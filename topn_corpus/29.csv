BUT HE IS DOING WHAT HE VIEWS AS BEST FOR ARABS, HIS REGIME.      By NICK B. WILLIAMS Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER      DAMASCUS, Syria      President Hafez Assad, the lone gun of Middle East politics, has joined the  posse, sending Syrian troops to Saudi Arabia for the showdown with Iraq.    In the shifting alliances of the Arab world, the 60-year-old Assad, two decades  in power here, had remained obdurate and aloof. Diplomats called him ""Mr. No.""  He was the man who sat and waited for things to turn his way.    Now, faced with hard and complex new realities, he has taken a stand, one that  is rife with risk.    Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has accused him of siding with Western powers, a  breach of Arab protocol. And many Syrians are tuned to Baghdad Radio. There is  grumbling in the army. Fundamentally, Kuwaitis, Saudis and the oil-rich sheiks  of the Persian Gulf are not Assad's kind of people.    But Assad, as always, is keeping his eye on Arab interests as he sees them, and  those of his own regime. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he says, is an  unacceptable threat.    With the perennial outsider in the thick of the confrontation, the regional  lineup has changed radically.    ""I don't think anything heightens more the isolation of Saddam Hussein in the  Arab world than Syrian involvement,"" Secretary of State James A. Baker III told  a news conference in Brussels on the way to his Sept. 14 talks with Assad.    In explaining his motivations to his own people, Assad declared in a long,  nationally televised speech two days before Baker arrived:    ""Can we say that the invasion and annexation has placed the Arab nation in a  stronger position? . . . Did it unite our ranks? . . . Did it benefit Iraq, or  has it, once again, wasted Iraq's potential and placed Iraq in a position  foretelling grave harm? The invasion of Kuwait and the canceling of a state is  a great catastrophe, an unforgiveable sin.""    Diplomats here say there is more to the Syrian stance than Assad's long-held  personal antipathy toward Hussein and fears that his old rival might end up  calling the shots in the Middle East. The region has been rattled by a series  of events over the past decade: the Iran-Iraq War, the Palestinian rebellion in  the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza; the interminable strife in Lebanon,  and the collapse of the Soviet empire.    None has affected Syria more than the last. Syria was the premier Soviet client  in the Middle East, and Assad milked the connection rigorously. With his Soviet  arms, only the Israelis dared to stand up to him. Now he has seen the writing  on the Berlin Wall.    A European diplomat here said: ""Moscow had put Assad on notice two years ago  that it would no longer pay the bill to make Syria a regional military  colossus. But what shook them was the fall of the East German and Romanian  regimes. They got the message. They had to change their style.""    Assad has moved to open up the state-run economy, and he has dipped a toe into  Arab diplomacy, re-establishing relations with U.S.-bankrolled Egypt, which had  been shunned from his tent for a decade for its separate peace with Israel.    ""Assad can see what's going on with the Soviets and Eastern Europe,"" another  diplomat said. ""He has to put his eggs in another basket, in this case with the  Arabs.""    Syria had remained an outsider as Arab blocs were forming in the wake of the  Iran-Iraq War. Saddam Hussein engineered the Arab Cooperation Council -- Iraq,  Egypt, Jordan and Yemen -- as a counterweight to the Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation  Council and as a personal vehicle for Arab leadership. The North African Arab  states formed their own union.    Damascus was the odd capital out.    Now the Arab Cooperation Council is a shambles, and the prospect of an ad hoc  Syrian, Egyptian, Saudi axis is rising in opposition to Iraqi power. Each  brings its own special power and influence.    There is a Middle Eastern adage, attributed to former Secretary of State Henry  A. Kissinger, which holds that ""you can't make war without Egypt and you can't  make peace without Syria."" It could be amended to add that nothing moves in the  Middle East without the oil of Saudi money. According to Damascus-based  diplomats, it is flowing.    ""We understand that the Saudis will be meeting the payroll of the Syrian  troops,"" one diplomat said, ""and putting in something government-to-government  as well. We're talking megabucks.""    The unconfirmed word here is that the Saudis will bolster the Syrian treasury  to the tune of $2 billion, in addition to the billions promised Egypt, Turkey  and Jordan for their crisis-damaged economies.    Assad has reportedly promised to send another 15,000 to 20,000 troops to Saudi  Arabia, joining the 4,000 already there. Among the units to be sent, diplomats  said, is the 9th Armored Division, which will be pulled off the Golan Heights  front with Israel, another sign of the changing times.    The moves are being handled carefully by the Assad regime. When the decision  was made at an Arab League summit conference in Cairo to send troops to the  gulf region, Assad convened the National Progressive Front, the loose coalition  of leftist, secular parties that backs the ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party.  The political doctrine was laid down and disseminated through Baathist and  administration channels.    While reports of pro-Iraqi demonstrations in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi  border, have been denied by diplomats and reporters who went to the areas,  Assad's decision to defend the Saudis and demand an Iraqi withdrawal from  Kuwait was hardly universally popular here. Iraq's denunciation of oil-rich  gulf sheiks and foreign troops in the Islamic heartland has struck a chord,  diplomats say.    Amad Bagdadi, a Damascus cab driver, underlined the doubts.    ""Saddam is crazy,"" he said. ""He wants every Arab city, not just Kuwait."" He  paused for a moment, and then added, ""But who can feel sorry for those rich  people in the gulf?""    There has been no open defiance, however. The Assad regime ""would hit them  (protesters) like they did eight years ago,"" the European envoy said, referring  to Hassad's brutal suppression of a fundamentalist uprising in the city of Hama  in 1982. ""They wouldn't hesitate.""    He and others said some grumbling was evident in the Syrian military.    ""One, they're unhappy at the prospect of being stationed alongside Western  troops,"" the European said, ""and two, they're not going to make money in the  Saudi desert. Lebanon, by comparison, has always been a choice assignment. In  Lebanon (where 35,000 Syrian soldiers are deployed) you can become rich. A  division commander there is like an old Ottoman satrap; the money just rolls  in.""    The pan-Arab issue is harder to gauge, particularly as it applies to Syria's  long-held claim to championing the cause against Israel. In fact, Palestinians  here are kept under tight control and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine  Liberation Organization, ranks high among Assad's enemies.    The loyal Palestinians, including Ahmed Jibril, head of the Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, have found a place under the  regime as a counterweight to the mainline PLO.    ""This is an ugly world,"" one envoy said, ""and it pays to have some of these  guys around.""    Jibril has been implicated in the December, 1988, bombing of a Pan American  jetliner over Scotland, and his presence here has kept Syria on the U.S.  terrorist list.    Syrian officials, including Assad, separate the gulf crisis from the  Palestinian cause.    ""The liberation of Jerusalem cannot start in Kuwait,"" one said.    The Iraqi invasion has, however, had a direct impact here economically, for  both good and ill. Syria, a minor player in Middle East oil production, is  profiting from the price increase forced by the crisis. Production is estimated  at 400,000 to 420,000 barrels a day, with about half retained for domestic  needs. The rest is exported for badly needed hard currencies.    Shell, so far the lone exporter, moves its crude to the Mediterranean coast  through a pipeline that carried Iraqi oil until the Baghdad connection was shut  down in 1982, near the outset of the Iran-Iraq War, in which Syria and Libya  were Iran's sole Arab supporters.    Weighing against the windfall in oil revenues is the loss of remittances from  Syrians working in the gulf states, an estimated 50,000. Those in Kuwait alone  sent home about $200 million last year, a foreign economic analyst said. Now  many are returning to a country afflicted with high unemployment.    Hard economic times are nothing new for Assad's regime. Middle East politics is  the more dangerous challenge. Diplomats ask: What if Hussein survives the  military and economic stranglehold and the American-led foreign forces  withdraw? Or what if Israel is drawn into the conflict?    ""Syria loses either way,"" the European diplomat said. ""An Iraqi victory means  Baghdad will be the champion of the Arabs on the Palestinian issue. And if  Israel comes in, the whole region goes backward again.""

Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said Iraq was  ""working to divide the GCC"" and was ""still a threat to security  and stability in the region.""    He urged the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to ""restate the  member nations' joint position on Iraq, to block any attempts""  to drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab  Emirates (UAE), Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.    Observers said Prince al-Faysal, in his opening address to a  two-day GCC foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh, was implicitly  criticizing Baghdad's links with Oman and Qatar.    Oman was the only GCC country to maintain relations with  Baghdad after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990.    Qatar has also drawn closer to Iraq in the past few months,  arousing deep concern in Kuwait, which was liberated by a US-led  multinational coalition in February 1991.    In Cairo last weekend, the Omani and Qatari foreign  ministers  held talks with their Iraqi counterpart Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf  on the sidelines of an Arab League ministerial meeting,  officials said.    Al-Sahhaf described Iraq's relations with Oman, Qatar and  Bahrain as ""good"" at the meeting, they added.    The GCC session was also expected to cover the Middle East  peace talks, notably the multilateral track in which the Gulf is  involved. Qatar and Oman are to host Israeli delegations for  meetings of multilateral working groups.    Likewise on the agenda was Iran's territorial dispute with  the UAE, the official Emirates news agency WAM said.    In Cairo, the 22-member Arab League reaffirmed support for  the UAE in its dispute with Iran over three strategic islands in  the southern Gulf.    The UAE has warned it could resort to international  arbitration to resolve the dispute with Iran over the islands of  Abu Musa, Tunb al-Kubra, and Tunb al-Sughra. Iran insists the  problem must be tackled through direct dialogue.    The UAE and Iran had strong political and economic links  until the dormant dispute flared anew in 1992 following  accusations that Tehran had annexed the UAE part of Abu Musa and  expelled some of its residents.    The GCC defence, political and economic alliance was created  in May 1981 during the Iran-Iraq war.     "

In a part of the  statement, PGCC calls for Iran-UAE talks on the disputed islands.    Following the release of this statement, a spokesman for the  Iranian Foreign Ministry yesterday, Monday, June the 6th, said:  Historical evidence shows that the islands have always belonged  to Iran, and to resolve the differences the Islamic Republic of  Iran welcomes holding of talks with the UAE, without any  pre-conditions.    The Islamic Republic of Iran has, however, left the door  open  for talks as put forth by the spokesman of the Iranian Foreign  Ministry yesterday. The spokesman said the invitation extended  to the UAE's foreign affairs adviser is still valid.    The UAE, immediately after the Iran-Iraq war in 1988,  without  any hard evidence, claimed ownership over the Iranian islands of  Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa. The claims have so far  worked as a media propaganda by the regional states and those  fueling tension and crisis in the Persian Gulf region.    The PGCC statement has also protested against the anti-Saudi  propaganda on the Iranian media during the hajj season. In this  connection Dr. Mohammadi [not further identified] said: The  Iranian media enjoys full freedom--something which the  neighbours should understand.    The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman rejected the claim  that Iran has supported one of the sides in the Yemen conflict  and has provided military assistance to that country, saying:  From the outset of the conflict the Islamic Republic of Iran has  clearly announced its stance expressing regret over the outbreak  of clashes and concern over the division and separation of the  Muslim brethren of Yemen. Also, the Islamic Republic of Iran,  while opposing any kind of military operations and adopting a  neutral stance, announced its willingness to carry out mediation  in the conflict.    In this connection he added: Iran is deeply interested in  preventing the foreign provoked dismemberment of Islamic  countries and believes that differences among Muslims should be  resolved through peaceful means. Therefore, Iran deeply regrets  the killing of any Muslim in Yemen -- whether from the south or  the north -- and calls on the warring sides to put an end to the  war and begin talks, which should be aimed at preserving Yemen's  integrity. Iran also calls on others to show restraint and not  become a source for the dangerous escalation of the crisis.     "

By NICK B. WILLIAMS Jr. and DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      NICOSIA, Cyprus      Iraq and four other Arab nations called Thursday for a ban on nuclear and  chemical weapons in the volatile Middle East, urging Western pressure on Israel  to comply.    The proposal, coming three days after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threat  to retaliate with nerve gas against any Israeli attack, appeared designed to  paint Israel into a diplomatic corner. It was made by the foreign ministers of  Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen, meeting in Amman, Jordan. It was seconded by the  Syrian foreign minister in an Israeli newspaper interview.    In public, Israel officials were skeptical of the proposal, but regional arms  reduction has become a topic of serious discussion in the Foreign and Defense  ministries, government sources said.    Iraq and its three allies in the Arab Cooperation Council, concluding a two-day  meeting in the Jordanian capital, declared that any Mideast disarmament ""should  be balanced.""    ""All kinds of destructive weapons, including nuclear, chemical and biological,  should be prohibited in order to guarantee regional and international  security,"" the foreign ministers said.    Israel is the only Middle Eastern nation reputed to have nuclear arms, a  strategic trump card in any regional conflict. Although the government refuses  to confirm its nuclear capability, Israeli leaders responded ominously to  Hussein's threat. Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel could  respond ""many times over"" to an Iraqi chemical assault.    Responding to Thursday's Arab proposal, Yosef Olmert, a government spokesman,  remarked, ""Let those who have used chemical weapons ban them first,"" referring  to Iraq's wartime attacks on Iranian troops and indigenous Kurdish rebels. In  general, Western governments accept nuclear deterrence as legitimate, but not  chemical-warfare forces.    In wording similar to the Arab communique, Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh of  Syria, a stubborn foe of both Iraq and Israel, told a reporter for the Israeli  daily Hadashot based in Paris: ""If there was a sincere desire for peace and  security, then Israel should agree to declare the Middle East an area clear of  all destructive weaponry.""    If that phrase means elimination of strategic forces, including nuclear  weapons, Israel would remain heavily outmanned by Arab forces, despite its 1979  peace treaty with Egypt. And despite the vaunted Israeli edge in battlefield  technology, discipline and training, the Arab countries continue to build up  their conventional forces. Iraq's army, in particular, is battle-tested and  equipped with first-class imported and adapted weapons.    Nonetheless, independent Israeli analysts view the Arab offer on arms reduction  as something new. Previously, Arab states had basically lobbied to get Israel  to sign the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Now, they have linked  nuclear arms control with the proven Arab capacity to deliver chemical weapons.    Despite the conventional-forces advantage enjoyed by the Arabs, Israel might  find a way to respond to arms control offers, defense analyst Gerald Steinberg  said. ""Israel could link nuclear arms control with reductions in conventional  forces,"" said Steinberg, a researcher at Bar Ilan University.    Steinberg pointed out that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed  to this formula in talks about arms reduction in Europe. ""Israel bases its  nuclear program on the presence of large Arab armies. To give it up, Israel  would have to be assured that it is not falling into a conventional arms trap,""  he said.    In the past, Israel has declined to link chemical and nuclear arms in a single  package. It also would prefer a regional pact on nuclear arms that would permit  each country to inspect each other's atomic facilities. ""Just having inspectors  from hostile countries in each other's back yard would greatly reduce  tensions,"" said analyst Dore Gold from the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies  in Tel Aviv.    Saddam Hussein's tough speech Monday in Baghdad was condemned by the United  States and other Western powers -- State Department spokeswoman Margaret  Tutwiler branded it ""inflammatory, irresponsible and outrageous"" -- but it has  rallied Arab opinion.    On Thursday, the Arab League, meeting in Tunis, Tunisia, issued a statement  warning Israel that any attack on Iraq would be considered an attack on all 22  league members, Reuters news service reported. Iraq had requested the meeting  to rally support in its disputes with Britain, Israel and the United States.    The Iraqi president's words have filled the Arab world with ""will, power and  vigor,"" declared the Jordanian newspaper Al Rai. Jordan's King Hussein, quoted  by the national Petra news agency, said Hussein ""did not threaten anybody but  affirmed Iraq's ability to face any planned aggression and its legitimate right  to defend itself.""    The Cairo reporter for the London-based Mideast Mirror wrote: ""Saddam's tough  remarks created a feeling of excitement, even exhilaration, among the public,  monopolizing conversations in sidewalk cafes.""    Hussein was stung by Western criticism of his government's execution last month  of a British-based reporter on spying charges and by the arrest in London last  week of Iraqi citizens in an alleged plot to smuggle U.S.-made nuclear-weapons  devices to Baghdad.    In response, he suggested that Israel and its Western allies were creating an  atmosphere that invited Israeli attack on Iraqi military facilities.    ""Let them drop such attempts to give Israel a pretext to strike. . . ,"" he  warned. ""I swear to God we will let our fire eat half of Israel if it tries  anything against Iraq.""    Hussein's threats and complaints struck a sensitive chord among the Arabs,  whose pride has been hurt time and again by Israel's ability to strike targets  far from its borders without fear of vengeance by strategic weapons. By  brandishing chemical weapons, Hussein has attempted to introduce a balance of  fear in the Middle East.    Military analysts are doubtful that the threat is fully substantive, noting  that Iraq would need an arsenal of accurate missiles to carry out the boasts.  But Iraq's mid-range missile development has jumped alarmingly since  cross-border missiles were first introduced to the Middle East during the  1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.    The foreign ministers of the Arab Cooperation Council, ostensibly an economic  alliance, decided the time was right to once again try to tie Israel's nuclear  hands.

By NICK B. WILLIAMS Jr. and DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      NICOSIA, Cyprus      Iraq and four other Arab nations called Thursday for a ban on nuclear and  chemical weapons in the volatile Middle East, urging Western pressure on Israel  to comply.    The proposal, coming three days after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threat  to retaliate with nerve gas against any Israeli attack, appeared designed to  paint Israel into a diplomatic corner. It was made by the foreign ministers of  Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen, meeting in Amman, Jordan. It was seconded by the  Syrian foreign minister in an Israeli newspaper interview.    In public, Israel officials were skeptical of the proposal, but regional arms  reduction has become a topic of serious discussion in the Foreign and Defense  ministries, government sources said.    Iraq and its three allies in the Arab Cooperation Council, concluding a two-day  meeting in the Jordanian capital, declared that any Mideast disarmament ""should  be balanced.""    ""All kinds of destructive weapons, including nuclear, chemical and biological,  should be prohibited in order to guarantee regional and international  security,"" the foreign ministers said.    Israel is the only Middle Eastern nation reputed to have nuclear arms, a  strategic trump card in any regional conflict. Although the government refuses  to confirm its nuclear capability, Israeli leaders responded ominously to  Hussein's threat. Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel could  respond ""many times over"" to an Iraqi chemical assault.    Responding to Thursday's Arab proposal, Yosef Olmert, a government spokesman,  remarked, ""Let those who have used chemical weapons ban them first,"" referring  to Iraq's wartime attacks on Iranian troops and indigenous Kurdish rebels. In  general, Western governments accept nuclear deterrence as legitimate, but not  chemical-warfare forces.    In wording similar to the Arab communique, Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh of  Syria, a stubborn foe of both Iraq and Israel, told a reporter for the Israeli  daily Hadashot based in Paris: ""If there was a sincere desire for peace and  security, then Israel should agree to declare the Middle East an area clear of  all destructive weaponry.""    If that phrase means elimination of strategic forces, including nuclear  weapons, Israel would remain heavily outmanned by Arab forces, despite its 1979  peace treaty with Egypt. And despite the vaunted Israeli edge in battlefield  technology, discipline and training, the Arab countries continue to build up  their conventional forces. Iraq's army, in particular, is battle-tested and  equipped with first-class imported and adapted weapons.    Nonetheless, independent Israeli analysts view the Arab offer on arms reduction  as something new. Previously, Arab states had basically lobbied to get Israel  to sign the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Now, they have linked  nuclear arms control with the proven Arab capacity to deliver chemical weapons.    Despite the conventional-forces advantage enjoyed by the Arabs, Israel might  find a way to respond to arms control offers, defense analyst Gerald Steinberg  said. ""Israel could link nuclear arms control with reductions in conventional  forces,"" said Steinberg, a researcher at Bar Ilan University.    Steinberg pointed out that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed  to this formula in talks about arms reduction in Europe. ""Israel bases its  nuclear program on the presence of large Arab armies. To give it up, Israel  would have to be assured that it is not falling into a conventional arms trap,""  he said.    In the past, Israel has declined to link chemical and nuclear arms in a single  package. It also would prefer a regional pact on nuclear arms that would permit  each country to inspect each other's atomic facilities. ""Just having inspectors  from hostile countries in each other's back yard would greatly reduce  tensions,"" said analyst Dore Gold from the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies  in Tel Aviv.    Saddam Hussein's tough speech Monday in Baghdad was condemned by the United  States and other Western powers -- State Department spokeswoman Margaret  Tutwiler branded it ""inflammatory, irresponsible and outrageous"" -- but it has  rallied Arab opinion.    On Thursday, the Arab League, meeting in Tunis, Tunisia, issued a statement  warning Israel that any attack on Iraq would be considered an attack on all 22  league members, Reuters news service reported. Iraq had requested the meeting  to rally support in its disputes with Britain, Israel and the United States.    The Iraqi president's words have filled the Arab world with ""will, power and  vigor,"" declared the Jordanian newspaper Al Rai. Jordan's King Hussein, quoted  by the national Petra news agency, said Hussein ""did not threaten anybody but  affirmed Iraq's ability to face any planned aggression and its legitimate right  to defend itself.""    The Cairo reporter for the London-based Mideast Mirror wrote: ""Saddam's tough  remarks created a feeling of excitement, even exhilaration, among the public,  monopolizing conversations in sidewalk cafes.""    Hussein was stung by Western criticism of his government's execution last month  of a British-based reporter on spying charges and by the arrest in London last  week of Iraqi citizens in an alleged plot to smuggle U.S.-made nuclear-weapons  devices to Baghdad.    In response, he suggested that Israel and its Western allies were creating an  atmosphere that invited Israeli attack on Iraqi military facilities.

0,FT921-11125 ,"FT921-11125 _AN-CBCA0AAGFT 920203   FT  03 FEB 92 / Iraqi ships find Italian home      By ROBERT GRAHAM      ROME   THE Italian navy has bought four frigates originally ordered by Iraq, partly closing the book on one of the most accident-prone deals in the history of Italian defence contracting. The four Lupo (wolf) class frigates were part of a L3,600bn (Pounds 1.7bn) contract for 12 naval vessels won in 1981 by two Italian defence consortia, headed by Fincantieri, the state ship-building group and Oto-Melara, the state guided weapons company. But only four vessels, worth L300bn, have been handed over to Iraq. Of these a supply ship and a floating dry dock are blocked in the Egyptian port of Alexandria and two Assad class corvettes are still at the Italian naval base of La Spezia, where the other warships are also docked. The deal fell foul of both the western arms embargo resulting from the Iran-Iraq war and the allied embargo on Iraq following President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the cost of maintaining the four frigates and six corvettes has been running at L550m a day, over L400m of which has been financial charges. The first of the frigates was completed in 1985 and the full order with sophisticated missile armaments was ready by 1987; the completion of the corvette order was spread between 1986 and 1988. Although Iraq sent crew for training on two corvettes as early as 1986, the first opportunity to take delivery came after the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. Iraq made payments of L1,800bn in the hope of unblocking the entire contract. The frigates were 'freed' for delivery in 1989 and eventually the two least bellicose vessels were released; but just when it seemed the Italian government would waive its objections to the retention of the offensive vessels, Mr Saddam invaded Kuwait. The inability to obtain full payment and the high cost of maintenance has weighed heavily on every big defence contractor in Italy, all of which were either directly or indirectly involved in the deal. The Italian navy was pressed to buy up as much of the order as possible, but was reported to be reluctant because of lack of funds and because the vessels had been designed to Iraqi navy and Gulf water specifications. However, with the Andreotti government in its final days, the defence lobby was able to exercise sufficient influence for funds to be made available to the Defence Ministry through 1994 to purchase four frigates. The remaining eight vessels under Italian control or blocked in Alexandria have been put out to international tender.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

The general public should be forgiven for not giving much thought these days to  President Jimmy Carter's statement in his 1980 State of the Union address,  popularly labeled the ""Carter Doctrine"":    ""Any attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region  will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States and  such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military  force.""    The Iran-Iraq war is over, the Ayatollah Khomeini is dead, the Organization of  Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has long lost its sting and the Soviets  have withdrawn from Afghanistan and show no sign, if they ever did, of making a  grab for Iranian or Saudi oil fields.    Yet the doctrine lives on, with a whole industry of scholars, soldiers and  policy-makers supporting it, doctored into longevity by Ronald Reagan's sharp  buildup of American naval and air power. And President Bush's propensity to let  sleeping dogs lie keep's the doctrine's life-spirit intact.    Public opinion has already absorbed the more benign atmosphere, but top  policy-makers appear to be failing to acknowledge not just the changed Soviet  attitude but the equally profound changes in the power of the oil industry and  of Islamic fundamentalism. This is extraordinarily intellectually silly, not to  say costly to the taxpayer.    The policy-makers need to be confronted with a few hard facts:    The Persian Gulf, and in particular the infamous Strait of Hormuz, the narrow  waterway that is its entrance, is no longer the ""jugular"" of the Western  economies. The rapid construction of overland pipelines is reducing its  importance by the day. Besides, as the Iran-Iraq war revealed, it was not  feasible to block the strait by sinking ships in its entrance. Its waters run  too deep and its currents are too strong. Moreover, the war showed that large  modern-day tankers are not especially vulnerable targets. Their very size makes  them difficult to sink and crude oil is not particularly flammable. It's  nothing more than a myth that shipping got through during the war because of  the presence of American, British, French and Dutch naval forces. Attacks on  shipping actually increased by 60% in the year following the beginning of naval  patrols.    The oil market has totally changed since the huge price rises of 1973 and '79.  Indeed, so slack is the market that the Iran-Iraq war made no notable impact on  oil prices, even though insurance rates rose sharply for ships transiting the  Gulf.    OPEC no longer has the power to play on Western fears about oil prices. And  nothing in its achievements suggests it ever should have been otherwise. The  price hikes of '73 and '79 certainly happened, but we now know they were  accelerated and exaggerated by a speculative panic concerning future supplies.  The OPEC countries themselves have learned that they are as much the losers  when they help push the Western economies into recession.    Certain oil gurus earned large consulting fees predicting that oil prices were  unlikely to come down and that the dependence on Persian Gulf oil would  continue indefinitely. In fact, in real terms, oil prices are not much  different from what they were before the price rises, and by 1985 dependence on  the Gulf nations' oil could not have been more different than it was in 1980.  The United States was down from 30% to 7% of all oil imports, Western Europe  from 60% to 35% and Japan from 70% to 59%.    Conservation, more technologically proficient extraction policies, new  discoveries and the substitution of other energy sources were the successful  legacy of the price antics of '73 and '79.    The third leg of the oil threat has been the long-held belief that Moscow has a  greedy strategic eye on the oil-producing states. The invasion of Afghanistan  rang the alarm bells, convincing many that it was the first step in a long-term  Soviet drive to the Gulf.    But as Prof. Robert Johnson argues in a long and thoughtful analysis in the  current issue of Harvard's International Security, this is simply not true.  ""The Soviets must assume the Iranians would resist any military advance. And  they've been reminded in Afghanistan that local forces operating in mountainous  terrain can put up a very considerable resistance.""    Some argue that the Soviets could take power through ""invitations"" from local  regimes. Yet experience has shown that radical regimes in the Middle East  usually repress local Communist parties, are highly nationalistic and may be  Islamic-fundamentalist.    Even before perestroika, it was never very clear why the Soviets would want to  take these kinds of risks. In the late 1970s, the CIA argued that Soviet oil  production was about to go into rapid decline and the Soviets would have to  look elsewhere for oil. The decline has not happened, and the Soviet Union  remains the world's largest oil producer.    The final argument for Western worriers has been the view that Iranian  fundamentalism might come to dominate a significant part of the Gulf. But if  Iran failed with Iraq, which has the Arab world's largest Shiite community and  therefore the one most sensitive to Khomeini's brand of Islamic fervor, the  chance of success elsewhere is, to say the least, unlikely.

Jordanian political sources said the government ordered out  the Iranians because of their contacts with Islamic  fundamentalists.    The ministry informed the Iranian authorities about the move  at the beginning of January, giving the diplomats two months to  leave.    The official reason was that Jordan wanted to reach a  balance  between the number of diplomats in each country, as Jordan had  only two in Tehran.    Jordan and Iran resumed diplomatic relations in January 1991  after a 10-year break.    Tehran severed relations with Amman because of its support  for Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988.    The Iranian embassy in Amman reopened in March 1991 and  Jordan's embassy in Tehran soon after.     "

TEHRAN SAYS 2,000 OF ITS WAR PRISONERS RETURNED.      From Associated Press      NICOSIA, Cyprus      Iraqi soldiers Monday were winding up their withdrawal from occupied Iranian  territory, the official Iranian news agency said, freeing thousands of  battle-hardened troops to face U.S. forces.    On Sunday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the number of Iraqi troops poised  on the Kuwaiti border with Saudi Arabia had jumped from 160,000 to 200,000.  That figure suggested that Iraqi soldiers from the Iranian border regions might  already be bolstering those in Iraq-occupied Kuwait.    The Iraqi withdrawal from Iranian border areas began Friday and was expected to  be completed today.    Cheney, inspecting U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region, refused to say how  many American troops have been deployed. The U.S. troops were sent to protect  strategic, oil-rich Saudi Arabia after Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.    Tehran newspapers Monday attacked the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia  and predicted that the Saudi monarch, King Fahd, will meet the same fate as the  deposed emir of Kuwait.    In an editorial, the newspaper Jomhuri Islami accused the king of allowing the  United States to make Saudi Arabia a virtual U.S. state.    ""Just as Iraq annexed Kuwait to its territory, the United States has annexed  Saudi Arabia to its realm,"" said the newspaper, according to Iran's official  Islamic Republic News Agency.    However, the newspaper stressed that although it opposes the U.S. military  presence, it also opposes the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait.    The Iraqi withdrawal from Iranian border areas came as part of an initiative by  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last week to formally end the Iran-Iraq War.  Fighting in the eight-year conflict had effectively ended with a cease-fire two  years ago.    In Iran's southern region near the Persian Gulf, departing Iraqi troops shouted  ""Down with the U.S.!"" and ""Allahu Akbar!"" (God is great), the Iranian news  agency reported.    The agency said the departing Iraqis expressed desires for ""more brotherly  relations"" between their countries and waved to their former enemies as they  pulled out of fortifications along the 30-mile-long Shalamcheh-Kushk axis.    The troop withdrawal is accompanied by the biggest prisoner exchange since  World War II. The United Nations and diplomats say the two sides held a total  of 100,000 prisoners.    Tehran Radio reported that 2,000 prisoners returned to the Iranian capital  Monday in a jubilant homecoming.    The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said thousands of relatives and  well-wishers thronged Tehran's Mehrabad airport and crowded surrounding  streets. The prisoners were showered with flowers, and sheep were sacrificed  for a traditional Islamic welcome.    Iraq's army daily newspaper, Al Qaddisiyah, had reported that some of the  troops formerly deployed along the 730-mile Iran-Iraq frontier would be sent  south to confront U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.      BACKGROUND    Iran and Iraq have a long history of squabbling, often over the vital Shatt al  Arab waterway they share as well as some disputed islands. So, it was no great  shock when, on Sept. 22, 1980, Iraq bombed Tehran airport and invaded its  neighbor to the east. Despite overwhelming Iraqi air superiority and early  ground successes, the Iranian military, reinforced by a substantially larger  population with a religious commitment to martyrdom, waged a bitter campaign  and recovered much of its territory. A lengthy stalemate ensued, with Tehran  rebuffing a series of cease-fire proposals by Baghdad. On Aug. 20, 1988, both  combatants agreed to an uneasy, U.N.-brokered cease-fire, but peace terms could  not be hammered out -- until Saddam Hussein's sudden acceptance of all of  Iran's demands last week.

He said the decision to undertake military operations in the gulf region ""is in  my opinion limited solely to President Bush.""    Herzog brushed aside warnings by some Iraqi military sources that Iraq will  send missiles against Israel if the United States attacks Iraq.    ""It is not logical,"" he said, ""that Saddam Hussein would desire to launch his  missiles specifically against Israel, thereby opening another front. The number  of missiles at his disposal is limited, and from the moment of being launched,  the missiles turn the launching bases into targets, not only for the Israeli  air force but for the entire force deployed against him.    ""Moreover, to the best of my knowledge, these missiles have not been tested at  such long range. It is unclear whether they are equipped with chemical  warheads.

They  said Iraq may be capable of fitting a chemical warhead on a missile but they  doubt that it would be militarily effective.    In addition, they charged that the Jordanian air force has been flying  reconnaissance missions along the Saudi Arabian border, presumably gathering  intelligence for Iraq on allied troop positions.

In a written answer to a question originally tabled on November 24 by Mr Phillip Oppenheim, Tory MP for Amber Valley, Mr Major indicated that British machine tool sales to Saddam Hussein's regime totalled nearly Dollars 93m over the period in question. That compared with Dollars 42m-worth of equipment sold by Italy, Dollars 16.8m by France and Dollars 11.7m by the US. British sales peaked at more than Dollars 63m in 1988, the year a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war was agreed. When called upon in the past to defend sales of possible dual-use equipment such as machine tools, government officials have argued that if Britain did not agree to export the goods, other countries would. The government appointed Lord Justice Scott to head an independent judicial inquiry into arms sales to Iraq in the wake of the Matrix Churchill affair.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

As thousands of Egyptians crowded the airport terminal at the Iraqi capital of  Baghdad this week demanding tickets, authorities said they were also  investigating reports that more than 100 Egyptian corpses were flown home from  Iraq last month.    Bodies have been arriving at Cairo International Airport at the rate of three  or four a day. Death certificates, which originally listed many of the causes  of death as ""bullet wounds,"" have recently attributed the deaths to ""accident""  or ""butane gas cylinder explosion,"" according to the Egyptian state-owned  newspaper, Al Akbar.    Five new bodies arrived Wednesday, two of them with smashed skulls, the  newspaper said. But Iraqi government authorities said the number of deaths is  not unusual in light of the number of Egyptian workers in Iraq, estimated at  more than 1 million.    An Egyptian Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday that he could not confirm  the number of deaths or the circumstances behind them, but he said Egyptian  Prime Minister Atef Sedki is scheduled to meet Saturday with a high-level Iraqi  delegation to discuss the worsening Egyptian worker crisis.    ""We have been working on it through diplomatic channels, and we hope in the  days to come we can come up with a satisfactory solution,"" the official said.    The exodus from Baghdad corresponds with Iraq's decision six weeks ago to limit  the amount of money that unskilled foreign workers can transfer out of the  country to 10 dinars a month (about $55), which amounts in many cases to less  than 10% of their earnings. Previously, workers were allowed to send up to half  their salaries home.    The decision comes in the wake of Iraq's eight-year-long war with Iran. A U.N.  cease-fire in August brought an end to much of Iraq's foreign military aid,  leaving the country strapped for foreign currency and burdened with a flood of  soldiers competing with foreign workers for civilian jobs.    Many Egyptians have lost their jobs, and others have complained about a  deterioration in working conditions, including unilateral wage reductions,  non-payment of wages and occasional outbreaks of violence, together with the  new limits on transferring their earnings home.    To handle the flood of returning Egyptians, Iraqi Airways has increased its  flights to Cairo from two a week to 10, and EgyptAir has added three additional  weekly flights. For the last several days, more than 2,800 workers a day have  been airlifted out of Baghdad, and others have gone home by bus through Jordan.    In interviews at Cairo airport, Egyptian workers complained that they were  arriving home virtually penniless because of the ceiling on wage transfers.    Adel Said Sayed, a plumber who went to work in Baghdad last March, said he is  taking home only $300 for eight months' work because of the transfer limit and  because his employer refused to pay him all he was due. When he complained,  Sayed said, ""The man brings his gun and said, 'You must work. You should work  or I will kill you and bury you here.' ""    Iraqi President Saddam Hussein discounted claims that Egyptians have been  mistreated in Iraq and dismissed reports of an increase in the number of  workers who have died.    ""There have been millions of Egyptians here . . . and it is natural that, like  Iraqis, some of them die, are killed in car accidents or in quarrels with  Iraqis or among themselves,"" he said in a report on Iraq's official radio.    Hussein also said some incidents of violence could be expected in the wake of  the Iran-Iraq War.

The two corvettes formed part of a L3,000bn (Pounds 1.3bn) 1980 Iraqi order for four corvettes, four frigates and some support vessels. Though the order has been partly paid, the ships completed and Iraqi crews were at one time training in the military port of La Spezia, delivery was initially halted by the Iran-Iraq war and then by the invasion of Kuwait. The financial burden of the Iraqi order has weighed heavily on Fincantieri, which has reported steady losses as a result of the crisis in shipbuilding and interest charges on spending for the order. In 1991 it lost L174bn, a substantial proportion of which is believed to have stemmed from costs relating to the Iraqi order. Mr Enrico Bocchini, the company's chairman, declined to speculate on reports that the four remaining frigates would be sold to the Italian navy.   Companies:-  FINCANTIERI Cantieri Navali Italiani.

By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      One of the reasons virtually no Western experts anticipated Iraq's annexation  of Kuwait, officials now say, is that no one thought Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein had any interest in possessing most of the country.    What Hussein wanted, the officials believe, was only a small part of his  neighbor's land -- two strategic islands and a strip of territory covering the  southern end of an oil field that straddles the Iraq-Kuwait border.    Now, U.S. officials worry that Hussein might try to withdraw to that line,  making a ""concession"" of land that he never really wanted so that he can hold  onto what he really coveted all along.    The territory in question has two major points of interest -- the Rumaila oil  field, an oblong tract of land located mostly in Iraq with its southern end in  Kuwait, and the two islands of Bubiyan and Warba, which together control the  approaches to Iraq's chief port.    Before the invasion, U.S. officials were neutral on the question of whether  Iraq's claims to that land were valid.    ""We have no opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with  Kuwait,"" U.S. Ambassador April C. Glaspie told Hussein on July 25, in the last  meeting between a U.S. official and the Iraqi president before the invasion.    Now, however, the Bush Administration insists that Iraq must withdraw  unconditionally from all Kuwaiti territory.    ""We do not think the emir (of Kuwait) should negotiate with a gun at his head,""  a senior Administration official said. Any territorial concessions that Kuwait  might make while Iraqi troops remain on its soil would merely reward Iraqi  aggression, Bush and his advisers argue.    At various points in its history, Iraq has asserted claims to all of Kuwait,  but the claims have been particularly insistent about Bubiyan and Warba.    The islands are barren mud flats, useless for most purposes. But they are all  that prevent virtually landlocked Iraq from being a nation with a 200-mile  coastline and the potential to be the dominant naval power in the Persian Gulf.    Now, all Iraqi shipping from its ports at Basra and Umm al Qasr must sail  around the two islands. A third port, Al Faw, was largely destroyed during the  Iran-Iraq War and remains essentially closed. Its shipping lanes also are  dominated by the Kuwaiti islands.    Rumaila, meanwhile, is one of the Middle East's largest pools of oil. The field  runs about 50 miles from north to south, with only two miles at the southern  end lying inside Kuwait. Oil industry experts say that the field might still  contain 30 billion barrels of oil, despite years of pumping.    Before the Iran-Iraq War, Rumaila, where oil was discovered in 1953, was one of  Iraq's biggest oil production centers. During the war, the Iraqis largely shut  down the field to protect it from Iranian attacks. The Kuwaitis, meanwhile,  continued to pump oil from their portion.    According to Iraq, the Kuwaiti pumping effectively siphoned oil from Iraq's  side of the field to Kuwait's, shifting resources 10,000 feet below ground in a  way that damaged Iraq's interests. Saddam Hussein has claimed that Kuwait owes  his country $2.4 billion for oil taken improperly from the Rumaila field.  Kuwaiti officials have denied that charge.    But some independent oil analysts say that the Iraqis may have a case --  although perhaps not for that full amount.    Kuwait has declined to say how much of its oil comes from Rumaila, but industry  analysts assume that the percentage is relatively small given how little of the  field lies inside Kuwait. Most Kuwaiti oil lies in the southern part of the  country, near the border with Saudi Arabia.      Map, Hussein's Possible Goals: Hussein might try to withdraw from Kuwait but  retain what he really wanted all along: two strategic islands and a strip of  territory covering the southern end of the Rumaila oil field on the Iraq-Kuwait  border.

THE  U.S., BUTT OF KUWAITI PROPAGANDA, IS NOW ASKED TO COME TO THE RESCUE.      By Barry Rubin, Barry Rubin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for  Near East Policy, is the author of the forthcoming Revolution Until Victory:  The Politics and History of the PLO (Summit/Simon & Schuster).      WASHINGTON      ""He who stands too close to the blacksmith gets burned by the sparks,"" Kuwait's  foreign minister once said of his country's location between warring Iran and  Iraq. Kuwait lived by oil, a most flammable substance. This month, Saddam  Hussein set a fire that burned independent Kuwait to the ground.    Kuwait was a most unusual country, more state of mind -- or finance -- than  nation-state. Lacking a national tradition, its citizens were bound together  largely by a combination of their traditional way of life and the new riches  they shared. Lacking any means to defend itself against powerful neighbors Iran  and Iraq, Kuwait tried to pursue a systematic policy of appeasement.    The Al Sabah family ruled the desert that became Kuwait when the United States  was still a British colony. To escape from its neighbors' domination, the  rulers accepted a British protectorate themselves in 1899. Although Baghdad  recognized the border in 1932, the 1960s and again in 1976, it periodically  claimed Kuwait for itself, coveting Kuwait's oil wealth and 120 miles of  Persian Gulf shoreline.    Shortly after London granted independence in 1961, Iraqi threats forced British  troops to return for a few months. Then, in an interesting precedent, the  British were replaced by an Arab League force from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia  and Sudan, which stayed two years until the danger dissipated. Every time  Kuwait seemed vulnerable -- when the British terminated their security  guarantee in 1971, in 1973 and again in 1976 when the emir dissolved Parliament  -- Iraq reiterated its claim.    When Iraq's threat receded, Islamic Iran began to press its own claim, trying  to subvert the 20% of Kuwaiti citizens who shared Tehran's denomination of  Shiite Islam. Most of the Iran-Iraq War, particularly between 1982 and 1988,  was fought a few miles from Kuwait's frontier. Angered by Kuwait's support for  Iraq, Iran sponsored dozens of acts of sabotage and terrorism in the first half  of the 1980s, including a 1985 assassination attempt on the emir.    Kuwait sold oil on Iraq's behalf, gave tens of billions of dollars in loans  that were actually gifts and used its ports to transship Iraqi war supplies.  When Iran escalated attacks on Kuwaiti ships, the government asked to  re-register tankers under the U.S. flag so they could be convoyed by U.S.  warships. The United States agreed and lived up to its promise.    Ironically, Kuwait had always been the most outspokenly anti-American of all  the gulf Arab regimes. Part of Kuwait's appeasement was to buy off potential  attacks or subversion by subsidizing Iraq, Syria and the Palestine Liberation  Organization. The other component was rhetorical extremism. Kuwait was not  moderate; it simply did not do very much except talk and donate money.    Thus, Kuwait's U.N. ambassador could speak of a ""cabal which controls and  manipulates and exploits the rest of humanity by controlling the money and  wealth of the world. . . . It is a well-known fact that the Zionists are the  richest people in the world and control much of its destiny."" In July, 1985,  Kuwait National Assembly speaker Ahmad al Sa'dun demanded Kuwait cease aid to  the PLO and Jordan for being too moderate in considering negotiations with  Israel.    At the same time, however, despite some regional defense efforts -- the Gulf  Cooperation Council pact of those unable to protect themselves; the trade of  aid for Egyptian advisers in 1986 -- Kuwait's survival depended ultimately on  Western support.

Thus, for example, they threatened to go to the  Soviets to obtain American reflagging, then gave the U.S. fleet only limited  help in protecting them.    Understandably obsessed with their vulnerability, Kuwait based its internal  politics on three principles: limit citizenship, keep power away from radical  nationalists and get as much money as possible out of the country.

Rather than build industry at home, the expectation of invasion or domestic  instability made Kuwait send its money abroad, preparing for a day when its  people might join their cash in exile. There is now about $50 billion in the  United States, $30 billion in Europe (mostly England), and $20 billion  elsewhere. This money is divided between the Reserve Fund for Future  Generations, which cannot be touched until early in the next century, and a  more liquid General Reserve.

Thus, Kuwait survived for almost three decades on a mixture of rational  calculation and paying protection money. It did not expect to be loved by the  Arab World, it did hope to be left alone.

THE  U.S., BUTT OF KUWAITI PROPAGANDA, IS NOW ASKED TO COME TO THE RESCUE.      By Barry Rubin, Barry Rubin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for  Near East Policy, is the author of the forthcoming Revolution Until Victory:  The Politics and History of the PLO (Summit/Simon & Schuster).      WASHINGTON      ""He who stands too close to the blacksmith gets burned by the sparks,"" Kuwait's  foreign minister once said of his country's location between warring Iran and  Iraq. Kuwait lived by oil, a most flammable substance. This month, Saddam  Hussein set a fire that burned independent Kuwait to the ground.    Kuwait was a most unusual country, more state of mind -- or finance -- than  nation-state. Lacking a national tradition, its citizens were bound together  largely by a combination of their traditional way of life and the new riches  they shared. Lacking any means to defend itself against powerful neighbors Iran  and Iraq, Kuwait tried to pursue a systematic policy of appeasement.    The Al Sabah family ruled the desert that became Kuwait when the United States  was still a British colony. To escape from its neighbors' domination, the  rulers accepted a British protectorate themselves in 1899. Although Baghdad  recognized the border in 1932, the 1960s and again in 1976, it periodically  claimed Kuwait for itself, coveting Kuwait's oil wealth and 120 miles of  Persian Gulf shoreline.    Shortly after London granted independence in 1961, Iraqi threats forced British  troops to return for a few months. Then, in an interesting precedent, the  British were replaced by an Arab League force from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia  and Sudan, which stayed two years until the danger dissipated. Every time  Kuwait seemed vulnerable -- when the British terminated their security  guarantee in 1971, in 1973 and again in 1976 when the emir dissolved Parliament  -- Iraq reiterated its claim.    When Iraq's threat receded, Islamic Iran began to press its own claim, trying  to subvert the 20% of Kuwaiti citizens who shared Tehran's denomination of  Shiite Islam. Most of the Iran-Iraq War, particularly between 1982 and 1988,  was fought a few miles from Kuwait's frontier. Angered by Kuwait's support for  Iraq, Iran sponsored dozens of acts of sabotage and terrorism in the first half  of the 1980s, including a 1985 assassination attempt on the emir.    Kuwait sold oil on Iraq's behalf, gave tens of billions of dollars in loans  that were actually gifts and used its ports to transship Iraqi war supplies.  When Iran escalated attacks on Kuwaiti ships, the government asked to  re-register tankers under the U.S. flag so they could be convoyed by U.S.  warships. The United States agreed and lived up to its promise.    Ironically, Kuwait had always been the most outspokenly anti-American of all  the gulf Arab regimes. Part of Kuwait's appeasement was to buy off potential  attacks or subversion by subsidizing Iraq, Syria and the Palestine Liberation  Organization. The other component was rhetorical extremism. Kuwait was not  moderate; it simply did not do very much except talk and donate money.    Thus, Kuwait's U.N. ambassador could speak of a ""cabal which controls and  manipulates and exploits the rest of humanity by controlling the money and  wealth of the world. . . . It is a well-known fact that the Zionists are the  richest people in the world and control much of its destiny."" In July, 1985,  Kuwait National Assembly speaker Ahmad al Sa'dun demanded Kuwait cease aid to  the PLO and Jordan for being too moderate in considering negotiations with  Israel.    At the same time, however, despite some regional defense efforts -- the Gulf  Cooperation Council pact of those unable to protect themselves; the trade of  aid for Egyptian advisers in 1986 -- Kuwait's survival depended ultimately on  Western support. Yet Kuwaitis correctly believed that they could bad-mouth the  West and enjoy its help. Thus, for example, they threatened to go to the  Soviets to obtain American reflagging, then gave the U.S. fleet only limited  help in protecting them.

0,FT924-7700 ,"FT924-7700 _AN-CKOAUAC5FT 921114   FT  14 NOV 92 / Ministers knew of arms 'front': Jordan used as conduit for UK military supplies to Iraq      By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD DONKIN      BRITISH government ministers   up to and possibly including three secretaries of state - almost certainly saw secret documents stating that Iraq had asked Jordan to 'front' for it on a large military shipment in the last days of the Iran-Iraq war. The documents, circulated to ministers in the Ministry of Defence, Department of Trade and Industry and Foreign Office, relate to spare parts for Chieftain armoured recovery vehicles made by Vickers of the UK. This first clear indication that ministers knew about and acquiesced in deals in which Jordan acted as a conduit for arms to Iraq came as Labour, in a separate development, put more pressure on the government over arms-related sales to Iraq. The opposition stepped up its efforts to challenge Mr John Major by releasing further documents and calling upon him to say how much he knew about the issue of export licences when he was foreign secretary. Ministers have consistently maintained that, before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Britain acted in compliance with the guidelines drawn up in 1985 during the Iran-Iraq war. The documents bearing on Jordan relate to meetings of the Inter-Departmental Committee, a body of high-level MoD, DTI and Foreign Office officials set up to scrutinise export licence applications to Iraq and Iran. The summary of one meeting on August 11 1988 refers to 'the question of spares for the Chieftain armoured recovery vehicle for Iraq'. It continues: 'Iraq has asked Jordan to front for them.' The summary of a second meeting on October 19 1988 notes that the supply to Iraq of 'spare parts for armoured recovery vehicles' had been approved. It notes: 'These parts were linked to the Jordan deal but would be supplied direct to Iraq as they were automotive parts only, and not armour or lethal equipment.' What ties ministers to these documents is evidence submitted by senior Foreign Office officials to the trade and industry select committee's inquiry into the Iraqi 'supergun' affair in January 1992. A note supplied to the committee by Mr John Goulden, then a Foreign Office under-secretary, states that 'the minutes of each meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee were submitted with brief summaries of details of each case considered to FCO, MoD and DTI ministers for approval'. Questioned by an MP whether 'it could be any minister from the secretary of state downwards in those departments', Mr Patrick Nixon, then head of the Foreign Office's Middle East department, said: 'It could indeed.' Between August and October 1988, the secretaries of state for defence, trade and industry and foreign affairs were Sir George Younger, Lord Young and Lord Howe respectively. A list of products licensed for export to Iraq in 1988, also submitted to the committee, confirms that more than Pounds 900,000 worth of armoured vehicle spares were cleared for shipment. The end user was listed as the Iraqi armed forces. The use of Jordan as a conduit for UK military supplies to Iraq was 'an open secret' among defence experts. Mr John Wyatt, a bomb disposal specialist and a former official at International Military Services, the government-owned arms sales company, saw British-supplied munitions in Kuwait at the end of the Gulf war. He said: 'We had clear-cut evidence when I went in that ammunition, rockets, mines, and all the rest of it had been supplied by Britain to Jordan which had subsequently got into Iraqi hands.' He added: 'I'm sure in 1988 there was definite knowledge of movement backwards and forwards between Jordan and Iraq . . . because I think at that stage there was a certain amount of support for Iraq against Iran.'

At present  Russian specialists are completing the technical research. It  is expected the power station, which is to produce one seventh  of Iran's demand in electricity, will be ready for operation in  five years' time.    The construction of the nuclear power station was started in  the seventies by two German companies, however it was stopped  before the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war. The Iranian  leadership wavered for a long time as to whether it would be  expedient to complete the construction, but when Tehran decided  in an affirmative way Germany abdicated its commitments because  of fears that the nuclear program might acquire a military  direction.    IAEA inspections to the Bushehr nuclear power station did  not  confirm the fears.    In addition to participating in the construction of the  nuclear power station, Russia will receive a contract to build a  gas-fired thermal power station in the same region. According  to political observers, new Iranian-Russian relations in the  field of power engineering will boost bilateral cooperation in  the political and economic spheres and will also bring to Russia  hard currency it so badly needs.

Mr Eric Beston, the Department of Trade and Industry official formerly responsible for export licensing, said he had been told about the project through a secret Whitehall committee investigating Iraqi arms procurement but had forgotten about it over the summer holidays. This intelligence indicated that Matrix Churchill's lathes had been turned to military use at an Iraqi factory. Mr Beston did not mention this in a letter in September 1989 to Lord Trefgarne, the trade minister, before the minister's meeting with Mr Paul Henderson, the company's managing director, to decide whether four export licences worth Pounds 6m should be granted. In his letter to Lord Trefgarne Mr Beston said that the Foreign Office's case for refusing the licences was neither as 'strong nor as clear cut' as it suggested. He said the licences were for 'general purpose industrial equipment' of a type UK companies had previously supplied to Iraq. He bases his case on the fact that the guidelines covering exports to Iraq had been relaxed - although not openly - after the Iran-Iraq ceasefire in the summer of 1988. Mr Beston agreed with Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, Lord Justice Scott's counsel, that the main purpose of the relaxation was to allow through dual-use goods.   Companies:-  Matrix Churchill.

In this manner, the recommendations of the parliamentary  assembly are expected to facilitate the implementation of the  decisions taken by the Black Sea Economic Cooperation  Organization.

0,FT922-12369 ,"FT922-12369 _AN-CDSAAAD2FT 920418   FT  18 APR 92 / UN grants Kuwait part of Iraqi port      By AP      NEW YORK   A UN COMMISSION setting Iraq's long-disputed southern border has granted Kuwait part of Iraq's only serviceable seaport and a larger portion of the Rumaila oil field, AP reports from New York. The decision is certain to anger Iraq, which used an old border dispute with Kuwait to justify its August 1990 invasion of the emirate. A US-led alliance drove Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991. The Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission said Kuwait would be given part of Umm Qasr, which is linked to the Gulf by the Khor Abdullah waterway and is near Iraq's major offshore oil terminal. Iraq's main port, Basra, has been unusable since the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, when sunken ships clogged the Shatt-al-Arab waterway between the port and the Gulf. The commission's rulings also grant a greater portion of the Rumaila oil field to Kuwait. It was not clear whether Iraq would comply with the rulings. Iraq is represented on the commission but did not participate in the vote on its rulings, apparently in protest. Iraq accepted all terms of the ceasefire agreement that marked its defeat in the war, including the creation of the commission. However, UN officials say Iraq has not complied with other provisions of the ceasefire, including demands for co-operation with UN inspectors overseeing the destruction of its weapons. Under the UN's Gulf War cease-fire resolution, the commission was mandated to set the border with reference to a 1963 agreement which favoured Kuwait.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

By ROBERT SATLOFF, Robert Satloff is a fellow at the Washington Institute for  Near East Policy.

Over the last five years, Jordan has built a strategic alliance with Iraq to  fill the gap created by the king's festering disillusionment with America and  his growing uneasiness with Israel. The formation last April of a new,  Likud-led Israeli government, in which virtually every minister has at one time  voiced disdain for Jordan's very existence, confirmed in the king's mind the  need to look elsewhere for protection.    Brimming with confidence following the Iran-Iraq war, a million-man army and an  arsenal of missiles and poison gas, Saddam Hussein was quick to comply. But, of  course, only on his terms. Namely, Iraq insisted that Jordan help raise the  Arab-Israeli stakes through such displays of brinkmanship as joint  Iraqi-Jordanian air force operations and permitting the flight of Iraqi  reconnaissance planes over the Israeli border. Against his better judgment,  King Hussein went along with the Iraqi agenda every step of the way as the  price to pay for the right to brandish the Iraqi army as Jordan's strategic  deterrent.    Through it all, Jordan sought comfort in the smug belief that it had the  relationship well under control. For the past year, as Iraq's relations with  the West worsened, Amman has seen itself performing la mission civilatrice in  its relations with Baghdad, with Jordanians officials speaking expansively of  the invaluable role they play in explaining the West to Iraq and explaining  Iraq to the West. The king, it was implied, was a royal Higgins to Saddam's  Eliza Doolittle.    The Iraqi digestion of Kuwait, a hereditary monarchy with roots in its land  almost two centuries longer than the Hashemites in theirs, showed how  ridiculous and misguided Jordanian policy actually was. Jordan has no leverage  over Iraq and has not had any since the end of the Iran-Iraq war, but Jordan  refused to see the one-way signs posted on the road to Baghdad. By promising a  peaceful resolution in the gulf, the Iraqi president lied and abused  theJordanian king -- his closest and perhaps his only ally -- and underscored  Jordan's utter lack of strategic independence. The king's reaction so far is  the response of a proud but powerless man made to look the fool.    A final reason for the king's apologia for Iraq revolves around domestic  political opinion in Jordan. He is not, as has been suggested, Mussolini to  Saddam's Hitler; Jordan has neither the means nor the ambition for territorial  expansion. But the World War II analogy that does apply is the Austrian-like  reaction of the Jordanian and Palestinian people to the Iraqi Anschluss.    In the face of unprecedented international condemnation, the Jordanians and  Palestinians continue to lionize Saddam Hussein for taking what he believes is  rightfully his. That is a lesson many in their hearts (if not in their minds)  would like to see applied in Palestine as well as in Jordan itself. As he has  done on occasion in the past, King Hussein has decided to ride that tide,  rather than be swept up in it.    For these reasons, the West's favorite Arab ruler quixotically finds himself in  league with Moammar Kadafi and Yasser Arafat in excusing Iraq's lust and  avarice.

0,FT923-10877 ,"FT923-10877 _AN-CG1AVADSFT 920728   FT  28 JUL 92 / Iraq banks face NY lawsuit over loans      By ALAN FRIEDMAN      NEW YORK   THE Bank of New York filed a lawsuit in federal court yesterday charging that Iraq's state-owned Rafidain Bank and the Central Bank of Iraq had defaulted on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 523m) of loans. The lawsuit, in a Manhattan court, seeks to force Rafidain or the Iraqi central bank, which guaranteed the borrowing, to repay Bank of New York for its share of the loans. The New York bank says it is owed more than Dollars 22.6m plus interest on two loans of Dollars 500m extended to Iraq during the height of the Iran-Iraq war in the mid-1980s. Bank of New York put up Dollars 35.2m of the first Dollars 500m loan extended by 36 banks in 1983, and Dollars 10m toward another loan extended by 25 banks in 1985. Payments were made on schedule by Iraq until the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Baghdad suspended its debt repayments when the United Nations imposed economic sanctions. Iraq has also defaulted on Dollars 2bn of US government loan guarantees, including more than Dollars 300m related to loans made by the Atlanta, Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Yesterday, in the latest of his disclosures relating to BNL's Iraqi loans, Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, released documents showing that weeks before the invasion of Kuwait the Bush administration allowed the US affiliate of the Iraqi-owned Matrix-Churchill machine tools company to ship militarily useful technologies to Iraq that helped President Saddam Hussein's missile projects. The US export occurred, said Mr Gonzalez, despite US government knowledge that Matrix-Churchill was part of Iraq's secret procurement network and was funded by BNL.

[Al Thani] The agenda is open for discussion. We hope this  subject will be discussed. Qatar's view on it is known.    [Al-Jundi] What is Qatar's position?    [Al Thani] Qatar unreservedly favors any Arab reconciliation  and closing Arab ranks.    [Al-Jundi] Does this meeting of the Damascus Declaration  foreign ministers have particular significance in light of the  recent Middle East developments?    [Al Thani] Perhaps the discussion of peace developments is  one of the most important topics at the meeting. But there are  other important issues to be discussed. We hope we can achieve  positive results.    [Al-Jundi] Speaking of the situation in the Middle East, is  the Gulf Cooperation Council now inclined to lift the Arab  boycott against Israel?    [Al Thani] The Arab boycott was introduced by an Arab League  decision. I believe the Arab League is the right venue at which  a decision on removing the boycott should be made. I am  discussing the primary boycott, the first-degree boycott. As  regards other degrees of boycott, Qatar will do what is  necessary when the other negotiating tracks, notably the Syrian  and Lebanese, are advanced.    [Al-Jundi] But Qatar was the first Gulf state to begin  telephone contacts with Israel. Is this an action distinct from  any by the Gulf Cooperation Council states?    [Al Thani] I cannot discuss distinction. We assumed this  position and others can judge it. But we made the decision for  humanitarian reasons. We opened telephone links with the West  Bank and Gaza for humanitarian reasons. There are many  Palestinians in Qatar who want to contact their families  directly. It is a humanitarian issue.    [Al-Jundi] What can the Gulf Cooperation Council offer to  support the Palestinian-Israeli agreement?    [Al Thani] As you know, the Gulf Cooperation Council has  helped the Palestinian cause a great deal. I believe that if  the Council helped in the days of war and estrangement, it will  spare no effort to help during the peace process.    [Al-Jundi] Have you in the Gulf agreed to provide specific  amounts of money to support the Gaza-Jericho agreement?    [Al Thani] No, we have agreed on no such thing.    [Al-Jundi] Thank you.    [Al Thani] Thank you.     "

Mr Channon told the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry that during his period as secretary of state, from 1986-87, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence were interpreting government guidelines in a way he had not envisaged. The guidelines agreed to in December 1984 were intended to restrict defence exports which could significantly enhance military capabilities and prolong or exacerbate the Iran-Iraq war. But Mr Channon commented on one case in which the export of hovercrafts to Iran had been blocked not, in his view, on the basis of military criteria, but because Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher, then prime minister, had not wanted either to alienate the opinion of other arab countries or become embroiled in the Irangate controversy which had surfaced in the United States. 'I think (the MOD and the Foreign Office) were changing the rules as they went along . . Although it was government policy, it was jolly irritating,' he said. Documents made available to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry team confirm that by 1986 Mr Alan Clark, then serving under Mr Channon as trade minister, and other DTI officials were arguing strongly for a relaxation of the guidelines. But Mr Channon said he had no record of some documents being circulated to him. One which he could not recall seeing before yesterday was a minute written by Mr Clark to Mrs Thatcher on November 24 1986 urging a relaxation of the guidelines.

Shaykh Hamad,  who has been in Bonn since Monday, is discussing possibilities  to increase cooperation between Germany and the Arabic Gulf  emirate with the Federal Government and Bundestag deputies. The  two countries are negotiating an agreement in the spheres of  economic cooperation, investment protection, double taxation,  aviation, and cultural exchange.    According to statements from the Foreign Ministry, Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel and Shaykh Hamad in a meeting last night  agreed to conclude these negotiations as quickly as possible.  Bonn would also try to further extend relations between the  European Union [EU] and the Gulf Cooperation Council -- the  community of the six Arabic Gulf monarchies -- during the German  EU presidency (second half of 1994).    Before his meeting with Kohl, the Qatari foreign minister  held talks with Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag's  Foreign Committee; Reinhard Goehner, parliamentary secretary in  the Economics Ministry; and Friedrich Bohl, head of the  Chancellor's Office. Tonight, the foreign minister is scheduled  to meet Joerg Schoenbohm, state secretary in the Defense  Ministry, for talks.    With exports worth 192 million German marks [DM] in 1993,  Germany was one of the most important supply countries for Qatar  (after Japan, the United States, and Britain). Qatar's exports  to the FRG, mainly crude oil, only amounted to DM8 million.     "

""It is unimaginable (to think) that the terrorists group  could have undertaken such a heinous act without first having  cleared it through the Iraqi intelligence authorities,"" the  English-language newspaper said.    It was referring to the main armed rebel group, the People's  Mojahedin, accused by Iran of Monday's [20 June] attack in the  shrine of Imam Reza in the northeastern city of Mashhad. The  Mojahedin have strongly denied any involvement.    The daily accused Baghdad of ""commissioning"" the Iraq-based  Mojahedin to ""plant the bomb in the holiest site in Iran."" The  Mojahedin ""could have obtained such a bomb only from the Iraqi  security forces,"" it said, referring to the 4.5 kilogram (10  pound) device.    The Interior Ministry said 24 were killed and 70 injured,  while the official IRNA news agency said 26 had died and 170  others wounded.    Iran on Thursday [23 June] indefinitely postponed a visit to  Iraq by a Foreign Ministry delegation in protest at Baghdad's  support for the Mojahedin. The visit was to continue  discussions on normalising ties five years after the end of the  1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. Talks resumed last October after they  were broken in the wake of the Gulf war.    Tehran has also accused Baghdad of encouraging the Mojahedin  to carry out sabotage activities inside Iran and the Iraqi  intelligence service of being directly involved in bomb attacks  here.    Iranian Intelligence Minister 'Ali Fallahian said earlier  this month that two high-ranking Iraqi officers were arrested  for smuggling explosives to Iran and planning bomb attacks.     "

Mr Gonzalez said he had forwarded the documents to the Senate intelligence committee, which last October, in its own report on the nomination of Mr Robert Gates as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), stated: 'Intelligence sharing continued on a sporadic basis until 1988 when the Iran-Iraq war ended.' Mr Gonzalez termed the Senate report 'misleading'. The documents include an Iraqi options paper prepared for a White House meeting in May 1990 by Mr Gates, then deputy national security adviser to President Bush. A section entitled 'intelligence co-operation' notes that intelligence exchanges had waned since the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq of 1988. In favour of continuing such co-operation the argument is made that 'they still provide Iraq with limited information on Iranian military activity that would be missed.' The section goes on to state: 'Ending this contact would close off our very limited access to this important segment of the Iraqi establishment.' A Congressional investigator said the Gonzalez committee had received independent confirmation of US-Iraqi intelligence sharing that went beyond the documents released.

All borrowings from the IECF must be used for the  purposes specified. Those that have been transferred to other  projects or appropriated for other purposes without the prior  consent of MOFTEC are to be recovered forthwith.    2. To expedite its circulation and enhance the  efficiency of its utilization, from now on the IECF is to focus  supporting cost- effective foreign projects undertaken by those  companies that implement foreign transaction policies and obey  coordination. Under normal circumstances, it will not extend  loans to investments made by solely foreign-funded or  joint-venture overseas enterprises. The IECF will channel its  credit primarily to the circulation of short- term funds during  the peak period of project funding.    3. To support the development of such undertakings as  contracted foreign projects and cooperation in labor services,  the annual interest rate for borrowings from the IECF will  remain as they are, i.e., the annual interest rate for Renminbi  loans is 4 percent and that for U.S. dollar loans is 5 percent.  Should a need arise, from special circumstances, for a renewal  of the loan, the debtor is to file an application one month in  advance, after which the renewal may be approved by MOFTEC. In  this case, however, the annual interest rate for Renminbi loans  is to conform to the interest rate on revolving-fund credit for  enterprises undertaking foreign contracts set by the General  Office of the People's Construction Bank of China, while the  annual interest rate for U.S. dollar loans is to conform to the  interest rate on revolving-fund credit set by the General Office  of the Bank of China. Should the renewal need to be repeated,  at the discretion of the authorities, the management fee is to  be calculated by the bank credit interest rate, plus 10 percent.  The renewal may not be repeated more than once. Failure to  repay the loan on maturity or extending the length of maturity  without securing prior consent is subject to a penalty of 20  percent, in addition to the bank credit interest rate.    4. A file is to be established for each debtor, into  which its borrowings from, and repayments to, the IECF are to be  entered. In future credit management, priority is to be given  to debtors that have repaid their loans on time and are in good  standing. Debtors that have failed to repay their loans on time  and are not in good standing will not be entitled to further  credit.    5. In June and December of each year, each debtor is  to tabulate the progress in utilization of the IECF borrowings,  in conformity with the attached sample format, and furnish  detailed written data describing the returns, experience, and  issues in relation to the IECF borrowings. Both of these are to  be submitted to MOFTEC (the Financial Accounting Department and  the Department of Foreign Economic Cooperation), with a copy  forwarded to the Finance Ministry (the Finance Department of  Foreign Currency and Affairs).

Simultaneously, the MFER submitted  to the Government of Russia a draft of the decree ""On Making  Amendments and Additions to the Regulations on the MFER in  Conjunction With the Subordination of the Russian Agency for  International Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR) to the MFER  and the Establishment of the Federal State Office `Russian  Center for International and Cultural Cooperation.'"" The RAMSIR  has long been an apple of discord between its former and current  masters. The MFER decree and the draft decree of the government  should codify the role of the ministry as the overseer in  investment issues.    The MFER of Russia intends to assume ""regulatory functions  in  the area of attracting foreign investment to the Russian  Federation"" because, as the text of the draft decree reveals,  the ministry considers itself a legal successor of the RAMSIR,  ""insofar as this Agency has operated to perform the above  envisioned functions."" Along with the functions of the RAMSIR,  the MFER should also take over 75 of its employees. However,  regardless of the decisions to be made by the RAMSIR personnel,  the MFER is already recruiting cadres for its new main  directorate. It is proposed that the RAMSIR itself be  transformed into the Russian Center for International and  Cultural Cooperation (that is to say, some kind of an analog of  the Council of Societies for Friendship With Foreign Countries).  It will now be charged with carrying out the edict of the  president ""On Russian Scientific and Cultural Centers Abroad.""  It is planned to appoint Valentina Tereshkova, the former  chairman of the SSOD [Union of Soviet Friendship Societies], to  head the new department.    In addition to the already mentioned documents, the MFER  simultaneously submitted to the government two others. It is  proposed that the system of centralized exports be modified. The  MFER proposal calls for transmitting state quotas to individual  exporters through the tender committee of the ministry. Besides,  the MFER insists on canceling export duties on all goods. Both  drafts fit very well within the policy of liberalizing foreign  economic relations which the MFER is now pursuing.    [Boxed item begins]    From Order No. 109 of the MFER of Russia    1.

0," LA090490-0097   271261    September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 1; Column 4; Foreign Desk      1460 words      BATTLE-WEARY IRAQIS PREPARE FOR NEW ORDEAL      By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      BAGHDAD, Iraq      The large black banners began appearing a few days ago at busy intersections  throughout Baghdad, and, for most Iraqis, their message had an old yet  painfully familiar ring.    They were official reminders of heroism, martyrdom and death. For a nation that  has endured far too much of all three in the past decade, they were dark omens  that yet another round of war may lie ahead.    ""In the name of God, the most gracious, most merciful,"" began one such banner  on the wall outside the Baghdad Horsemanship Club compound in the Al Mansour  neighborhood, ""this is to honor the martyrdom of air force pilot Maj. Mohammed  Abdulaziz Tabara, who died on Aug. 4 as he fought for the Islamic nation.""    Aug. 4, 1990, two days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait: a prelude to what may  become another war.    Throughout Iraq's brutal eight-year conflict with Iran, which ended just two  years ago, the white-on-black banners were constant sights on Baghdad's  streets. But their reappearance this week in a nation so tightly controlled  that official permission is required for every billboard and sign stands out as  a stark symbol of how President Saddam Hussein is psychologically preparing his  17 million people for more war, more death, more sacrifice.    Beside the black martyrdom banner, there was another one in white that  declared, ""Iraq is trying to protect the holy places from the Americans and  those who cooperate with them.""    They are much-needed messages, to be sure. In a nation where nearly every  family has lost sons or fathers and tens of thousands more lost limbs, the  memories of the war recently ended are as painful as an open wound.    Nobody knows how many died during those eight years of trench warfare, tank and  artillery battles and missile barrages, although most estimates put the death  toll as high as 1 million -- nearly half of them Iraqis.    To the Western mind, the mere thought of yet another, far more catastrophic  conflict with the many foreign armies and sophisticated air forces that the  outside world has ranged around them would plunge such a nation into utter  despair.    But the Iraqi mind is a thing apart. It is battle-weary, yet battle-hardened.  It deeply mourns human loss, yet uses that sorrow to fight harder. It is a mind  as tightly controlled as the society around it, constantly bombarded with  Hussein's slogans about Iraqi pride and nationalism. And it is a mind that he  has conditioned to draw personal strength from the power of its president and  its nation.    Just listen to Madria Nasser Abdul Mishadani, a 40-year-old teacher whose  husband was injured nearly a dozen times while fighting in the Iran-Iraq War  but kept returning to the front lines.    Approached at random by an American journalist in a Baghdad market on Monday,  she was asked whether Iraqi women are nervous about the looming war.    ""No women are afraid,"" she said. ""Aren't we Iraqis? Why should we be scared of  war?""    She added that the commitment is not merely a nationalist one. The cause is  just, she said, and one worth fighting for, even if it means taking on the rest  of the world.    ""For 20 years, we've tried to get Kuwait,"" she said with pride about the Aug. 2  invasion that started the Persian Gulf crisis. She justified Iraq's occupation  of the tiny gulf state by citing the U.S. invasion of Panama last year.    Nabeel Abyass, who was standing in a bread line several miles away, echoed that  view. In fact, the 30-year-old employee of a Baghdad export-import firm, who  fought in the front lines of the Iran-Iraq War from 1984 until it ended in  1988, described the Iraqi psyche by using the Arabic word that means ""hardened  in battle.""    ""Why should I be afraid of war?"" Abyass asked. ""The people who are in the right  aren't afraid of fighting those who are wrong. Besides, we have the will to  face the strongest country in the world.""    The bravado clearly is part of the way every Iraqi home gets psyched up each  day in the current crisis. It is a joint effort, Abyass said. When he goes home  at the end of each day, the nights are filled with talk of the crisis.    ""Politics and work are our entire lives right now.""    But the biggest cheerleader of all is the president himself. He has built into  Iraq's Orwellian system a natural resilience and cult of the military that  actually thrives in a war atmosphere, according to diplomats and analysts who  have lived in Baghdad during times of both war and peace.    The prolonged war with Iran also gave Hussein distinct logistic advantages.    ""Frankly, because of the war, the Iraqis have an enormous ability to organize  things,"" one European diplomat said.    And the fresh backdrop of war appears to have conditioned Iraqis to the concept  of personal and physical sacrifice for the preservation of a nation long ruled  by outsiders.    These are all traits that Hussein has taken pains to nurture and reinforce in  his society, both to strengthen the nation amid the devastation of war and to  justify the fight, no matter how obtuse the logic.    Baghdad, for example, is filled with government-commissioned statues and  mammoth posters attesting to glorious victory in the war with Iran, in which  Iraq gained little and then, just two weeks ago, gave up every piece of real  estate it had captured.    Outside one government building is a statue of a giant Iraqi air force pilot  standing amid the actual ruins of a crashed Iranian F-4 fighter jet.  Officially, it is to commemorate an air force so proficient that it is said to  have shot down 67 Iranian planes in a single day.    A guide from the Iraqi Cultural Ministry explained that the story behind the  statue is of a dogfight between an Iraqi pilot, who was out of ammunition, and  an Iranian jet close on his tail. The Iraqi is said to have looped around and  deliberately crashed into the Iranian in a suicide maneuver that killed both.    But the best illustration of the unusual war psychosis that Hussein has bred  into his people is the enormous Monument of Saddam's Qadissiya Martyrs. It  commemorates the war dead from the Iran-Iraq War, which the Iraqi president  named Qadissiya II after a 7th Century battle in which Arabs defeated Persians.    The shrine sits in the center of a 600,000-square-yard park that includes a  roller coaster and other amusement park rides. The monument, a glittering blue  Islamic dome split into two pieces, stands 120 feet high and 440 feet wide. It  weighs 2,130 tons, all pure marble covered in blue ceramic tile. It took 27  months to build between 1981 and 1983, which was the height of the war.    The cost of the monument: 40 million dinars, then the equivalent of nearly $100  million.    ""It's a fascinating reflection of Saddam Hussein's priorities,"" one Western  diplomat in Baghdad said. ""While most of the Arab leaders in the gulf have  spent their vast oil wealth on opulent palaces, Gargantuan and abstract  sculpture and municipal buildings or simply gambling in the casinos of London  and Monte Carlo, Saddam has used it for things like this.    ""In a way, of course, he has had to. He needs these huge symbols to convince  his people of what he himself believes to be true. And he needs them to  reinforce the notion that they must always be ready for war, that the sacrifice  of war brings both glory and strength.""    Back in Baghdad's bazaars, it would seem that Hussein's policy of  indoctrination has been all but complete.    Hicham Abdul Alim, a 30-year-old pharmacist waiting along with 29 others in one  of the many bread lines caused by the world's embargo of trade with Iraq, was  asked whether some of his friends and neighbors were hoarding food to prepare  for war, an offense punishable by death.    Alim, who is not a member of Hussein's Arab Baath Socialist Party, said that he  did know of several such offenders but that each time he learned of it, he  would give them a simple speech he said was designed to prepare them for  another round of sacrifice and war.    ""You are a weak person,"" he said in relating that speech to an American  journalist Monday. ""A strong person can feed himself on one loaf of bread,  while a weak person can have 50 loaves of bread and still feel he doesn't have  enough.""    Then, Ahmad Abdallah, 54, who was standing nearby, was asked whether he had  anything he wanted to say to the American government, which is leading the  boycott that has forced him to wait each day for flour and bread.    ""I want to tell the American people that our president wants peace,"" he said.  ""I'm sure the American people want peace, but Bush wants to keep causing  problems. . . . This is a fight between presidents.""    But then, Abdallah added that he and his countrymen are more than prepared for  an all-out war.    ""We have experienced war for the last decade,"" he said. ""And we are ready to  fight until the last person.""

The conferees discussed topics related to developing  and strengthening industrial cooperation between the two  countries, and drafting the necessary decisions and  recommendations that will then be referred to the Joint  Industrial Committee. [passage omitted]    In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, Nasri Khuri said: Today's  meeting of the technical subcommittees is one of a series of  meetings and contacts that these committees are holding to form  the framework of cooperation and coordination between the two  fraternal countries under the provisions of the Treaty of  Fraternity and Coordination and on the basis of the agreements  signed and ratified in accordance with the constitutional  procedures in both countries.    Several committees were formed under the provisions of the  Economic and Social Cooperation Agreement. These committees  are: The ""Joint Industrial Committee,"" which in turn has formed  five technical subcommittees, which are holding their meeting  today; the ""Joint Agricultural Committee,"" which held its  meeting earlier and agreed to establish a subcommittee for  marketing agricultural products, and which will hold its second  meeting on Saturday; the ""Joint Electricity Committee,"" which is  scheduled to meet today, Sunday 13 February; the ""Joint Water  Committee,"" which is discussing several matters relating to  joint waters and which has already held two meetings; the ""Joint  Health Committee"" and the ""Joint Transport Committee,"" which  also held their meetings.    The Joint Economic Committee, which has prepared a general  idea of how to implement the Economic and Social Cooperation  Agreement, will hold its meeting in the middle of next month.    There is also a ""Joint Tourism Committee,"" a ""Communications  Committee,"" a ""Committee for Facilitating Border Procedures,""  and a ""Committee for facilitating Bases for Certificate of  Origin."" We are now in the process of forming a ""Joint  Committee for Labor and Social Affairs"" and a permanent  committee for planning. All these committees are operating  under the supervision of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council and  they submit their results to the Economic and Social Cooperation  Agreement committee, which consists of all the competent and  concerned ministers from both sides in the two fraternal  countries, in order to make the necessary decisions on them  prior to submitting then to the Followup and Coordination  Commission.    We must point out here that within the framework of the  Treaty of Cooperation and Coordination between the fraternal  countries there is a ""Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs,"" and  a ""Joint Committee for Defense and Security."" This is in  addition to the ""Economic and Social Committee.""

By NICK B. WILLIAMS Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER      MANAMA, Bahrain      Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday announced that U.S. Air Force planes  have begun operating out of a base in the United Arab Emirates, and he praised  the ""strong commitment"" of the Emirates, the latest Persian Gulf country to  open its doors to outside forces in the military confrontation with Iraq.    The touring Pentagon leader said that C-130 cargo planes are using Bateen Air  Base to ferry supplies to American troops in Saudi Arabia.    The Emirates, a confederation of seven small oil sheikdoms, announced Sunday  that it had agreed to host ""some Arab and friendly forces"" in the face of the  threat to its big neighbor and alliance partner, Saudi Arabia.    ""That reveals the strong commitment of the men and women of this country to  defend their way of life and to rally behind their leadership at this time,""  Cheney said.    The C-130s had, in fact, begun operations from Bateen five days ago, American  military officers told reporters traveling with Cheney. ""But I don't think  anybody knows how long they'll be here,"" said Col. Dave Mason, commander of the  314th Tactical Airlift Squadron, who has 16 C-130s and 575 airmen in a unit  flown to the Emirates from Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas.    Cheney told reporters aboard his plane on a four-day tour of the crisis region  that the American commitment is ""long-term"" and that he could not speculate on  what the size of the force will be ""one or two years from now.""    The impression that U.S. military units will be in the Persian Gulf on an  open-ended deployment to safeguard oil production vital to the industrialized  world has been supported by gulf officials in private conversations over the  last few weeks.    The Saudis requested Western support in the face of an Iraqi threat to their  oil fields after Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of Saudi  Arabia's neighbor Kuwait. Following the Saudis' lead, the normally cautious  Arab states on the west coast of the gulf, one by one, joined the defense.  British airplanes flew to Oman in the first days of the crisis. Last week,  Bahrain approved open use of its airfields by British jets.    All the small countries, bound in alliance to Saudi Arabia under the Gulf  Cooperation Council, supported the deployment of the first foreign forces on  Saudi soil.    Officials in Bahrain and other gulf states say their governments are now  prepared for a long-term strategy to repel any aggression.    ""We have to be very realistic,"" one said, discarding the notion that the gulf  states can provide their own security. ""The whole world agrees that there is a  danger to the international economic system"" if the Persian Gulf is unstable.    ""The principle will be here for a long time. The Americans will be here, and  the British will supplement them,"" the official added.    In this crisis, the Emirates were the first to act. When the Iraqi army first  threatened Kuwait in late July, in an oil-production dispute that also involved  the Emirates, President Bush sent two KC-135 refueling tankers to the gulf for  exercises with the Emirates' minuscule air force of French-made Mirage  fighters.    Now, the 314th Squadron has set up shop in the desert heat. The airmen are  housed in 50 air-conditioned trailers provided by the Emirates' central  government in Abu Dhabi. Col. Mason, the commander, said his planes were  ferrying food, ammunition and weapons from Bateen Air Base to the growing force  of American Marines and paratroopers on the ground in Saudi Arabia.    ""The total size of the final deployment will depend on future developments,""  said Cheney, who left the Emirates for stops Monday in Oman, a sultanate just  outside the Persian Gulf, and the Saudi city of Jidda, on the Red Sea coast.  ""I'm especially pleased that U.S. forces are among those accepted by the UAE in  defense of the gulf,"" he declared after meeting with the Emirates' president,  Sheik Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayan.    ""It's a measure of the seriousness of the situation and shows how deeply  concerned they are about Saddam Hussein. They want to cooperate with the United  States and other forces in the region.""    He made no disclosure of U.S. deployments beyond the airlift squadron. The  Emirates' acceptance of foreign forces specifically mentioned the possibility  of Arab units joining a multinational defense.    The Emirates government, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, ""has agreed to  receiving some Arab and friendly forces as a contribution towards Arab and  international efforts to defend the region.""    Two days earlier, Bahraini officials had announced their approval of use of  airfields on the small island nation by British forces.    On Aug. 7, less than a week after Iraqi tanks and troops poured across the  Kuwaiti frontier and occupied the oil sheikdom, President Bush ordered U.S.  troops and warplanes onto Saudi Arabian soil at the request of King Fahd, whose  country was threatened by Iraqi armor driving south from Kuwait city.    The first American planes began arriving in Saudi Arabia's Eastern province the  next day, marking the first foreign deployment in the gulf states. Britain sent  in a squadron of Tornado fighters and flew a squadron of Jaguar warplanes to  Oman.    American naval forces had been operating in the international waters of the  gulf for years, demonstrating the right of free passage. In the 1980-88 war  between Iran and Iraq, American warplanes flew cover over Navy ships escorting  Kuwaiti oil tankers reflagged under the Stars and Stripes to qualify them for  American protection.    The strategy kept Kuwaiti oil moving to world markets but was marked by tragedy  in 1987 when an Iraqi Exocet missile hit the frigate Stark, killing 37 U.S.  sailors. Baghdad said the attack was an accident.    The next year, a missile fired by the guided missile cruiser Vincennes felled  an Iranian airliner, killing all 290 aboard. Vincennes' officers said the plane  was mistaken for an attacking warplane.

By NICK B. WILLIAMS Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER      MANAMA, Bahrain      Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday announced that U.S. Air Force planes  have begun operating out of a base in the United Arab Emirates, and he praised  the ""strong commitment"" of the Emirates, the latest Persian Gulf country to  open its doors to outside forces in the military confrontation with Iraq.    The touring Pentagon leader said that C-130 cargo planes are using Bateen Air  Base to ferry supplies to American troops in Saudi Arabia.    The Emirates, a confederation of seven small oil sheikdoms, announced Sunday  that it had agreed to host ""some Arab and friendly forces"" in the face of the  threat to its big neighbor and alliance partner, Saudi Arabia.    ""That reveals the strong commitment of the men and women of this country to  defend their way of life and to rally behind their leadership at this time,""  Cheney said.    The C-130s had, in fact, begun operations from Bateen five days ago, American  military officers told reporters traveling with Cheney. ""But I don't think  anybody knows how long they'll be here,"" said Col. Dave Mason, commander of the  314th Tactical Airlift Squadron, who has 16 C-130s and 575 airmen in a unit  flown to the Emirates from Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas.    Cheney told reporters aboard his plane on a four-day tour of the crisis region  that the American commitment is ""long-term"" and that he could not speculate on  what the size of the force will be ""one or two years from now.""    The impression that U.S. military units will be in the Persian Gulf on an  open-ended deployment to safeguard oil production vital to the industrialized  world has been supported by gulf officials in private conversations over the  last few weeks.    The Saudis requested Western support in the face of an Iraqi threat to their  oil fields after Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of Saudi  Arabia's neighbor Kuwait. Following the Saudis' lead, the normally cautious  Arab states on the west coast of the gulf, one by one, joined the defense.  British airplanes flew to Oman in the first days of the crisis. Last week,  Bahrain approved open use of its airfields by British jets.    All the small countries, bound in alliance to Saudi Arabia under the Gulf  Cooperation Council, supported the deployment of the first foreign forces on  Saudi soil.    Officials in Bahrain and other gulf states say their governments are now  prepared for a long-term strategy to repel any aggression.    ""We have to be very realistic,"" one said, discarding the notion that the gulf  states can provide their own security. ""The whole world agrees that there is a  danger to the international economic system"" if the Persian Gulf is unstable.    ""The principle will be here for a long time. The Americans will be here, and  the British will supplement them,"" the official added.    In this crisis, the Emirates were the first to act. When the Iraqi army first  threatened Kuwait in late July, in an oil-production dispute that also involved  the Emirates, President Bush sent two KC-135 refueling tankers to the gulf for  exercises with the Emirates' minuscule air force of French-made Mirage  fighters.    Now, the 314th Squadron has set up shop in the desert heat. The airmen are  housed in 50 air-conditioned trailers provided by the Emirates' central  government in Abu Dhabi. Col. Mason, the commander, said his planes were  ferrying food, ammunition and weapons from Bateen Air Base to the growing force  of American Marines and paratroopers on the ground in Saudi Arabia.    ""The total size of the final deployment will depend on future developments,""  said Cheney, who left the Emirates for stops Monday in Oman, a sultanate just  outside the Persian Gulf, and the Saudi city of Jidda, on the Red Sea coast.  ""I'm especially pleased that U.S. forces are among those accepted by the UAE in  defense of the gulf,"" he declared after meeting with the Emirates' president,  Sheik Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayan.    ""It's a measure of the seriousness of the situation and shows how deeply  concerned they are about Saddam Hussein. They want to cooperate with the United  States and other forces in the region.""    He made no disclosure of U.S. deployments beyond the airlift squadron. The  Emirates' acceptance of foreign forces specifically mentioned the possibility  of Arab units joining a multinational defense.    The Emirates government, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, ""has agreed to  receiving some Arab and friendly forces as a contribution towards Arab and  international efforts to defend the region.""    Two days earlier, Bahraini officials had announced their approval of use of  airfields on the small island nation by British forces.    On Aug. 7, less than a week after Iraqi tanks and troops poured across the  Kuwaiti frontier and occupied the oil sheikdom, President Bush ordered U.S.  troops and warplanes onto Saudi Arabian soil at the request of King Fahd, whose  country was threatened by Iraqi armor driving south from Kuwait city.    The first American planes began arriving in Saudi Arabia's Eastern province the  next day, marking the first foreign deployment in the gulf states. Britain sent  in a squadron of Tornado fighters and flew a squadron of Jaguar warplanes to  Oman.    American naval forces had been operating in the international waters of the  gulf for years, demonstrating the right of free passage. In the 1980-88 war  between Iran and Iraq, American warplanes flew cover over Navy ships escorting  Kuwaiti oil tankers reflagged under the Stars and Stripes to qualify them for  American protection.    The strategy kept Kuwaiti oil moving to world markets but was marked by tragedy  in 1987 when an Iraqi Exocet missile hit the frigate Stark, killing 37 U.S.  sailors. Baghdad said the attack was an accident.    The next year, a missile fired by the guided missile cruiser Vincennes felled  an Iranian airliner, killing all 290 aboard. Vincennes' officers said the plane  was mistaken for an attacking warplane.    Since the Iran-Iraq truce that ended the war in 1988, Washington has kept a  presence in the gulf in the form of an eight-ship task force.    Arab countries, including those in the gulf, have traditionally insisted that  Arab disputes should be left to them.

Senior officials  from both sides in charge of scientific and technological  affairs reviewed the achievements scored in the past 15 years  since the 1979 signing of the ""Agreement Between the Chinese and  U.S. Governments on Scientific and Technological Cooperation.""  They also discussed new prospects for strengthening or  expanding scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation.    At the meeting, Song Jian, co-chairman of the meeting,  Chinese state councilor, and minister of the State Science and  Technology Commission, and John Gibbons, assistant to the  president for science and technology and director of the Office  of Science and Technology Policy, fully affirmed the tremendous  achievements scored in scientific and technological cooperation  between the two countries. They also signed a joint communique  of this meeting as well as a ""Clean Coal Appendix"" to the  ""Sino-U.S. Protocol on Cooperation in Fossil Energy"" and renewed  the ""Sino-U.S. Protocol on Cooperation in Marine Science and  Technology.""    Following the meeting, Song Jiang pointed out in a speech:  This meeting has created new conditions for future Sino-U.S.  scientific and technological cooperation. He then said: The  fruitful cooperation between China and the United States  according to 29 protocols in this regard has yielded some major,  inspiring results. Such cooperation is not only of great  significance for the two countries' scientific and technological  circles but has played an important role in promoting economic  development and scientific progress and enhances the friendship  of people in the two countries. He expressed the belief that  with the meeting's decision on the common objectives for the  expanded scale and scope of scientific and technological  cooperation, the cooperation between scientific, technological,  and economic circles in China and the United States would  certainly develop toward ever higher aims and in ever broader  fields.    Gibbons said in his speech: There are many opportunities in  Sino-U.S. scientific and technological cooperation. So it is  necessary to promote such cooperation. He then pointed out:  The Clinton administration holds that maintaining a stable  relationship with a strong and prosperous China is very much in  the interests of the United States. He said: As a Chinese  proverb goes, a thousand-mile journey is started by taking the  first step. China and the United States have taken the first  step together toward in-depth cooperation at the joint  commission meeting.    According to Chinese science and technology delegation  members attending the meeting, as one of the important  activities in Sino- U.S. relations, this meeting stressed that  both sides should expand their cooperation in the development of  cancer and AIDS medicines, environmental protection, the  exploitation and effective use of energy, and in  high-temperature superconducting materials and rare- earth  elements. From now on, Sino-U.S. scientific and technological  cooperation will focus on these four fields.    Four representatives from the American Pharmaceutical  Association, the Council of Environmental Industry, the Power  Research Institute, and the Auto Engineers Association briefed  the meeting this afternoon on opportunities for expanding the  scientific and technological cooperation between Chinese and  U.S. industries. They earnestly hoped for expanding scientific  and technological cooperation between the two governments to  enterprises.    The ""Agreement Between the Chinese and U.S. Governments on  Scientific and Technological Cooperation"" was signed by  then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and U.S. President Carter in  1979. Within the framework of this agreement, the two sides  signed 29 protocols in education, agriculture, space technology,  high-energy physics, industrial science and technology  management, scientific and technological intelligence,  metrology, atmosphere, oceanography, public health, hydropower,  earthquake, earth science, environmental protection, basic  science, construction and urban planning, surface water, nuclear  safety, nuclear physics, aviation, transportation and  communication, statistics, fossil energy, topography,  telecommunications, railways, protection of nature, nonferrous  metals, and land management. Within the bounds of these  protocols, relevant Chinese and U.S. Government departments have  undertaken more than 1,000 projects for scientific and  technological cooperation and over 10,000 people have exchanged  visits over the past 15 years.    According to the ""Agreement Between the Chinese and U.S.  Governments on Scientific and Technological Cooperation,"" the  Sino- U.S. Joint Commission on Scientific and Technological  Cooperation, which guides the agreement's implementation, holds  a meetings once every two years in the capitals of the two  countries by turns.

In a 20-minute meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa,  Vu Khoan thanked Japan for calling on the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to expand its  assistance to Indochina countries, including Vietnam, at last  week's OECD meeting in Paris, foreign ministry officials said.    Vu Khoan was quoted as telling Kakizawa that Vietnam is  making preparations to join the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN).    He did not specify any other Asia-Pacific groupings Vietnam  is interested in joining, but Hanoi has expressed willingness to  participate in the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC)  and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the  future, according to the officials.    Kakizawa replied that Japan wants to help Vietnam take  active  part in the Asia-Pacific region and will continue to make  efforts to expand OECD assistance to the region, the officials  said.    Turning to Vietnam's diplomatic relations, Vu Khoan told  Kakizawa that ties with the United States are improving, with  the two sides recently agreeing to set up liaison offices in  each other's country.    Vietnam's relations with China are also improving, although  some problems remain, and Hanoi wants to solve those problems  through negotiations, Vu Khoan was quoted as saying.    Negotiations over several disputed land and sea boundaries,  including the row over the Spratly Islands, have been under way  since Vietnam and China reestablished diplomatic relations in  1991, but have failed to make much progress.    Kakizawa welcomed Vietnam's recent economic and social  developments and told Vu Khoan he hopes Hanoi will continue  making efforts to normalize relations with China and the U.S.,  the officials said.    Kakizawa and Vu Khoan agreed to cooperate in implementing  Japan's economic cooperation with Vietnam, they said.     "

This was to settle the old accounts of the Gulf war  in reply to the Yemeni's pan-Arab position and to teach the  Yemeni leadership a hard lesson for its pan-Arab role in the  Mother of Battles.    When Yemen joined the Arab Cooperation Council, certain Gulf  states were outraged because they considered it the backyard of  the Gulf and the Roman theater in which they watch the rivers of  blood flow to kill their boredom of money and oil.    Since the Gulf War ended, the United Stats has been hatching  conspiracies to destroy the pan-Arab flame in Yemen and place  its shores and Bab el-Mandeb under U.S. control to complete the  occupation of the entire Arabian Peninsula and its long shores.    The UN Security Council's intervention in a domestic affair  without the request of the responsible Yemeni party also comes  to avenge the Jordanian stands, which certain Gulf states still  abhor because of, first, Jordan's fostering of the Arab  Cooperation Council; second, its rational position in the Gulf  war; and, third, its honorable mediation to spare Yemeni blood.    The new imperialist conspiracy did not stop at fragmenting  Yemen's unity, isolating it, and pushing it into the quagmire of  a long civil war. It went beyond that to the objective of  aborting the Jordanian mediation and destroying its plan for  pan-Arab renaissance -- the Arab Cooperation Council, as well as  destroying the effective Yemeni role in that Council. The more  important objective of the conspiracy was to curb the Jordanian  role and prevent it from contributing to the pan-Arab  renaissance because the Arab Cooperation Council plan -- which  certain Gulf states viewed as a challenge and an axis hostile to  their dreams and encroachment on their influence zones,  primarily Yemen -- was about to shatter the hopes of the U.S.  imperialism to impose control on the Gulf. To avenge that  position, certain Gulf states, acted quickly to complicate  matters and push the situation in Yemen to a dead end. They used  in the process certain Yemeni stooges to implement their  conspiracy, with promises that they will be put in control if  they implement their policies.    We denounce the UN Security Council's intervention in  Yemen's  internal affairs. We know in advance that any Arab subject that  enters the Security Council will come out of it more complicated  because the Security Council will not put things in the proper  context and will, instead, complicate the problem, knowing that  behind every Arab sedition there are American hands.    The Yemeni issue remains of concern to the legitimate Yemeni  leadership and any foreign intervention in rejected. The  Yemeni people will reject any Yemeni party that throws itself  into the lap of U.S. imperialism to impose on its people a  position that runs counter to their national aspirations. The  Yemeni people have always been invulnerable to attempt at  containment or hegemony and have crushed all conspiracies aimed  at colonizing them and subjugating them to foreign hegemony.    We urge the Yemeni people and leadership to deny the  conspirators every opportunity and to adhere to Yemen unity. We  also urge them to utilize every chance for dialogue in order to  foil the evil conspiracies and abort the big sedition.     "

Deputy Head of the Russian Foreign Economic Relations  Department for Multilateral Cooperation Maksim Medvedkov told  Interfax that to adopt the package, approved by all other EU  members on May 16, would make the prospect of the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and  the European Union being initialled and then signed in June or  July a reality.    The Shokhin-Brittan agreements concerned ways to settle the  two most burning issues in Russian economic relations with the  EU: the conditions for the activity of foreign banks in Russia  and trade regulations for substances used in the nuclear  industry, particularly uranium, which has become a true  stumbling block.    Medvedkov said that France was afraid that Russian uranium  exports would deliver a blow to its own nuclear fuel exports to  EU countries. He said he doubted that France had any other  reason to veto the Shokhin-Brittan deal or the signing of the  partnership and cooperation agreement itself.    He said France was simply making the latest in a series of  attempts to tailor the regulations governing uranium sales to  its own requirements but without providing so much as a hint of  an argument in defense of its position.    ""France's fears are economically groundless and are more  abstract in character,"" Medvedkov commented. Paris was  concerned, for example, that Russia would try to inundate Europe  with its uranium at some future date and alter the existing  market. ""That assumption too is unfounded, since EU restrictions  on the export of fissile substances exist, and there are other  Euroatom rules which are binding for Russia,"" he said.    Russia and France will discuss this complex issue and other  difficulties associated with the signing of the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation between Russia and the EU during the  current visit by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to Moscow.

""If our cooperation is limited to questions of security  systems or foreign policy, everything may remain at the level of  mere rhetoric,"" Meri noted. He said the Baltic states must  realize that, under their geopolitical conditions, issues of  security and foreign policy can be solved only if they have a  common economic basis.

By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      LONDON      ""Majnoon"" is what they call the marshes on the border that divides Iran and  Iraq just below the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. It's the  Arabic word for ""madness."" And in the spring of 1984, when the Majnoon marshes  became the latest battlefield in the prolonged Iran-Iraq War, Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein redefined the word.    As one of only a handful of European and American journalists who managed to  reach the actual fighting at the time, I watched Hussein's army slaughter  thousands of Iranian soldiers in a rare and little-known military operation  that combined high technology, hatred and the horrors of war into a blend of  brutality almost beyond comprehension.    What we saw was vintage Saddam Hussein, the efficient and surgical military  muscle that made the Persian Gulf War one of the bloodiest in the history of  man and made Hussein himself the most awesome leader in the Arab world.    And it left behind haunting images that now help define America's newest enemy  in the Middle East and graphically underscore the ruthless dedication of his  million-strong war machine.    The Battle of Majnoon wasn't nearly as widely documented as Hussein's use of  vast chemical weapons arsenals on Iraq's rebellious Kurds, whose poisoned  bodies littering the roadsides have been shown time and again on Western  television during the past 10 days. Nor was it as well publicized as the Iraqi  leader's devastating ""War of the Cities"" missile attacks on schools, homes and  mosques throughout Iran during the eight-year war.    In fact, there were very few shots fired, and only a handful of artillery  barrages. They were hardly needed, given the creative killing methods devised  by the Iraqi army for the occasion.    ""You wait until nighttime, and you will see how we are killing these Iranian  dogs,"" an Iraqi officer said with a broad grin. ""We are frying them like  eggplants.""    He then took us on a tour of dozens of thick electrical cables his troops had  lain through the marshy battlefield, a spaghetti network that snaked in and out  of the patchwork of lagoons. He showed us the mammoth electric generators that  fed the exposed power lines from positions just behind the Iraqi front lines.  And, when the Iranian Revolutionary Guards made their regular evening advance,  the officer and his men demonstrated the macabre genius of their invention.    Iraqi gun batteries fired just enough artillery to force the Revolutionary  Guards from their marsh boats, and, when hundreds of them had been forced to  continue their advance through the lagoons on foot, the men manning the Iraqi  generators flipped a few switches and sent thousands of volts of electricity  surging through the marshland.    Within seconds, hundreds of Iranians were electrocuted.    But the horror show did not end there. The following morning, Iraqi troops  began another grisly routine that the officer called ""the morning road detail.""    They made their way through the marshes, gathering up the dead Iranian soldiers  like dynamite fishermen harvesting a day's catch. Working methodically, the  Iraqis piled the corpses on top of one another in the water in head-to-toe  stacks, five bodies high and five across.    Together, the human piles formed long rows, the width of a troop truck, the top  layers above the water's surface. Each row extended in a straight line through  the marshes from the Iraqis' positions toward the Iranian border. Finally, the  rows were sprinkled with lime and covered over with a foot-thick tier of desert  sand.    It was the Iraqi method of road building, using the bodies of their enemies to  construct assault routes for tanks and trucks.    There are other grisly anecdotes from the Iran-Iraq War that help define Saddam  Hussein -- glimpses of an enigmatic leader who in the last 12 days has sealed  his nation to all outside journalists and crafted his image through Iraqi  government television clips.    For Saddam Hussein, a teen-aged assassin who led his splinter faction of the  Arab Baath Party to power in a ruthless July 30, 1968, coup, the pursuit of  physical power and military might has been as much a characteristic as his  penchant for security.    During three meetings with Hussein in small press conferences or interviews in  1984, I was led through three metal detectors each time and thoroughly  body-searched twice by his personal guards. Throughout the rambling sessions,  Hussein turned answers into political diatribes and always referred to himself  in the third person.    Every trip he made outside his presidential palace was an unscheduled, surprise  visit. Foreign journalists were never permitted to accompany him. And he would  travel in a convoy in which several limousines were used as decoys.    It was during another rural journey through the Iraqi countryside that it  became clear Hussein's troops were capable of using on their own people the  very same ruthlessness they show their enemies.

Active  participation in the North Atlantic Council for Cooperation and  in the Partnership for Peace project is an important starting  point for NATO membership.

For several months American police have had information that  an international gang has succeeded in using Cyprus to launder a  large amount of money received from the sale of drugs.    According to our information, the American police and the  Cypriot police are cooperating to investigate this case and  locate the people behind it.    In the past, Cyprus has been used to transfer dirty money  overseas, a case in which Canadian police showed great interest.    Cyprus is being used as a transit point in the drug trade,  but recently it has developed a market of its own.

Accepting SRV Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's  invitation, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai paid an official  visit to Vietnam on 16-19 March 1994.    2. During his visit to Vietnam, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai  was cordially received by Do Muoi, general secretary of the  Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV] and State President Le Duc Anh.    3.

After the visits to Vietnam by Crown Prince Maha Wachiralongkon  in 1992 and Princess Maha Chakri Sirinthon in 1993 and the  Thailand visit by CPV General Secretary Do Muoi in 1993, this  official visit by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai marks a new  developmental step in the friendly relations between Vietnam and  Thailand and contributes to peace, stability, and prosperity in  Southeast Asia.    7. In the talks, the two sides acknowledged progress in  cooperation in economic, commercial, educational, scientific,  and technological matters. The two sides held, however, that  more effort must be exerted to strengthen the Vietnam-Thailand  relationship. To achieve that goal, the two sides unanimously  agreed that Vietnam and Thailand need to accelerate their  negotiations in order to quickly solve all remaining problems.  The two sides also agreed to set up joint commissions to  oversee other fields that need to receive more attention and  close cooperation. Regarding this issue, the two sides agreed to  quickly form a high-level joint commission to solve the fishery  problem and restore order in the sea.    8. The two sides held that the Tourism Cooperation Agreement  and the Accord for Mutual Cooperation between the Vietnam  Commerce and Industry Chamber with the Thailand Industry  Federation are practical measures to further accelerate the  cooperation between Vietnam and Thailand through related organs  and private business in the two countries.

The  Thai side welcomes Vietnam's readiness to participate in the  Regional Security Forum which will be held in Bangkok in July  1994.

The two sides highly evaluate the Cambodian people's  efforts to strengthen peace and implement national concord  without external interference. The two sides believe that the  Cambodian people, under the leadership of King Sihanouk and  their royal government, will be successful in their national  reconstruction and in building a Cambodian state of peace and  independence with friendship relations with all nations in the  region.    12.

0,FT922-3557 ,"FT922-3557 _AN-CFKBHAASFT 920611   FT  11 JUN 92 / US allowed Indonesian arms sales to Iraq      By ALAN FRIEDMAN      NEW YORK   THE Bush administration gave its approval in November 1989 to Indonesian government arms sales to Iraq, according to a declassified State Department cable made public in Congress yesterday. The cable is the first confirmation that the US gave explicit approval to allies to sell arms to Iraq, while Washington was ostensibly operating an embargo against Baghdad. The cable was sent to instruct a US envoy who was to hold a meeting with an Indonesian minister over Jakarta's wish to sell French Super-Puma helicopters to Iraq. The cable, which was classified secret and sent by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state, says: 'Although the US severely limits the sale of our own munitions-list items to Iraq, we have not had a policy of discouraging other countries' arms sales to Iraq. Such a policy is in effect with regard to Iran.' Mr Sam Gejdenson, a Democratic on the House foreign affairs committee, yesterday released the cable along with other documents illustrating the US 'tilt' to Iraq, both before and after the August 1988 conclusion of the war between Baghdad and Tehran. Mr Gejdenson, who yesterday claimed that Mr James Baker, secretary of state, had withheld documents from his congressional investigation into US relations with Iraq, stressed the Eagleburger cable was sent less than nine months before Mr Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and well after the end of the Iran-Iraq war. At the height of the US tilt to Baghdad, in a cable signed in June 1984 by Mr George Shultz, then secretary of state, it was stated that 'under present circumstances, in which Iraq is clearly on the defensive and Iran is in little danger of defeat, we are not actively opposing non-US controlled exports of arms to Iraq, which do not contribute to widening the war'. Mr Gejdenson yesterday also released a late 1988 State Department memo - entitled Guidelines for US-Iraqi Policy - that seemed to oppose any arms sales to Baghdad, but simultaneously suggested making an exception to the US ban on weapons sales by allowing the sale of C-130 transport aircraft and computers.

The  president was reacting to an agreement reached in New York on  Saturday, 19 March, between Netherlands Development Cooperation  Minister Pronk, the IMF, and Surinamese Foreign Minister Mungra  and Planning and Development Cooperation Minister Assen.    After the meeting Pronk said that Paramaribo had agreed to  IMF monitoring of the structural modification program which the  Surinamese economy was to undergo. The IMF will report progress  made each quarteron. The state of affairs and the Netherlands  will decide on this basis whether or not Suriname will receive  or how much money Suriname will receive as support for its  balance of payments, the minister said.    But Venetiaan refused on Sunday to commit himself. ""We have  not yet made any decision. First, we want to see what demands  are made,"" the president said in his initial reaction to IMF  monitoring. Paramaribo has always resisted IMF checks on the  grounds that the institution would support excessively rigorous  economic cuts. Suriname wanted the British Warwick Institute to  follow up the process rather than the IMF. But the Warwick  Institute indicated that it wanted to do no more than assist the  IMF. In addition this was unacceptable to the Netherlands.    The Development Cooperation Ministry was assuming yesterday  that the agreements made on Saturday were valid. ""If two  prominent Surinamese Government ministers agree on something  like this, then it is serious business,"" Pronk's spokesman said.  He added that the agreements still had to be approved by IMF  Director Camdessus and President Venetiaan.    Before his departure for New York on Friday, Pronk said that  Suriname had to decide in the near future about the monitoring  of the recovery program. Elections would soon be held in the  Netherlands, followed by the formation of a new cabinet, and  according to the minister, that could lead ""to a huge amount of  lost time"" in the resumption of aid to Suriname, Pronk's  spokesman said. On the basis of the 1992 Framework Treaty,  Suriname is still due approximately 1.2 billion guilders for  items including balance of payments support, subject to the  condition that it takes measures to boost the economy. If  everything goes well, this support will be spread over  approximately 10 years. It is separate from project aid, which  is continuing normally and remains outside IMF monitoring. The  Netherlands is providing this aid for social facilities,  education, health care, and infrastructure.     "

This lack of specifics, he said in a written reply to Congressman Jack Brooks, panel chairman, did not mean the case was closed but that the conditions laid down in the act, passed after the Watergate scandal and empowering the appointment of a special prosecutor, had not been met. This is the 10th occasion that Congress has made such a request and the first rejection by an attorney-general. The authority of the act, of which Mr Barr and President George Bush have been conspicuous critics, expires in December unless renewed by Congress. Iraqgate covers the actions allegedly taken by the administration consequent on the US 'tilt' towards Baghdad, starting in the mid-1980s at the height of the Iran-Iraq war and continuing until shortly before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. They include fraudulent loans to Iraq channelled through the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the misuse of loan guarantees offered by the Department of Agriculture, and the alteration of Commerce Department export certificates to conceal the supply of arms and other technology relevant to Iraq's military development. Throughout the congressional investigations, involving half a dozen separate committees, there have been complaints that the administration has persistently withheld evidence. Mr Barr's refusal to appoint a prosecutor will doubtless cause these to grow, although it also leaves the door open to Mr Brooks and Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, to make a second approach, naming those suspected of having broken the law. The administration has countered that Congress's motives are purely political and designed to embarrass the president's re-election campaign. Similar criticism has been directed from the White House at the activities of the independent prosecutor in the Iran-Contra affair.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

South Korean Construction Minister Kim U-sok, who is  visiting  Malaysia, held talks with Malaysian Public Works Minister Leo  Moggi and asked him to take action that would allow South Korean  builders to participate in various development projects.    Malaysia is pushing ahead with its ""Vision 2020 Program"" to  raise per capita gross national product (GNP) to 10,000 U.S.  dollars by 2020 and has embarked on various development projects.    Minister Kim proposed that Korean and Malaysian construction  firms advance jointly into third countries including China and  Vietnam.    Kim promised the Malaysian minister that South Korea will  draft a plan for its construction businesses to transfer  technology and provide technical education to Malaysian workers.    Meanwhile, South Korean builders have received 4.1 billion  dollars in orders from Malaysia and are carrying out 1.75  billion dollars worth of construction in 23 cases.     "

[Derycke] During the parliamentary debate, it was only the  Flemish Bloc which shocked me, arguing for the abandoning of an  Africa which they see as on the road to ruin. If that is the  position of Belgian society, as the Flemish Bloc claims, then I  am almost ashamed to be Belgian. Europe has a tradition which  will not allow it to act in this way. I have also been  surprised by the extent to which certain deputies, and no doubt  public opinion, are ill-informed on the subject of Rwanda,  unaware that we have redirected 80 percent of our aid for this  country to basic activities, far removed from political  intrigues.    [Stroobants] Specifically?    [Derycke] In the field of education, health care, and  agriculture we have given the minimum necessary for these people  who, without us, would have nothing. In the future, we will  have to discuss cooperation within the government, with the  Parliament, and with the people. Like everyone else, I too am  pained by the death of our paratroopers and civilians. They  were all in Rwanda to help with the country's democratization.  But we must not forget that the drama experienced by the vast  majority of Rwandans is, at the very least, as awful as our own.    [Stroobants] Could democracy really be envisaged in Rwanda?    [Derycke] We created an elite which was ready for democracy,  in accordance with the policy defined by the European Union.  Africa is not entirely a disaster, even if seven or eight  countries are still lagging behind on the question of freedoms.  The other donor countries must understand this, together with  the IMF and the World Bank. The socio-economic problems, the  poverty, are also factors which partly explain what is happening.    [Stroobants] Belgian cooperation will continue?    [Derycke] We are already providing humanitarian aid, as of  today. For the rest, it is clear that we must now consider the  situation and it is not going to start up again overnight. But  I cannot stand those who say ""It's all over, let them get on  with it."" Africa can be our principal partner. Improving the  life of the people of Africa can also bring benefits for us. I  myself am proud that Belgium is maintaining a policy of  cooperation. In 80 percent of the countries we aid, the policy  is a genuine success. [passage omitted]     "

0,FT932-5346 ,"FT932-5346 _AN-DFDB5ABTFT 930604   FT  04 JUN 93 / Supergun probe to contact Chilean arms man      By DAVID HELLIER and ALAN FRIEDMAN   THE SCOTT inquiry, investigating claims that the government colluded in the sale of weapons to Iraq in breach of its own guidelines, said yesterday that it would write to Mr Carlos Cardoen, the Chilean arms manufacturer, to see if he has relevant evidence. In an interview on BBC TV's Newsnight earlier this week Mr Cardoen said he would be willing to give evidence to the Scott inquiry but was worried about travelling outside Chile in case he was kidnapped by the US authorities. The Scott inquiry team feels it may get everything it needs from Mr Cardoen by letter and is unlikely to wish to visit him in Chile. Mr Cardoen was involved in the sale of weapons to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war and his company worked closely with Matrix Churchill, the Coventry-based machine tools company at the centre of Britain's arms to Iraq scandal. The Scott inquiry was set up in response to the uproar caused by the collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial. Charges of illegal exports against three executives were dropped when it emerged that the intelligence services had been briefed about their activities and that they had received encouragement for the exports from Mr Alan Clark, then trade minister. The US justice department has filed arms export charges against Mr Cardoen and Teledyne, a California defence contractor. The indictment concerns the alleged illegal export from the US to Chile between 1982 and 1989 of zirconium, a metal made by Teledyne. The metal was allegedly used by Mr Cardoen to make about 24,000 cluster bombs that were then sold to Iraq. Mr Cardoen has said that the Washington authorities knew about and granted approval for his arms exports to Iraq as part of a bias towards Iraq during the 1980s. His assertions that he regularly briefed CIA officials contradict previous statements by the Bush administration. Two years ago a joint investigation by the Financial Times and ABC TV found that Mr Cardoen had indeed had relationships with US intelligence officials. The Scott inquiry said anything Mr Cardoen may be able to contribute about the role of British government officials is likely to be relevant to questions later in the public hearings. The hearings began last month and are scheduled to continue at least until September.   Companies:-  Matrix Churchill.   Countries:-  CLZ  Chile, South America.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Speaking to IRNA at the opening ceremony of an international  oil and gas exhibition, Shafranik termed the exhibition as a  short step taken towards cooperation with oil-rich countries and  industrialized world. Shafranik said he was willing to discuss  oil and gas cooperation between Iran and Russia with an Iranian  delegation currently participating in the exhibition.    In his recent talks with Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Reza  Aqazadeh in Ashgabat, the need for mutual ties in the said  fields were stressed, the Russian minister noted.    The prospect for promotion of cooperation between the two  countries depends on Iran's interest in the issue, the Russian  minister said.    Iran's pavilion at the exhibition covers an area of 60  square  meters in which pictures of Iranian oil and gas facilities and  those of operations regarding capping of blazing oil fields and  laying pipe lines by Iranian experts are put on display.

At a symposium, the economists and entrepreneurs noted that  the trade value between China and Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand  and the Philippines last year exceeded one billion U.S. dollars,  an increase of 26 percent over the previous year.    In recent years, investment in China by Southeast Asian  countries has amounted to two billion U.S. dollars.    Meanwhile, in Southeast Asian countries, there are also  about  300 Chinese-funded enterprises with many construction projects.    They held that with the economic growth in the region,  economic cooperation between China and Southeast Asian countries  has broad prospects.    At the symposium held in Haikou City, the Chinese economists  and entrepreneurs established a commercial committee under the  China Society of Southeast Asian Studies.

The document, written by a senior official in the Middle Eastern department, confirmed that the Foreign Office knew that equipment to be exported by Matrix Churchill, the Iraqi-owned machine-tool manufacturer, could be used to make munitions. It advised that the arms embargo would not be broken. The shipment would not prolong the war since the Iraqis would use the tools as a substitute for Soviet supplies - a view disputed by the Ministry of Defence. However, urging secrecy, the document said that if the deliveries became public, they would have to stop. The document was produced during the Old Bailey trial of three former Matrix Churchill directors accused of deceiving the Department of Trade and Industry by pretending the equipment was for civil use. Mr Alan Clark, then a trade minister, also urged Matrix Churchill and other machine-tool makers to keep quiet about deals with Iraq, the court heard. Export licences for some of the company's exports were frozen after intelligence reports suggested they would be used for military purposes. Mr Clark met Mr Paul Henderson, the Matrix Churchill managing director and one of the defendants, and other representatives of the machine-tool industry in early 1988 to discuss the problems of restoring the licences. The licences were approved by ministers soon after. A minute of the meeting, read out in court, said Mr Clark told them press stories about the deals would jeopardise restoring the licences. When someone expressed concern that the Daily Telegraph was showing a close interest, Mr Clark said he would contact Mr Max Hastings, the editor, since he was a personal friend. Mr Henderson, Mr Trevor Abraham, a former Matrix Churchill commercial director, and Mr Peter Allen, a former sales director with the company, all deny breaching export regulations. The trial continues today.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

ROC Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang urged Australia to  support Taiwan in its bid to join the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as trade, investment and tourism  relations between Taiwan and Australia have been growing rapidly.    Some 4.8 million Taiwan tourists have visited Australia,  spending more than than US$8 billion while there, Chiang said.    In addition, Taiwan-Australia trade has been growing at a  rapid rate, Chiang said.    Chiang's Australian counterpart, Bob McMullan, agreed that  Taiwan is one of Australia's most important trading partners in  the Asia-Pacific and he believes that Taiwan should be a member  of the World Trade Organization, which will supersede GATT  before the end of this year.    McMullan added that he hopes Taiwan will gradually reduce  import tariffs -- especially those on fruit, automobiles, and  beef -- to meet the regulations set out in the GATT Uruguay  Round accord.

[ellipsis as published]. Five provinces and  autonomous regions from China's northwest region flung their  doors open to the outside world on an unprecedented scale. They  gave full play to their advantage of abundant natural resources;  comprehensively developed economic and technological cooperation  with other provinces and autonomous regions; introduced  investment from abroad and established economic relations with  other regions; learned from the experience of other regions for  their own development; made use of other regions' superiority to  make up for its own deficiency; and promoted the development of  the local economy.    The northwest regions of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia,  and Shaanxi are endowed with rich natural resources and have  long supplied a large amount of the resources and raw material  for the national economic construction. However, due to a weak  economic foundation, they were not effective at  self-development. With the deepening of reform of China's  economic system, and with the gradual lifting of prices of  resources and raw materials, these provinces and autonomous  regions--which in the past have relied on state subsidies and  mandatory production plans--have been forced one after another  to enter market competition. As a result, people in those  regions began to change their concepts and sought to open a new  path for development through extensive economic and  technological cooperation with other regions.    Advancing to the east and expanding to the west, reaching  out  to the north and descending to the south, introducing investment  from abroad and establishing economic ties with other regions in  China, and adopting an omni-directional opening up policy have  all become the common understanding of these provinces and  autonomous regions in developing the economy. So far they have  joined some ten regional cooperation organizations including the  Huanghe Economic and Technological Cooperation Zone, the  Northwest Economic and Technological Cooperation Zone, and the  Shaanxi-Gansu-Sichuan Economic Cooperation Zone. Last year  alone they concluded agreements with other regions on some  10,000 cooperation projects and on exchanges of goods worth over  two billion yuan. What is gratifying is that economic and  technological cooperation is not limited to project cooperation  and to exchange of commodities alone; they now involve joint  development. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region cooperated with  other regions to develop a cotton growing base; Gansu Province  jointly developed rare metal resources with other regions; and  Ningxia prepared to cooperate with other provinces to build a  power supply project. Funds from five provinces, autonomous  regions, and other regions for China's Huanghe Economic  Cooperation Zone Joint Stock Limited Company have initially been  put in place as scheduled. The operation of this company will  effectively help coordinate economic exchanges between various  provinces and regions as well as promote their development  through cooperation.    The five provinces and autonomous regions have changed their  passive stance and have begun to aggressively look for business  partners. Xinjiang concluded agreements of 2.1 billion and 1.7  billion yuan respectively from its holding of the ""Spark Trade  Fair"" and ""Urumqi Trade Fair"" in 1992. Last May, 2,044  contracts, agreements, and letters of intent worth 1.7 billion  yuan were signed at Shaanxi's Third Technological Results Fair.  At the same time, the five provinces and autonomous regions  have increased economic cooperation with coastal regions.  Qinghai Province entered into an economic cooperative  relationship with Shandong Province. They signed 51 projects on  introduction of funds, technological cooperation, and personnel  exchange, as well as 32 agreements on expanding friendly ties  during exchanges of leadership last year. They also carried out  1,700 personnel exchanges, with over 500 of these involving  cadres at or above county level and at or above department head  level. Qingdao Chemical Industry Institute has annually helped  train 50 specialized chemical industry personnel for Qinghai's  Haibei Prefecture during each of the last five years. Shaanxi,  Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Gansu have also exchanged cadres and work  experience with economically developed coastal regions. They  have broadened their economic vision and increased economic  cooperation projects through such kind of exchanges.     "

The spirit of the memorandum has so far been translated into a  comprehensive rural development project launched in Meuang Son  District, Sam Neua Province, aimed at reducing production and  trafficking in narcotic drugs. Since 1990, the Lao side's task  force has seized 905 kilos of opium, 155 metric tons of  marijuana, and over 34 kilos of heroin. Also, the Lao side  officially set up an office for the Committee for Control and  Suppression of Narcotic Drugs on 20 May 1994.    The U.S. delegation arrived in Laos for at noon on 7 June.     "

Einseln said one of the main purposes of his trip to Moscow,  where he had been invited by the Russian Defense Ministry, was  to ensure concrete cooperation at the final stage of Russian  troop withdrawal from Estonia. Russia earlier offered to pull  out all its troops by August 31 but linked this to the provision  of residence permits and social security measures for retired  Russian military officers living in Estonia.    Einseln plans to propose setting up a bilateral military  commission to quickly and efficiently deal with any troop  withdrawal problems.

According to the  contract, EPD, jointly with Japan Energy Economics Research  Institute (board chairperson: Mr. Toyoaki Ikuta), will cooperate  in drafting the power development plan in Vietnam. This is the  first cooperative effort with Vietnam in power-source  development. In the five years leading up to 1992, Vietnam's  power demand showed an average annual increase of 7.3 percent,  and the trend is expected to continue into the near future.  Therefore, the Vietnamese government had assigned priority to  the power-development project and had asked Japan for technical  assistance in the project.    EPD is to offer its assistance from December 1993 through  August 1995, during which time Vietnam's power-demand forecast  will be surveyed, a power-development plan for 1996 through 2010  will be drafted, and basic policies for executing the plan will  be examined. Vietnam's total power-generation-facility capacity  is estimated to be 3,057 megawatts, of which 54 percent is  generated by hydroelectric power.

Speaking to the visiting ESCAP executive secretary Raffi  Ad-Din Ahmad, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said the organization was  pursuing human and holy goals and therefore it was necessary for  all regional countries to strengthen their cooperation with  ESCAP in a bid to attain those goals.    Many of the goals the ESCAP is trying to attain are among  the  priorities in the economic development plan of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, he said.    The president said that connection of Iranian railway to  those of the Central Asian countries would prove effective in  boosting mutual economic and trade relations and in transiting  commodities from Central Asia to other countries via Iran.    The ESCAP chief briefed the president on some of the major  programs of the organization including upgrading economic  relations of developing countries, controlling the growth of  population and expanding communications via Iran and Pakistan  with west and west Asian countries [as received], ECO [Economic  Cooperation Organization] and ASEAN member states.    Holding a conference on women, expanding manpower and  tackling the issue of disability and treating the disabled are  among other goals of the economic and social commission for Asia  and the Pacific, he said.

Even before the ministers met  with Grachev in the evening, the ministers' talks mainly  concentrated on further developments of the alliance's relations  with Russia. Balanzino, the NATO deputy secretary general,  chaired the meeting, as Secretary General [Manfred] Woerner had  followed his doctor's advice not to participate.    Defense Minister Volker Ruehe spoke out clearly in favor of  offering Russia a ""partnership without adjectives"" such as  ""strategic,"" ""pragmatic,"" ""cooperative,"" or ""privileged."" As  Russia cannot become a member of NATO, the alliance must offer  it a comprehensive partnership within and outside the  Partnership for Peace that corresponds with its importance.  After the first round of talks in Brussels on Tuesday, Ruehe  reported that he agrees with U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry  that the alliance should enter into a general foreign and  security policy dialogue with Russia. The nuclear issues and  proliferation of nuclear weapons should not be discussed by the  United States and Russia alone in the future, but by Russia and  NATO as a whole. On relations between NATO and Russia, however,  Ruehe said it is out of the question to grant Russia a de facto  right to veto alliance resolutions, to allow Moscow to impede  NATO's capacity to act, or to subordinate the alliance to the  Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).  ""Cooperative relations of partnership within and outside of  Partnership for Peace are the key to security and stability in  Europe,"" Ruehe said. Russia must be treated as a great power  and a partner, but it must gain its neighbors' confidence by  itself, whether they be ""distant"" or ""near"" neighbors. This  requires acknowledging their sovereignty and the inviolability  of their borders. It is NATO's task to give Russia as much help  as it can in a difficult situation. But the Atlantic alliance  must watch out for false partners.    Ruehe recommended that it should be made clear to Russia  that  its participation in the Partnership for Peace is important.  Moscow should sign the framework agreement without additional  conditions or changes. This includes the willingness to aim at  a comprehensive cooperation between NATO troops and the Russian  Armed Forces. The practical part of the Partnership for Peace  is to focus on promoting military cooperation. Even if it is  given the same status as the other partners, Russia has the  possibility to acquire a position that corresponds with its  size, importance, and potential. Outside the Partnership for  Peace, relations should focus on the dialogue on political and  strategic issues. In this connection it is important that the  dialogue between NATO and Russia is transparent. If this is  safeguarded, it will be possible to convince the partners in  Central and East Europe of the importance of cooperating with  Russia. [passage omitted]     "

President Taya also said that since Mauritania is very  rich in mineral resources, China may take part in their  exploration and development.    Mauritanian Premier Boubaker also met with Zhu Xun and his  party on the same day. Boubaker said since friendly cooperation  between Mauritania and China has played an important role in  Mauritania's development, he hoped for the constant development  of such cooperation. He added that Mauritania places great hope  on cooperation with China in the area of geology and mineral  resources.    Minister Zhu Xun's 2-6 April official visit to Mauritania  was  effected at the invitation of Mohamed Fall, minister of mines  and industry of Mauritania. Prior to the conclusion of Zhu  Xun's visit, China and Mauritania signed a scientific,  technological, and economic cooperation agreement in the sphere  of geology and mineral resources.     "

0,FT943-7512 ,"FT943-7512 _AN-EHWDLAB0FT 940823   FT  23 AUG 94 / Labour attacks supergun 'scandal'      By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent   Labour yesterday launched an attack on government moves to disqualify six directors of Astra Holdings, the collapsed munitions company involved in the Iraqi 'supergun' affair. Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow open government minister, said the Department of Trade and Industry's treatment of the directors was 'a significant piece of the cover-up over arms to Iraq'. He said it was 'a grade-one scandal'. The DTI launched disqualification proceedings this month, nearly a year after seven Astra directors were criticised in a DTI inspectors' report on the company's Pounds 22m acquisition in 1989 of PRB, a Belgian defence company. Astra, which is in receivership, became involved in the 'supergun' affair after discovering that PRB had a contract to supply propellant. Customs officers blocked the project by seizing giant steel tubes in 1990. The DTI report criticised the directors for continuing with the PRB acquisition in spite of warnings from advisers about PRB's financial condition. They were also criticised for misleading shareholders about Astra's financial situation. Mr Meacher yesterday wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, claiming that the proposed disqualifications were 'a shabby and sordid political vendetta'. He said the move was 'designed to intimidate and discredit the former Astra directors because of what they have revealed about the secret and illicit arms trade with Iraq and the government's connivance in it'. He added that the government wanted Astra closed because the directors had discovered that subsidiaries it had purchased were being used, with the connivance of the government, for the illegal export of arms to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. Mr Meacher said the political motives behind the government's actions were 'clearly revealed' by the exclusion from the disqualification list of Mr Stephan Kock, an Astra director with links to the security services. Mr Kock was criticised by the DTI report, but the department said there was insufficient evidence to justify disqualification. Mr Meacher said it was 'obvious' that he had been excluded because of his 'close links' with the security services. Mr Meacher also criticised the government for failing to reply to a parliamentary question tabled six weeks ago asking when Mr Kock had acquired British nationality, and which government department intervened with the police in Argyll, Strathclyde, after he fired an automatic pistol at two motorists in January 1990. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a junior defence minister, promised a month ago to write to Mr Meacher, but has not done so.   Companies:-  Astra Holdings.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

We  oppose the export of internal problems of separate countries,  Greek Minister of Macedonia and Thrace Dr. Konstandinos  Triaridhis told Bulgarian journalists in Thessaloniki on May 24.  He stressed the need for the promotion of Bulgarian-Greek  economic cooperation, including the establishment of new  transport links. The meeting coincided with the visit by  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov in Athens.    Dr. Triaridhis said the ministry in his charge implemented  the policy of the Greek Government. He elaborated on Greek  views on development in the Balkans. According to him, all  countries in the regions, including Greece, have their share of  problems. Greece is a member of the European Union whereas  other Balkan states, including Bulgaria, would like to join in,  and integrate into European structures. Greece would like to  help those countries, from which it would benefit itself.  Hopefully, these Balkan states will have made progress in some  ten years, including Albania and Skopje, said the Greek  minister. Greece is trying to help cope with difficulties, he  said.    He said Greece is glad about meetings such as that with  Minister Daskalov. But it also would like to see livelier  contacts among non-governmental bodies, among journalists,  business and ordinary people. He cited recent meetings in Varna  and Khaskovo. According to Triaridhis, the strengthening of  economic cooperation in the Balkans and especially between  Bulgaria and Greece can benefit integration between the Middle  East and Central Europe.    Dr. Triaridhis elaborated on the Greek stand on Skopje. He  said that if Skopje leaders show willingness for dialogue in the  Balkans, Greece was ready to lift the embargo today, not  tomorrow, but Greece could not tolerate manifestations of  fanaticism in Skopje. According to him, these manifestations can  create problems for Blagoevgrad and Sofia, and involve Greece  and Albania, too. Greece opposed a time bomb that might explode  in some five years. The Skopje problem is a problem for the  Balkans, said Triaridhis. According to him, it is a paradox that  Bulgaria, which is in the same situation as Greece, supports the  name of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia].    The Greek minister stressed that the war in Bosnia should  end  as soon as possible. Involvement by Turkey, Albania and others  would only aggravate it. He also commented on the long-lasting  embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and  Montenegro) which has severely hit Greece and Bulgaria.  According to him, it is very bad that Balkan countries let  foreigners manage the situation is the Balkans.    The Greek minister focused on major guidelines for the  development of Macedonia and Thrace, that concern not only  Greece but can have a positive impact in other Balkan countries,  especially Bulgaria and Albania. According to him, this is of  interest to the Bulgarian Government. Dr Triaridhis said there  were no minorities in Macedonia and Thrace but religious  communities that have all the rights and obligations of Greek  citizens.     "

This was disclosed by a source at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] on 6 April. The government  plans to display Japan's attitude in making international  contribution by providing its utmost ""assistance for  reconstruction work"" to the African nation. This will be the  second full-fledged ODA to a country, in which the SDF is  engaged in PKO activities, after Cambodia. Japan plans to  provide tens of millions of dollars to Mozambique, though the  amount is less than a total of $300 million given to Cambodia  for its reconstruction work. While a MOFA survey team has  already arrived in Mozambique, together with survey teams from  European countries and the United States, the government intends  to promote the plan in a concrete manner to lead other nations.  Moreover, the government plans to positively help Mozambique  smoothly conduct its general elections scheduled for October,  and it has begun studying a plan to send an election-monitoring  team based on the PKO Cooperation Law.    Since Japan regards the southern Africa region as an area to  which great emphasis in its ODA programs should be attached, it  has decided to provide aid to Mozambique. From now on, the  government intends to extend ODA to the peripheral region,  including South Africa, which will be newly born following a  constituent assembly election.    SDF members have been dispatched in rotation to Mozambique  since last May, and 53 members are currently engaged in duties  there. Moreover, Japan provided Mozambique with approximately  $200 million through bilateral assistance centering on food  supply and acceptance of trainees (between 1988 and 1992).  However, because the government army and the antigovernment  army have been smoothly conducting disarmament under the  monitoring of the UN peacekeeping operations in Mozambique  (ONUMOZ), a focal point of construction work has now shifted to  improvement of infrastructure in the country. For this reason,  Mozambique is now waiting for assistance from foreign nations.    Under these circumstances, the government has sent to the  country a survey team headed by Mitsugu Saito, chief of the  Development Cooperation Division under MOFA's Economic  Cooperation Bureau, saying: ""More positive ODA will be  necessary from now on. If soldiers, who will lose their job,  have no place to go after disarmament is completed, all efforts  will come to nothing,"" (according to a MOFA source). The  government intends to hold the final consultations on working  out possible cooperation, including improvement of social  infrastructure and technical assistance after the survey team's  return home set for 15 April. Among possible projects are: road  repairs; the improvement of water supply and drainage; and  assistance for the electric power industry. While Japan  provided aid to Cambodia as a partner in the Asian region, ODA  to Mozambique is believed to ""have an epoch-making significance  as Japan's visible assistance for reconstruction in Africa,  which is far from Japan"" (as stated by a government source).

They also decided to open a working-level meeting headed by  division director-level officials from Korea's Trade, Industry  and Energy Ministry and Japan's International Trade and Industry  Ministry.    Through the meeting, the two governments aim to spur  standardization, joint research, technology cooperation and  personnel education in the multi-media sector.

But his propaganda machine left the main point of interest and the reason of Sunday's attack a mystery. Three sites hit by missiles have been confirmed: the lobby of the Rashid hotel in Baghdad was badly damaged, a house in the suburb of Karada was half-demolished and a factory in Zafaraniya, 10 miles south of Baghdad and the announced target of the allied attack, was hit. Western journalists, despite being escorted to the two civilian sites, were denied access to the factory at Zafaraniya. Described as a nuclear site by the allies and a facility for manufacturing industrial equipment by the Iraqis, an army official prevented an organised Ministry of Information tour of the site, despite the fact it had been viewed by some journalists immediately after the bombing. 'Yesterday was one day, today is another, he said. The government took advantage of the high-profile Rashid bombing by holding a funeral for the two people who were killed in the hotel. Escorted by a ceremonial army brass band, a large group of dignitaries, hotel staff and mourning relatives, the coffins of Ameriha Toma, a receptionist at the hotel, and a female guest were marched to a burial site to the accompaniment of a funeral dirge. Soon afterwards, more than 1,000 delegates at the Sixth Islamic Conference, who were removed to another hotel after the bombing last night, descended on the hotel to conduct the day's proceedings, and Rashid staff attempted to convey a sense of business as usual. It was the same all over Baghdad. Iraq has been under seige in military and economic terms almost continually since the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980; coping in tragic circumstances has become a way of life. However, a sense of despair was apparent after Sunday's attack, and disbelief that the capital was once again under fire from the allies. At the Karada site, where one woman was killed and her two daughters injured when their house was hit by a missile, Dr Mohammad Dowee, a military doctor and neighbour whose three daughters were injured by shattering glass, accused the allies of not caring about Iraqi civilians. 'If people (in the west) saw the exact picture, they wouldn't agree with what happened here. Killing ordinary Iraqis will not help enforce their demands,' he said.

Extremely toxic even when inhaled in relatively small amounts, chemical weapons  unleash devastating effects ranging from severe eye, lung and skin burns to  virtually immediate death.    Ironically, such weapons, which include nerve agents, cyanide and mustard gas,  can be easily concocted in a makeshift laboratory using formulas from a  chemistry textbook. Also, the dramatic effectiveness of chemical weaponry makes  it almost impossible to effectively defend against, said Dr. Jane Orient, an  internist at the University of Arizona.    Iraq is generally believed to have used nerve agents and mustard gas during the  last years of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and against Kurds in northern Iraq.    Mustard gas can burn and blisters whatever it touches, said Gregory A.  Thompson, director of the Drug Information Service at the USC Medical Center.

Extremely toxic even when inhaled in relatively small amounts, chemical weapons  unleash devastating effects ranging from severe eye, lung and skin burns to  virtually immediate death.    Ironically, such weapons, which include nerve agents, cyanide and mustard gas,  can be easily concocted in a makeshift laboratory using formulas from a  chemistry textbook. Also, the dramatic effectiveness of chemical weaponry makes  it almost impossible to effectively defend against, said Dr. Jane Orient, an  internist at the University of Arizona.    Iraq is generally believed to have used nerve agents and mustard gas during the  last years of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and against Kurds in northern Iraq.    Mustard gas can burn and blisters whatever it touches, said Gregory A.  Thompson, director of the Drug Information Service at the USC Medical Center.  When inhaled in large enough quantities, however, it can cause death within 24  to 48 hours.    Victims' blistered lungs fill with fluid and they essentially drown, he  explained.

In an interview with the weekly KAYHAN HAVAI, Sergey  Tretyakov said an agreement had been reached with Iran ``in  principle'' to set up the plant in Bushehr on the Gulf, and to  complete another left unfinished by a German company.    ``Despite opposition from Washington, we are determined to  go  ahead with the project,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We have an  independent policy with respect to Iran.''    Tretyakov said negotiations were underway and the project  would be implemented only if ``financial problems are sorted  out,'' but he did not clarify what the problems were.    Diplomats here said Iran, faced with a serious cash crisis,  had asked Moscow to finance the project, but Russia had refused,  due to its own economic problems.    Discussions between Iran and Russia have been going on for  more than a year over the purchase of two 440-megawatt  VVER-440-213 nuclear reactors for the new plant.    The German corporation Siemens launched the project when the  late shah was in power, but broke off work during the Islamic  revolution and the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.    The cost of the project has been put at 3.7 billion dollars.    Iran has repeatedly called for work to resume but the German  government has refused, amid concerns that it could be accused  of aiding nuclear proliferation in a country suspected by the  West of aiming to build nuclear weapons.    The possibility of Russian involvement in finishing the  plant, which is 80 percent complete, was discussed during a trip  to Moscow by an Iranian delegation in the summer, Tretyakov said  in an interview with the daily ABRAR in August.    Iran and Russia signed an accord on civil nuclear  cooperation  earlier this year, but did not disclose details of the agreement.    During a visit here in March, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey  Kozyrev said such cooperation would take place within the  regulations set by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and  under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA).    Tehran has repeatedly accused Western countries, notably the  United States, of preventing it from obtaining nuclear  technology for civilian purposes.    In February, Iran also signed an accord with China for the  purchase of two 300-megawatt nuclear reactors for non-military  use. The project with Beijing has also been delayed because of  financial problems, according to Chinese diplomats in Tehran.     "

Russia's Military  Industrial Complex Hopes To Cooperate With Turkey's]    [Text] On 20 April Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan  and his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev signed an  intergovernment agreement On Cooperation on Military and  Technical Matters and in the Sphere of Defense Industry. The  document does not envision any specific transactions or  programs. It is a framework agreement that provides legal  underpinnings for cooperation.    In February, during a visit to Moscow by French Defense  Minister Leotard, Russia signed the first such agreement with a  NATO member country. The agreement with Turkey, however,  according to First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, is  broader because, as follows from its title, it also provides for  direct cooperation between the two countries' defense industries.    Competent sources in the Russian Federation Defense Ministry  say that the Turks are interested in gaining access to some  modern Russian technology in the area of creating armored  hardware, rotary-wing aircraft, and aviation. At the same time,  Russia would like to borrow from Turkish know-how for the  benefit of the most backward sector of its military industrial  complex -- the electronics industry. For the last eight to 10  years Turkey has managed (mainly by using Western technology  obtained within the NATO framework) to achieve fairly modern  standards in military communication means and some other fields.    Combining Turkish electronic software with Russian hardware  appears quite a promising idea. The end product may prove  competitive, especially in ""Third World"" countries.  Furthermore, Turkey has the largest army among NATO European  member states, and therefore is itself a serious arms market.  Ankara is ready today to buy Russian helicopters and armored  personnel carriers because the Turkish Army is constantly  engaged in combat operations in the east of the republic, in  Kurdish areas, and needs a constant inflow of new equipment.    The Turkish defense minister said that ""our good-neighborly  relations have grown into friendship, including between armies.""  Yet not everything is that cloudless. Moscow is persistently  urging a revision of the flank quotas (the numerical limitations  on heavy weapons of the Russian Army and Internal Affairs  Ministry troops in the Caucasus and in the Leningrad Military  District), envisioned under the 1990 Paris (CFE) Treaty and the  1992 Tashkent Treaty. The unstable situation in the Northern  Caucasus and the Transcaucasus has compelled Moscow to reinforce  its troop grouping in the region but Turkey, rather sharply,  blocked all attempts to have the quotas revised. In the  Northern Caucasus and the Transcaucasus Moscow's and Ankara's  strategic interests have often clashed in the past two years.  The idea of creating a chain of permanent Russian military  bases along the former Soviet-Turkish border is not evoking any  enthusiasm in Turkey either.    On 24 April, during ""one to one"" talks between the Turkish  minister and General Grachev, the quota problem will apparently  be discussed in earnest, but the possibility of a compromise  being reached does not look too realistic so far. The flank  quotas under the CFE Treaty are to take effect in 1995: Not  much time is left. The good-neighborly cooperation between the  two military industrial complexes could be scaled down having  barely started.     "

The Tokyo Workshop on Cooperation for the Conservation of  Biological Diversity in Asia brought together about 70 people,  representing the World Bank, the United Nations Environment  Program, the governments of Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and the  Philippines, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).    In a closing statement to the gathering, the workshop  president, Taishichiro Sato of the Japan Wildlife Research  Center, said the participants had decided to promote the  development of knowledge and specialized technology for the  preservation of biodiversity in Asia.    Sato said they also expressed a desire to encourage more  local bodies to participate in biodiversity conservation and to  encourage more efficient data collection and sharing so that  development decisions can be made without compromising the  region's biodiversity.    The gathering was organized by the Environment Agency of  Japan and the Japan Wildlife Research Center.    Colin Rees, head of the Land, Water and Natural Habitats  Department within the World Bank, said the technology to ensure  biodiversity is maintained is still inadequate.    Rees called on Japan to foster more people able to preserve  biodiversity in its other agencies and ministries and not just  within the Environment Agency.    Representatives from the Foreign Ministry, Japan  International Cooperation Agency and the Japan branch of the  World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) also attended the meeting.     "

Stuck on the two controversial issues of  trade in nuclear materials and foreign banking access in Russia,  negotiations have scarcely progressed since December.    Although both sides had been confident that the Agreement  could be successfully concluded before the visit of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin to Brussels on December 9, it emerged  that significant problems remained with trade in nuclear fuel  and the Russian banking sector. Since then, experts from both  sides have attempted to tackle the core of these issues but to  no avail. One Russian diplomatic source was very pessimistic  for the future of the talks, arguing that it was unlikely that  agreement would be reached before the end of March, threatening  a further extension of negotiations into April.    Trade in Nuclear Fuel    The problems surrounding trade in nuclear materials between  Russia and the EU countries focus on a draft separate agreement  negotiated at an earlier date with the Russians in the framework  of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). This draft  agreement has been rejected by the Russians who want trade in  nuclear products integrated into the Partnership and Cooperation  Agreement. The Europeans argue that it is crucial to maintain  specific regimes on price levels and traded volumes, etc., in  the nuclear domain and, as such, the issue must be resolved  within a EURATOM accord. In response, the Russians produced new  proposals at the end of January outlining their plans for  integrating nuclear trade into the Partnership Agreement. The  Commission rejected several of the ideas as unclear and  contradictory, but is still examining them. Nevertheless,  according to one Commission source, it is ""highly unlikely"" to  give a positive response.    Banking Block    The other stumbling block concerns the controversy over  foreign banking facilities. In recent weeks, the Russians have  limited the possibilities for foreign banks to operate in their  territory, while a tentative agreement on the level of activity  of European banks in Russia had already been reached.  Nevertheless, the new law considerably limits the activities of  foreign banks operating in Russia by restricting their  activities to transactions with nonresidents only. Even this  means of operating will only be allowed to continue until  January 1996. Moreover, only those banks with existing links  with Russian residents before November 15, 1993 will be allowed  to stay in business.    The European Union, for its part, is prepared to limit  foreign banking activity in Russia, but on the basis of other,  less demanding, conditions. It is prepared to prevent the  establishment of any new branches of foreign banks on Russian  territory and to limit deposits to those over ECU100,000 which  would concentrate foreign bank activity on large-scale  enterprises. Furthermore, the EU would outlaw transactions on  privatisation shares and Russian bonds while granting a licence  to those foreign banks already established in Russia to allow  them to continue operating.

0,FT932-11249 ,"FT932-11249 _AN-DEECIAD8FT 930505   FT  05 MAY 93 / Guidelines on defence sales kept from MPs for a year      By JIMMY BURNS   OFFICIAL guidelines governing the export of defence-related equipment to Iran and Iraq were kept from parliament for almost a year, it emerged yesterday. The arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard that ministers decided in 1984 that details of new guidelines should only be allowed to 'trickle out' to parliament to minimise any disruption to trade with Iraq and relations generally with the Arab world. That decision was revealed on the first day of public hearings in the inquiry which was prompted by the collapse of the Matrix-Churchill case in which three former directors of the company were accused of illegally trying to export arms-making equipment to Iraq. The inquiry was set up to investigate whether official guidelines were breached with the knowledge or complicity of the government. In a forceful exchange, Lord Justice Scott, who is heading the inquiry, asked a former senior Foreign Office official whether he thought it right that official guidelines governing defence-related sales to Iraq and Iran should have been kept from parliament for nearly a year. Mr Stephen Day, a former head of the Foreign Office's Middle East desk, denied that he had received any instructions that policy should be kept secret. But he confirmed that a decision had been taken by ministers in November 1984 that new guidelines governing exports to Iran and Iraq should be revealed only incrementally to parliament. The guidelines, which restricted the export of defence equipment that might significantly enhance or exacerbate the Iran-Iraq war, were drawn up after the foreign office expressed concern about the amount of defence-related UK material reaching the Gulf. The inquiry heard that a recommendation by Sir Richard Luce, then foreign office minister of state, that the new guidelines should be announced 'robustly and positively' to the House of Commons and in briefings to the media was never adopted. Instead, the guidelines were announced in stages in response to parliamentary questions between April and October 1985. Earlier, Sir Richard said his department had found it increasingly difficult to defend an unannounced policy in the early 1980s that only 'non-lethal equipment' could be sold to Iran and Iraq. His view was that the guidelines needed to be made more restrictive as they were open to abuse. 'We found this a grey area . . . different ministers could form different opinions about what was lethal and what was not lethal,' he said. Without being drawn on specific examples, Sir Richard said that if policy differences were not resolved between departments, it was the then prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who took the final decision.

Soskovets regards the petroleum and gas industry as one of  the most promising areas of Russo-Turkish cooperation. He moved  to set up an international consortium for building a pipeline  between Russia and Turkey with the participation of Azerbaijan,  Kazakhstan and Armenia. He said that Russia had efficient  technologies for the production of pipes and could help train  highly skilled specialists.    Taking into account Russia's rich experience in power  engineering, Soskovets offered the Turkish side to build a new  atomic power plant in Turkey. ""Russian nuclear power plants  have dependable safety systems,"" he said. ""Moreover, they are  much cheaper than the world prices"".    Kumbaracibasi went on record for the construction of a new  pipeline for transporting petroleum from the former USSR to  Turkey. He said this would partially help solve the problem of  the passage of tankers through the Bosphorus.    Russian Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Oleg  Davydov,  who took part in the talks, drew the Turkish delegation's  attention to the ""prospects of cooperation in marketing Russian  special technologies"". He said a 95 million U.S. dollars  contract had already been concluded. ""This will help Russia  settle its debt to Turkey in the Paris Club within three years,""  he stressed.     "

Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, inquiry counsel, said yesterday: 'Papers we have seen show that by 1985 there was government knowledge that Jordan was being used as a diversionary route for military equipment to Iraq.' Under government guidelines at the time, during the Iran-Iraq war, no equipment which might prolong the conflict should have been exported to either combatant. The revelation at the start of the second week of public hearings in the Scott inquiry raises potentially embarrassing questions about a deal that involved government ministers, and a secretive government-owned company. Government documents held by the inquiry team show that in September 1985, the government signed a memorandum of understanding between the UK and Jordan. This was later to result in a Pounds 270m defence package which was arranged by International Military Services (IMS), a defence company wholly owned at the time by the Ministry of Defence. In response to questions in parliament, both Mr John Major and Mrs Thatcher, when prime minister, have in the past refused to comment on IMS on grounds of commercial confidentiality. Miss Baxendale referred to previously restricted MoD documents which show that IMS was criticised by two defence officials in July 1985 for allegedly attempting to evade the guidelines. The criticism referred to a contract for armoured recovery vehicle spare parts to Iraq which were instead used to supply tanks. The inquiry also heard evidence yesterday from Sir Adam Butler, minister for defence procurement between September 1984 and September 1985. Questioned about government knowledge of Jordanian diversion of military equipment and of the internal criticism of IMS, Sir Adam said he had no personal knowledge of either, although he accepted that his post made him responsible for IMS's conduct as a company. The inquiry, headed by Lord Justice Scott, was set up in November in response to public controversy surrounding the collapse of the Matrix-Churchill case in which three former directors of the machine tools company had been accused of illegally trying to export arms-making equipment to Iraq. The inquiry is investigating whether official guidelines were breached with the knowledge or complicity of the government. The inquiry next Monday will take evidence from Sir Hal Miller, a former leading Conservative backbencher who in April 1990 revealed that he had warned the government about Iraq's supergun two years before parts for it were seized by UK customs officers.

Giving evidence to the Scott inquiry into defence sales to Iraq, Mr Mark Higson, a former desk officer for Iraq at the Foreign Office, said that before the end of 1988 the government started operating two different sets of guidelines on arms sales to Iran and Iraq. Foreign Office and trade ministers relaxed the strict guidelines towards Iraq in order to win lucrative arms deals while insisting in public that the guidelines were still being operated impartially. 'There would have been trouble from the public and MPs if we had announced publicly that there had been a relaxation in favour of Iraq,' said Mr Higson, who left the civil service, partly because of his disagreement with the way that policy was being applied. He said the sham policy was 'churned out' time and again for MPs and the public, even on one occasion in a letter from Sir Geoffrey Howe, then foreign secretary. Mr Higson, who drafted the reply on the foreign secretary's behalf in June 1989, said the letter had not been a truthful answer to a query from Mr Peter Shore, the Labour MP, because it did not reflect the policy being applied at the time. Miss Presiley Baxendale, counsel for Lord Justice Scott, said of the Howe letter: 'It is misleading and not a truthful answer to Peter Shore's letter?' Mr Higson replied: 'Yes.' His obligation had been 100 per cent to the Foreign Office, he said, and he had maintained the sham policy regardless. 'It was my duty,' he said. The government had considered Iraq 'the big prize' when the Iran-Iraq war ended, he said. This was recognised by Mr William Waldegrave, then a junior minister at the Foreign Office, in a note he wrote on a departmental memo in October 1989. He wrote: 'I doubt if there is any future market of such a scale anywhere where the UK is potentially so well placed if we play our diplomatic hand correctly . . . We must not allow it to go to the French, Germans, Japanese, Koreans etc.' In recommending that the foreign secretary visit Iraq at the earliest opportunity, Mr Waldegrave added: 'A few more Bazofts and another bout of internal repression will make things more difficult.' The minister was referring to Mr Farzad Bazoft, an Observer newspaper journalist who was executed after being arrested in Iraq on spying charges.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Through the New Europe Fund, the  Flemish Government invested 200 million Belgian francs in  cooperation projects with Poland. The talks were concluded last  month. The treaty covers virtually all fields which fall within  the Flemish Parliament's competence. It deals with the  development of the SME [small- and medium-sized companies]  sector, with professional training and labor relations, with  evolutions in the field of environment, and with culture.    The draft treaty will be submitted to the federal  government,  which will verify within 30 days whether or not the treaty goes  against federal powers. No one is expecting any problems, even  though it is no secret that the Belgian foreign minister is not  at all pleased with the phenomenon that regions are going  ""offshore"" in an increasingly independent way.    After that, nothing else will stand in the way of the  treaty's signature, which is scheduled for 6 or 7 June in the  Polish capital. Then the Flemish Council will have to approve  it. Only then will the Flemish-Polish treaty be ratified and  have international force of law.     "

The foreign ministry revealed it had informed the Iranian  authorities at the beginning of January that 21 of its 26  diplomats here had two months to leave.    The official reason was that Jordan wanted to achieve more  of  a balance between the number of diplomats in each country, as  Jordan has only two in Tehran, and there is no Iranian community  here.    However, political sources said the government ordered out  the Iranians because of their contacts with Islamic  fundamentalists, who are suspected of carrying out two recent  bomb attacks on sex cinemas which injured nine people.    The main fundamentalist party, the Islamic Action Front,  condemned the first cinema blast, in Amman last month, but  called for tighter legislation to implement a ban on sex films.    The sources said Jordan had proof that the embassy was  financing the fundamentalists, and the authorities had accused  the Iranian ambassador of having interfered in parliamentary  elections in November.    Western diplomats told AFP the ambassador, Ahmad  Dastmalchian, was formerly a member of the revolutionary guards  and played a major role in setting up the pro-Iranian Hizballah  guerrilla movement in Lebanon. He refused to make any comment.    Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the Middle East peace  process suffered a setback in the elections, in which candidates  close to King Husayn won 59 out of the 80 seats in the lower  house of parliament, guaranteeing that any peace treaty with  Israel would be ratified.    The fundamentalists kept only 18 of the 30 seats they held  in  the previous, non-party assembly elected in 1989.    Jordan and Iran resumed diplomatic relations in January 1991  after a 10-year break. Tehran broke off ties because of Amman's  support for Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988.    The Iranian embassy in Amman reopened in March 1991 and  Jordan's embassy in Tehran soon after.    On Saturday the first secretary at the Jordanian embassy in  Lebanon, Na'ib 'Umran Ma'ayitah, was shot dead in Beirut.    The killing came almost a week after King Husayn said in  Washington that he hoped to meet Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin to boost chances of peace.    The Jordanian Ambassador in Beirut, Fakhri Abu-Talib, said  the attack was ""aimed at the (peace) process in which Jordan is  involved, as well as Lebanon's efforts to restore stability and  order.""    Ma'ayitah was the first foreign official to be killed in  Beirut since the civil war ended in 1990.     "

Mr Clark, who was serving at the Department of Trade and Industry at the time before moving to the Ministry of Defence, also admitted that he advised Matrix Churchill and other British toolmakers exporting machines capable of making arms to draw up specifications emphasising their peaceful, rather than military, applications. However, he denied that that showed companies how best to circumvent government guidelines on arms exports to Iraq. Mr Clark said he thought the government's guidelines were 'tiresome and intrusive' and that it was in Britain's best interests for the Iran-Iraq war to continue as long as possible. The former minister was giving evidence in the trial of three former directors of Matrix Churchill, the Coventry machine tool company, who are accused of deceiving DTI by pretending that equipment exported to Iraq was for civil, not military, use. Mr Paul Henderson, the company's former managing director, Mr Trevor Abraham, its former commercial director, and Mr Peter Allen, the former sales director, all deny breaching export regulations. In January 1988 Mr Clark met a number of representatives of the British machine tool industry, including Mr Henderson, who were concerned that the DTI had frozen their export licences after earlier shipments had been suspected by intelligence services of going to Iraqi munitions factories. Mr Clark told them to draw up specifications with their customers that emphasised peaceful rather than military purposes. When something was capable of dual use, the use that was within government guidelines should be emphasised, Mr Clark told the court. The suggestion involved 'our old friend 'economical'', he admitted to Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Mr Henderson. 'Economical with the truth?', Mr Robertson responded. 'With the actualite,' Mr Clark replied. It was not misleading or dishonest to have made such a suggestion and did not amount to a tip-off he said. It was, however, a case of 'Whitehall cosmetics' to keep the records ambiguous, he agreed. Mr Clark agreed that intelligence reports were confused over whether the machine tools could be used to make munitions. The trial continues today.  The Financial Times   London Page 11  "

According to the minister, the politicians had an open  exchange of opinions, but on some issues the dialogue was rather  tough. Among such issues, Povilas Gylys mentioned at a news  conference on Monday Russia's stance on the new partners of the  West European Union. According to the minister, the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council intended to welcome the granting of  the status of partners of the West European Union to nine  Central European countries, including the Baltic states.  However, under Russian pressure, it limited itself to  mentioning this fact in the final communique of the meeting.    Povilas Gylys said that a strong and negative reaction by  some participants in the meeting was provoked by Russia's hints  about a possible revision of the treaty on the reduction of  conventional arms in Europe. Russia endeavors to link the  demilitarization of the Kaliningrad region with the possibility  of maintaining larger armed forces on its northern and southern  borders. This was categorically opposed by Turkey.    Minister Povilas Gylys stated at the news conference that  Lithuania is interested in the demilitarization of Kaliningrad,  but at the same time understands the importance of the treaty on  the reduction of conventional arms in Europe. Lithuania cannot  be excluded from the European context, Povilas Gylys stated,  adding that it would not be practical to maintain that Lithuania  can influence that process.     "

""The willingness was repeatedly expressed when central bank  governors of major Southeast Asian countries met here earlier  this week,"" Shieh said.    The participants, he stressed, had been deeply impressed by  Taiwan's dynamic economy during three days of discussions.    Central bank governors from the forums's nine member states  -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,  Sri Lanka, South Korea, Nepal and the host ROC -- participated  in the discussions April 6-8 about how to promote regional  financial cooperation. Cambodia, Fiji, Laos, and Tonga also  attended the event as observers.    With the economic and trade ties between Taiwan and  Southeast  Asian countries growing closer, strengthening of financial  cooperation is necessary, Shieh said.    As to complaints of financial investment barriers set by  Southeast Asian countries, he said those countries are already  pushing for the easing of restrictions on the establishment of  branches by foreign banks.    ROC investment in Southeast Asia totals around US$16.5  billion, making Taiwan a major capital supplier to the region.    The central bank governors exchanged views on topics ranging  from international currency cooperation, world economic reports,  currency policies of the countries in the region, foreign  exchange management and financial outlooks.

Negotiations between the governments over the contracts are referred to in a July 1990 government briefing document prepared when ministers were considering relaxing the 1984 export guidelines that prohibited approval of defence equipment exports to Iraq or Iran while they were at war. The document - released during the Matrix Churchill trial - says dropping the guidelines would be 'a very useful factor in the negotiations enabling the further release of items the Iranians have already paid for and with the possibility of at least limited resupply likely to affect Iranian attitudes'. The document says that if the negotiations with Iran 'go badly and the Iranians force us to arbitration, it could cost us up to Pounds 200m or more'. The Iranian deal was handled almost entirely by International Military Services, the government defence sales company. The company's shares are vested with the Ministry of Defence but the MoD gives it almost autonomous status. The MoD refers inquiries about IMS to the company, which does not respond to press inquiries. The MoD confirmed talks were continuing and said the matter was in IMS's hands. Throughout the Iran-Iraq war IMS maintained an office in Tehran and another in Amman in Jordan, which maintained close military co-operation with Iraq. The Iranian Military Procurement Office in London stayed open until September 1987 in spite of evidence that Iran was conducting a worldwide arms buying network from there. The office was opened in 1982 and worked actively until it was closed, according to officials of the National Iranian Oil Company, whose building the procurement office used. Officials said contracts handled by the office between 1982 and 1987 included British-made military spare parts. Officials said the office's activity was curtailed only in response to political pressure. 'The government knew 100 per cent what was going on here,' said one. In answer to a parliamentary question last week Mr Douglas Hogg, Foreign Office minister, denied the government had given approval for the procurement office to be reopened in the UK.

Established in 1958 in a remote part of southwest China's  Yunnan Province, and known as ""the kingdom of plants"", the  nature reserve is made up of five linked reserves with a total  area of 240,000 ha.    Specially designed to protect the local ecosystem of  primeval  forests, and rare animals and plants, the reserve boasts 4,000  kinds of tropical forest and rain forest. So far, a total of  341 wild plants are cultivated in the reserve, 52 of which are  under special protection from the central government.    In addition, 99 wild animals in the reserve are under top  protection from the Chinese Government.

In.: ""Fight Against International Drug  Traffic: France and Morocco Adopt a Drug Cooperation Program""]    [Text] The fourth leading exporter of cannabis resin  worldwide, Morocco remains the main supplier of hashish imported  into France. Faced with this unpleasant economic fact  (unpleasant for King Hassan II's allies), late last week Paris  and Rabat adopted a cooperation program to fight drugs.    The joint action plan, which reflects the Moroccan  authorities' change of attitude since the fall of 1992, aims to  reduce the Moroccan production of cannabis resin, which the Drug  Geopolitical Observation Council estimated at more than 1,500  tons in 1992, for about 30,000 hectares [ha] under  cultivation.[.sup]1[/] The Moroccan king corrected that  figure, mentioning 50,000 ha under cultivation.    In traditional cannabis-growing areas, i.e., the Rif and the  northern provinces, French-Moroccan cooperation will involve  projects to develop tourism and mountain economy and create  small- and mid-size businesses, as well as agronomic research  and drinking-water supply projects.    On the repressive side, the plan of action mentions the  organization of seminars on police and customs methods, the  exchange of information on trafficker networks, and improved  judicial cooperation. Seventy years after the French state  authorized cannabis growing in northern Morocco, under the  control of the Moroccan Bureau of Kif and Tobacco,  French-Moroccan cooperation comes up to the expectations of the  European Council which, in December, adopted a specific program  to fight drug in Morocco, and invited member states to sign  bilateral agreements.

This is a pragmatic approach.    Ma Yuzhen told reporters yesterday that the Chinese  Government has taken account of Hong Kong's interests in  adopting this pragmatic attitude on current Sino-British  relations.    Both the Chinese and British sides clearly understand that  it  is impossible to hold talks again on Hong Kong's constitutional  reform, Ma Yuzhen pointed out; but both sides are aware that  there is still a need to cooperate on issues other than Hong  Kong's constitutional reform, he added.    He cited as an example that Hong Kong's economy and its  people's lives must not be ignored because the talks on Hong  Kong's constitutional reform have failed. In addition, China  and Britain must cooperate in international affairs and in their  economic and trade relations. British Foreign Office Minister  Alastair Goodlad will visit Beijing in July. This indicates  both sides' wish for cooperation.    On the prospects for Sino-British trade, which has received  attention in all circles, Ma Yuzhen said that the Chinese  Government welcomes British businessmen's investments in China  and hopes that British businessmen will have opportunities.

HUSSEIN OFFERS  FREE OIL TO 3RD WORLD.      By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      BAGHDAD, Iraq      The Iraqi government moved Monday to fully mend fences with Iran, its enemy of  the 1980s, by announcing that it will restore diplomatic relations with Tehran.    Foreign observers in Baghdad interpreted the move as one more effort to break  out of the international isolation that has developed since Iraq invaded  neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2.    It was the second gesture President Saddam Hussein has made to Iran in less  than a month. In mid-August, he announced the withdrawal of Iraqi troops that  had occupied a section of Iran after the 8-year Iran-Iraq War ended in 1988 and  renounced his claim to disputed territory at the head of the Persian Gulf.    Also Monday, Hussein offered to supply oil free of charge to Third World  countries suffering from higher prices brought on by the Mideast crisis.    In a televised speech read as usual by a network announcer, Hussein said: ""We  announce today that we are still your brother and share with you the same  destiny. Therefore, we declare now that we are prepared to supply you with  Iraqi oil free of charge.""    He said that anyone who wants the oil, ""under the assumption"" that such a gift  is not forbidden by U.N. sanctions, should simply apply for it.    ""We are prompted by a principled and moral commitment to ease some of your  burden and to demonstrate solidarity with you,"" Hussein said. ""Such a decision  is not related to, and shall not be affected by, any of your decisions and  attitudes toward the current crisis.""    With oil revenues cut off, along with imports of food, medicine, spare parts  and machinery, the blockade is taking a toll on Iraq, but analysts say the  country has not yet begun to buckle under the strain. Iran and Iraq share a  long border, and if Iran decided to ignore the sanctions, the blockade could  collapse.    The announcement on the restoration of ties came at the end of a two-day visit  to Tehran by Iraq's Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz. He was shown on television  here speaking cheerfully with Iranian officials.    The announcement seemed to suggest that Iraq wants more than just formal  diplomatic ties. Western diplomats noted that the quest for ""natural"" relations  implies trade links as well.    The Iran-Iraq War ended two years ago in a cease-fire brokered by the United  Nations, and when Iraq formally sued for peace last month, it was seen as an  effort to free troops for use against the multinational force being assembled  on the Arabian peninsula.    In the months since the war, neither Iran nor Iraq had shown so much as a  glimmer of trust until last spring, when Hussein raised the possibility of a  summit peace conference.    The key point of dispute was the Shatt al Arab, the waterway that forms the two  nations' southern border. Control of the waterway, the gulf outlet of the Iraqi  port of Basra, was a prime strategic target for Baghdad's troops when they  poured into Iran in September, 1980. Five years earlier, the late Shah Mohammed  Reza Pahlavi, then the power in the gulf, had forced upon Iraq an agreement to  share the Shatt al Arab straight down the middle.    Two weeks after the invasion of Kuwait, faced with the first elements of what  has become a massive Western military buildup in the gulf region, Hussein  called for an exchange of prisoners of war, the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from  Iranian territory and a 50-50 division of the Shatt al Arab.    ""Everything you wanted . . . has been realized,"" he said in a letter to Iran's  President Hashemi Rafsanjani.    Although Hussein's propaganda organs announced that peace on the Iranian border  would permit the military to move 30 divisions, more than 300,000 men, to the  southern front ""for the great duel"" over Kuwait, intelligence reports indicate  that fewer than five of the divisions have shown any sign of moving.    Now, with the blockade proving effective, Hussein is believed to be looking to  Iran as a way of circumventing the blockade and bringing in supplies. Large  shipments of food would be sighted easily in sparsely populated Jordan, but  Iran has a population of more than 50 million, and increased supplies could be  brought into Iranian ports without seeming unusual.    Two days before Aziz arrived in Baghdad, the English-language Tehran Times  openly suggested that ""humanitarian shipments"" might be passed through to Iraq.  Ever since U.N. trade sanctions were imposed last month, Hussein has been  probing for potential soft spots with a series of public relations gestures.    To Arab nationalists, he has portrayed his cause as a battle against Westerners  out to subjugate the Arab world. To Muslims, he has depicted himself as a  defender of holy shrines in Saudi Arabia. Addressing his former arms supplier,  the Soviet Union, he has called for a return to the days when Moscow and  Washington battled by proxy in Third World conflicts.    These appeals have failed to have any effect on the noose being tightened  around Iraq, and now Hussein is waving a seductive card at the Third World,  particularly at debtor countries hard hit by rising oil prices.    Striking an us-against-them note, Hussein accused the Western powers of  forgetting the poor countries' troubles in their frenzy to turn back Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait.    ""It should not come as a surprise to you, brothers, when the big and developed  countries do not show much concern for your issues,"" he said.    The United States and its allies, he said, ""did not ask, nor did they provide  an answer to the harm they would bring to the Third World countries. While oil  monopolies are still drawing filthy profits from this crisis, they let Third  World countries muddle into their crises.""    Whether anyone takes Hussein up on the offer may be beside the point, analysts  believe. They say he is trying to win sympathy in the underdeveloped countries  on the basis of their needs and his apparent generosity.    His offer will hit several poor Asian countries at a time of frustration with  the West. Asians perceive that Western governments are ignoring the plight of  tens of thousands of Indian, Pakistani and Filipino workers trapped in Kuwait  and Iraq.    Asian diplomats in Baghdad complain that their citizens are de facto hostages  because they lack the means to get out, while the West is obsessed with the  Western hostages.    ""No one cares about brown-skinned refugees,"" Achmed Sakkam, the Philippine  ambassador, complained.    The Asian workers are helpless because the only exit open to them is through  Jordan, where hundreds of thousands of refugees already are waiting for  transportation home. Jordan has slowed the flow of refugees from Iraq in order  to relieve the pressure.    Iran, on the other hand, has offered to open its border with Iraq to refugees,  but Iraq has made no move to let refugees out on that side.    Staff writer Nick B.

Velayati, who made the remark in a meeting with visiting  vice  president of Sao Tome and Principe, Habib Travada, hailed Iran's  ties with African countries as ""excellent"" and said the Islamic  republic believes in ""real independence"" for all countries.    He announced Tehran's readiness to expand ties with African  states and said African countries in view of their bitter  experience in the past with certain Western countries, pay  special attention to promotion of ties with independent world  countries.    Travda in return said colonialist and Western countries make  ""mere promises"" of commercial assistance to the black continent.    He said his government believed certain developing states  could offer technological help to African countries.    Travda was pleased with his visit to Islamic Iran and said  his country is keen on expanding and cementing ties with Iran.    The two sides also explored other areas of bilateral  economic  and commercial cooperation, especially in the fields of  fisheries and culture.    The group of islands comprising Sao Tome and Prinicipe, have  a total area of 964 square kms, and lie in the Gulf of Guinea  off the southwest coast of Africa.    Sao Tome and Principe gained its independence from  Portuguese  colonial rule in 1975, and presently has a population of 120,000.    Iran established ties with the African country of Sao Tome  in  1993.     "

The document includes 10  articles, one of which provides that each side is to fund the  broadcasting of its programs via satellite communications to  ground receiver stations in the capital of its partner. Our  guests also traveled to Shanghai. During its stay in Beijing,  the delegation was interviewed by a correspondent from the  Russian section of China Radio International. Listen to this  interview.    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] We know  that during your visit, our radio stations signed documents of  cooperation. How do you assess the prospects of our future  cooperation?    [Delegation member] We have been cooperating for four years  now, and we mutually extend the use of our transmitters. We  have signed an agreement on extended mutual cooperation. We  have also discussed still broader cooperation as well as  exchanges of specialists, programs, and groups of journalists of  various television and radio programs. The things outlined in  the protocol signed today are the next step, but we have not  stopped here. We have discussed meeting in Moscow this October  or November to sign an even broader protocol. We have already  determined the direction of our activity, and will sign [word  indistinct] in Moscow this year. We are very satisfied with the  rate in which our cooperation is growing from year to year.  This helps both Chinese and Russian journalists and engineers,  and constitutes mutual fertilization out of which new ideas and  advances emerge.    The cooperation between Moscow Radio International and China  Radio International in the technical field, and especially the  allowing of mutual use of both countries' transmitters for  broadcasting, is an important aspect of our work and [words  indistinct] cooperation. But I believe a different side of the  cooperation is no less important, and maybe even the most  substantial. I am referring to the exchange of specialists, of  groups of journalists, and of radio programs--in other words,  fields in which cooperation is obvious. Cooperation in the  technical field is important and essential; we simply could not  conduct radio programs without it. However, this cooperation is  invisible to many, and a limited number of Chinese and Russian  experts know about it.    [Correspondent] One does not hear about it.    [Delegation member] Yes, that is correct. But when people  visit a country themselves, Chinese journalists coming to Russia  or Russian journalists going to China, when they see these  changes with their own eyes and the way people relate to them,  the upshot is that the most interesting radio programs are then  broadcast. These programs introduce the life of a different  country and different people, which is precisely what  constitutes a bridge of mutual understanding between people who  begin to understand each other deeper and better. I would like  to focus your attention on this. Unfortunately, certain areas  and points of cooperation in the sphere of exchange of  specialists have not yet been included in the protocol signed  today. But we hope, and maybe are even certain--and this  certainty comes from both Russia and China being interested--  that we will certainly broaden and renew our connections as  regards the exchange of journalists.

""It is a must to strictly enforce rules for air  security--from ticket sales, passenger and luggage check-in,  boarding, on-board inspection--to deal with air piracy,"" said  Chen Guangyi, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China  (CAAC).    CAAC will resolutely probe hijacking cases, punish those  responsible and take swift counter-measures. Chen told a  conference in Fuzhou, provincial capital of Fujian.    The city sits directly across the straits from Taiwan, where  many hijackers have attempted to force planes to land.    Chen also expressed hope that Taiwan authorities would  co-operate with the mainland to crack down on air piracy.    ""We are awaiting a treaty between the mainland's Association  for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and the Taiwan's Straits  Exchanges Foundation on repatriation of hijackers"" he said.    ""Once both sides can join hands in the war against air  piracy  and force hijackers back to where they flew from, we can root  out these crimes for the safety of the travelling public.""    CAAC's anti-hijacking campaign had a direct impact last year  when officials issued a series of rules on tightening air  defence, expanded air security employment and installed more  safety check devices.    Security departments foiled six hijacking attempts, detected  45 suspects with concealed firearms or knives, and confiscated  contraband and other dangerous articles.    In a letter to the meeting, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua  cautioned  that air security should do its utmost to prevent hijackings.     "
0,FT932-7062 ,"FT932-7062 _AN-DEZCHAA8FT 930526   FT  26 MAY 93 / Iranians raid guerrilla bases in Iraq: Aircraft retaliate for sabotage against oil pipelines as election nears      By PARICHEHRE MOSTESHAR   IRANIAN aircraft yesterday raided guerrilla bases in Iraq in retaliation for a series of attacks which have left an already war battered oil network in even greater disarray. Mr Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the Majlis (parliament) speaker, confirmed early morning raids against bases of the Mujahideen Khalq north-east of Baghdad. He said the raids, the first since April 1992, were launched in response to recent acts of sabotage by the mujahideen ahead of presidential elections set for June 11. Tehran said last week that infiltrators from Iraq had blown up oil pipelines in oil-producing Khuzestan province in south-west Iran and clashed with government forces elsewhere. The mujahideen claim to have killed scores of government soldiers in a series of ambushes in the past month. The organisation runs several camps in Iraq, and sided with the Iraqis during the eight-year war with Iran. Ordinary Iranians were yesterday unaware that their government had once again taken arms against what remains the only thorn in the side of the Rafsanjani government. However, popular support for the mujahideen is minimal and yesterday's events are likely to have more significance in Washington than in Tehran. The mujahideen were instrumental in bringing about the Islamic republic, but their 'Marxist' leanings later proved unpalatable to the mullahs. The leadership fled to Iraq, where its backing of the enemy in the Iran-Iraq war lost it what popular support it might have had. A government spokesman in Tehran yesterday played down the significance of the attacks. The mujahideen 'want to stir things up as people pay Iran attention coming up to the elections, to make themselves look as an alternative. These events are to attract the attention and financial backing of Clinton,' he said. 'It is very unimportant and ordinary. In the affairs of this country it is not very important, in the same way as the British government is not in danger when the IRA plant bombs in London.' In August last year a series of bomb attacks in Tehran and several other Iranian cities were laid at the door of 'Iraqi agents'. The mujahideen claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the Iranians arrested 'an Iraqi' who 'confessed' that he was an agent of Saddam Hussein. Following last year's attacks on mujahideen bases in Iraq, the organisation claimed responsibility for a number of riots in the Iranian cities of Shiraz, Arak and Mahshad. President Rafsanjani dismissed the events as 'mere gatherings'.

According to Cuban delegation sources, Robaina and His  Highness Al Thani spoke for more than 30 minutes in a positive  atmosphere, consistent with the signs of hospitality and respect  shown the delegation throughout its stay here.    The two officials exchanged views on the current status of  bilateral relations and agreed that both governments have an  interest in finding ways to increase and develop these  relations. The Cuban official expressed his country's interest  in developing cooperation in areas that have already been  identified, including health, medical products, and tourism, as  well as in other areas where equal opportunities and  possibilities for investment exist.    Moreover, Prince Al Thani reasserted his country's  determination to maintain independent relations with Cuba, based  on respect for each country's sovereignty and the freedom to  choose its own means of social development. Likewise, he said he  is aware of the situation on the island, and pledged to sponsor  the visit of a business delegation to Havana within the next few  weeks.    The Cuban foreign minister also met today with Health  Minister Sheik Hamad bin Sukhaym, who stated his willingness to  hire Cuban health personnel and purchase biopharmaceutical  industry products for their registration and use in Qatar.    A meeting was held with the minister of finance, economy,  and  trade at noon. Bilateral talks at the Foreign Ministry are  scheduled to begin this afternoon, shortly before the departure  to Havana.     "

Both events, he noted, will not  just determine the course of future relations with Russia in  many ways, but also positively affect the general climate of  international relations.    The 'Partnership for Peace' program and the protocol that  was  made public in Brussels which give impetus to the process of  further development of the `Russia-NATO' bilateral program of  deeper cooperation are fully in the national interests of Russia  as a great power, in the view of their specific features and the  general mood in Europe, which reflects the desire for deeper  trust and stability. According to Karasin, the signing of the  Brussels documents signifies a mutual agreement between Russia  and NATO as two major partners in European and global security.    The upcoming conclusion of the full-scale agreement on  partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and  the EC will bring cooperation between Russia and the EC to a new  level, Karasin said. ""This will be of enormous potential  benefit for the Russian economy, access of our goods to the  European markets, and for the deepening of the mutually  beneficial processes of economic development in the European  region. The EC too, might draw tangible benefits from closer  cooperation with Russia, such as a boost to its economy, easing  the unemployment problems, and opening up new markets,"" the  Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.

In an annual report on worldwide drug production and  trafficking, the U.S. Government corroborates that Cuban  authorities continue placing top priority on their anti-drug  policy, and it also indicates that Cuba cooperated with the  Unites States in this area in 1993.    According to Washington's opinion on how the nations of the  world are meeting the commitments made at the 1988 UN Drug  Convention, the report contends Cuba is engaged in a struggle  against drugs, despite the island's problems of fuel shortages  and the lack of spare parts, all of which limit Cuba's capacity  to combat drugs.    Cuba is a signatory of the UN convention on this issue and  has signed bilateral agreements with many nations in the region  to fight the scourge of drug trafficking.    Also, in 1988 it declared its willingness to sign an  agreement of this type with the United States--an offer which up  until now has been ignored by Washington.    Cuban cooperation in this struggle includes the interception  of planes and ships in its airspace and territorial waters, as  well as the supply of information to U.S. services in charge of  confronting this problem.    The United States is the world's largest drug consumer, and  the report admits that although cocaine continues being the main  threat to U.S. drug users, the danger of the use of heroin is  growing at an alarming pace.

""Turks are a brave, civilized and independent people. Who can  say that Turks do not know how to elect the right leaders?""  Baqeri told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS.    ""These results should be of concern only to Turks. They,  themselves, can talk about it. Iran is respecting the  expression of the Turkish people's free will. Some comments  concerning the election results can be attributed to the enemies  of Turkey. They are trying to distract the Turkish public. The  Turkish press has to prevent this plot,"" Baqeri said.    Regarding his visit to the newly elected RP mayor of  Erzurum,  Baqeri said that he traveled to Erzurum on a regular basis in  order to visit the Iranian Consulate in that city. ""I went to  Erzurum two years ago and I visited the mayor, the governor,  local press representatives and the university, just as I did  during my last visit. But the Turkish press preferred to focus  on my visit to the mayor. I have no particular interest in  visiting mayors from the RP. For example, I have no plans to  visit the (newly elected RP) mayors in either Istanbul or  Ankara,"" said Baqeri.    ""Turkish authorities and the press are aware of my  activities  here so there should be no question as to the purpose of my  visit to Erzurum,"" Baqeri noted, stressing that with his  four-year presence in Turkey, he is no newcomer to the country.  ""Are there any suspicions raised when other diplomats travel to  Southeast Anatolia? Iran and its ambassador bring nothing but  good intentions to Turkey,"" Baqeri stated.    Meanwhile, the Iranian ambassador also said that with 60  million Muslims living in Turkey, the RP could not claim to be  the sole representative of Islam in the country. His statement  was made in reference to claims that Iran has taken a special  interest in the success of the pro-Islamic RP. ""Can you say  that people from the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) are  not Muslims? I know so many people from True Path Party (DYP)  who pray regularly. There are ministers among them.  Consequently, those who place these issues on the agenda do not  have good intentions,"" he said.    However, he also mentioned that it would not make sense for  Iran to distance itself from the newly elected RP mayors either.  When the mayor of the Iranian city of Tabriz visited Turkey two  years ago, Baqeri pointed out, he held a meeting with SHP  Chairman Murat Karayalcin. At the time Karayalcin was a mayor  from the SHP. ""We established a good dialogue with him. But  now, the new mayor comes from the RP. Should we not establish a  dialogue with him simply because he is from the RP?""    Press Reports False    On another subject, Baqeri disputed press reports claiming  that he had proposed a solution to the Kurdish question,  branding them as false. ""The question proposed to me concerned  the situation of minorities in Iran, especially the Kurdish  minority. My response was that they do not present a problem  for us. I also explained Iran's policies concerning its  minority populations. My intention was not to advise Turkey.  Either there was a misunderstanding or the false interpretation  of my statements was done intentionally. My response was in no  way related to Turkey's problems. I have no interest in them,""  Baqeri said.    PKK Question    Meanwhile, Baqeri stressed that his country had cooperated  with Turkey since the very beginning of its problems with the  outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).    ""This cooperation is not new. We have been handing over to  Turkey people in Iran who have been acting against them. We  will continue to implement this policy. With the signing of a  security agreement between the two countries, we have just  stressed this cooperation one more time. But our stance has  remained the same since the very beginning of the problem,""  Baqeri pointed out.    He also criticized anti-Iranian reports related to the PKK  issue that have appeared in the Turkish press in the past. ""We  confronted the Turkish authorities about these reports and they  told us that these articles are created by the press and that  their own positions do not reflect the views expressed in the  news reports.""    Baqeri said that relations between Turkey and Iran were  very good. He also voiced Iran's pleasure on the cooperation  between the two countries on issues concerning security. ""I  hope that our relations on security issues will serve as an  example for other neighboring countries,"" he said. He also  mentioned that the general manager of Turkey's security forces,  Mehmet Agar, would visit Iran soon as an official guest of  Iran's security and disciplinary forces commander, Gen. Reza  Seyfullahi.    Common Enemies    Baqeri also claimed that Turkey and Iran shared many common  enemies, forming even closer bonds between the two countries.  To demonstrate this point, he displayed a map illustrating the  borders of a Kurdish state which extended into Turkish, Iranian,  Iraqi and Syrian territories.    He explained that the map had been published in Europe last  week, and said: ""Who are our enemies? Who is supporting the  establishment a Kurdish state? This is a plot of those who are  falsely claiming to be close to us. Is the exaggeration of news  about Iran an attempt to cover up these dangerous intentions?""  Baqeri also noted that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel,  while he served as prime minister, had shown a similar map to  Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and had reportedly  said during the meeting, ""Look what they want to do."" Baqeri  stressed that ""it is obvious that some people intend to tear  away parts of Iran and Turkey. We must be awakened,"" Baqeri  stressed.    Israel, Enemy of Muslims    In a reference to the development of closer relations  between  Turkey and Israel, the Iranian ambassador stressed that Iran  considers Israel to be untrustworthy.    ""Turkey makes its own foreign policy. We cannot comment on  this. But, we do not see them (Israel) as an honest society.  There is a verse in the holy Koran: It says that they had  tried to cheat even Allah. They definitely hate Muslims. They  are the enemies of all Muslims. You can see it in their  policies,"" Baqeri said.    Cooperation on Central Asia    Meanwhile, Baqeri stressed that the two countries were also  cooperating on the issue of Central Asia.    Despite the propaganda emanating from the Western press  which  claims that Turkey and Iran are competing over the newly  independent countries of Central Asia, the results of the  cooperation are beginning to bear fruit, Baqeri said. ""Turkmen  natural gas will be transported over Iran to Turkey and to  Europe by pipeline. The Western and Turkish press have written  much propaganda, but the realities (of the cooperation) are  obvious,"" Baqeri stated.    Turkey and Iran also share common views concerning the  Caucasus, he said. ""The two countries are opposed to the  Armenian invasion. Furthermore, we both have requested that  Armenia withdraw its forces from the Azeri territory it has  occupied. Both Iran and Turkey have been providing humanitarian  aid to Azerbaijan. And, both are helping the Caucasian and  Central Asian republics within the framework of the Economic  Cooperation Organization (ECO). There are many examples like  these.""    Moreover, he indicated that Iran was prepared to cooperate  with Russia and Turkey in an attempt to resolve the problem of  Nagorno-Karabakh. ""We informed Moscow and Ankara about our  readiness to cooperate. We are ready to cooperate with any side  that is willing to take steps to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh  question. Turkey, Russia and Iran are influential countries in  the Caucasus. Therefore, there is a need for intensive dialogue.  We are ready for this.""    Baqeri also mentioned that Iran and Turkey have already  conducted consultations at the levels of foreign ministry  general directors, department chiefs and experts. ""These kinds  of consultations are necessary. Ministerial level meetings,  alone, are not enough. For example, the Turkish Foreign  Ministry's general director of Caucasia and the Balkans, Omer  Ersun, visited Iran and their Iranian counterparts have visited  Ankara--all over the past few months. After discussing the  issues, we realized that our views were similar.""    The Iranian ambassador also expressed his government's  pleasure over Turkey's participation in the Bosnian peacekeeping  force, known as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. ""We are happy  about the decision that foresees the presence of Turkish  peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. The placement of the Muslim  Turkish soldiers in Bosnia is a situation that is very pleasing  to Iran.""    Meanwhile, Baqeri disclosed that there were 48,723 displaced  Azeris living temporarily in Iran who were receiving aid from  the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS).    According to information provided by the IRCS, seven tent  camps have been established for Azeri refugees in the border  areas of Pars Abad in Imishlinskiy, Bileh Savar, Saberabad and  Saatlinskiy regions since September 1993 and there is an urgent  need for increased international participation and support for  them.    Iran Overcomes Economic Troubles    Baqeri said that Iran, currently involved in a period of  reconstruction, was experiencing no economic problem that could  not be overcome.    We are reconstructing the areas that had been damaged during  the time of the Shah and in the Iran-Iraq war, Baqeri said. He  disputed the reports that claimed Iran was immersed in great  economic difficulties, saying that they were untrue and were  only made to disseminate political propaganda against Iran.    ""It is normal to experience economic problems. Just look at  other countries. Although they did not conduct a revolution  against a regime connected to the United States, or fight an  eight-year-long war or resist U.S. attempts at political  domination for 15 years, all of them still are experiencing  economic problems, including Europe and the United States,""  Baqeri noted.    The Iranian ambassador stressed that the current regime in  Iran represents the first implementation of an Islamic  government and is now in a period of experimentation in the  economic field. ""We want a state that depends on its own  resources. Our goal is not to depend on foreign resources.  However, foreign pressure does have an impact on the Iranian  economy.    ``The United States does not want the Iranian system to be  successful. To place pressure on the Iranian economy is among  their leading priorities. By reducing the prices for crude oil,  they want to negatively affect the Iranian economy so that they  can say that the Iranian system is unsuccessful,'' Baqeri  claimed.    He said that the United States was ""trying to place pressure  on the countries that were having economic relations with Iran.  Yet, they are always calling on Iran to establish economic  relations with them while trying to prevent other countries from  having economic relations with Iran,"" he said. [quotation mark  as published]    Baqeri also said that Iran was beginning to implement second  five-year developing plans in which the main goal was to develop  the country's very rich natural resources. ``Iran has very rich  resources along with its reserves of crude oil. Iran's natural  gas stocks are the second largest in the world.    ``We also have other resources. We have prepared an economic  plan that is not as dependent on crude oil export revenues. We  are now preparing to pass the plan, but obstacles still remain.  The Iranian nation is prepared to make sacrifices. In the  period of economic trouble, we eat and drink less,'' Baqeri  stated. Meanwhile, Baqeri said that Iran had offered a proposal  to Turkey related to increased cooperation in the area of the  automotive and spare parts manufacturing industry.    ""In one or two months, we are expecting a delegation from  the  Turkish Ministry of Industry and Trade to investigate the  opportunities for cooperation. We are hopeful about this issue  because there are many opportunities,"" Baqeri said.     "

According to the prereleased text  of his speech held at the opening of the two-day conference of  the bilateral economic commission in Berlin on Thursday [23  June], Rexrodt told Saudi Economics and Finance Minister Shaykh  Muhammad al-'Ali Aba-al-Khayl that he hopes to get some  information on future cooperation opportunities. The  commission, which was established in 1975, held its last meeting  in Riyadh in late February 1992. The conference will end in  Potsdam on Friday with the signing of a final protocol.    Rexrodt said he regrets that German investment in Saudi  Arabia is still very modest in volume and that it has not gone  up over the past few years. The reasons for this are not only  to be sought in Germany. Creating favorable conditions for  investment is also important for Saudi Arabia, Rexrodt said.    Rexrodt went on to express concern over the fact that German  exports to Saudi Arabia dropped by almost 15 percent in 1993,  while German imports only went down 1.1 percent. German exports  were at a high of 8.5 billion German marks [DM] in 1982. In  1993, the figure was DM3.6 billion. Imports from Saudi Arabia  amounted to some DM2 billion in 1993. The main products  imported were petroleum, fuels, and lubricating oil.    According to the Saudi Industrial Ministry, there are some  70  German-Saudi joint ventures.

Visiting South Korean foreign minister, here on the second  stop of his Southeast Asian tour, met with Thai Prime Minister  Chuan Leekpai for talks on regional issues covering ASEAN, its  relations with Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the  regional security dialogue that opened for the first time this  year, Han's aides said.    Han expressed hopes of giving a boost to Seoul-Bangkok  relations when Chuan visits South Korea next month, the aides  said. He explained the latest developments on North Korea's  nuclear problem with emphasis that the situation is not just a  regional concern but an international one that threatens world  stabiliity.    The foreign minister sought Thai's active role in mediating  South Korea's involvement with ASEAN as Bangkok plays  chairnation to this year's ASEAN post-ministerial conference  July 26-28, the aides said.    Chuan explained Thailand's ""constructive engagement policy""  aimed at improving relations with the three Indochinese country  -- Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia -- and its efforts to establish  the ""baht economy"" that would also incorporate Myanmar [Burma].    South Korean officials said they wish to connect to these  countries as well economically through Thailand.    The two leaders touched on Seoul-Bangkok economic relations  with Chuan noting the trade imbalance in South Korea's favor.    Bilateral trade tallied at 2.3 billion U.S. dollars last  year  with South Korea pocketing 1.2 billion dollar surplus.    Chuan urged South Korean businesses to more actively enter  Thai market and to make more investments as part of efforts to  balance these trade figures, the aides said.     "

Bernd  Neumann (Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary state  secretary in the Research Ministry, said that cooperation  projects in research and development are profitable for both  sides.    Neumann announced that during his government talks, which  will begin in Moscow on Monday [30 May], three new technical  agreements are to be concluded on water and environmental  research as well as on biotechnology. In addition, the final  discussion about an agreement on ocean and polar research is  planned. Particularly in the fields of space flight, ocean and  polar research, and laser technology Russian scientists have  large know-how. An outstanding example for successful  cooperation in space flight is the joint development with Japan  of the ""Express"" retrievable space capsule.    At the international level, Germany is involved in the  International Economic and Technology Center in Moscow, which  was founded at the initiative of the German foreign minister and  the U.S. secretary of state. The institute is to open up new  opportunities of employment to Russian scientists, who have so  far worked in weapons development. The international  association for the promotion of cooperation with scientists  form the independent states of the former Soviet Union (INTAS)  in Brussels, which works in the civilian sector and has the same  goal, is also supported by Germany beyond its contribution to  the European Union.    At the national level Bonn will spend about 37.5 million  marks [DM] by the end of 1994 for a science support program,  which was initiated in 1992. In addition, Russian scientists  are involved in more than 100 projects for technical programs,  which are financed by the Research Ministry with DM240 million.     "

Vladimir Gorbulin, director-general of the Ukrainian  National  Space Agency, believes that a NASA-UNSA dialogue will rule out  bilateral cooperation in what involves space rocketry  manufacture, because of Ukraine's failure to accede to the  Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT].    According to Mr. Gorbulin, Ukraine with its unique space  rocketry technologies lost a year when its parliament refused to  accede to NPT, while Russia managed to establish large-scale  international cooperation in space research, primarily with the  USA.    The Ukrainian National Space Agency together with the  Ministry for foreign economic relations have been mustering  support for Ukraine's prompt accedence to NPT.    During its crucial talks with NASA officers UNSA intends to  discuss likely opportunities for joining efforts in Earth remote  probing, satellite telecommunications and similar domains.    The Ukrainian side reportedly intends to offer NASA its  side-vision radars for scanning oceanic surfaces, which were  designed by the Yuzhnoye (Southern) designers, and the Paton  Institute's technologies for arc welding and construction  assembly in space.    Following the USSR's collapse Ukraine's space industry has  sustained heavy losses. In particular, the Yuzhnoye designers  personnel reduced by 3,000 over the two last years. (Mr.  Gorbulin refused to specify the number of personnel currently  employed by the Yuzhnoye Bureau, saying only the personnel loss  was tremendous).    Luckily enough, as Mr. Gorbulin hastened to add, there has  been no brain-drain in that case, since the relieved personnel  remains in Ukraine.     "

According to the regulations, from May 1 of this  year, chemicals without registration for importation will not be  allowed to be imported into China.    It is reported that over 38,000 varieties of chemicals are  now produced in China and a great amount of chemicals are  imported into the country and since there has been a lack of a  complete set of regulations and necessary technological measures  on their administration, some problems have been appearing in  their production, use, transportation, storage and waste deposal  [as received].

Symposium participants tended to see  prospects for  trade relations with the United States and Western countries as only  fair, with Asia viewed as likely to become the focus of China's  external economic development.      The November issue of XIANDAI GUOJI GUANXI, an international  affairs journal affiliated with the well-respected China Institute  of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a research think  tank, is devoted to papers presented at an October symposium  sponsored by that institution on ""China's Economy Opening to the  Outside World.""  The papers present current thinking on the full  spectrum of China's economic and trade relations with the world by  participants from government, press, academic, and commercial  circles.  (The appendix to this Foreign Media Note lists the  reported articles, authors, and affiliations represented at the  symposium.)      All symposium articles dealing with further opening up China's  economy to the world give top priority to upgrading China's export  mix by shifting away from low-profit, labor-intensive products.  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences researcher Zhang Shouyi argues  that a low-cost, skilled labor pool gives China a comparative  advantage in ""knowledge-intensive, high-tech products.""  Other ideas  for expanding high-profit exports by other authors include improving  product quality, before and after sales service, and packaging.  JINGJI RIBAO journalist He Ming stresses the importance of in-  country marketing agents and products responsive to consumer demand  when targeting markets in advanced countries.  Others at this  symposium call for implementation of international standards and  foreign managers in China's export enterprises to expand exports.      In reforming the foreign trade regime by ""internationalizing""  Chinese enterprises, state-run enterprises are in the best position  to upgrade their exports, gain overseas market share, and become  multinational corporations.  According to Wang Zhile of the Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation International Economic  Cooperation Research Center,  ""Of all the regions of the world,  Asia, and especially East Asia, should be the key region, the target  of first choice for internationalizing Chinese enterprises.""      The image of Asia as China's stepping stone to the world economy  is a common theme in many of the articles, but there is some  ambivalence in the respective arguments supporting that view:  Asia  is seen both as the region of greatest potential for China's  outward-oriented economic growth and as its stiffest competitor.  In  many cases Chinese exports are in direct competition with exports  from other developing Asian economies.  Moreover, low-quality  exports and lack of experience in international business dealings  put Chinese companies at a disadvantage in this competition.  China  is also see as in direct competition with ASEAN countries and  Indochina for foreign investment.      Nonetheless, there appears to be general agreement that China  must concentrate on Asia and Asian markets, both for their high  growth potential in the 9O's and to counterbalance the increasing  protectionism of Western countries.  With Asia, as with the world,  China's strategy for economic development is to begin with sub-  regional and bilateral relations and then move to multilateral and  regional fora.  Huang Fanzhang of the State Planning Commission  Economic Research Center explains this dynamic in terms of three  triangles.  Huang postulates a small triangle (Mainland China-  Taiwan-Hong Kong), a medium triangle (China-South Korea-Singapore  and other ASEAN countries), and a large triangle (China-Japan-United  States).  The larger triangles have the potential for economic  competition and even conflict.  Huang predicts the large triangle of  the Asia-Pacific will be the ""main battlefield"" in the U.S.-Japanese  struggle for economic leadership.  Huang sees areas of concern in  China's economic relations with both countries.  Japan doesn't want  to see China become a competitor, but rather wants China to always  ""fly in formation"" following Japan's lead.  According to Huang, the  United States, on the other hand, is intent on imposing its  political agenda on China.      Criticism of the United States along these lines is a frequent  theme in the articles.  CICIR analyst Ke Juhan asserts that the  United States is ""politicizing"" the economic relationship between  the two countries.  Ke says that conditionality on MFN, U.S.  economic reprisals based on ""unwarranted accusations"" of China's  violation of the MTCR, U.S. anti-dumping duties against Chinese  exports, and U.S. unilateral reduction of China's textile quotas  have all ""harmed the bilateral relationship.""  Yan Xuetong, also of  CICIR, agrees with Ke's contentions and further states, ""Hereafter  the United States will continue to use every pretext, including  constant use of quota limitations and anti-dumping duties, to limit  China's exports to the United States.""  Ke Juhan urges the United  States to put the relationship on a more ""practical"" footing,  stating that President Clinton's recent ""intentions, statements, and  actions"" are beginning to improve the economic relationship with  China and predicting that as more U.S. companies become involved  with China economically, they will ""play an active role"" in  improving the bilateral relationship.      Among the articles on bilateral and regional economic relations,  three on Russia and Europe by CICIR analysts stand out.  Wang Lijiu  asserts that now is the time for China to consolidate economic  relations with Russia.  However, according to Wang, both countries  must work to formulate a unified and coordinated trade policy.  Wang  also proposes setting up a Sino-Russian joint venture bank to  resolve outstanding trade payment issues and calls for increased  technology trade between the two countries.  In an article on  economic relations with Eastern Europe, Qi Degang advocates using  barter trade with cash-poor Eastern European countries to edge out  Western competition for those markets.  Finally, Guan Shufen  characterizes prospects for economic relations with Western European  countries as ""cautiously optimistic.""  Sino-German economic  relations will drive overall Sino-European economic development.  On  the down side, however, Guan sees increasing European trade  protectionism, use of anti-dumping measures to protect domestic  industries, and problems in Sino-French and Sino-British bilateral  relations.

Ke says that conditionality on MFN, U.S.  economic reprisals based on ""unwarranted accusations"" of China's  violation of the MTCR, U.S. anti-dumping duties against Chinese  exports, and U.S. unilateral reduction of China's textile quotas  have all ""harmed the bilateral relationship.""  Yan Xuetong, also of  CICIR, agrees with Ke's contentions and further states, ""Hereafter  the United States will continue to use every pretext, including  constant use of quota limitations and anti-dumping duties, to limit  China's exports to the United States.""  Ke Juhan urges the United  States to put the relationship on a more ""practical"" footing,  stating that President Clinton's recent ""intentions, statements, and  actions"" are beginning to improve the economic relationship with  China and predicting that as more U.S. companies become involved  with China economically, they will ""play an active role"" in  improving the bilateral relationship.      Among the articles on bilateral and regional economic relations,  three on Russia and Europe by CICIR analysts stand out.  Wang Lijiu  asserts that now is the time for China to consolidate economic  relations with Russia.  However, according to Wang, both countries  must work to formulate a unified and coordinated trade policy.  Wang  also proposes setting up a Sino-Russian joint venture bank to  resolve outstanding trade payment issues and calls for increased  technology trade between the two countries.  In an article on  economic relations with Eastern Europe, Qi Degang advocates using  barter trade with cash-poor Eastern European countries to edge out  Western competition for those markets.  Finally, Guan Shufen  characterizes prospects for economic relations with Western European  countries as ""cautiously optimistic.""  Sino-German economic  relations will drive overall Sino-European economic development.  On  the down side, however, Guan sees increasing European trade  protectionism, use of anti-dumping measures to protect domestic  industries, and problems in Sino-French and Sino-British bilateral  relations.

0," FBIS3-43215      ""cr00000004794001""        28 January 1994  Article Type:FBIS  Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-010--CHINA         Symposium Discusses Goals for China's Foreign Economic Relations        According     to research papers presented at a symposium on China's  economic and trade relations, China's priorities in foreign trade  are upgrading its export mix and ""internationalizing"" production  enterprises.  Symposium participants tended to see  prospects for  trade relations with the United States and Western countries as only  fair, with Asia viewed as likely to become the focus of China's  external economic development.      The November issue of XIANDAI GUOJI GUANXI, an international  affairs journal affiliated with the well-respected China Institute  of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a research think  tank, is devoted to papers presented at an October symposium  sponsored by that institution on ""China's Economy Opening to the  Outside World.""  The papers present current thinking on the full  spectrum of China's economic and trade relations with the world by  participants from government, press, academic, and commercial  circles.  (The appendix to this Foreign Media Note lists the  reported articles, authors, and affiliations represented at the  symposium.)      All symposium articles dealing with further opening up China's  economy to the world give top priority to upgrading China's export  mix by shifting away from low-profit, labor-intensive products.  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences researcher Zhang Shouyi argues  that a low-cost, skilled labor pool gives China a comparative  advantage in ""knowledge-intensive, high-tech products.""  Other ideas  for expanding high-profit exports by other authors include improving  product quality, before and after sales service, and packaging.  JINGJI RIBAO journalist He Ming stresses the importance of in-  country marketing agents and products responsive to consumer demand  when targeting markets in advanced countries.  Others at this  symposium call for implementation of international standards and  foreign managers in China's export enterprises to expand exports.      In reforming the foreign trade regime by ""internationalizing""  Chinese enterprises, state-run enterprises are in the best position  to upgrade their exports, gain overseas market share, and become  multinational corporations.  According to Wang Zhile of the Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation International Economic  Cooperation Research Center,  ""Of all the regions of the world,  Asia, and especially East Asia, should be the key region, the target  of first choice for internationalizing Chinese enterprises.""      The image of Asia as China's stepping stone to the world economy  is a common theme in many of the articles, but there is some  ambivalence in the respective arguments supporting that view:  Asia  is seen both as the region of greatest potential for China's  outward-oriented economic growth and as its stiffest competitor.  In  many cases Chinese exports are in direct competition with exports  from other developing Asian economies.  Moreover, low-quality  exports and lack of experience in international business dealings  put Chinese companies at a disadvantage in this competition.  China  is also see as in direct competition with ASEAN countries and  Indochina for foreign investment.      Nonetheless, there appears to be general agreement that China  must concentrate on Asia and Asian markets, both for their high  growth potential in the 9O's and to counterbalance the increasing  protectionism of Western countries.  With Asia, as with the world,  China's strategy for economic development is to begin with sub-  regional and bilateral relations and then move to multilateral and  regional fora.  Huang Fanzhang of the State Planning Commission  Economic Research Center explains this dynamic in terms of three  triangles.  Huang postulates a small triangle (Mainland China-  Taiwan-Hong Kong), a medium triangle (China-South Korea-Singapore  and other ASEAN countries), and a large triangle (China-Japan-United  States).  The larger triangles have the potential for economic  competition and even conflict.  Huang predicts the large triangle of  the Asia-Pacific will be the ""main battlefield"" in the U.S.-Japanese  struggle for economic leadership.  Huang sees areas of concern in  China's economic relations with both countries.  Japan doesn't want  to see China become a competitor, but rather wants China to always  ""fly in formation"" following Japan's lead.  According to Huang, the  United States, on the other hand, is intent on imposing its  political agenda on China.      Criticism of the United States along these lines is a frequent  theme in the articles.  CICIR analyst Ke Juhan asserts that the  United States is ""politicizing"" the economic relationship between  the two countries.  Ke says that conditionality on MFN, U.S.  economic reprisals based on ""unwarranted accusations"" of China's  violation of the MTCR, U.S. anti-dumping duties against Chinese  exports, and U.S. unilateral reduction of China's textile quotas  have all ""harmed the bilateral relationship.""

According to the regulations, from May 1 of this  year, chemicals without registration for importation will not be  allowed to be imported into China.    It is reported that over 38,000 varieties of chemicals are  now produced in China and a great amount of chemicals are  imported into the country and since there has been a lack of a  complete set of regulations and necessary technological measures  on their administration, some problems have been appearing in  their production, use, transportation, storage and waste deposal.    According to the regulations, the National Environmental  Protection Agency will be in charge of unified environmental  supervision and administration over the import of chemicals and  the import and export of toxic chemicals in line with the  ""London Standards"" stated in an international pact. The agency  will issue a list of toxic chemicals subject to prohibition or  strict restriction by the country. Chemicals to be imported  into the country and those chemicals included in the list of  toxic chemicals will be subject to registration and approval  procedures for a permit to be given for their importation and  exportation.    The General Administration of Customs and the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation will be respectively in  charge of the inspection of such chemicals and the examination  and the making public to the outside world of the list.

Stock market shipping indexes have slumped 25% worldwide since Iraq invaded  Kuwait on Aug. 2, said Lloyd's List International in London.    It said Norwegian and U.S. shipping companies have been hit hardest. An Oslo  business newspaper reported that some Norwegians' shipping fortunes were halved  on paper within two weeks of the invasion.    Loukas Hadjioannou, the Greek owner of the world's largest independent tanker  fleet, said 30% of all tankers could be laid up by the crisis.    ""The main thing that this crisis has done is once again stress the volatility  of the shipping market, how open it is to outside influences,"" said David  Glass, editor of Naftiliaki, a shipping magazine in Piraeus, Greece.    London experts said 60 ships, mostly tankers, were awaiting orders near the  Persian Gulf late last month -- at considerable cost to owners. But they said  there was some increase in chartering -- leasing of ships for specific voyages.    Compounding a decline in tanker activity are increasing costs for shipping  companies resulting from the dangers caused by the crisis.    Crews want cash bonuses for sailing in the Gulf.    Insurance costs have increased as much as tenfold, though more often by three  times, for ships in high-risk Gulf areas, according to Norwegian reports.    Jane Vidler of Lloyd's Insurance in London said war insurance rates for ships  have been raised three times since Aug. 2. But the highest premiums are still  just one-tenth of the 7.5% of a ship's value that some owners paid during the  1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.    Anxiety has pushed the paper value of Norwegian ships down by $1.3 billion, or  19%, since Aug. 1, according to Oslo's stock exchange. ""If this crisis goes on,  we'll be in trouble,"" Glass said, ""because the developed nations will enter a  recession, and they will have a smaller demand for oil.""    He said ships that can carry either oil or dry cargo could enter the dry cargo  market, causing problems in that segment. Also, expensive tankers ordered a few  years ago are being delivered now and ""those who ordered them are going to be  in trouble,"" Glass said.    Shippers expect some relief because other nations, including some OPEC members,  are expected to replenish up to 90% of the 4 million barrels of Iraqi and  Kuwaiti crude lost to the market.

Stock market shipping indexes have slumped 25% worldwide since Iraq invaded  Kuwait on Aug. 2, said Lloyd's List International in London.    It said Norwegian and U.S. shipping companies have been hit hardest. An Oslo  business newspaper reported that some Norwegians' shipping fortunes were halved  on paper within two weeks of the invasion.    Loukas Hadjioannou, the Greek owner of the world's largest independent tanker  fleet, said 30% of all tankers could be laid up by the crisis.    ""The main thing that this crisis has done is once again stress the volatility  of the shipping market, how open it is to outside influences,"" said David  Glass, editor of Naftiliaki, a shipping magazine in Piraeus, Greece.    London experts said 60 ships, mostly tankers, were awaiting orders near the  Persian Gulf late last month -- at considerable cost to owners. But they said  there was some increase in chartering -- leasing of ships for specific voyages.    Compounding a decline in tanker activity are increasing costs for shipping  companies resulting from the dangers caused by the crisis.    Crews want cash bonuses for sailing in the Gulf.    Insurance costs have increased as much as tenfold, though more often by three  times, for ships in high-risk Gulf areas, according to Norwegian reports.    Jane Vidler of Lloyd's Insurance in London said war insurance rates for ships  have been raised three times since Aug. 2. But the highest premiums are still  just one-tenth of the 7.5% of a ship's value that some owners paid during the  1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.    Anxiety has pushed the paper value of Norwegian ships down by $1.3 billion, or  19%, since Aug. 1, according to Oslo's stock exchange. ""If this crisis goes on,  we'll be in trouble,"" Glass said, ""because the developed nations will enter a  recession, and they will have a smaller demand for oil.""    He said ships that can carry either oil or dry cargo could enter the dry cargo  market, causing problems in that segment. Also, expensive tankers ordered a few  years ago are being delivered now and ""those who ordered them are going to be  in trouble,"" Glass said.    Shippers expect some relief because other nations, including some OPEC members,  are expected to replenish up to 90% of the 4 million barrels of Iraqi and  Kuwaiti crude lost to the market.    Also, some tankers have won contracts to sail farther for alternate oil cargoes  because Turkey closed a pipeline from Iraq.    Uncertain oil supplies could increase demand for coal cargoes from suppliers  such as the United States and Australia. And higher crude prices would  stimulate offshore oil exploration.

Its organizers -- the Armenian  Ministry of Energy and Fuel along with the U.S. Department of  Energy, International Development Agency, and the U.S. energy  association. About 400 delegates including representatives of 65  power engineering firms and companies from a number of countries  discussed a broad range of problems concerning power saving,  power engineering, heating supplies, electrical systems and  networks, alternative energy sources and prospecting for fuel  deposits.    The results of the forum exceeded our expectations, said  Sepukh Tashchyan, Armenian state minister. Speaking at a news  conference here today, he said 30 proposals had been received  from various foreign firms which, with serious development and  financing, could produce good results.    Susan Olds, director of the Caucasus regional section of the  U.S. International Development Agency, said the U.S. Government  was prepared to grant Armenia $26 million in aid to be spent on  the development of energy saving and raising the efficiency of  power usage, on the development of hydro-power, alternative and  renewable sources of energy. The European Union is giving  Armenia a certain amount of aid.    U.S. President Bill Clinton regards as very important the  process of democratization in the former republics of the USSR,  stated Richard Williamson, representative of the U.S. Department  of Energy. Therefore, he said, the U.S. Government supports and  encourages the activities of those firms that may be useful to  Armenia in carrying out reforms, in implementing the course of  democratization.

""As our delegation is leaving for Baghdad, the Iraqi side  sent a telex message, asking for a 2-week postponement of the  visit,"" Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister 'Abbas Maleki told XINHUA:    Therefore, the Iranian delegation has been still in the  country and the planned trip by foreign minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati has also been postponed, he added.    Nevertheless, he did not give any detail about the cause of  the postponement by the Iraqi side, adding that he was still  optimistic over the relations between Iran and Iraq.    However, observers here noted that the postponement would  cast a shadow on the improving relations of the two former foes.  It also indicated that the two sides have had big differences  on some major issues.    They also doubted the prospect of the bilateral relations  because many problems still remain unsolved, such as the fate of  prisoners of the eight-year war between the two countries, war  compensation, Iraqi aircraft in Iran and support of each side's  opposition forces.    The future talks will no doubt be focused on removing the  obstacles of the improving relations, rather than rapid  normalization of ties, which cannot be foreseen in the immediate  future.    The two sides will have a lot of important issues to  discuss,  including the trade. Once the UN sanctions against Iraq lifted,  Iran can be a major supplier of goods to Iraq.    However, Iranian dailies acknowledged that Tehran's mistrust  and lack of faith in the Baghdad regime is not without reason.  Baghdad has been supporting the outlawed Mujahideen Khalq  Organization (MKO) to launch cross border attacks from inside  Iraq.    The Iranian delegation was formerly scheduled for Iraq on  June 11 to make preparation for Velayati's visit to Iraq.    According to official report, Velayati was preparing the  trip  to Iraq to discuss bilateral ties and other issues, including  the fate of thousands of prisoners of war from both countries.    If the Iranian foreign minister makes the trip, it would be  the first visit by Velayati to Iraq since the 1991 Persian Gulf  war, when U.S.-led forces drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.    The POW issue is the main obstacle for an improvement of  ties  between the two countries.    According to an official report, Iraq is still holding 8,000  Iranian military personnel and civilians, including soldiers  captured almost 20 years ago in border skirmishes.    But Iraq has denied holding any Iranian citizens and claims  20,000 of its own troops are being held in Iran.     "
0,FT932-11253 ,"FT932-11253 _AN-DEECIAD4FT 930505   FT  05 MAY 93 / Scott inquiry told that arms guidelines 'trickled out'      By JIMMY BURNS   SECRECY which may have governed Whitehall policy-making in the 1980s was raised yesterday on the first day of public hearings in the arms-for-Iraq inquiry. The inquiry was announced by the government in November in the midst of public controversy over an alleged secret policy. In a forceful exchange, Lord Justice Scott, who is heading the inquiry, asked a former senior foreign office official whether he thought it right that official guidelines governing defence-related sales to Iraq and Iran should have been kept from parliament for nearly a year. Lord Justice Scott asked Mr Stephen Day, a former head of the foreign office's Middle East desk: 'Looking at the map more broadly would you not say that the British public and parliament were entitled to know about these important matters . . . to know about the guidelines?' Mr Day denied that he had personally received any instructions that policy should be kept secret. But he confirmed that a decision had been taken by ministers in November 1984 that new guidelines governing exports to Iran and Iraq should only be allowed to 'trickle out' to parliament to minimise any disruption they might have on trade with Iraq and relations generally with the Arab world. The guidelines, which restricted the export of defence equipment that might significantly enhance or exacerbate the Iran-Iraq war, were drawn up after the foreign office expressed concern about the amount of defence-related UK material finding its way to the Gulf. However, the inquiry heard that a recommendation by Sir Richard Luce, then foreign office minister of state, that the new guidelines should be announced 'robustly and positively' to the House of Commons and in briefings to the media was never adopted. Instead the guidelines were announced in stages in response to parliamentary questions between April and October 1985. Earlier, Sir Richard said his department had found it increasingly difficult to defend an unannounced policy in the early 1980s that only 'non-lethal equipment' could be sold to Iran and Iraq. His view was that the guidelines needed to be made more restrictive as they were open to abuse. 'We found this a grey area . . . different ministers could form different opinions about what was lethal and what was not lethal,' he said. Without being drawn on any specific examples, Sir Richard said that if policy differences were not resolved between departments, it was the then prime-minister, Mrs Thatcher, who took the final decision. Previously-classified Whitehall documents released during the the trial last year of three former directors of Matrix-Churchill, the machine tool company, showed that British ministers agreed in 1989 to withhold from parliament revised rules banning the sale of defence-related equipment to Iraq.

This is an enormous improvement  over the existing situation, for instance in fighting the  smuggling of cars.    So far, four to six ministries, the embassies, and other  authorities had to be used in prosecuting offenses beyond  borders, Beckstein said yesterday after speaking to his  Hungarian colleague Imre Konya.    The CSU politician said that establishing an international  investigation pool is an objective to be put into practice in  the medium term. Only through access to other countries' car  registration data can international car smuggling gangs be  stopped.    Stolen cars are mainly taken across the eastern borders.  Beckstein estimates that this is true for 50 percent of the  150,000 cars reported stolen in Germany last year. The cheaper  cars went to Romania, the more expensive ones to the former  Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and Belarus.    At the Bavarian borders, 15,688 foreigners were seized for  trying to cross the border illegally. This figure is 22 percent  higher than last year. At the border with the Czech Republic  alone, 13,191 persons were discovered; in addition, border  police arrested 4,256 persons that were smuggled into the  country, which is an increase of 89 percent over 1992. A total  of 1,698 people were arrested for smuggling foreigners into the  country (126 percent more than in 1992).    Of the 29,378 persons arrested at Germany's borders last  year, 65 percent were seized by Bavarian border authorities.  The interior minister considered this to be a proof of the  particularly ""intensive investigation work"" done by Bavarian  border police.     "

The Yugoslav economists, the Foreign  Ministry's note reads, believe that for the complete revival of  economic productive departments one needs a minimum of 18 years,  something that from a social viewpoint is inconceivable.    In these conditions, one hopes for Serbian-Romanian  cooperation, mainly in the areas of metallurgy, machine  building, electrical engineering, electronics, chemicals, and  the pharmaceuticals industry. By starting with these actions as  soon as sanctions are lifted, the exchange might reach a volume  of 1 billion dollars by 1995. In this way, the revival of the  Yugoslav economy could be completed by the year 2000 and the  Romanian economy could make up for the losses suffered as a  result of the dismantling of the CEMA market and loosening of  relations with the CIS.    The aforementioned note also mentions that the Romanian side  expressed agreement with the cooperation projects presented by  the Serbian guests. However, it insisted that they should take  place only when sanctions are lifted, because currently the UN  Committee 724 sometimes shows a totally unjustified rigidity  toward any commercial operation with Yugoslavia.    At the meeting of the two countries' presidents, when the  sides examined the results of the talks, the Serbian side  launched the idea of building a free trade zone along the Bega  Canal [which crosses Timisoara], as soon as international  political conditions permit it. Considering that the idea of  creating certain free economic zones is a long-standing wish of  President Iliescu's, it was regarded with great interest and  will be implemented as soon as possible.

In an eve-of-poll twist, indelible ink supplied from Germany to mark hands and prevent anyone carrying out their democratic rights more than once was found to be washable. But Mr Massoud Barzani, leader of the KDP (Kurdistan Democratic party), one of two key parties contesting the election, said last night at a press conference in the mountains that 'our people at Salahuddin University' had managed to manufacture a substitute and that the election would take place tomorrow. Leaders had earlier played down the postponement as a 'technical hitch' while admitting there was a sense of anti-climax among a population keen to vote after years of war and violent repression by Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Late on Saturday evening Kurdish-controlled television stations broadcast news of the delay and yesterday guerrillas toured the countryside with loudspeakers. But at 8am yesterday, the time scheduled for opening booths, the isolated and troubled residents of Halachan, a village razed by Mr Saddam's soldiers in 1988, emerged from their tents still expecting to vote. At Hajiyawa, scene of heavy fighting during the Iran-Iraq war, Kurds hungry for news anxiously discussed developments by a fleet of empty Land Rovers collected to ferry voters from villages. An armed guerrilla said: 'The people don't like to postpone. They think it's not right.' The Kurdish leadership is anxious to gain international recognition for the elections. Mr Hoshyar Zebari, a leading KDP member, said on Friday he was disappointed that no US or British politicians were attending the poll, but he was relieved that other international monitors would be remaining. A US State Department spokesman in Washington had said that the US welcomed 'public and private assurances by the Iraqi Kurdish leadership that these elections will deal only with local administrative issues and do not represent a move towards separatism'. But Turkey and Iran, neighbouring states with large Kurdish populations, have both condemned the elections as being outside Iraqi law. Ankara has announced that, on Friday, 27 Turkish soldiers and 36 Kurdish separatist guerrillas of the Kurdish Workers party were killed in clashes near the Iraqi border. All levels of Kurdish society appreciate the international dimensions of the elections. The dream of full independence is evident among ordinary people, but with 100,000 Iraqi government troops on a 320-mile frontier with Kurdish-controlled areas, the most widespread hope voiced in the streets, bazaars and tea shops is that the Kurds be allowed to live in peace.

But in October, after an August cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War,  King Fahd ordered a halt in a war of words with Iran.

Hence the contracted project  business will give an impetus to the export of China-produced  equipment and materials. This will not only help increase the  country's foreign exchange earnings, but also will reduce  project construction costs substantially. In order to ensure  the smooth development of this type of business, some concrete  operational procedures and methods have been formulated, based  on practical experience gained over recent years, and a notice  is hereby served as follows:    1. Any company running an international economic and  technological cooperation project, as a contractor or  sub-contractor abroad, which needs to procure necessary  equipment, materials and supplies, as well as machinery and  tools from the home country, can lodge an application directly  to and go through export procedures as required with this  ministry. If the equipment and goods to be exported are subject  to export license control, the company is to apply to this  ministry for an export license, by presenting the project  contract it has signed with the foreign party.    2. The company applying for the export of  China-produced equipment and goods is to submit a photocopy of  the contract concerned, as well as the application form, in  duplicate, for the export of equipment and good with relation to  a contracted project (see Appendix 1), and two copies of the  detailed list of project- related equipment and goods that are  to be exported (see Appendix 2). Both the application form and  the detailed list must be printed on A4-sized paper, as  prescribed by the appendices.    3. The equipment and goods for the export of which an  international operation company has applied are to be used only  by the company itself to meet practical needs in the contracted  works, as declared, and they are never to be used for any other  purpose, nor are they to be resold. In order to prevent  overstocks, the equipment and goods needed to run a contracted  project can be exported in batches and stages so as to keep pace  with the progress of the project.

0,FT924-8506 ,"FT924-8506 _AN-CKKCIAAGFT 921111   FT  11 NOV 92 / Looser curbs discussed on eve of Iraqi invasion      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   JUST THREE weeks before Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait on August 2 1990, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, called a meeting of senior British ministers to consider the relaxation of restrictions on defence-related sales to Iraq. The meeting on July 19 1990 was the culmination of more than two years of Whitehall battles over guidelines set out in 1985 by the then foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, to prevent Britain arming either side in the Iran-Iraq war. Its conclusions, and background papers prepared beforehand, may prove one of the most fertile areas of investigation for the judicial inquiry set up yesterday by Lord Justice Scott. As a confidential Ministry of Defence background paper re-veals, the issue of machine tool sales to Iraq was at the heart of the meeting. The paper, dated July 17 1990, says ministers had five days earlier been issued with intelligence assessments of Iraq's 'strategic weapons programme'. Until then senior ministers might have claimed they were unaware of many of the detailed decisions taken by officials and more junior ministers which had allowed sales of sophisticated arms manufacturing equipment to Iraq over the previous two years. But on July 19, the government papers suggest, the issue was being discussed at the very top of the government. Last night Downing Street said Mr John Major, then chancellor, had not attended. But the papers make clear that a Treasury minister was represented. A cabinet office paper prepared for the meeting outlined a series of options. One favoured the status quo while another called for a formal relaxation of the rules. The third, strongly favoured by the MoD, suggested outright abolition of the special restrictions. Previously, the Department of Trade and Industry had fought tenaciously and, usually successfully, for the the loosest possible interpretation of the rules. By June 1990 Mr Nicholas Ridley, trade and industry secretary, decided to formalise the status quo. He wrote to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, to request the high-level review. Mr Hurd was chosen to chair it. Mr Ridley was forced to resign from the cabinet over some remarks on Europe five days before the meeting. The outcome is not documented in the mass of secret government papers which emerged this week from the collapse of the court case against machine tool manufacturers Matrix Churchill. In the event, any decisions made were quickly overtaken by the much tighter regime imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "

This was stated to ITAR-TASS today by Yevgeniy  Bolshakov, State Duma deputy from the LDPR, who was the first  representative of this party to visit Japan at the invitation of  the Foreign Ministry as a member of the Russian parliamentary  delegation. The delegation has left for Moscow today after its  week-long stay here.    The deputy said that of all political forces of Japan, the  LDPR would like to maintain contacts with the LDPR. The program  of the delegation had included a meeting with representatives of  that party, which used to be the ruling party in Japan.  Yevgeniy Bolshakov believes that in the course of this meeting  ""certain mutual understanding of the commonality of partisan  interests of factions of both parties in their respective  parliaments"" was achieved. ""Of course one cannot say that the  two parties are alike, but it appears that the LDPR and the LDP  of Japan have common concerns,"" he believes.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had extended invitations, via  Bolshakov, to the leaders of the LDP of Japan to visit the  congress of the Russian party which begins on 2 April in Moscow.  However, ITAR-TASS was told in the headquarters of the LDP of  Japan that no official document inviting party leaders to the  LDPR forum in Moscow had been received, and doubt was expressed  as to the feasibility of receiving it before the start of the  congress.    Asked whether the LDPR leader was planning to make a  personal  appearance in Tokyo, Yevgeniy Bolshakov said that Zhirinovskiy  probably intends, in principle, ""to take a closer look at  Japan;"" however, there are too many acute problems at home, and  at least ""April and May have been fully booked in his political  diary.""

Iran's  ambassador told journalists about his view of the role of the  press as a means of rapprochement and mutual understanding,  saying its functions are ""to reflect reality as it is, on the  basis of truth."" Complaining that previous reports about Iran  very often have not corresponded to reality, the ambassador gave  the media representatives a brief history of his country and a  report on the state of its economy. Devoting particular  attention to oil as an export item, Rasul Eslami denied the  claim that all profits from oil exports are being used to  purchase weapons. He also analyzed and criticized the former  Iranian regime and discussed the Iran-Iraq war and the state's  path of development since the Islamic revolution. As for Iran's  policy in regard to Kazakhstan and the other former Soviet  republics, he said that that policy is to help those states  along the path of independent development.    The visit to Kazakhstan by Iranian President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani (who during his 10-day trip will also visit  Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan) is a  reciprocal visit after last year's trip to Iran by President  Nursultan Nazarbayev. The delegation includes minister of  foreign affairs Ali Akbar Velayati, minister of economics and  finance Morteza Mohammad-khan, minister of roads and transport  Akbar Torkan, and other ministers. Iran's delegation of  representatives will include approximately 100 individuals,  among them public officials, members of the government, bankers,  industrialists and businessmen. Mr. Rafsanjani will be  accompanied on the trip by his wife and daughter (incidentally,  Miss Rafsanjani is chairman of the Iranian Women's Association).    During the visit there are plans for visits to Almaty and  Karaganda, as well as discussion and signing of a number of  documents in the areas of economics, politics, cultural  cooperation and education. In the opinion of Rasul Eslami all  this will serve to reinforce and expand the agreements reached  during Nursultan Nazarbayev's trip to Iran. No specific economic  cooperation projects were mentioned. However, the ambassador did  invite everyone to a special exhibit by the Islamic Republic of  Iran that is currently in Almaty and which should provide a  complete picture of the capabilities of Iran's heavy and light  industry and of 80 different companies.    The ambassador promised to open Iran's borders to  Kazakhstan's products so they can reach the world market. The  same will be true of oil and gas when they reach the Persian  Gulf.    In short, the ambassador is convinced that by reaching the  Persian Gulf Kazakhstan will be able to gain access to the world  market. An enticing prospect. As is the two sides' stake in it.     "

In an interview en route to Addis Ababa, he said possible  military intervention in Rwanda by the South African troops  would have to be carefully considered by the government. ""There  is no plan so far of any military action. But the spirit to  assist and desire to help is there.""    Mr Nzo and senior officials of his department arrived in  Addis Ababa on Wednesday afternoon to officially raise South  Africa's flag outside the Organisation of African Unity  headquarters.    South Africa became the 53rd member of the OAU on Monday.    Mr Nzo said South Africa would play a role in conflict  mediation efforts in Africa in consultation with the OAU and the  United Nations.    He warned against exaggerated expectations of economic  benefits arising from South Africa's admission to the OAU.  ""Charity begins at home. South Africa also has large foreign  debt and must do everything possible to end that debt.""    The foreign minister said South Africa's membership of the  OAU was ""the culmination of a dream that one day South Africa  will take its rightful place alongside the independent states of  Africa"".    South Africa would assist the continent in asserting itself  in international politics and there was an increased potential  for trade links with other African states.    He emphasised however that South Africa's foreign policy  would be guided by the priority of improving the lives of South  Africans. ""We are not going to foster big brother relations with  the rest of Africa. We are for mutual co-operation to help  uplift the other countries of Africa.""    The flag-raising ceremony, which would be attended by the  OAU  Secretary-General Dr Salim Ahmed Salim, is scheduled to take  place at 3PM SA [South African] time.     "

They will spend six months  there to train some 1,000 local soldiers in mine detection and  neutralization. The initiative is taking place with the  Development Cooperation Ministry, which is contributing 7.8  million Belgian francs and the United Nations Development  Program, which manages the Cambodia Mine Action Center. The  mine clearance unit of the army will supply three instructors  and the navy will supply one.    The intervention by the Belgian soldiers is not without  danger. Although the civil war has stabilized in Cambodia,  individual actions by members of the Khmer Rouge are still  reported. The instructors will work in the northwest of the  country, the area which saw the most intense fighting during the  war. In addition, during the first phase, the mine clearance  activities will be accompanied on location. It is estimated  that there are still 4 million mines in Cambodia.    It is the first time that the mine clearance department of  the Belgian Army has carried out an overseas mission of this  nature. However, army mine clearance specialists have been  active in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia and Rwanda since  1992. But these teams were responsible for neutralizing  unexploded devices in order to protect Belgian troops and bases.  At present, Belgian mine clearance experts are still in Croatia  and Rwanda. The support provided by the Development Cooperation  Ministry is based upon the assumption that mine clearance in  Cambodia is an essential pre-condition for the country to  redevelop itself. After all, farming is virtually impossible  while the countryside is full of mines. It is reported that one  Cambodian out of 236 has already lost one or several limbs.  Every month, mines are still killing or wounding another 200 or  300 people in the country. Of a surface area of 10,000 sq km in  Cambodia containing mines, only 4.5 km have been cleared.     "

Although entering the elections independently the SNS will  still ""cooperate closely"" with Meciar's Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slota says. ""We decided on  independent candidacy in the elections because with joint  candidacy our party would lose its identity."" ""In every nation  state a real political force should exist that protects the  interests of the nation. In the case of Slovakia it is the  SNS,"" he tells the paper.    Slota says he is disturbed by the attempts of Hungarian  politicians to declare the Hungarian minority living in Slovakia  to be part of the Hungarian nation. ""From the SNS point of view  we can only talk of Slovaks who speak Hungarian,"" he says.    Accordingly the party intends to defend the Slovaks living  in  the south, where Hungarians form a majority: pushing for a law  protecting Slovak as the main language in all schools, armed  services, in the population register and other documents. They  also vow to reject an ethnic conception in the envisaged  reorganization of local government.    Speaking of SNS rivals in the run-up to the elections (to be  held on September 30-October 1), Slota denounces parties of the  right as being either manifestly pro-Czech or mere vehicles for  the ""personal ambition of bankrupt turncoats from the SNS and  HZDS."" The latter, however, will not be able to form a  coalition because ""they lack unified political foundations, even  though many have shown that, enticed by a vision of personal  gain, they are capable of selling out.""

The net loss of  Fr212 million in 1992 was not an accident.    CGS is going through a serious crisis, due in the first  place  to poor economic conditions and to declining cost-plus contract  activities (which accounted for 30 percent of its sales in  1993). But the SSII [data-processing services and engineering  company] is also experiencing a severe disappointment,  especially in Germany, following Daimler-Benz's acquisition of  an interest in Sogeti and the creation of a joint subsidiary,  Cap Debis--owned 51 percent by Debis Systemhaus and 49 percent  by Cap Gemini Sogeti. ""Germany accounts for much of our  results,"" the management pointed out, acknowledging that the  creation of Cap Debis (Fr2.2 billion in sales) was ""a  significant financial failure."" Moreover, ""managing a 50-50 SSII  is tricky, and poor economic conditions just make it more  difficult."" This is why Cap Debis, which owned 20 percent of CCS  (the computing center management subsidiary), will become part  of Debis Systemhaus, the Daimler Benz subsidiary. The resulting  company will be worth about Fr6 billion, and CGS will obviously  become ""diluted"" in it. Without the German burden, the  management claims, results would be comparable to those of 1992.    The group will thus see itself forced to increase its  capital  by Fr1.5 billion. In addition, other assets will be sold,  without any geographic disengagement. While management claims  that their interest in the Sema Group still possesses strategic  value, they acknowledge that they will take part in negotiations  on the future of Cisi [International Data Processing Services  Company], 36 percent of which is owned by Sogeti. The year 1994  will be marked by the search for another partner, besides  Daimler Benz.     "
0,FT932-8644 ,"FT932-8644 _AN-DERDAAD3FT 930518   FT  18 MAY 93 / 'UK knew arms leaked to Iraq': Scott inquiry learns shipments via Jordan were suspected      By JIMMY BURNS   THE government agreed an important defence package with Jordan in 1985 although it suspected Jordan was being used to divert military equipment to Iraq, according to evidence gathered by the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry. Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, the counsel for the inquiry, said yesterday: 'Papers we have seen show that by 1985 there was government knowledge that Jordan was being used as a diversionary route for military equipment to Iraq.' Under government guidelines at the time, during the Iran-Iraq war, no equipment which might prolong the conflict should have been exported to either combatant. The revelation at the start of the second week of public hearings in the Scott inquiry raises renewed and potentially embarrassing questions about a deal that involved government ministers, and a secretive government-owned company. Government documents held by the inquiry team show that in September 1985, the government signed a memorandum of understanding between the UK and Jordan. This was later to result in a Pounds 270m defence package which was arranged by International Military Services (IMS), a defence company wholly owned at the time by the ministry of defence. In response questions in parliament, both Mr John Major and Mrs Thatcher, when prime minister, have in the past refused to comment on IMS on grounds of commercial confidentiality. Miss Baxendale referred to previously restricted MoD documents which show that IMS was criticised by two defence officials in July 1985 for allegedly attempting to evade the guidelines. The criticism referred to a contract for the supply of armoured recovery vehicle spare parts to Iraq which were instead used to supply tanks . The inquiry also heard evidence yesterday from Sir Adam Butler, minister for defence procurement between September 1984 and September 1985. Questioned about government knowledge of Jordanian diversion of military equipment and of the internal criticism of IMS, Sir Adam said he had no personal knowledge of either, although he accepted that his post made him responsible for IMS's conduct as a company. The inquiry headed by Lord Justice Scott was set up in November in response to public controversy surrounding the collapse of the Matrix-Churchill case in which three former directors of the machine tools company had been accused of illegally trying to export arms-making equipment to Iraq. The inquiry is investigating whether official guidelines were breached with the knowledge or complicity of the government. The inquiry next Monday will take evidence from Sir Hal Miller, a former leading Conservative backbencher who in April 1990 revealed that he had warned the government about Iraq's supergun two years before parts for it were seized by UK customs officers. Evidence will be taken tomorrow from Mr Paul Channon, the former trade minister. Meanwhile, officials close to the inquiry confirmed that members of the intelligence services are continuing to give evidence in private hearings, but that the same opportunity will not be allowed for ministers.

The 108 legislators from 35 countries at the Asia-Pacific  Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) conference on ""science and  technology for regional sustainable development"" made the call  in a document unanimously adopted at the end of their five-day  meeting in a Tokyo hotel.    The document, titled ""Inventing the Future: Science and  Technology for Sustainable Development,"" said the  parliamentarians ""viewed human capital as the most valuable  resource a country can possess for its advancement.""    But the document said the Asia-Pacific region contains the  majority of the world's population below the poverty line and  this can only be altered if countries in the region cooperate in  the formation of scientific and technological partnerships aimed  at regional sustainable growth.    ""It is clearly recognized that there are important linkages  between poverty, population growth and pressures on the  environment,"" the document said.    ""Poverty is indeed one of the great sources of environmental  degradation.    ""Any practical strategy for sustainable development demands  that basic needs of the population be met as a matter of the  highest priority.""    The document said strategies to improve living standards  should include expanding connections among business, industry  and universities, and more emphasis on science and technology in  government decision-making, particularly in new technologies  like biotechnology, information sciences and bioenergy.    It also recommended greater involvement of women in  scientific and technological activity.    Outlining the contents of the document at a press conference  after the meeting, Goku Menon, head of the Indian delegation to  the conference, said it focused on the uses of science and  technology in meeting the basic needs of people in the region.    He said the conference was an example of the growth of  regional ties which will lead to greater scientific and  technological cooperation at the expense of ""narrow nationalism""  in the region.

Soon after he arrived, Mr.  Roussin went to meet the country's authorities, particularly  President Ange-Felix Patasse, who granted him a very lengthy  audience late this morning. At the end of the audience, the  French minister expressed satisfaction with the resumption of  school activities and work in the public sector. He also  reiterated his country's stand towards Africa by stating that  France is not abandoning Africa. He redefined the orientation  of French aid, and referred to the 30-billion French franc  package allocated to banks in the franc zone. Here is Mr.  Roussin responding to questions from the press.    [Begin recording] [Roussin] Whenever France makes  commitments it honors them. When Africa makes certain decisions  France remains loyal to it. When it is said here and there that  France is ditching Africa, France is abandoning its friends, and  that a new page has been turned -- that is all baseless. You  are not abandoning your friends when you give 30 billion francs  to help them go through a delicate transition for the  relaunching of real growth and development. That is not true.  So, indeed, not only have we taken considerable measures --  during a difficult period for us -- to support this courageous  decision from the African countries -- and it will be seen  within a few months that all of us within the franc zone made a  good decision -- but even the backup measures have to be  negotiated between the various parties.    We have also put strong pressure on international  institutions so that everybody, taking into account the efforts  made by Africa, in turn, comes to Africa's aid. On 22 February,  I will be going to Brussels to see EC chief Jacques Delors and,  there too, champion Africa's cause and explain the efforts that  have been made, so that Europe can also participate in assisting  Africa. You talked about the backup measures [words indistinct]  minister with whom we met this morning, well, France will make  additional efforts. You know, in addition, we have constituted  a special fund to help -- in countries where this will be  necessary -- the most underprivileged people during this  transition period following the devaluation decision, until the  point arrives where economies start picking up again under the  new conditions.    [Unidentified correspondent] You talked about 30 billion  francs, how will these funds be distributed among the various  countries?    [Roussin] These 30 billion francs represent general aid from  France. In effect, it constitutes the cancellation of Africa's  debt. Africa owed France 25 billion francs, and we are  canceling that debt. There is 5 billion in project assistance  -- France wants to keep this rate up in cooperation efforts,  efforts made by the government and which are accepted by the  National Assembly and the Senate -- which is continuing. In  addition, we have this special social assistance fund. [passage  omitted] Therefore, France does not intend to ditch Africa.  France without Africa would not be the same. We are bound, we  are united. The success of these current operations will be the  success of Africa, it will be that of the Central African  Republic, and also that of France. We are closely bound within  the franc zone family and nobody can [words indistinct].  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] [passage indistinct]    [Roussin] I know that on 15 February an agreement was signed  between the appropriate minister and the head of mission. I  myself have signed other agreements that [words indistinct] were  very considerable and that apparently have been disbursed. The  French Cooperation Fund has been given very specific directives.  The Cooperation Mission has been given very specific  directives. The IMF has committed itself. The World Bank has  committed itself -- the first disbursements of the World Bank  for some countries are already under way -- and we have never  joined hands as much as now in order to manage a problem of such  dimensions.

All China's counties will get electricity supplies and over  95 percent of farmers' households are then expected to be  supplied with electricity, officials said at a meeting here  today of the Rural Electrification Working Conference, jointly  sponsored by the State Planning Commission, the State Economic  and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Electricity Industry.    At the meeting, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua urged departments of  electricity and local governments to cooperate with each other  in supplying electricity to the farmers through self-reliance  and by exploiting local resources in the poverty-stricken areas  so that the local farmers can become prosperous as soon as  possible.    China's rural electrification process achieved remarkable  progress since the 1960s, sources at the meeting said. By the  end of 1993, 97 percent of townships, 93 percent of villages and  89 percent of farmers' households had been able to use  electricity.    Per capita annual electricity consumption for the rural  population reached 48 kilowatt-hours in 1993, 7.9 times the  figure for 1978.    Many large power stations are supplying electricity to the  rural areas. Thousands of small thermal or hydro-electric power  stations have been built, while wind and solar energy are also  being used.    However, there are still 28 counties that have virtually no  electricity supply. And about 120 million farmers in a dozen  provinces and autonomous regions, mostly in western China, are  waiting to get electricity.    Officials said that these areas, often sparsely populated,  are the most difficult to be electrified because they are far  from the large regional electricity network, their local  economic growth is slow and local finance tight.    According to a blueprint on the electrification of China's  rural areas in the 1990s which was presented to the meeting by  the Ministry of Electricity, most of China's poor villages will  be able to use electricity in the coming few years.

The meeting emphasized the satisfaction with the action  taken  to promote cooperation between the two countries through the  Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation that will  be signed by Macedonian Science Minister Aslan Selmani and  Konomi.    It was concluded that this agreement was very important for  promoting cooperation in the area of science as a basis for  cooperation in more important areas of mutual interest for the  two countries. The possibilities for cooperation envisaged in  the agreement open the road to bilateral and multilateral  cooperation between the two states, as well as cooperation among  the countries in the Balkans, Europe, and the world. Regional  scientific projects are the main projects for which financing is  envisaged by the European Union and the United Nations, above  all traffic, economic, energy, information, and ecology programs.    Yesterday, the Albanian delegation also had a meeting with  the president of the Macedonian Academy of Science and Arts,  Ksente Bogoev. Interest in cooperation between the two  academies was expressed, as well as general readiness to  organize a meeting of the delegations of the academies in Skopje  and Tirana. Cooperation can be also implemented by organizing a  scientific symposium on the ecological protection of Lake Ohrid,  which is of great significance for both countries.    Frederika Popovska-Pavlovska, vice president of St. Cyril  and  Methodius University and responsible for international  cooperation, informed the guests from Albania about the  organization in our universities.

A reportage by our correspondent Vladimir Izotov has the  details.    [Izotov] (Felix Leon Carabello), consul general of the  Republic of Cuba in St. Petersburg, did not conceal the fact  that the main aim of the news conference was to attract the  attention of Russian and, in the first place, St. Petersburg  businessmen toward cooperation with his country.    In the early 1980's trade turnover between Cuba and the  Soviet Union was some 7 to 8 billion rubles [R] per annum, Mr.  (Caraballo) recalled, in terms of the ruble exchange rate at  that time. Now it would be excellent if the target of R1.5 to 2  billion could be achieved, he added.    After the break-up of the Soviet Union and the Council for  Mutual Economic Assistance, considerable changes took place in  Cuba, the consul general said. Circulation of foreign currency  has been legalized in the country. Joint enterprises, in the  first place in the sphere of tourism, have undergone development.    The most hurtful thing, Mr. (Caraballo) added, is that the  place of the Soviet Union in the development of such sectors of  the Cuban economy as the nickel and oil refining industries has  been taken not by Russia but by Canada, Sweden, and other  western countries.    In reply to a question by the Radio Rossii correspondent  about trade cooperation with our country, Cuba's consul general  remarked that not very long ago an agreement was signed on the  delivery of 1 billion tonnes of Cuba sugar to Russia in exchange  for 2.5 billion tonnes of Russian oil. The government of St.  Petersburg and Leningrad oblast is showing an interest in  developing partner relations with Cuba, Mr. (Caraballo)  remarked. The joint (Petrokub) firm is already in operation --  it is engaged in exporting Cuban tobacco to St. Petersburg. A  joint enterprise for the delivery of Cuban medicines to Russia's  northwestern region will start functioning soon.     "

The project in this capital of northeast China's Jilin  Province, where the country's number one automobile plant is  located, marks a new wave of overseas investment in China's  automotive industry.    Just before this project, the Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile  Corporation signed an agreement with Ford Motor Co. of the  United States to produce interior decoration parts for cars.    China is described as the world's largest potential auto  market, as some 270 million families are estimated to be  potential auto owners. Listed by China as one of the backbone  industries, auto production is expected to hit three million  vehicles a year by the end of the century, fueling demands for  auto parts.    As most of China's auto manufacturers started by assembling  foreign parts, domestic part makers have to greatly reduce costs  when China approaches its resumption of its status in GATT (the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). Joint production with  foreign auto makers is an option or even a way out for some  Chinese firms, experts say.    According to an official from the Ministry of  Machine-Building, most of the China's existing 116 auto makers  are Sino-foreign joint ventures. He added that China will  divert auto joint-ventures to auto parts production. He said  China plans to establish 200 enterprises to build another 200  auto parts production plants within the century, and so  Sino-foreign co-operation, he said, will be of vital importance.    in light of the growing Chinese market, Ford of the United  States set up a special department to deal with Chinese business  this year. General Motors started a joint venture to make auto  parts in Beijing this April and another two ventures are being  discussed with Chinese partners in Henan and Shenyang. Similar  Sino-foreign auto parts enterprises have also been established  by companies from France and other countries.     "

Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius said he  expects  the memorandum to serve as a basis for other documents that  would define specific forms of defense cooperation, including  acquisition of weapons by Lithuania.    The assistant U.S. secretary of defense for regional  security  affairs, Charles Freeman, said the memorandum, which is under  preparation, provides for wide-ranging cooperation and expressed  hope that Lithuania and the United States will smoothly approach  its signing.    At a press conference in Vilnius Monday, Freeman said the  United States intends to sign similar accords with all countries  in East and Central Europe, except a majority of former Soviet  republics. The official said the fact that the Baltics are  offered such cooperation witnesses the continuity of a policy  according to which the United States never formally recognized  the annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the Soviets  in 1940.    U.S. and Lithuanian delegations, headed by Linkevicius and  Freeman, met Monday to discuss possibilities for closer defense  cooperation, as well as to exchange views on the preparation of  Lithuania's ""Partnership for Peace"" presentation document, the  defense doctrine, the national security concept and the creation  of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion.

Guyana, 25 years ago, occupied the piece of land which she  claims to be hers. The countries are disputing about where the  source of the bordering Corantijn River is. The problem  originates from the time when Suriname was a colony of the  Netherlands and Guyana a colony of England. Holland and England  then agreed that the Corantijn River would be the border to  Suriname and Guyana, taking the uppper Corantijn as the source  of the Corantijn. Now President Ronald Venetiaan suggests  international mediation to solve this problem. However, the  border dispute should not stand in the way of positive  collaboration between the two nations, say the Surinamese  president.    During a special address to the National Assembly on Tuesday  [21 June], Guyana's president, Cheddi Jagan, said the Corantijn  River should not be dividing, but uniting the two countries. He  suggested that the parliaments of Suriname and Guyana make laws  that enable mutual private investments in the two countries.    [Jagan] Clearly we cannot be satisfied merely with the  establishment of democratic institutions. Our democratic  institutions, including our parliaments, must function in a  manner that puts the welfare of our people at the central point  of our purpose.    [Riedewald] Bilateral collaboration is not enough says  Jagan.  Suriname and Guyana should also work together within regional  organizations.    During his four-day visit to Suriname, President Jagan  visited the state oil company, the banana company, and  (Effebacher) power plants and other production facilities in  Suriname.

In the statement,  the two countries agree to continue developing their relations,  aimed at cultivating new areas of bilateral cooperation.  Patterson then returned to his country.

He said such  decisions arise from a consensus among the member nations. He  did say, however, he views the Cuban situation as a priority  issue for the regional organization.    Undoubtedly, Cuba's political system is different. There is  no reason, then, to exclude Cuba from the family of Western  nations,"" he said.

Patterson predicted a positive outcome from the current  negotiations between Colombia and the Caribbean Common Market  (Caricom), of which Jamaica is a member. The talks are aimed at  confirming a free trade agreement to be signed in July. He also  announced aeronautics officials from the two countries will meet  in San Andres at the end of May to complete the final details on  an air transportation agreement to promote further development  of bilateral relations.

0,FT924-8672 ,"FT924-8672 _AN-CKJB2ADAFT 921110   FT  10 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The Matrix case   THE CASE against three former executives of the Matrix Churchill company, withdrawn by the public prosecutor yesterday, has cast a disturbing glare on the apparent ineffectiveness of government controls on exports of military hardware. What is not clear, however, is whether these procedures were merely ineffective, or whether in some sense the government was conniving at the circumvention of its own declared export control policy, in pursuit of quite different foreign policy objectives. The executives were accused of selling machine tools to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, despite a government ban on military-type exports to either of the warring parties; but it emerged in court that Mr Alan Clark, former trade minister, and government officials had deliberately encouraged the company to conceal what they knew was the military end-use of the machine tools. The weaknesses of the export control procedures were inevitably compounded by the involvement of British intelligence. Illicit arms exports may seem to be a useful channel for acquiring sensitive information. Yet Britain, along with its allies, proved anything but well-informed about Iraq's political intentions and about its weapons programmes. So perhaps the trade was more advantageous to Iraq than to Britain. One plausible explanation for the circumvention of the arms embargo was that the British government secretly supported Iraq in the war against Iran. In principle the embargo was imposed equally on both countries, and no doubt the government would have viewed an even-handed stalemate with equanimity. Yet it undoubtedly feared most the prospect of an Iranian victory, with the accompanying danger that the fundamentalist regime in Tehran could dominate the whole Gulf. Such a judgment was certainly shared by the French government. But the big difference between British and French policy was that Paris openly proclaimed a strategic alliance with Saddam Hussein, whereas British support remained unofficial. The invasion of Kuwait showed that it was more prudent to fear Iran than to trust Iraq. As a result, the British government has been embarrassed by the latest revelations; whereas France suffered the deeper shock of a betrayed alliance. But if British governments depart for reasons of state from declared high principle to hard realpolitik, at least they should do so with greater competence than was shown in the Matrix case.

He said this in a speech to about 200 students and teachers  at Qinghua University, one of the most prestigious in China.    He expressed his satisfaction with the academic exchanges  between the universities of the two countries over the last  decade.    He made the speech during a tour of the university after his  meeting with Chinese acting Premier Zhu Rongji in the morning.    Following the speech, three Qinghua professors gave him an  outline of the cooperative projects between Qinghua University  and Canadian ones.    Professor Zhao Chunjun, deputy dean of the School of  Economics and Management of Qinghua, told Hnatyshyn that since  the Sino- Canadian cooperative project on management education  began in 1984, over 30 Canadian professors had taught at  Qinghua, and a center had been set up in the university to train  Chinese management officials.    About 200 Chinese managers had taken courses on  international  marketing, international finance, technology transfer,  securities and stocks, as well as development of human  resources, Zhao said, adding that the project had yielded good  results.    In the afternoon, Hnatyshyn visited the Beijing  International  Earth Station.    There he attended a ceremony marking the finish of initial  testing of the first phase of construction of the Beijing  domestic satellite telecommunications earth-station, a  cooperative project between China's Post and Telecommunication  Ministry and the spar company of Canada.    It was learned that 19 earth stations will be established in  China after the project is completed, and 14 of them have been  set up in the first stage. China and the Canadian company were  satisfied with the testing of the first phase of the project.

Llewellyn Smith,  director general of Cern, said in an interview with XINHUA here  today.    CERN, set up in 1954, is the world's biggest organization  for  basic research on particle physics.    Nineteen countries participate in CERN, with 5,000 staff  members and 500 scientists from outside the participant  countries.    Prof. Smith said CERN has attracted scientists from around  the globe, and its research is of great significance. At  present, half of the world's high-energy physicists are listed  in CERN.    He said CERN has cooperated with China for more than 10  years, and about 80 Chinese scientists are doing research in  CERN today.    Smith said, ""We very much welcome Chinese scientists to join  CERN. They bring with them wisdom and products. We are looking  forward to further cooperation with China, including cooperation  in new experiments and construction of new accelerators.""    He said CERN's success is the result of close cooperation  between scientists from different countries.    Chinese scientists have contributed a lot to the L3  [expansion unknown] experiment chaired by famous physicist Prof.  Samuel C.C. Ting, Smith added.    Prof. Ting, a Nobel laureate in physics, told XINHUA that  his  joint work with Chinese scientists dates back to 1977, after  which time 10 to 20 Chinese scientists were sent to work with  him annually.    He said that the Chinese scientists had made important  contributions in the fields of theory and digital analysis.    He said Chinese scientists collaborated in the design and  construction of Laboratory L3 in 1982. They undertook the  building and experiments on the BGO crystal, a time- and  energy-consuming task.    Due to their efforts, the first mass quantity of BGO  crystal,  12 tons, was reaped.    As for CERN-China cooperation promoting China's research in  high energy physics, Smith said that the cooperation provided  Chinese scientists with opportunities to explore physical  origins on the front line of physical structure research while  exposing them to a lot of high technologies, concerning  superconduction, high frequencies, high vacuums and computer  networking, thus training them well in these aspects.

CONCERTED ACTION IS SEEN  AS UNLIKELY.      By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAIRO      Arab foreign ministers huddled in emergency session throughout the day Thursday  at a plush hotel next to the Nile, debating how to respond to Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein's brazen invasion of Kuwait earlier in the day.    They broke for lunch. They phoned home. They plunged in again at dusk, calling  for more coffee. But by mid-evening, the only thing they had agreed on was to  meet again today.    Even a prominent Egyptian diplomat was embarrassed. ""The Arab world,"" he  sighed. ""They're all walking around this afternoon the same way they were this  morning. 'What to be done? What to be done?' ""    Such is the Arab world's dilemma in confronting the brash Iraqi president who  has emerged at once as its most prominent leader and its most savage dictator,  the new standard-bearer for Arab unity and the single greatest threat to his  neighbors anywhere in the world.    Even Saudi Arabia, whose famed multibillion-dollar defense budget has built one  of the most technologically sophisticated arsenals in the region, appears to  have found itself powerless to stop Iraq's decisive march into Kuwait. It is a  march in defiance of regional cooperation pacts and Hussein's recent pledge to  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, as recently as a few days ago, that he would  not resort to force.    ""It's like a thumb in Mubarak's eye, and he knows it,"" one Western diplomat  said. ""At this point, I don't think any one state is able to counteract the  Iraqis, and it just doesn't seem likely that there will be any concerted  action.""    Kuwait pleaded with the ministers to adopt a resolution condemning the invasion  and also sought military intervention from the 21-nation Arab League and from  its neighbors on the Gulf Cooperation Council, a coalition of Persian Gulf  states whose primarily economic union also included a mutual defense pact.    But sources close to the talks said the ministers found themselves unable even  to agree to condemn the invasion, in large part because of opposition from two  staunch Iraqi allies, Yemen and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Gulf  Cooperation Council members -- Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and  the United Arab Emirates -- met earlier in the day and broke up without issuing  a statement.    The Egyptian president held intense contacts with Arab leaders throughout the  region Thursday, proposing an emergency Arab League summit in Cairo as early as  the next few days. But most attention focused quietly on the Saudis, who have  the most muscle to apply against Iraq -- and the most to lose if it doesn't  work.    Saudi Arabia's vast oil wealth -- almost 40% of it annually spent on defense --  has enabled it to amass one of the most sophisticated weapons networks in the  Middle East. Its 65,700-member armed forces is by far the largest among the  Gulf Cooperation Council countries; its air force is equipped with sleek F-15  and F-53 fighter jets; the Saudis operate U.S.-supplied AWACS airborne early  warning systems and sport 550 main battle tanks.    But the Iraqis have 1 million troops under arms, finely honed from Iraq's  recent eight-year-long war with Iran. They are prepared to deploy up to 5,500  tanks and 513 combat aircraft, including fairly advanced Soviet-made MIG-23s  and the French-built Mirage F-1s.    ""The quick answer is, they (the Saudis) are not a powerful force.

Allowing an Arab counterstrike from Saudi soil could have dangerous  repercussions if the strike fails. And the Saudis are equally wary of seeking  too much assistance from the United States because -- with their own regime  occasionally buffeted mildly by internal dissent -- they don't want to appear  to be, in the words of one analyst, ""too dependent on the U.S.""    ""They're just helpless.

CONCERTED ACTION IS SEEN  AS UNLIKELY.      By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAIRO      Arab foreign ministers huddled in emergency session throughout the day Thursday  at a plush hotel next to the Nile, debating how to respond to Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein's brazen invasion of Kuwait earlier in the day.    They broke for lunch. They phoned home. They plunged in again at dusk, calling  for more coffee. But by mid-evening, the only thing they had agreed on was to  meet again today.    Even a prominent Egyptian diplomat was embarrassed. ""The Arab world,"" he  sighed. ""They're all walking around this afternoon the same way they were this  morning. 'What to be done? What to be done?' ""    Such is the Arab world's dilemma in confronting the brash Iraqi president who  has emerged at once as its most prominent leader and its most savage dictator,  the new standard-bearer for Arab unity and the single greatest threat to his  neighbors anywhere in the world.    Even Saudi Arabia, whose famed multibillion-dollar defense budget has built one  of the most technologically sophisticated arsenals in the region, appears to  have found itself powerless to stop Iraq's decisive march into Kuwait. It is a  march in defiance of regional cooperation pacts and Hussein's recent pledge to  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, as recently as a few days ago, that he would  not resort to force.    ""It's like a thumb in Mubarak's eye, and he knows it,"" one Western diplomat  said. ""At this point, I don't think any one state is able to counteract the  Iraqis, and it just doesn't seem likely that there will be any concerted  action.""    Kuwait pleaded with the ministers to adopt a resolution condemning the invasion  and also sought military intervention from the 21-nation Arab League and from  its neighbors on the Gulf Cooperation Council, a coalition of Persian Gulf  states whose primarily economic union also included a mutual defense pact.    But sources close to the talks said the ministers found themselves unable even  to agree to condemn the invasion, in large part because of opposition from two  staunch Iraqi allies, Yemen and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Gulf  Cooperation Council members -- Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and  the United Arab Emirates -- met earlier in the day and broke up without issuing  a statement.    The Egyptian president held intense contacts with Arab leaders throughout the  region Thursday, proposing an emergency Arab League summit in Cairo as early as  the next few days.

At the end of a 48-hour visit to Mexico, the diplomat stated  there is currently no country that can replace the United States  in its position before the world. ""The United States is not the  world's gendarme; it is the head of an overall moral operation  for peace, stability, liberty, and security. It is not a matter  of having a policeman; instead, it is a highly responsible  country,"" he said.    Peres and Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello reported  the  acceptance of five Israeli proposals, which include negotiating  a free trade agreement, avoiding double taxes, carrying out  cultural exchange, and modifying Mexico's position at the United  Nations.    The Mexican diplomat explained that Israel proposed  negotiating the bilateral free trade agreement based on the  agreement it has with the United States and said that this issue  must be analyzed.    The Mexican diplomat said it will be necessary to get the  text of the U.S.-Israel free trade agreement prior to the  negotiations so the document can be studied by the Mexican trade  secretariat to learn what commitments, rights, and obligations  it entails. After adding that the next step will be to determine  whether those issues are compatible with Mexican laws, Tello  said there is certainly a willingness to negotiate the trade  agreement.    The Mexican foreign secretary said the second point proposed  by Peres to Mexico was to sign a treaty which prevents double  taxes between the two countries. Work on this treaty is well  ahead of schedule and is about to conclude; and all they will  have to do is set the date for signing the document.    Tello indicated that another proposal is to sign an  agreement  to create a double fund that encourages research and development  in various sectors, which shall be determined by the two nations.    The fourth point in Peres' proposal, he indicated, was to  adopt specific measures to give an additional boost to cultural  exchange, and the fifth point refers to the request that Mexico  modify its position at the United Nations on environment issues.

0,FT921-12078 ,"FT921-12078 _AN-CA2A2AAQFT 920129   FT  29 JAN 92 / Israel worried over Iran's nuclear plans      By HUGH CARNEGY      JERUSALEM   ISRAEL, for years a discreet partner with Iran against Arab powers, has begun to voice concern over Tehran's military ambitions, saying it is in the early stages of developing a domestic nuclear weapons programme similar to that pursued by Iraq. This week, the defence establishment has alleged publicly that unspecified German and other European companies, some of whom previously co-operated with Iraqi non-conventional arms projects, were now working in Iran. 'Israel will not remain inactive on the subject of German and European aid to Iran in the development of nuclear and chemical weapons and will not remain indifferent to the active threat of an extreme and unpredictable regime,' Mr Eliyahu Ben Elisar, chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee, told Ha'aretz newspaper. In the past, notably during the reign of the late Shah, Israel itself traded oil, arms, equipment and technological know-how with Iran, which it cultivated as an important regional counterweight to Arab states. Contacts survived the Shah's overthrow, despite the advent of the virulently anti-Israeli Khomeini regime, and Israel continued to supply arms during the Iran-Iraq war. In late 1989, the US confirmed Israel had bought oil from Iran in a deal linked to efforts to win the freedom of Israeli servicemen held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. Now, however, with those efforts still frustrated, officials say they are worried by Iranian ambitions to become a dominant regional power, filling the vacuum left by Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War a year ago. Their concern has been heightened by Iran's opposition to Middle East peace talks, which most Arab states have accepted, and its efforts to forge ties with Islamic former Soviet Asian republics. In off-the-record briefings, military sources have said Tehran is in the early stages of a nuclear programme which, if successful, could produce an 'Islamic bomb' by the end of the decade. They say it is modelled on the Iraqi efforts to acquire foreign technology. They say Iran is seeking co-operation with China and Pakistan, having ordered a small reactor and acquired a 'calutron' isotope isolation device from Beijing for research purposes. It is also trying to buy a 5-10 megawatt reactor from India. The sources say Israel has no evidence that Soviet nuclear scientists have been brought to Iran, as some reports have suggested. But they say links have been made with European companies -which they did not name - for the supply of equipment with nuclear uses. Israel is also worried by Iran's conventional forces. The sources say Tehran acquired 'several dozen' 500km-range, Scud-C ballistic missiles from North Korea last year to add to its shorter-range Scud-B rockets, and has plans to acquire longer-range missiles. Iran, the sources say, has shown no sign of giving back more than 100 Iraqi jets whose pilots flew them across the border during the Gulf War.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

But it appears to  have failed to realize the anticipated results, as usual, due to  the poor investment climate and imperfect laws.    More than one year after the laws related to foreigners'  investments were established, the economic trade group of Nampo  City, North Korea, visited the Korean Autonomous Government of  Yanbian on the 11th of the month, calling for economic trade and  joint ventures. Even last July, Pak Hwa-ryong, Vice-Chairman of  Administrative Economic Committee of North Hamkyong Province is  said to have visited here to explain the construction of the  Chongjin-Najin and Chongjin-Hoeryong Expressways. This means  North Korea devotes all its energies to expanding the social  overhead capital to invite foreign investment. In addition, it  concluded with China an ""Economic Trade Cooperation Protocol""  the gist of which is to activate border trade, etc., and an  ""Agreement to Construct Railroads and Harbors on the Tumen,"" and  made a contract for the development of the Najin-Sonbong area  which will cost $100 million and involve 21 Russian enterprises,  they say.    Since the Cooperation Law was established in 1984, North  Korea has been said to explain the inactivity of foreign  investment as due not only to the poor infrastructure but also  to the imperfect investment system. Accordingly, as measures  following the three Laws, the ""Foreigners' Investment Law,""  ""Joint Venture Law,"" and ""Foreigners' Enterprise Law,"" which  were established last year, North Korea established the  ""Foreigners' Investment Enterprise and Foreigners' Tax Law,""  ""Foreign Exchange Control Law,"" and ""Free Economic Trade Zone  Law"" last February to invite foreign investment, they say. But  North Korea's laws on foreign investment are abstract and  mutually inconsistent--possibly the general trend of socialist  states' laws. The three laws established at the beginning of  this year are also seen as more logically complemented and  followed by additional legislative measures.    Foreigners' Investment Enterprise and Foreigners' Tax Law  (Chapter 8, Article 57). This is a basic law related to taxes  which should be paid by foreigners' investment enterprises or  foreigners performing economic activities within the North  Korean territory. It prescribes income-, property-,  inheritance-, sales-, and local taxes, as well as related  sanctions and exemptions. Because this law has many points  conflicting with established cooperation companies' and  foreigners' income tax laws and their detailed rules, some  provisions of the law seem to lose their validity on the  principle of the priority of the new law.    The causes of inactivity are inconsistent laws and poor  infrastructure. North Korea levies graduated income tax rates on  foreign enterprises -- 25% (general area) and 14%  (free  economic trade zone) of the settled rate of interest. It is  known that the law levies lower tax rates than those (30%  and  15%) of China, which it views as a rival. And it  prescribes  that foreigners staying more than one year pay personal income  tax on income from outside as well as inside the territory  (Article 17). Although North Korea has more favorable tax rates  on enterprises than does China, it levies more unfavorable  income tax rates on private persons. This seems to negatively  influence foreign investment plans.    Property tax is levied on buildings, ships and aircraft in  North Korea (Article 25). Inheritance tax is levied not only  inside but outside of North Korea (Article 31). This seems to be  a step to confiscate assets that residents repatriate from Japan  and those of Japanese wives residing in North Korea who inherit  from their families in Japan. But as the provisions of the law  apply to ""Korean residents residing outside the territory of the  Republic who perform economic activities within its territory,""  questions are raised as to whether the provisions apply to South  Korean enterprises. Because North Korea has thus far insisted  politically on the concept of ""One Korea,"" the territory of the  ""Republic"" as the whole Korean peninsula, some say that South  Korea is included in the territory of the ""Republic."" In the  Cooperation Law, the first law related to foreign investment,  its application is to be limited to ""foreign enterprises and  individuals"" and ""Korean residents abroad including Korean  merchants and industrialists in Japan,"" clearly eliminating  South Korean enterprises from participation. But in the laws on  foreigners' investments established after last year, the subject  of application, unlike the Cooperation Law, is prescribed to be  ""Korean residents residing outside of the territory of the  Republic."" Accordingly, a dominant opinion is that it allows  South Korean enterprises (and individuals) to participate. A  noticeable problem is how North Korea interprets this in  connection with the idea of ""One Korea.""    In addition, even if South Korean enterprises are subject to  the laws in the same way as foreign enterprises, a question is  raised as to which of the two, the North-South Fundamental  Agreement or these laws, is applied to South Korean enterprises  when the North levies taxes. It is prescribed in the laws that  foreign enterprises and individuals should observe the agreement  concluded by their government and North Korea's government on  taxes when the agreement is different from the laws (Article  17). In relation to this provision, when the North-South Joint  Economic Cooperation Committee concludes agreements on dual  taxation prevention and investment promotion, will such an  exception in the laws be applied even to South Korean  enterprises?    Because the North-South Fundamental Agreement is applicable,  the North and South are in ""a special relationship which is not  one between nations."" If South Korean enterprises are not  subject to the exceptional provision (Article 17) of the law due  to the special relationship, they may have more unfavorable  liability to taxation than other countries.    Free Economic Trade Zone Law (Chapter 7, Article 43). This  is  a basic law that regulates foreign investment in the  Najin-Sonbong area, which is called a small golden triangle, and  another free economic trade zone which will be designated in the  future. The law prescribes the authority and duties of an agency  to manage the area, maintenance of circumstances for economic  activities, tariffs, currency, finance, security and preference,  and settlement of disputes, etc. The law reflects North Korea's  intentions to make good use of the free economic trade zone as a  window for opening their economy by bestowing tax privileges on  business activities and opening up foreign exchange markets to  foreigners within the zone. The law stipulates that the  organizations which develop and manage the zone are the Foreign  Economic Committee of the central government and the local  authorities. By the suggestion that the central government is  one organization which controls and leads the open-economy  policy, it has been made clear what organization takes charge of  the policy.    Because the law mandates that foreign enterprises should,  even in the zone, employ and dismiss manpower on contracts made  with North Korean manpower supply organizations, inflexibility  of labor management has been raised as a major potential  problem. And every account must settled in Korean ""Won"" or  convertible foreign currency. This will mean North Korea will  aim at collecting foreign currency.    Foreign Exchange Control Law (Chapter 4, Article 31). This  law outlines the general rules and system of foreign currency  transactions, foreign securities issues, movement of foreign  currency in and out of the country, securities and precious  metals, etc.    Carrying foreign currency into the country is not limited.  But approval by the foreign currency management agency is  required for its removal, except for currency reported when  entering the country and foreign currency within the free  economic trade zone. This seems to be aimed at increasing  foreign exchange reserves.    Foreign investment enterprises are strictly required to keep  accounts with the Trade Bank or banks designated by the foreign  currency management agency and report their foreign exchange  situation to the agency quarterly and annually. This system  means that foreign enterprises should raise their necessary  foreign exchange by exporting or borrowing from foreign  countries, and they cannot systematically convert Korean Won  profit made in the domestic market to hard currency.    Even in the three laws established this year, there appears  the intention of North Korea to carry forward only ""an open-door  policy under strict control,"" under the closed and rigid  structure as usual. Even if the laws related to foreign  investment are improved, as long as the economic structure and  system are not reformed, the investment climate will not  materialize, and accordingly, the success of an open-economy  policy cannot be expected.

Members of the rightist opposition voiced  skepticism.    Yesterday, 4 May, Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa  Serrano confirmed the government's plan to sign a cooperation  agreement with Cuba though he reiterated that an eventual  resumption of diplomatic ties with Fidel Castro's government is  not on the list of subjects that the Chilean Government will  assess in the short term.    Today, Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona said his  party ""enthusiastically supports"" the tightening of friendship  and cooperation ties with the Cuban people.    Christian Democratic Party [PDC] President Gutenberg  Martinez  asserted his party is in favor of cooperating with Cuba ""from a  solidarity viewpoint in view of the difficulties the Cuban  people are enduring,"" adding that cooperation ""should be granted  without imposing any conditions."" Martinez also upheld the end  of the U.S. economic embargo on the island because, in his  opinion, this might encourage the Cuban authorities to implement  a greater economic and political domestic opening. Martinez  will preside over a PDC delegation that will travel to Cuba this  month.    Chilean Communist Party leader Carlos Toro asked Eduardo  Frei's government for the immediate normalization of diplomatic  relations with Cuba while Radical Party President Senator  Anselmo Sule commented that there is a certain degree of  cooperation with Cuba.    Sule mentioned a $10 million credit the Chile State Bank  recently granted the Cuban Government to finance the purchase of  Chilean foodstuff and added that Chile can cooperate with Cuba  ""in several aspects."" Sule said that among the incentives are  the activities that some Chilean companies are developing in  Cuba, the extension of export credits to that country, and the  promotion of social development actions on the island.    The rightist Democratic Independent Union (UDI), voiced its  agreement with the establishment of a cooperation program ""that  does not encourage the perpetuation of the current Cuban  regime."" UDI Senator Beltran Urenda, member of the Senate's  Foreign Commission, believes any aid for Cuba ""should seek a  change in the Cuba Government, a democratic opening."" He said  ""any support"" that may help Fidel Castro's regime to remain in  power ""is dangerous.""     "

He called  for work to continue to implement the resolution issued by the  African summit in this regard.    The brother secretary of the General People's Committee for  Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation stressed that the  border problem between the Great Jamahiriyah and Chad had been  solved once and for all, culminating in the signing of a pact of  good neighborliness and cooperation between the two countries.    He explained that Libya was a country that respected the law  and international laws, pointing out that the Great Jamahiriyah  had undertaken to implement the ruling of the International  Court of Justice regarding the Aouzou strip and to resolve its  border problem with Chad.    He said that the Great Jamahiriyah had implemented a ruling  of the International Court of Justice for the third time, which  confirmed that Libya abided by the laws issued by the  International Court of Justice. He pointed out that it was the  great powers who refused to implement the decisions issued by  such courts, observing that some of these states had broken  international laws in the past and had failed to implement laws  issued by the international body [words indistinct] that Libya  knows who is above the law and who actually respects the law.

He addressed a  session of the NATO Council devoted to the adoption of documents  regulating relations between Russia and the North Atlantic  alliance.    Kozyrev pointed out that the preparation of a programme of  broad cooperation between NATO and Russia has begun on the basis  of proposals earlier submitted by Russia. A special protocol  says that this will be a programme, meeting the dimensions and  significance of Russia's potential. ""An agreement has been  reached on a broad, deep dialogue and cooperation in areas where  Russia is capable of making a unique and important contribution  which conforms to Russia's prestige and responsibility as the  biggest European, world and nuclear state,"" Kozyrev said.    Accepting NATO's proposals, Russia is officially joining the  Partnership for Peace initiative. Taking part in its  realisation as equal partners are both states which were  adversaries in the period of cold war, or neutral countries  balancing between the two blocs. Such broad participation  creates prerequisites for further evolution of the European  situation in the direction of strengthening mutual understanding  and ensuring an equal level of security for all countries. For  all its importance, ""the Partnership for Peace"" is only one  direction for establishing military-political interaction,  Kozyrev said.    Another direction includes activities along the lines of the  Council for North Atlantic Cooperation (NACC), whose potential,  in Russia's opinion, should be more actively used, in  particular, in its peace-keeping activities.    The third direction is the development of a system of  bilateral contacts between Russia, NATO and NACC, which will  include peace- keeping activities, joint maneuvers, cooperation  in conversion. These directions ""fit the framework of the common  choice in favour of cooperation and the formation of a really  single space of security from Vancouver to Vladivostok,"" Kozyrev  said. In conclusion, the Russian foreign minister pointed out  that all efforts should pursue a priority goal -- the creation  of single Europe. ""The key role on the continent is being played  and will be played by the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe (CSCE). This is where Russia's opinion and the  alliance' assessments coincide,"" Kozyrev said.     "

During a news conference, the foreign minister said the  cooperation will include the sugarcane industry, education,  sports, social areas, and international relations.    During his five-day tour, the foreign minister negotiated  the  terms of a technical assistance agreement, which includes Cuban  specialists constructing a sugar mill in Zambia.    Gilly Mushota announced that during his next trip to Cuba,  Zambian President Frederik Chiluba will sign sugarcane industry  agreements and that his country will finance all the operations.

0,FT911-5209 ,"FT911-5209 _AN-BDPBVAALFT 910416   FT  16 APR 91 / World Trade News: Brazil and Iran discover ideal partnership      By CHRISTINA LAMB      BRASILIA   AT the time of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait last August Brazilian officials were, with remarkable foresight, already negotiating a deal to replace Iraq with Iran as the country's second largest oil supplier. Both sides insist the timing was mere coincidence but once the UN sanctions were announced outlawing commerce with Iraq, Brazil knew exactly where to look to substitute its major trading partner in the Middle East. Results were immediate. Last year Brazil's exports to Iran rose by 50 per cent to Dollars 425m - 40 per cent of its sales to the Gulf region  - while those to Iraq dropped 68 per cent to Dollars 110m. This year Brazil is expecting an even greater rise. Mr Marcos Azambuja, director general of the Brazilian Foreign Office, says: 'It has proved easier than we thought to replace the Iraq market. Our whole strategy now is to make Iran our major Gulf partner.' There is more at stake than simply sales of food and raw materials. Last October Mr Ozires Silva, Brazil's then infrastructure minister, led a mission of businessmen to Tehran to offer expertise for the reconstruction of Iran after eight years of war with Iraq and the building of an industrial complex near the mouth of the Hormuz Strait. The Brazilian mission was given a red carpet welcome including meetings with 12 ministers. Brazil's role as a big arms supplier to the opposite side during the Iran-Iraq war was forgotten with the signing of a second oil contract for a further 100,000 barrels per day making a total of 220,000. Officials came back with the news that Brazil could capture Dollars 12bn in contracts over the next five years both from the Iranian government and private sector. In many ways it is an ideal partnership. Brazil's perceived fencesitting during the Gulf war has ruled out any hope of it gaining contracts in Kuwait though Mr Azambuja insists 'the Brazil-Iraq connection was overblown'. Iran's still uneasy relations with the US and Europe means Brazil with its considerable experience in large development projects is the perfect solution. Already this year Brazil has welcomed eight Iranian missions including the ministers for mining, energy, heavy industry and agriculture, all dangling large contracts for the construction of steel and sugar mills, roads and railways and hydro-electric projects. It is not just talk. Although last year Brazil was in deficit in trade with Iran because of escalating oil prices, since October an estimated Dollars 800m of export contracts have been signed for the supply of sugar, steel, food and ten Tucano trainers. Agromachinery makers Caterpillar and Maxion have signed accords and two of Brazil's biggest capital goods producers, rivals Zanini and Dedini, have joined forces to build sugar mills in Iran. Construction company Andrade Guterriez is expected to soon sign a Dollars 350m contract to build a Dollars 1.4bn hydroelectric dam in consortium with Siemens and the Soviet company, Technopromoexport.

Speaking upon his return to Bratislava Kukan said that his  talks with Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad and League of Arab States Secretary  General were not just polite meetings.    He said that Slovakia maintained a good reputation in the  Middle East and called for the renewal of the broken ties  existing at the time of the Czechoslovak Federation. ""Arab  countries are interested in developing relations with Slovakia  and they are just waiting for the political signal. It is now  up to economic circles how they utilize this political capital,""  Kukan said.    Minister of the Economy Peter Magvasi will sign an economic  agreement in Egypt next week, said Kukan. He said that Slovakia  was not trailing behind the Czech Republic although it still did  not have a Slovak-Arab Chamber of Commerce similar to the  Czech-Arab one.    Kukan said that with its largest trade partner, Syria,  Slovakia could continue cooperation in the military area, the  power industry, engineering and agriculture. Kukan pointed to a  chance which is appearing for Slovak companies to cooperate with  Egyptian and Jordanian partners in building infrastructure in  Palestine.    Slovakia's trade turnover with Syria is about $48 million,  with Egypt about $20 million, and with Jordan $7 million.    Asked by CTK Kukan elaborated that a contract on supplying  250 Slovak-made tanks to Syria was close to implementation and  he did not know about any other under preparation. However, he  said that Slovakia was ready to participate in military  cooperation, including the modernization of tanks, also with  Egypt.    On the unblocking of Syria's debt towards the former  Czechoslovakia which is worth billions of dollars Kukan said  action had first to be coordinated with the Czech Republic.  ""However, the Syrian side is very reserved in this issue,"" he  said.    Kukan stressed that Slovakia's efforts to improve  cooperation  with Arab states, from which it has no diplomatic relations only  with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, does not mean a change in the  balanced approach towards individual countries of this region  and in Slovakia's interest in cooperation with Israel.

Domestic enterprises will actively proceed with  civilian-level industrial cooperative projects with the five  subcommittees of the ROK-PRC Industrial Cooperation Committee,  which will be organized on the occasion of President Kim's China  visit for the automobile, electronic, aviation, electronic  exchanger (TDX), and nuclear energy fields.    They are now holding consultations with China on specific  problems in promoting those projects by dispatching joint  delegations or management-level personnel to China. In  particular, our government is consulting with domestic business  circles over nominating a head company in each field to improve  efficiency in promoting economic cooperation with China through  a unified channel for each sector.    The government is considering nominating Daewoo Motors as  the  head company in the automobile field, the Korea Electric Power  Corporation in the nuclear energy field, Kumsong Dacom in the  electric exchanger field, and Samsung Electronics in the  electronic field, which includes high-definition television.  Samsong Aviation Company and Korean Air are competing with each  other for the leadership in the aviation field. The government,  however, is struggling because business circles oppose the  policy of nominating head companies and insist on liberal  competition.    Daewoo Motors and China's Changchun No. 1 Motor Company  agreed to invest jointly $1.5 billion in building a  joint-venture plant capable of producing 300,000 automobile  parts and 150,000 completed automobiles a year and they are now  proceeding with this project. Hyundai Motors is also planning to  invest individually to manufacture ordinary automobiles.    China has requested that the Korea Electric Power  Corporation  provide technological support and investment for its nuclear  power facilities. It has already dispatched a technological  support team to maintain the No. 1 and No. 2 nuclear power  plants in Guangdong, China.    It has been learned that China has promised our business  circles that it will consider adopting ROK electric exchangers  as a standard system in building the national communication  network in the future. Kumsong Dacom and Samsung Electronics are  now expanding their investments in this field in China.    The ROK Government plans to promote cooperation with China  by  organizing a consortium with an ROK head company and the  aviation industries of China, a company designated for the  consortium by the Chinese side. In the meantime, Samsung  Aviation Company, Korean Air, Daewoo Heavy Industries, Halla  Heavy Industries, and Seil Heavy Industries are independently  promoting joint projects with Chinese companies.

The value of trade between Russia and Vietnam made up more  than 300 million dollars last year, Antoshchenkov said. Both  sides no longer establish rigid quotas on trade. Instead they  coordinate the lists of goods in which they are interested.  Russian consumers receive from Vietnam rice, meat, tea, coffee,  vegetables and friut, spices, rugs and carpets, footwear, sewn  articles, knitgoods and other goods. Incidentally, the  exhibition of goods that opened at the Vietnamese trade mission  in Moscow on June 14 shows Vietnam's export potentials. Vietnam  is interested in purchasing from Russia road-building equipment,  metals, fertiliser, timber and sawn timber.    Russia deliveries of sets of equipment for the construction  of various facilities are of much importance to Vietnam,  Antoshchenkov said. The construction of the Hoabinh hydropower  station will be completed this year. The biggest hydropower  station in South East Asia with a capacity of two million  kilowatts will go into operation in September. A hydropower  station will be build in Yali in the Danang District. This will  make it possible to supply enough electricity to central  Vietnam. The construction of the Laokai complex with an  enrichment factory to produce 1.5 million tonnes of apatite  concentrate a year will be completed this year.    Both sides expressed satisfaction with a successful  functioning of the joint venture Vietsovpetro which extracted  over 20 million tonnes of crude oil from the shelf of Vietnam in  the period of the venture's existence. The volume of extraction  will surpass six million tonnes this year.    Vietnam will continue goods deliveries towards repaying its  debt to Russia, Antoshchenkov said.    During the visit of the Vietnamese Premier accompanied by a  large group of officials from various ministries and agencies,  representatives of the Vietnamese business circles will hold  substantive talks for the speeding up of the implementation of  the earlier achieved arrangements and will discuss projects for  cooperation. A number of documents, including agreements on  cooperation in the area of agro-industrial complexes and  fisheries will be signed.     "

As he said, relations between the two countries ""entered the  phase of close cooperation."" ""Considering Argentina's weight  and influence in Latin America, cooperation with it is very  important to us,"" Kozyrev said.    Upon conclusion of their talks the two men signed a protocol  on consultations between their ministries and an  intergovernmental agreement on visa-free travel for the holders  of diplomatic and service passports; they also initialled a  basic political document on the fundamentals of relations  between the Russian Federation and Argentina. ""The documents we  signed are the basis and at the same time only the tip of the  iceberg of our close cooperation,"" Kozyrev said.    According to him, relations between Moscow and Buenos Aires  develop not only on bilateral foundations, but also on the  ""global level."" ""Argentina is a key state in Latin America, and  at the moment we are engaged in active work on that continent,  establishing cooperation with the Organization of American  States and with regional economic structures,"" Kozyrev said.    As he said, Russia is interested in promoting interaction  with Buenos Aires also in the framework of the U.N., since at  present Argentina is a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security  Council.    For his part Guido Di Tella pointed out that Argentina views  Russia as a great world power. We closely follow what happens  in Russia, and we believe that your reforms deserve great  respect, he said.    According to him, the two countries' stands on many  international issues approximate or coincide. When discussing  the problems of world security and the future world structure,  we speak in one language of cooperation and mutual respect, he  concluded.    As the political adviser to the head of Russian diplomacy,  Galina Sidorova, told journalists, during the talks with his  Argentinian counterpart Kozyrev drew his attention to the  incident involving the Russian fishing ship Orel detained by the  Argentinian authorities since February, 1993.    ""Our ship was detained on the pretext that it was engaged in  fishing in the Argentinian economic zone. We view this pretext  as far-fetched, and hope that an acceptable solution to this  issue will be found after all,"" Sidorova said.     "

The Central Committee [C.C.] of the Jordanian Communist  Party  in its March 24 solidarity message to the C.C., the Workers'  Party of Korea said the United States reversed the New York  agreement, fully revealing its aggressive design to render the  situation strained and perpetrate a provocation on the Korean  peninsula.    The Brazilian Communist Party issued a statement on March  24.    Noting that the United States was driving the situation of  the Korean peninsula to the brink of war by foiling the third  round of the DPRK-U.S. talks and seeking the resumption of the  ""Team Spirit"" joint military exercises and the deployment of  Patriot missiles in South Korea, the statement said this is a  premeditated provocation to isolate and stifle socialist Korea.    The Spanish Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification,  the Organizing Committee of ""the Espano-Coreano Koryo Friendship  and Cooperation Association"" and the Spanish Committee of the  Organization of Solidarity of the Peoples of Africa, Asia and  Latin America released a joint statement on March 22.    Pointing out that a grave situation has been created again  on  the Korean peninsula by the U.S. perfidious act in reversing its  agreement with the DPRK, it condemned the bellicose and  irresponsible attitude of the International Atomic Energy  Agency, which is serving the imperialists and the United States.    The Russian Association for Friendship and Cultural  Cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a  statement March 24 said the situation of the Korean peninsula  has been further aggravated because some quarters of the United  States and Japan have not given up the intention to stifle the  DPRK, and the United States, taking advantage of its predominant  position in the IAEA, has reversed the DPRK-U.S. agreement, put  all manner of pressure on North Korea and worked to impair its  authority in the international arena and finally suffocate the  socialist system of this country.    The Zimbabwean Association for Solidarity and Friendship  with  Korea, the General Confederation of Trade Unions of Yemen and  the Secretariat of the Democratic Youth League of Ghana, too,  issued statements urging the United States to stop threatening  the DPRK.

I would like to ask you about a  typical post-Cold War case. Would you give your view and  analysis of the situation in the DPRK?    [Saito] The DPRK is the only nation with which Japan has yet  to settle post-war issues. There is no change in Japan's desire  to normalize diplomatic relations with the DPRK. There is a  possibility, however, that the DPRK, a geographically close  neighbor of Japan, is developing nuclear weapons and this is a  serious issue. Japan cannot tolerate DPRK development of nuclear  weapons. We strongly hope that suspicions about the DPRK's  development of nuclear arms will be cleared up in the U.S.-DPRK  talks. We hope the talks will settle the DPRK nuclear issue one  way or another.    [Reporter] It has been pointed out that any crisis in the  Korean peninsula will inevitably lead to a change in Japan-U.S.  security arrangements.    [Saito] Japan-U.S. security arrangements will not be  affected by any crisis on the Korean peninsula and we are not  concerned about that. The military threat to Japan has not yet  disappeared (even following the end of the Cold War). Japan  cannot protect itself from various crises by its own power  alone. The significance of Japan-U.S. security arrangements  will remain unless a change occurs in Japan's ability to protect  itself. Japan-U.S. security arrangements keep other Asian  nations free from security concerns and their effect will remain  unchanged.    [Reporter] Looking at Japan's security, there are China and  Russia, both of them political and military superpowers.    [Saito] Japan will host the ASEAN regional forum next year.  I think it is right ASEAN foreign ministers and their  counterparts from China and Russia hold talks to discuss the  regional security issue. Japan will urge both China and Russia  to hold security talks with Japan. Japan should promote these  security talks and the ASEAN security talks simultaneously.    [Reporter] Regional security considerations aside, will the  Asian and Pacific region not move toward forming an economic  bloc?    [Saito] The region may move toward forming such an economic  bloc. It is to be expected that European nations will watch  closely the strengthening of relations between the United States  and the member nations of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation  Conference [APEC], but there is nothing for them to worry about.  The European Community (EC) wants to maintain its relationship  with APEC whereby it attends APEC conferences as an observer.  Japan supports this.    [Reporter] With the Cold War behind us, Japan's bid for a  seat on the UN Security Council is becoming more realistic.    [Saito] I believe Japan is qualified to join the UN Security  Council as a permanent member. If an international consensus  forms on Japanese membership, Japan should go along with it. We  must not be impatient, however.    [Reporter] There is also the question of participation by  the Self-Defense Forces in such UN and multinational forces that  fought in the Gulf war. Should the government not make clear  its view on this before the question comes up again?    [Saito] The best thing would be to have the issue debated  and then a decision made once conclusions from the debate have  been drawn. In any case, however, it is clear that Japan can  only take actions are permitted by the Constitution, even if it  is admitted to the UN Security Council as a permanent member.  If Japan becomes a permanent member of the UN Security Council,  the UN body cannot ask Japan to do what is prohibited by the  Constitution. I do not mean Japan cannot join the UN Security  Council before deciding the limits of its participation. As far  as the multinational forces are concerned, my personal view is  that it would be difficult for Japan to join them.    [Reporter] Other nations hope Japan will participate in the  UN peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslavia.    [Saito] Some argue that as Yasushi Akashi has been appointed  the UN peacekeeping operations representative in the former  Yugoslavia, Japan should do something. I cannot agree with the  argument, though. It is clear, however, that if the situation  there is left uncontrolled, it could get worse. A political  decision will be made on Japan's participation in UN  peacekeeping operations after we are clear whether Japan's  participation is compatible with the Peacekeeping Operations  Cooperation Law. I mean the government will begin examining the  possibility of participation if it conforms to the Peacekeeping  Operations Cooperation Law and the United Nations makes a  request to that effect.

As long as there is a war existing there are  dangers existent and the main loser is the Yemeni people. He  clarified that our infrastructure is subjected to destruction  and that those who are imposing war on us now have no cause,  emphasizing that we have a cause for which we are struggling and  that we are owners of the right. This came in a press interview  held by the AL-KHALIJ newspaper of the United Arab Emirates with  Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the chairman of the Presidential Council,  and published in its issue dated 5 June.    He clarified that what is going on in Yemen today is not a  Yemeni issue only. The project that collided with the unity  project and spoiled it is another project connected to many  projects and how can we explain that Iran was displeased by the  UN Security Council's resolution concerning Yemen? He added  that the issue now is the issue of the Gulf states, the  stability of the people, and the interests of these countries.  Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid went on to say: The others are trying to  impose the Gulf crisis on us, but [words indistinct] its  expansion to another region in the south of the Arabian  Peninsula.    In his reply to a question about published information  mentioning that there are Jordanian airplanes which are  providing Sanaa with weapons and ammunition, Mr. 'Ali Salim  al-Bid said: Yes, there is information about this matter. In  the beginning I did not believe it, but when we followed up the  matter we got sure about it. I did not expect this stand from  Jordan. It is me who went to King Husayn to help us in reaching  a solution and mediation. I had not expected this. I had not  wanted King Husayn's stand to be heard, but this is their state  policy. This is their own concern.    About the relations of the Democratic Republic of Yemen with  the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the  chairman of the Presidential Council said: We created here a  state which wants stability. I consider it in the first defense  line of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. We are seeking  stability and he who seeks stability continues as a defense line  for all those who seek stability anywhere.     "

The spending, or eight million dollars a year, is part of  the  ASEAN-Australia Economic Cooperation Program and will be  channelled through the Australia International Development  Assistant Bureau (AIDAB).    Australia has outlined six projects for development in  ASEAN:    -- Coastal Zone Development and Resource Management.    -- Waste Water Treatment Technology Transfer and Cleaners  Production Demonstration.    -- Environmentally-sound Energy Production and Waste  Disposal from Biomass/Waste Supplemented by Fossil Fuels.    -- ASEAN-Australia Forum Telecommunication Cooperation in  Training which may be implemented with Information and  Communication Technology for Sustainable Development.    -- Electricity and the Environment: A Framework for  Decision Making in the ASEAN Region.    -- Development of Food Safety and Quality Assurance  Systems for Marketing and Distribution of Fresh and Processed  Horticultural Products in ASEAN.    AIDAB's Regional Programme Officer in Bangkok, Julie Angela  Kaeowaen, said the projects are part of phase three of the  cooperation program. Phase one was conducted during 1984-89 and  phase two during 1989-94.    In each project, four consultants from Australia and ASEAN  will visit every ASEAN member to conduct a feasibility study and  come up with an implementation plan that suits the development  of that particular project.    The feasibility study has been conducted already for the  coastal zone environment and waste water projects, and the  consultant team arrives in Bangkok today to do the  environmentally-sound energy production project.    The team to deal with the telecommunications project is  expected to be here in late July. Eighteen participants from  six ASEAN members will participate in each course under the  project, which will include a training course in Australia that  varies from ten days to ten weeks depending on the course.    Miss Kaeowaen said 25 courses will be conducted under the  telecommunication project, three courses will concentrate on  policy and regulations, eight courses on economics and  management and the rest on technology.    The participants will include academics, company executives  and government officials, who will be selected by the Thai  Foreign Ministry.    Australia also launched a project under the Linkages Stream  for one year, granting A$25,000-250,000 to applicants who seek  funds to support a technical and investment feasibility study  aimed at encouraging investment exchanges between ASEAN and  Australia, mutually beneficial trade, investment promotion and  related projects.

The Amur is a river on the Sino-Russian border, and  Khabarovsk City is located on the northern bank on the middle  reaches of the river. During the years when relations between  the two countries were tense, this was the frontier of military  confrontation filled with the smoke of gunpowder. Today, border  trade and various forms of economic cooperation have replaced  conflicts, turning the Amur River into a river of friendship  that links the feelings of the two peoples.    The Khabarovsk border region is graced with enchanting  sights, covers an area of 824 square kms, and has a population  of more than 2 million, 80 percent of which lives in the city  proper. Densely forested, the area abounds in such resources as  coal, zinc, and gold. Its industry is dominated by metallurgy,  machine-building, aircraft manufacturing, electric cable  production, petroleum refining, and woodworking, while fishery,  deer-raising, and commercial hunting are also booming sectors.  On top of the fairly developed shipping and air transportation  services, the trunk line of the celebrated Trans-Siberian  Railway crisscrosses the southern part of the region.  Khabarovsk, with a population of 600,000, is the capital of the  border region, as well as the largest industrial city and one of  the transportation hubs in the Far East.    In Russia's drive for economic reform, the Amur River has  taken the lead in opening up to the outside world. Pisarenko  [name as received], deputy director of the region's Foreign  Economic Liaison Bureau, told us: The Khabarovsk border region  has established economic cooperation and trade with 42 countries  and regions, of which China is the largest economic and trade  partner.    Pisarenko said exuberantly: The trade volume between the  Khabarovsk border region and China accounted for 45 percent of  the region's total foreign trade volume in 1993, rising by 340  percent from $115 million in 1992 to $391 million in 1993. The  trade structures of the two sides complement each other, with  the border region primarily exporting steel products, plants and  equipment, nonferrous metals, and timber to China, and importing  daily necessities and food from the latter. The female deputy  director said: Following the termination of the border region's  traditional economic ties with western Russia and the CIS  countries, rail freight has risen steadily, rendering the  region's economic relations and trade with China increasingly  important in the absence of self-sufficiency in industrial and  agricultural production.    What we witnessed here is not only the conduct of barter  trade with China, but also a growing interest on both sides in  the establishment of joint ventures. By January this year, 199  Chinese-funded enterprises had been established in the border  region, accounting for 45 percent of the total number of  foreign-funded enterprises. Of these, 144 are joint ventures,  and 55 are wholly Chinese-owned. Registered assets total $11  million, or 10 percent of the region's total foreign registered  assets. Moreover, experienced Chinese vegetable growers and  construction workers have begun to demonstrate their skills in  the Khabarovsk border region.    The reporters visited the largest country market in  Khabarovsk City. Several thousand stalls were neatly arrayed in  this market covering an area of some 20,000 square meters, where  vendors hawked their wares incessantly and customers jostled  each other. Most of the goods were clothing and other daily  necessities. In addition to local people, stall proprietors  included Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Mongolian nationals.  The local official accompanying us on the trip said:  High-quality and inexpensive daily necessities and food  produced by China have greatly enriched the border region's  market; however, the reputation of Chinese goods has also been  sullied by some poor-quality commodities. The local government  official said: Most of the Chinese-funded enterprises in the  region carry out trading activities, and the number of  enterprises engaged in commodity production is too small.    Quoting Peter the Great during an interview with these  reporters, the Russian presidential representative in the  Khabarovsk border region, said: ""The more a country conducts  foreign trade, the better its people's lives will become."" He  expressed the hope that people on both sides of the river, who  have a century-old history of border trade, would further expand  mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade.    With the clouds illuminated by the setting sun, the  picturesque Amur River seemed to be singing the song of  long-running friendship between people on both sides of the  river.     "

Russia Has Filed a  Petition To Join the Executive Committee of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees""]    [Text] In recent years the refugee problem which has  alarmed the world for decades has directly affected Russia, too.  A stream of victims of interethnic conflicts in the post-Soviet  space and victims of national discrimination in the former  republics of the Soviet Union has rushed to Russia.    This was perhaps the main reason the Russian Federation  filed  a petition to be admitted as a member of the Executive Committee  of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. This UN structure was  created as early as 1951 when a number of countries developed  and signed the UN Convention on Refugee Status. Russia also  signed this convention in May of last year, thus assuming the  requisite obligations. If the UN approves the Russian  petition--and at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian  Federation they assure us that this will most likely be the  case--the observer status which Russia has at present will be  converted into full-fledged membership. This will not impose any  additional financial obligations on the state because the budget  of the Executive Committee is formed on a voluntary basis.    Two laws actually apply in Russia at present--""On Refugees""  and ""On Forced Resettlers."" This is why it is important to  determine who is who. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia  believes that otherwise it will be very difficult to take  measures aimed at solving their problems. It is necessary to  solve three problems in order to settle the refugee crisis.    First, we should make every effort to try and extinguish  conflicts on the territory of the former USSR which constitute  the ground zero of human waves sweeping toward Russia, and solve  the problem of discrimination against the Russian-speaking  population in the former Soviet republics, primarily in the  Baltic countries by signing relevant agreements with them.  Incidentally, they are now doing this at Smolenskaya Square  quite intensively.    The second problem is to set up a living for refugees and  forced resettlers; this is handled by the Federal Migration  Service (FMS) which was created in 1992. However, given the  tremendous number of people seeking assistance from the FMS, it  has not been in a position to fine-tune its operation in a  civilized manner over this short period of time. This is why it  is very important for Russia to become a member of the Executive  Committee of the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees]. The Administrations of the High Commissioner which  have been created in Moscow, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan  are already helping to solve problems associated with migration.  Obtaining membership in the UNHCR Executive Committee will help  Russia to use the potential of this organization to the fullest  extent. As early as the meetings of the Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe in Rome and the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council in Brussels late last year, the head of the  foreign policy establishment of Russia Andrey Kozyrev proposed  to make the institution of the High Commissioner for Refugees  more effective and to reinforce it. These Russian initiatives  were laid down in the Declaration on Aggressive Nationalism,  whose text was also proposed by Moscow.    Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the UNHCR has  already produced favorable results: On 13 January of this year a  communique resolving the issue of the return of resettlers from  Georgia and Abkhazia was signed during Russian-Abkhazian  negotiations with the cooperation of the Administration of the  High Commissioner.    The third task is to prepare and begin actions to resolve  the  problems of foreigners from faraway foreign countries who are  staying in Russian territory illegally. So far, no procedure at  all has been developed for them. As we were told at the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to some estimates we have  0.5 million of them. There are many refugees from Afghanistan,  Angola, and Somalia. The Kurds account for a significant  proportion. There are also natives of Ethiopia, China, and Sri  Lanka. All of them cannot be ignored: After all, according to  the 1951 convention, a person is under its protection from the  moment of filing a petition to be granted refugee status.    Having become a member of the UNHCR Executive Committee,  Russia will be able to influence the enhancement of its role in  the world system in resolving emergency situations: famine,  natural cataclysms, military conflicts, and so on.

The speaker  was referring to a recent remark by the Saudi king who sided  with the UAE in its dispute with Iran over the island.  Nateq-Nuri said Iran was committed to the accord signed in 1971  between Iran and the emir of Sharjah [Al-Shariqah] on Abu Musa  Island.    He said Iran had only heightened security at the island  after  arresting a spy around the island and that this had made the UAE  officials unhappy. He said bilateral talks should continue to  resolve the minor disputes between the two countries, in order  not to provide the ""aliens to engage in mischief."" The  negotiations on the matter had been halted by the United Arab  Emirates, he said.    About Iran's relations with Egypt and foreign minister's  imminent visit to Cairo, he said Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati will visit Cairo to attend the upcoming meeting of the  Non-aligned Movement (NAM). On possible talks between  Iran-Egyptian foreign ministers on the sideline of the NAM  meeting, he said there were no restrictions on holding talks  between the foreign minister and his counterparts from Egypt or  other countries. On the obstacles in the way of improving  Tehran-Cairo relations, Nateq-Nuri said the main stumbling block  was the spread of the spirit of Islamism in Egypt that the  Egyptian officials wrongly attribute to the Islamic Republic of  Iran.    On Iran's foreign debts, the speaker said the amount of the  debts was no problem to Iran in light of its huge natural  resources. He said that most of the countries of the world are  debtors, but, the big powers magnified Iran's debts due to their  hostile attitude towards Iran.    On the Middle East peace process and the probability of  resolving tension between Syria and Israel, he said Iran's  relations with Syria were too solid to easily worsen. In the  meantime, he said, ""we recommend the Syrian officials not to  damage their political prestige because Syria will get nothing  from the Zionist regime"".    About import of the U.S. goods and if they would leave any  cultural impact, he said there was no room for concern regarding  the arrival of certain American products such as Coca Cola.  Because, he said, ""our Islamic and national culture is too  strong to be affected negatively by such minor issues.""    On the Iran-Iraq relations, he said numerous issues still  remained to be solved including the UN Security Council  Resolution 598 and the issue of Iranian prisoners of war (pow)  as well as the issue of pilgrimage to the holy places in Iraq.  The officials of the two countries intend to meet and settle  the issue, he said.    On the priorities to be given to the second five-year  development plan by the Majlis, he said the Majlis places  emphasis on social justice, restructuring the adminstrative  system, reducing reliance on oil revenues and reviving the  pricing mechanism.    On the Saudi ban on holding the special ceremony of  ""antipathy towards atheists,"" he said despite the harassment  done by the Saudis, the incident was unlikely to result in break  off of diplomatic relations due to the two countries being  neighbours and because of the interests of the world of Islam.

The Russian foreign minister said that British Prime  Minister  John Major's meeting with Russian Federation President Boris  Yeltsin was still quite a recent event, while a new and  important event for mutual relations was now on the agenda: the  first state visit to Russia by Queen Elizabeth II.    Kozyrev mentioned the broad list of issues discussed at the  current talks, in particular, preparations for the political  meeting of leaders of the G-7 and Russia in Naples, the working  out of an agreement on partnership between Russia and the  European Union, the prospects of cooperation between Russia and  NATO, the Bosnian crisis, and Moscow's relations with the Baltic  countries. Significant attention, in his words, was paid to  finding ways to step up the activities of the CSCE during  preparations for the summit meeting of the member countries of  this international forum. There was also a productive exchange  of views on ways of developing regional cooperation, including  cooperation with Murmansk. The minister said that ""Britain was a  partner with whom Russia was holding a stable, open and friendly  dialogue.""    The head of the British Foreign Office noted that his  country  was playing pioneering role in ties with Murmansk. In Hurd's  words, this role was clearly manifested in the past wars, and it  continues now, as demonstrated by the present visit, the first  by a British foreign secretary to the polar regions of Russia.  ""Agreement has been reached on all the issues we discussed,"" the  head of the Foreign Office said. ""There are three major  organizations in Europe - NATO, the EC, and the CSCE. In the  early stages of their existence they were dealing with the  problem of overcoming confrontation, but now a new stage has  begun, and work is under way with the aim of reaching accord.  Russia is playing a key role in this process. I hope a  cooperation agreement between Russia and the European Union will  be signed as early as June. We in Britain at any rate will be  striving towards this. We also expect Russia to reach accord  with NATO on the basis of the Partnership for Peace program, and  we expect the CSCE to become a more effective tool in overcoming  international crises.""

The protocol proposes the development of cooperation in the  areas of energy, transportation, communications and other areas.  It further proposes establishing new areas for cooperation.  Speaking at the signing ceremony of the protocol, Kumbaracibasi  said that the two sides had discussed all the issues in a  mutually benevolent atmosphere at the meeting.    Stressing that the relations between Turkey and Russia were  improving, Kumbaracibasi said that both sides carried good  intentions towards eliminating the problems and that more  importantly, they had reached an agreement in principles on the  issue of new and wider projects.    Davydov, who also spoke at the conference, said that the  volume of commerce between the two countries would reach $2  billion and noted that this meant that the volume of commerce  between Turkey and Russia would equal that between Russia and  the United States. He said, ""Turkey will continue to be our  most essential commercial partner.""    The issue of the hardships that Turkey came face to face  with  at times when Russia cut off Ukraine's natural gas was also  discussed at the meeting and the two sides agreed that the  section of the Russian pipeline passing through Ukraine be  bypassed, thus enabling the transportation of natural gas to  Turkey. Although the issue of the threats which carrying oil  through the straits posed for Istanbul was not openly discussed  at the meeting, it was nevertheless noted that the two sides  wholeheartedly supported the technical meetings on the prospect  of finding alternatives for transporting the oil. Meanwhile, at  a meeting he had with Kumbaracibasi on Wednesday morning,  Russia's first deputy prime minister, Oleg Soskovets, noted that  the issue of oil and gas was the most important area of  cooperation between Turkey and Russia and suggested that the two  sides cooperate on constructing an oil and gas pipeline between  Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Armenia. Officials  reported that Russia was interested in the projects for building  a nuclear plant in Turkey and building a dam on the Coruh river  and that moreover it wanted to build a thermal power plant in  Turkey. According to the protocol, the dam and thermal power  plant be discussed only when Russia increases the amount of  natural gas it gives to Turkey from the present amount of eight  billion cubic meters to 10.5 billion cubic meters.

This was agreed on by  Public Order Minister Stilianos Papathemelis and his Israeli  counterpart, Moshe Shahal, during the Greek minister's visit to  Jerusalem. Correspondent's Kostas Tomaras has the following  report.    [Begin Tomaras recording] The beginning of a close  cooperation between Greek and Israeli authorities, especially on  the issue of combating terrorism, was marked by the visit of  Public Order Minister Papathemelis to Israel at the beginning of  this week. During a news conference held today, Papathemelis  announced that this cooperation will begin at the EU Summit in  Corfu, where a team of Israeli specialists will install special  equipment as part of the security measures. The equipment will  include cameras that take pictures at night and from a great  distance. The team of Israelis will arrive in our country next  week and will train Greek officials in the use of that  equipment, which afterwards will remain with the Greek police.  The public order minister said he was impressed with the modern  technical means that the Israelis have and which he did not even  see in the United States. The public order minister also let be  known that the Israelis have information on terrorism, mainly  due to the perfect organization of their police, and hopes that  the signing of a bilateral cooperation agreement will result in  the transfer of that information to the Greek authorities. The  cooperation among the authorities of the two countries will be  extended to combating drugs and illegal immigration and the  exchange of information, mainly the supply of high technology  equipment necessary for the modernization of the Greek police.  Asked whether he discussed the issue noted in a recent report  by Italian newspaper CORRIERE DELLA SERA regarding the gathering  of terrorists in Iran, Papathemelis replied: I raised the issue  with persistence but the Israelis were not willing to tell me.  In another question on whether the Israelis have any  information about terrorism in Greece, the public order minister  said that only time will tell. However, he stressed that the  Israeli authorities have the capability to get such information  from sources to which we have no access. Finally, on his visit  to Israeli, the public order minister said that it was  considered a step that supports the peace efforts in the area  and that Israel looks forward to the role of Greece and Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou in that peace.

Mr. Halasah and his Iraqi counterpart Ahmad Murtada would  cochair the annual board meeting of the Iraqi-Jordanian Land  Transport Company (IJTLC) and review the company's 1993  operations and draw up plans for the next year.    The meeting will also finalise the 1993 report and annual  accounts of the company, owned by the Jordanian and Iraqi  governments, officials said. No details of the company's  financial status were immediately available.    However, the officials said, the company's operations have  been adversely affected by the continuing international  sanctions against Iraq. Before the sanctions were imposed in  August 1990, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the company  largely depended on transporting Iraq-bound cargo unloaded at  al-'Aqabah to Iraq.    The company continued to survive after the imposition of the  sanctions on Iraqi imports of food and medicine exempt from the  sanctions, but the overall volume of such cargo has decreased  gradually, with Iraqi government agencies as well as private  sector merchants turning to Iranian, Lebanese and Turkish ports  for their imports to avert the costly delays incurred while  importing through al-'Aqabah.    The delays and higher freight charges are caused as a result  of what importers describe as overzealous enforcement of the  sanctions by inspectors aboard warships patrolling the Red Sea.    During his talks in Baghdad, Mr. Halasah, who is accompanied  by the Jordanian board members of the IJLTC and senior company  officials, is also expected to raise Jordan's concerns over  further decline of Iraqi imports through al-'Aqabah following  the reopening of Iraq's Gulf port of Umm Qasr in November, the  officials said.    While on a visit to Amman in late November, a senior Iraqi  transport ministry official was reported to have assured Jordan  that there was ""a political decision"" not to let the reopening  of Umm Qasr affect Iraq's imports through al-'Aqabah.    But a campaign launched in Baghdad to encourage private  sector importers to use Umm Qasr through incentives such as free  fuel and bunkering, and guidelines given to shippers to use  small-size vessels suitable to the Gulf port's capabilities have  fuelled Jordanian concrns.    In one case, the Australian Wheat Board was requested to use  two 25,000-tonne ships to carry 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq  instead of one 50,000-tonne vessel. Umm Qasr can only handle  vessels up to a 25,000-tonne capacity.    Jordanian shipping agents however, expect a minimum level of  Iraq-bound cargo to pass through al-'Aqabah.    ""Umm Qasr is suitable for Iraqi imports from the Far East,""  said a shipping agent. ""But volume of Iraqi purchase from the  Far East is not much anyway. The bulk of Iraqi imports is from  Europe, and this has to come through al-'Aqabah.""    Furthermore, said the agent, many shipowners are reluctant  to  send their vessels to Umm Qasr because most international  insurance companies either refuse to extend coverage to the  vessel or demand high premiums.    Umm Qasr lies in an area where the threat of mines planted  during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war as well as the war over Kuwait  remains high.    The Jordanian Shipping Agents Association (JSAA) has called  on the government to cooperate with the shipping sector to  devise a package of incentives to attract shipping lines to use  al-'Aqabah.

The delegation includes MP's of the Social  Democratic Populist Party, the Welfare Party, the True Path  Party and the Motherland Party. ""This is the first visit of a  head of the Turkish Parliament in the last 20 years and it is an  indication of good neighbourly relations,"" Aleksandur Yordanov,  chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly, said welcoming the  Turkish guests.    Late in the afternoon, the Turkish MP's conferred with Mr.  Yordanov. ""We share similar views on all issues with the  exception of the commitment of Turkish troops to the UN  peace-keeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina,"" Mr. Cindoruk  said after the meeting. According to him, it is not a case of  differences of opinion but rather of the interpretations of the  United Nations' decision. ""We respect the Bulgarian position  (on non-involvement of the Balkan countries in the  Yugoconflict),"" the president of the Turkish Parliament said.  ""The blue helmets going to Bosnia are not Turkish troops but  troops of the United Nations,"" Mr. Cindoruk argues. According  to the chairman of the Bulgarian Parliament Aleksandur Yordanov,  instead of resolving the problem, the presence of Turkish blue  helmets in Bosnia and Herzegovina would cause further escalation  of the tensions based on historical experience in this region.    ""Both Bulgaria and Turkey see the promotion of their  commercial and economic relations mainly within Black Sea  Economic Cooperation, together with other countries in the  region like Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Greece,"" Mr. Yordanov  said after the meeting. He explained Bulgaria's stand on  Turkey's active efforts to accelerate the formation of a  parliamentary assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.  ""Bulgaria believes such a parliamentary body could only be  instituted on the basis of a well-developed economic  cooperation,"" Mr. Yordanov said. According to him, there are  some other forums for parliamentary contacts, like the Council  of Europe and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe. Mr. Cindoruk sees no obstacles to the development of  Bulgarian-Turkish economic relations.    Aleksandur Yordanov raised with his Turkish counterpart the  problem about Bulgarian immovable property in Istanbul: The  Bulgarian Church, hospital and school.    Mr. Cindoruk conferred today with Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov. They agreed that bilateral relations are making  positive progress and discussed the possibilities for their  further promotion in various fields, the Foreign Ministry press  centre said.

Located on the Bohai Sea, Tianjin is effectively cooperating  with Beijing city, Shanxi, Hebei, Heilongjiang and Shandong  Provinces as well as with Yunnan, Guangxi and Xinjiang in the  remote areas.    Statistics show that a total of 11,420 cooperative projects  were signed last year, attracting capital of 967 million yuan  from other areas.    Officials said that regional cooperation, which began in  recent years, has effectively helped local economic growth.    Various organizations to promote regional cooperation were  established and expanded. The association of mayors of cities  around the Bohai Sea, for instance, now has 17 member cities.  The Tianjin Municipal Government has set up representative  offices in a number of other provinces.    At present, the city is cooperating with the coal-rich  Shanxi  Province in the development of coal, transportation and raw  materials industries.    The cooperation projects with Qinghuangdao city in Hebei  Province not far from Tianjin have come to some 50, involving a  total investment of 38.70 million yuan. Local products  including cloth shoes, carpets and tableware are exported via  Tianjin port.    The city has also opened many specialized markets for such  products as petrochemical materials, textile raw materials and  automobile industrial products.    In addition, a major market network is taking shape,  covering  capital, technology, labor and information services.    By the end of 1993, the number of capital goods markets  totalled 28, attracting many large industrial and commercial  ventures all over China. The transaction volume topped 20  billion yuan last year, according to figures from the Tianjin  Municipal Government.    A few large trans-regional joint ventures were also  established. Some Tianjin factories with quite advanced  technical levels, especially in such fields as chemicals,  electronics, machinery, textiles and automobiles, have begun  offering machinery for processing strawberries, wild apples and  other local produce to North-west China.    The Tianjin Welding Electrode Company, for instance, has set  up 25 joint ventures in eight provinces and autonomous regions.  In Xinjiang alone the joint ventures achieved a net profit of 7  million yuan last year.    Officials said that Tianjin has now established many raw  materials bases in other parts of China.    Tianjin also offered technical and other forms of help to  many poor areas. It has arranged 33 projects of technology  transfer, personnel training and commodity exchange with  localities around the Three Gorges areas in Central China.    In addition, it has signed more than 600 technical and  economic cooperation projects with North-west China's Gansu  Province, benefiting both parties.     "

There is no doubt that this is a maximum position. Almost  simultaneously, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev presented in  the U.S. magazine, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, similar, but a bit more  vague ideas about the future role that Moscow is striving for in  the CSCE. In addition, the following things are remarkable in  his article:     -  The demand for the recognition of Russia as a  superpower, which advocates, just as does the West, democracy,  human rights, and responsible international action;    -  The term  ""NATO-mania,"" which Kozyrev uses in connection with Poland, the  Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, but without citing these  states by name;    -  The West should recognize Russia's ""problems  with Georgia and Tajikistan"" and support the Russian role. Only  if the need for close cooperation in the CIS is recognized, can  a repetition of the Yugoslav tragedy be avoided. Kozyrev  equates the nature and structure of the CIS with those of the  EU;    -  The safeguarding of the rights of Russian minorities in the  ""near abroad"" is a real problem for Russia.     Both Russian ministers expressly do not speak about the  security interests of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  Hungary (the so-called Visegrad states), and the three Baltic  republics. However, their statesmen are very worried about  domestic developments in Russia, which they fear might lead to  an imperialistic foreign policy and endanger the independence of  their states. They watch the current Partnership for Peace with  suspicion, because here Russia is placed on the same footing as  they are.    So far, the West has, however, shied away even from  promising  the four Visegrad states NATO memberships or a security  guarantee. The EU does expect to accept them as members within  a few years, but their future role in the framework of the  intended ""common foreign and security policy"" of the EU remains  unclear for the time being.    The West is facing a dilemma: On the one hand, it is in the  interest of all Europeans to effectively ensure the security of  the Visegrad states (and the three Baltic republics). For them,  a security policy condominium of the West with Moscow must not  come about, because the Poles, but also the Hungarians (because  of 1956!) and the Czechs (because of 1968!) would reject  Russia's position as a guarantor power. Neither have the four  divisions of Poland been forgotten in Warsaw, in which not only  Moscow but -- in addition to Vienna's participation three times  -- also Berlin was involved every time, nor has Prague forgotten  the invasion of German troops under Hitler and its consequences.    On the other hand, Moscow's demand for the recognition of  its  status as a superpower and for institutionalized cooperation  with the West is sensible. However, neither the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council nor the Partnership for Peace are suitable  for that as long as they both put Russia on the same level as  small states.    Conversely, the Russian proposal for giving the CSCE  executive powers rights to the fringe of the Pacific Ocean is  unacceptable; one just has to think of the effect on China. In  a few years everyone will recognize that the United States,  China, Russia, Japan, and the EU are superpowers. All five must  learn to respect each other in every way as big powers.    The North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which was  established  upon proposal by the United States, and the Partnership for  Peace may have been useful as improvised interim solutions.  Now, however, this concept rather proves to be a knot that must  be untied. It is time to invite both Russia and China to fully  participate in the annual G-7 meetings, the so-called  international economic summits. This would serve both mutual  understanding and Moscow and Beijing's legitimate need for  recognition.    Furthermore, the current system of security agreements  between the West and Moscow must be supplemented with a general  strategic consultation and cooperation treaty between Russia and  the West. The NATO Consultation Council would then remain an  episode.    Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia will soon  become members of the EU. Russia is not happy about this, but  it cannot object. It is only logical to put these states under  NATO protection. But do not water down NATO and the Atlantic  alliance!    Kozyrev has repeatedly warned against a return of the  centuries of Russian imperialism to get foreign policy successes  from the West, which are necessary for the reform forces in  Russia. However, despite all Russia's current economic and  political weaknesses, the West cannot avoid the actual  recognition of this gigantic country's historical, current, and  future role as a superpower.

Priorities for this year's overseas assistance are boosting  cooperation with non-governmental organization (NGOs) and  enhancing small programmes that are of mutual benefit to  countries involved, said Ellen Shipley, a counsellor in the  Technical and Economic Cooperation Section of the Australian  Embassy in Bangkok.    Australia's overseas aid programme has come under attack  from  its own NGOs for being too aligned with Australia's commercial  interests at the expense of helping the poor abroad.    According to an embassy press statement, half of the A$  [Australian dollars] 1.4 billion in overseas aid earmarked in  the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau  (AIDAB) 1994- 1995 budget will go to 13 countries in Southeast  Asia and the Indian subcontinent.    Shipley said Australia wants to cooperate better in this  area  because ""we're located in this region -- we want to be a  complete partner in this region.""    She was attending a workshop here along with 30 development  project officers from Australian embassies in 13 countries, from  Vietnam to Pakistan. The training session was the second held  in the past 18 months, giving participants -- a number of them  locally hired -- a chance to exchange views and learn about  policy development.    Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating recently pledged  A$350  million over the next four years to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.    Hieng Sokchea, Senior Administrative Clerk in the  Development  Cooperation Unit of Australia's Phnom Penh Embassy, said the  four sectors he's pinpointed were education, agriculture, health  and infrastructure. Australian aid to Cambodia doubled to A$92  million in the 1994-95 fiscal budget.    Sokchea said more than 15 bridges, costing an estimated A$10  million, will be built along Road 5 from Phnom Penh to  Battambang.    For Laos, A$48 million was promised over the next four  years.  One-third will go to training and human development programmes,  while one-fifth is for infrastructure projects.    Vietnam's aid was doubled to A$140 million, making it the  third top overseas recipient after Papua New Guinea and  Indonesia.    For Thailand, Shipley said one third of the Bt [baht] 500  million assistance pledged is geared toward educational  programmes and, although there is a focus on rural programmes,  Canberra is ""looking at bigger infrastructure programmes"".    Shipley pointed out that one of Thailand's most crucial  problems is income disparity, so her country is supporting a new  programme on small local NGOs that will have an impact on income  generation.

He emphasized that the world faces new challenges and  threats to its stability and security following the era of  political-ideological confrontation. Speaking at the  inauguration of the 10th Mexican-Canadian Ministerial Commission  meeting here, Tello asserted that cooperation among countries  must be increased, justice among nations augmented, and  international institutions strengthened. The Mexican foreign  secretary said that Mexico and Canada have significant points of  agreement that have allowed more solid and profound bilateral  relations. Tello asserted that as the world has become more  independent, nations are intermingling more, new economic spaces  are being created, and competition for markets and positions in  the global economy is increasing. For this reason, scientific  and technological developments force firms and governments to  propose efficient solutions that acknowledge the needs of  growing competitiveness.    He emphasized that NAFTA has increased and broadened  Mexican-  Canadian interaction and has caused bilateral relations to  become significantly closer and more familiar. The foreign  secretary said the agenda of the 10th meeting, which ends this  afternoon, shows the richness of the countries' relations as it  includes issues related to commerce, finance, agriculture,  transportation, mining, forestry, fisheries, and labors.    Regarding politics, the dialogue goes beyond the bilateral  field and includes aspects related to the operations and goals  of institutions such as the United Nations, the OAS, the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation mechanism.    Canadian Foreign Minister Andres Ouellet pointed out the  importance of the countries' bilateral relations based on mutual  respect and agreement on goals to bring peace and respect to  every country. He added that NAFTA has prompted great  international interest as well as curiosity in European and  Asian countries, but ""for us, it is a new relationship that we  must intensify, mature, and fully experience.""    He mentioned the possibility of Latin American countries  such  as Chile joining the commercial agreement and added that  countries in the hemisphere should seek wider membership.    The Canadian minister explained that the meeting will  include  issues related to the export of Canadian equipment and minerals  and tele-exploration [teledeteccion] technology, as well as  access to the market of Mexican firms such as Mexican Petroleum  and the Federal Electricity Company.    Ouellet said NAFTA increases Mexico's and Canada's prospects  for sustained economic growth and said that both governments  will respect the other's priorities regarding labor and  environmental issues.    The delegates to the 10th Ministerial Commission meeting  will  study bilateral relations and cooperation mechanisms in various  sectors of common interest.     "

He presented the proposals, notably on creating a mechanism  for consultation on security issues worldwide, and on increased  military and political cooperation, to the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation Wednesday.    The statement, a copy of which was received by AFP Thursday,  was headlined the ""practical participation"" of Russia in the  Alliance programme.    It stated: ""One of the goals of the partnership should be  the formation of a collective security and stability system in  Europe.""    It also also cited as an issue of ""special importance""  possible cooperation over Russian-led peacekeeping operations in  the former Soviet Union.    A well-placed NATO source said Wednesday that Grachev had  proposed levels of participation proportional to Moscow's  military weight, indicating an enthusiasm exceeding all  expectations.    ""We thought (Russia) was only prepared to dabble its toe in  the PFP, but Grachev indicated it was ready to dive in,"" the  NATO source said.    But Grachev also called for a formal system of consultations  between Moscow and NATO on European and world security.    He reiterated Russia's wish for regular and automatic  meetings with NATO at all political and military levels,  something the Alliance has thus far resisted.    ""NATO is not ready or willing to give any droit de regard  (right to influence) or even worse a veto over its activities,""  NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Balanzino told a press  conference Wednesday.    The Russian text added that the Partnership should help  coordinate activities of NATO and other structures, notably the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), the document said.    The CSCE comprises all European countries plus the United  States and Canada, while the NACC is the NATO body responsible  for consultation with former Warsaw Pact countries.    ""In principle, the CSCE and the NACC should seek to  coordinate the efforts of NATO,"" and other bodies including the  European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),  the text said.    Political partnership would operate via consultations on  European and world security issues which would function ""both on  a regular and emergency basis,"" it stated.    Balanzino, the chairman of Wednesday's meeting, suggested  that NATO was willing to accept the evolution of a ""constructive  and substantial dialogue"" if Russia embraced the military  partnership.    But NATO rejected a treaty formalising bilateral relations  with Russia, although it did not rule out a less formal  declaration when Moscow signs the PFP.     "

Participating in this  operation were, on the Russian side, 180 officers and soldiers  from the Russian Pacific fleet, and a large-to-medium sized  landing fleet; and on the U.S. side, 250 Marines and a number of  warships, including helicopter carriers and landing ships. The  U.S. and Russian navies' joining forces with each other no doubt  has drawn the world's attention.    The U.S.-Russian joint military exercises were a simulated  joint operation conducted by the two navies in order to carry  out joint disaster relief missions in cases of natural disaster,  such as an earthquake or flood, that might take place somewhere  in the world. For this reason, both sides deployed landing  ships, helicopters, and amphibious tanks to conduct the military  exercises. The landing site was the Keleierke [0344 7191 1422  0344] Peninsula, 50 km to the south of Vladivostok. Both U.S.  and Russian Marines carried out antidisaster and  personnel-rescue exercises.    This joint military maneuver was carried out according to  some provisions of the U.S.-Russian memorandum on military  cooperation which was signed last September. Although the  central task of this military maneuver was confined to  disaster-fighting missions, it was, after all, a joint military  operation run by the two military superpowers, an event that  would have been absolutely unimaginable in the past.    The Two Superpowers Each Have Their Own Purposes in Military  Cooperation    Russia has been facing numerous economic difficulties  following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, but it remains  a world-class military superpower. To be sure, this military  maneuver was focused on joint disaster-fighting operations, but  it still created an impression to the world that the two  military superpowers are intending to join forces to dominate  the world or to intervene in regional affairs when necessary.  Russia itself does hope to work together with the United States  and have a say in world affairs, as the United States does.  Referring to the Korean nuclear issue, the United States  recently pledged to press the Security Council to impose  economic sanctions. In response to this, Russia reproached the  United States for failure to consult it beforehand, and  therefore it expressed discontent with the United States and  voiced objection to the U.S. action. Russia's purpose is to  fight for a say in world affairs which is equal to that enjoyed  by the United States.    Following the end of the Cold War, the world situation has  been developing in a diversified manner. As far as diplomacy is  concerned, Clinton has frequently flaunted his ""strength,"" but  the U.S. strength is not equal to its ambition. Either its  hard-line diplomacy or tactic of using military force is  ineffective in many cases -- in the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil  war, the Somali rebellion, the Rwanda civil war, the Haiti coups  d'etat, and the Korean nuclear issue, for instance. The United  States has been facing criticism, both at home and abroad,  throughout the process of military intervention in Somali, from  the deployment of U.S. troops to the pullout from the country.    Being busy dealing with the economic crisis, today's Russia  is much less influential than the Soviet Union of the past. As  civil war burst out in the former Yugoslavia, the West  repeatedly urged Russia to play a leading part in pressuring the  militarily aggressive Serbs, but so far the West's appeals have  been to no avail.    The United States and Russia Are To Jointly Explore Space  Technology    Both military superpowers are experiencing a decline in  their  control over and influence in the world. Both sides wish to  cooperate and support each other to seek a greater say in world  affairs.    On 21 June, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev announced that  Russia and the United States would jointly propose to the  Security Council a bill on easing the nuclear crisis on the  Korea Peninsula. This bill consists of a proposal to call an  international conference and a scheme of stage-by-stage  sanctions against Korea. The only new point in this bill lies  in that it is a ""U.S.-Russian cooperation project.""    The United States and Russia also have decided to step up  scientific and technological cooperation in the areas of space  exploration and environmental protection. As scheduled, Russian  Premier Chernomyrdin, who will be on a visit to the United  States, will attend an accord-signing ceremony on 23 June, by  which the United States will join the space development plan to  be run on Russia's Mir space station.    ""U.S.-Russian cooperation"" may be extended to other fields  in  the future. It can be beneficial to both sides, and it also can  be used, when necessary, to demonstrate to the world the  intention of the United States and Russia to dominate the world,  both militarily and politically.

Mr Wirasak said Thailand and Burma have been haunted by the  ""legacy of distrust"" for a long time and that needed to be  changed.    At present, Thailand and Burma are in the process of  creating  mutual trust the ambassador said. ""We are trying to help Burma  break political isolation by inviting them to be a guest country  at the ASEAN meeting in June. And at the same time we  facilitate the attempt of Burma to talk with the minority groups  and stop the fighting.""    ""Thailand maintains a non-intervention policy. However, we  hope that Burma and the minority groups will eventually reach a  peaceful settlement. The border between Thailand and Burma  should be the border of cooperation and not the border of  conflict. The fighting between Burma and the minority groups  along the border also adversely affects our country and our  people.""    The envoy said only when Burma settles the problem with the  minority groups will that country will be able to start  focussing on development. ""The situation has somewhat inched  towards peace as Burma has developed a more flexible stance when  dealing with the minorities,"" he added.    The diplomat said Burma has tried to improve its image and  that will take some time before it finds acceptance. ""When I  first arrived in Burma, it was under martial law. Curfew was  imposed. Now there is more freedom. A number of political  prisoners were released and Burma has somewhat decentralised its  power.""    ""It has also drafted a new constitution which will have the  presidency system. However, the military will continue to play  an important role in that country. It's just like Indonesia.  If we can accept Indonesia, why don't we accept Burma?""    He said he has eyed Burma with an Asian point of view. ""I  admit that I had in the past looked at Burma from the  westernised viewpoint and I had misunderstood that I know the  neighbouring country well. In fact, I came to realise that I  knew very little about Burma which has a different political  culture. Let's look at our neighbour from the Asian point of  view, like people in the same region should think of.""    Burma should be allowed to find its own political solutions,  he said.    Thailand has initiated a number of projects to help Burma in  the areas of public health in the rural areas, he said.

The only alternative to them is a regime of total international  confidence. This is stated in a report of the Russian  delegation submitted to the 27th conference of the Japanese  atomic industrial forum underway here. The report has been  drawn up by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. It believes  that the Russian nuclear complex which is experiencing difficult  times should export more electricity generated by nuclear power  plants and should heavier rely on the export of technologies and  a number of materials. It should be open to international  cooperation.    In view of the unstable situation in the world, while  nuclear  disarmament is in progress, the complex of nuclear arms is under  certain obligations, says the report. More stable, easier  verifiable and predictable strategic arms systems should be  preserved while surplus, morally and obsolete provocatively  dangerous kinds of nuclear arms should be eliminated.    Russia spends up to one thousand billion roubles a year to  dismantle such armaments, according to the information of the  Ministry of Atomic Energy. The basic stocks of arms are worn to  over 50 per cent. A large-scale modernisation is required in  keeping with contemporary demands, also in order to dismantle  and utilise nuclear arms.    The Ministry of Atomic Energy regards as a way out a broader  use of vast scientific and technological potential accumulated  over the decades of the development of the atomic industry.  ``In addition to large state investment, Russia's participation  in the market of high technologies and scientific and  technological progress with drawing foreign capital in  reasonable and mutually advantage proportion would be useful to  all sides,'' says the report. ``The ministry annually receives  80 million dollars of additional financing for scientific and  technological projects. As a result of external financing of  projects carried out at enterprises of the Ministry of Atomic  Energy with the subsequent joint use.''    The new generation of nuclear power and thermal stations  with  fuel recycling and deactivation of waste, including slow-neutron  and fast-neutron reactors with the use of uranium-plutonium fuel  and the uranium-thorium cycle also requires considerable  outlays. These power plants will be much more safer because of  features of their design including an uncontrolled chain  reaction of nuclei. Russia views as an additional source of  investment into the area the expansion of the export of  electricity generated by nuclear power plants, of equipment and  fuel for power plants, including products for the utilisation of  weapon-grade uranium and plutonium, as well as rare-earth  metals, medical isotopes and high-calory fertilizer which are  produced in the framework in the nuclear complex. This  investment will reach one billion dollars this year.     "

I would like to congratulate Vietnam for  building this project through its own effort. It proves that  Vietnam is able to do other bigger projects. The Hoa Binh  Hydroelectric Project is the symbol of the close relations  between Vietnam and Russia. It makes relations between Vietnam  and Russia as well as other countries in the Commonwealth of  Independent States become closer and closer. In future, Russia  may install two other generator units at the Hoa Binh  Hydroelectric Power Plant, and two other generator units at the  Pha Lai Thermal Electric Power Plant. When Russia is [word  indistinct] from its crisis, and it is certainly getting out of  the crisis, we will have more joint ventures and investment in  Vietnam. [end recording]    Mr. Yarov then gave his impression about Vietnam and its  people. He said: The Vietnamese people are hardworking and  hospitable. During my working visit to Vietnam, the Vietnamese  Government has created favorable conditions for us, especially  during my visit and in our presence at the inauguration of the  eighth generator unit of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant.  The weather in Vietnam is very beautiful.     "

The Russian foreign minister arrived here Wednesday [26  January], taking with him quite a number of officials and  business people from various parts of the country, indicating  that Russia is ready to further its economic and trade  cooperation, including border trade, with China.    Sino-Russian trade volume in 1993 hit a record 7.68 billion  U.S. dollars, an increase of some 30 percent over the previous  year.    Of this, Russia's import from China amounted to 2.69 billion  U.S. dollars and its export to China was 4.99 billion U.S.  dollars, remaining the seventh biggest trading partner of China.    China mainly exported to Russia grain, food, light  industrial  goods and textiles, household electrical appliances and raw  materials, and imported Russian power plant equipment, vehicles,  steel, chemical fertilizer and electronics and machinery.    The economies of China and Russia are mutually  complementary,  and economic and trade exchanges between the two countries,  which is in the interest of both, will cater to the needs of  each other's economic development and life of the two peoples.    China supports, as always, positive development of  Sino-Russian cooperation in trade, economy and technology based  on equality and mutual benefit and encourages its companies and  enterprises to cooperate with Russia in various fields, a trade  official said.    At present, bilateral economic and trade cooperation are  being diversified to cover traditional barter trade,  over-the-counter trade and compensation trade.    During the first 10 months of 1993, China signed 420  contracts with Russia for providing labor services, involving  470 million U.S. dollars.    China also invested some 82 million U.S. dollars in nearly  500 joint ventures in Russia.    China and Russia agreed at a meeting held in March last year  that the two countries would cooperate in the fields of building  materials, information technology, instrument making,  metallurgy, agriculture, chemicals, and micro-electronics.    By the end of last June, China had imported a dozen Russian  technological projects for aviation, power and metal processing,  with a total value of 400 million U.S. dollars, while exporting  to Russia some 50 technological projects valued at 120 million  U.S. dollars.    However, there are some snags in the Sino-Russian trade,  such  as poor transportation facilities.    A trade official with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation said that China is willing to make  concerted efforts with Russia in 1994 to consolidate what had  been achieved in trade and cooperation between the two countries.    He hoped that both China and Russia would take some measures  to strengthen management of each other's enterprises dealing  with foreign trade and improve investment environment, so as to  further bilateral co-operation.

Who's At the  Helm?"": ""Of the Competitors, We're the Assistants...""; first  paragraph is source introduction before Yaropolov's piece]    [Text] The negotiations between Russia and the United  States on cooperation in space may wind up with a decision to  create a joint orbital space station. That aim evokes differing  assessments from specialists.    The capabilities and infrastructure of the domestic space  sector could be destroyed if Russia accepts NASA's proposal with  regard to an international space station project. The  development of the Alpha station, mainly with U.S. equipment and  in cooperation with Europe, Japan, and Canada, could reduce us  -- with two modules and a transport craft -- to a ""second-string  player."" But it is Russia who is creating a space infrastructure  for the United States, and that 3-3.5 years earlier than they  had planned to do it on their own. But their attempts, which  have cost them almost $10 billion, have not been successful.    The future station, built and serviced with the American  space shuttles, can fly with an orbital inclination of 57ë,  and maybe even 51ë. Consequently, it will not fly over all  of Russia, as had been planned for our Mir-2 station. Recall  that Mir-2 was supposed to lift off in 1997, to an orbit of  65ë, which would make it possible to continue remote sensing  of the ground. The Alpha enables survey of no more than 5  percent of our country.    The United States will have the opportunity to use the  orbital complex in its entirety. But no one knows yet whether  Russian cosmonauts will get to operate the Alpha at all. The  fact is that all the know-how with regard to the development of  the orbital station has been valued at $800 million. Even though  Russia herself invested tens of billions of rubles in that  technology at a time when the ruble and the dollar were almost  equivalent.    But since the whole station will go for roughly $40 billion  and will be operated by the project participants on a percentage  basis, according to how much was contributed, Russia's operating  time will be no more than 10 days a year. When you recall that  we have obligations to France in the manned program, then it's  not clear at all for whom or for what purpose we will be  creating Alpha.    Besides, Russian industry will lose vitally important  orders.  And the unique Cosmonaut Training Center in Zvezdnyy Gorodok  will become virtually unnecessary -- the crews will start  training in the States. And the Flight Control Center, with all  its expensive equipment and highly skilled specialists, will  lose its significance.     "

0,FT942-12558 ,"FT942-12558 _AN-ED2DAAA2FT 940429   FT  29 APR 94 / Tokyo policy on Iran seen as being naive      By PAUL ABRAHAMS      TOKYO   The revelation that Iran may have been training Japanese terrorists to conduct assassinations in Europe and the US will produce acute embarrassment in Tokyo. The discomfit is caused not merely because members of the Japanese Red Army, one of several left-wing terrorist groups which burst onto the international scene in the 1970s, might be planning attacks in western cities, but because of Japan's controversial policy of courting Iran with aid and finance. The warnings yesterday by the US and UK governments that Iran must halt its apparent support for terrorist groups will put pressure on Tokyo to review its own policies towards that country, which have been based on the idea that it is assisting moderates in Tehran. This justification for Japan's policy, formulated by Mr Kunihiko Saito, a permanent foreign vice minister and former ambassador in Tehran, is that the moderate and technocratic faction in the Iranian government is being led by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. This faction, argues the foreign ministry, wants to develop economically - and therefore socially and politically - and should be encouraged. Japan's western allies believe the Japanese foreign ministry is being naive. They say no evidence exists that President Rafsanjani opposes state sponsorship of terrorism. Indeed, they insist he in fact heads the top-level Supreme National Security Council which orders executions. The Tokyo policy, motivated, at least in part by Japan's desire to secure adequate energy for a country that has almost no natural energy resources, has included providing Tehran with much needed aid and finance. During late 1992, Tokyo, in spite of western reproaches, resumed aid to Iran, and the following May released Y38.8bn (Pounds 255m) for the Karun Dam project. A second tranche is due to be provided shortly. Last month, in a separate move, the governor of the Central Bank of Iran announced Tehran had arranged the final details necessary to reschedule Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.57bn) in loans from Japan. The terms allowed a grace period of 24 months and the loans would be repaid over the following three and a half years. Both the US and Britain have been anxious to prevent Tehran rescheduling its short-term debt as a means of bringing pressure to bear on Iran and its shaky economy which has been crippled by the Iran-Iraq war and the low price of oil. They hope solidarity among the G7 on terrorism and the case of Mr Salman Rushdie, the author of the controversial work, The Satanic Verses, should help force a change in Iran's policies. Western diplomats are bewildered by the Japanese policy, particularly as they believe Japan has suffered from Iranian-inspired terrorism. In July 1991 Professor Itashi Igarashi, the Japanese translator of Mr Rushdie's book, was murdered. Japanese police believe the assassination was the work of trained assassins from Vevak, the Iranian ministry of intelligence and security headed by Mr Ali Fallahian. The Iranian embassy in Tokyo provided logistical support for the killers. In addition, say western diplomats, the North Korean missile programme threatening Tokyo is being developed with Iranian money and technical co-operation. North Korea's Rodong-1 missile is being tested in Iran, for example. Western governments are clearly anxious to use the latest revelations to bring pressure to bear on Tokyo. However, the foreign ministry in Tokyo yesterday insisted it had not so far seen any conclusive evidence of Tehran's involvement in state-sponsored terrorism. If the British government could provide clear evidence, appropriate action would be taken, it added.   Countries:-  IRZ  Iran, Middle East.     JPZ  Japan, Asia.

Western diplomats in Kuwait said Baghdad would be infuriated by the demarcation but there was little Iraq could do beyond complaining. Mutual agreement on the new border 'is just something else which will have to wait until the regime changes in Iraq', one diplomat said. The United Nations Commission, established as part of the Gulf war ceasefire agreement, is not expected to present its findings until April. However, officials say the team has already decided on 'parameters' for the border. These will lie several hundreds - in some cases thousands - of metres north of what has previously been accepted as the border. The demarcation will place in Kuwaiti territory between five and seven oil wells in the Iraqi portion of the Rumalia oilfield. The UN experts have also decided that the point at which the border meets the coast is virtually certain to run through Iraq's main naval base at Umm Qasr. The new border will anger Baghdad for a number of reasons. Iraq revived its disputed claim to the entirety of Kuwait as justification for its August 1990 invasion. Iraq also claimed some southern portions of the Rumalia oilfield, which dips into Kuwait, and had expressed irritation about its limited access to the sea. Umm Qasr has virtually been Iraq's sole serviceable port since the Shatt al Arab waterway was closed in September 1980 by the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war. Iraq's president Saddam Hussein launched the war in part to gain full sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab. The commission's findings have been based on exhaustive research into maps and documents held largely in British Foreign Office archives. These date back as far as the early 1900s, when the modern states of Iraq and Kuwait were shaped out of the crumbling Ottoman empire. Once the decision is announced, the 120-mile (200km) common border will be marked with border posts and will also receive formal UN sanction. Common borders are finally a matter of bilateral consent between neighbouring countries, but US officials say they will insist the new boundary be respected as Iraq's southern border. The present border is monitored by the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, which patrols a demilitarised zone running 10km north of the accepted border and 5km south. Iraqi trespass over this border is considered an infringement of the Gulf ceasefire terms. The UN Security Council yesterday warned Iraq to start co-operating fully with UN weapons inspectors or face grave, though unspecified, consequences, AP reports. The council decided in closed meetings to send Mr Rolf Ekeus, who heads the special commission monitoring elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, to Baghdad at once to demand compliance with UN resolutions. Diplomats say that economic sanctions could be tightened if Iraq does not fall in line. Iraq repeatedly has tried to conceal the extent of its nuclear weapons programmes and other arms projects. It also has refused to co-operate in the long-term monitoring and destruction of arms. Shifting sands, Page 4  The Financial Times   London Page 1 Map (Omitted).  "

To this end, Malaysia has exerted efforts to  make its presence felt. The principle of opening one's door to  the outside world without losing one's own traits is strictly  applied to everyday activities in Malaysia. The country  consists of people of different races with Malaysians accounting  for 53 percent of the population and Chinese, Indians, and other  foreign nationals representing the rest of the population.  Although Malaysians belong to different religions, they all get  along very well.    Malaysians regard Vietnam as a true friend. Therefore, on  the very first day of their visit, General Secretary Do Muoi and  other Vietnamese guests were invited to attend the 10th General  Meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council.    Reporting on this event, major newspapers in Malaysia  carried  headlines saying that this was a unique dialogue. At that  meeting, General Secretary Do Muoi answered many questions  raised by the delegates. In response to a question posed by a  famous British film producer as to whether Vietnam, while  implementing its open-door policy, is worried about the  influence of foreign cultures on its national traits, General  Secretary Do Muoi emphatically said: We welcome mankind's  cultural quintessence and cultural activities that help promote  friendship, enrich the sense of aesthetics, and perfect the good  personality of the Vietnamese people.    Before leaving Malaysia, General Secretary Do Muoi granted  an  interview to correspondents of the Voice of Vietnam and the  Vietnam Television Network on the results of his visit to  Malaysia. He said:    [Begin Do Muoi recording] It can be said that my visit has  yielded very encouraging results. Our Malaysian friends have  accorded the Vietnamese delegation a very warm welcome. We  witnessed many building projects everywhere we went. I am  convinced that by the year 2020, Malaysia will achieve its  economic objectives of turning itself into a developed  industrialized country. Our Malaysian friends highly value the  renovation process in Vietnam and hope that our country will  reach a relatively quick growth rate within a short period of  time. His Excellency Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and I are  pleased to note that so far, the friendship and cooperation  between the two countries have developed very well. Both of us  hope that together with the recent visits by Vietnamese Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir  Mohamed, my current visit will contribute to consolidating and  strengthening bilateral cooperative ties a step further. His  Excellency Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed said: It is  necessary for Vietnam to move forward, effect changes for the  better, and enrich itself, thereby helping create conditions for  Malaysia and other neighboring countries to score better  development results.

The main aim of the  Saudi oil policy, according to this evaluation, is to prevent  Iran from becoming stronger, which the Saudis fear and are  prepared to suffer economically as long as the harm they cause  Iran is even greater.    The political echelon was informed that raising the price of  oil by several dollars would significantly improve Iran's  economy, which has a very heavy foreign debt of $30 billion, of  which $8 billion are short-term debts.    Political sources in Jerusalem recently expressed concern  about an agreement by Germany, Japan, and Switzerland to  reschedule Iran's debts and to offer it new lines of credit.  Iran is also negotiating a similar agreement with France. In  the view of the analysts, Iran might use the money to purchase  dual purpose technology which would permit it to advance its  plans to develop nuclear weapons.    The analysts said that the scope of trade between the United  States and Iran casts a shadow on the U.S. commitment to isolate  Tehran. Iran's trade with the United States is smaller than  with the Europeans and the Japanese. It was over $600 million  last year, and in 1992 reached some $730 million, which was made  up almost entirely of U.S. industrial equipment to Tehran.  Iranian exports to the United States were very small, only some  $20 million.    Israel warned the West about Iran's aspiration to obtain  nuclear arms and its actions to encourage Islamic fundamentalism  in the Arab states. Israel's policy was however not to present  itself as an enemy of Iran, but to round up international  support for a policy of curtailing Iran's rearmament and  subversive tactics, and to support a U.S. policy of ""dual  containment"" against Iran and its rival Iraq.    The evaluation recently presented to the political echelon  in  Jerusalem states that U.S. ""dual containment"" is no longer a  single policy against Tehran and Baghdad. An analysis of a  paper published by National Security Adviser Tony Lake in  FOREIGN AFFAIRS shows that Washington's policy toward Iraq calls  for the overthrow of President Saddam Husayn's regime. Its  policy toward Iran is different. The United States is not  trying to overthrow the Islamic regime in Iran and wants to  influence Tehran to change its behavior and start a dialogue  with Washington. It has, however, reservations about the  policies of European states and Japan, which are seen as  attempts to advance their business interests with Tehran. The  Americans think that improving Iran's economic situation will  decrease the regime's extremism. The analysis presented to the  political echelon said that Israel early on expected ""dual  containment"" to be expressed in an effort to isolate Iran  politically and economically, as the United States had done with  the USSR.    Elements in the U.S. intelligence community recently  dismissed the Israeli evaluation of Iran's subversive activities  in the Arab world. In their view, Iran is trying to keep up its  revolutionary image and present itself as having influence in  the Middle East way beyond what it really has, and that there is  no real Iranian threat to undermine the existing regimes in the  Arab states.    The U.S. sources believe that the fundamentalist movements  in  Egypt enjoy some aid from Iran, but do not want to be Tehran's  satellites since they regard themselves as popular Egyptian  organizations. Tehran is simultaneously maintaining ties with  Husni Mubarak's government. In the U.S. view, Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] in the territories also does not want to  operate as an Iranian satellite.     "

Now  that through divine blessing the people of Iran are celebrating  the 15th anniversary of the glorious revolution with pride and a  sense of victory; now that the people and the government --  united and steadfast -- have surpassed a long, adventurous march  full of victories as well as difficulties; now that the serving  government, through a great struggle and by taking the  initiative, has removed the major obstacles in the face of  economic progress and national growth and development -- thereby  paving the way toward construction and general welfare with a  speed suited to the conditions of the revolution, the general  conditions of the country require the publicity mechanism of the  Voice and Vision to take on new policies in line with the  nation's progress in all fields in order to balance the cultural  climate of the nation and the accelerating trend of construction  and general growth and development with the bases of the  revolution and the fundamental principles of Islam. Furthermore,  in order to confront the propaganda and cultural onslaught of  arrogance and its lackeys, the new policies should widen the  scope of the media's struggle in the trench of explaining,  deepening, and honoring the glorious principles of the Islamic  revolution, as well as in the trench of explaining the  self-sacrificing efforts of the country's officials, the three  branches of the state, judiciary, executive, legislative,  especially the hard working and relentless judicial branch, with  new, progressive, and rational methods and through a great and  vigilant jihad.    Taking into account the aforementioned, and expressing my  thanks and gratitude for the relentless and continuous efforts  of the esteemed Mohammad Hashemi, who during his term as the  official in charge of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic  Republic of Iran -- particularly during the imposed Iran-Iraq  war -- carried out great and all-encompassing efforts in  administrating this sensitive and important institution, I  appoint the esteemed Dr. 'Ali Larijani, who is one of the  outstanding scientific and cultural figures of the country and  who has a proud, revolutionary background, as well as a  background of cabinet responsibilities -- and an individual  known for his devotion, piety, and cultural and artistic  experiences -- as the head of the Voice and Vision, as well as a  member of the Supreme Council for Cultural Revolution for a term  of five years.    It is expected that he will receive the cooperation of  intelligent colleagues and revolutionary innovators from within  the organization and attract prominent personalities from  outside to produce a new plan and a productive agenda to utilize  the organization's vast resources, turn it into a base for the  development of ideas, culture, and art, and a center for the  guidance of Iran's Muslim people and others who are eager to  hear the voice of revolutionary Iran. A place for the  presentation of the nation's achievements in different fields of  life, science, politics, art, education, and other fields.    Here I deem it necessary to thank the esteemed Supervisory  Council of the IRIB, comprising representatives from the three  powers of judicial, legislative, and executive for their  valuable efforts, and while wishing its scholarly and worthy  members to cooperate with the management of the Voice and  Vision, announce the termination of the Council.    The salient points, which should be observed in the great  new  plan are as follows:    The operation of the Voice and Vision organization should be  aimed at achieving better quality in all its programs. The  quantitative expansion should be put in second place.  Nevertheless, the necessary nationwide transmission to all  corners and rural areas of the country should be given priority.    The structure of the organization should be reviewed and the  necessary changes should be made to its style and productivity.    Cooperation with university scholars and scholastic circles  should be used to raise scientific and social issues and present  new ideas to the public.    In Islamic discussions, attention should be paid to the  quality, depth, and excellence of the issues. Weak and  ambiguous issues and personal tastes should be avoided. In  order to achieve this, wise and calculated cooperation should be  made with religious seminaries and scholars, particularly the  esteemed and prominent scholars of the Qom Seminary.    In general, Voice and Vision should become an open school  for  the presentation of the realities of pure Muhammadan Islam,  peace be upon him and his scion, and the instructions of the Ahl  al-Beit [family of the prophet], peace be upon them, in a noble  and proper way.    In the production of artistic programs, cooperation should  be  made with the country's cultural foundations, such as the  Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, the Islamic publicity  organization, and artistic circles, in order to make the most  use of them.    The dissemination of information, which is one of the most  important tasks of the Voice and Vision, should find a better  system, better speed, better editorial judgement, as well as  intelligible and correct language, more than before. The Voice  and Vision must use correct Persian, and its language should set  standards. Mispronunciation and misreading must be eliminated  immediately. The Voice and Vision must be the teacher of the  sweet, clear, and powerful Persian language. A number of steps  have been taken in his context, but they should be complemented.    Artistic programs on the Voice and Vision should become  sweet and attractive, with the most sumptuous theatrical arts  containing social, political, and ethical messages in this  all-encompassing medium. Light, empty, and misleading programs  lacking in artistic quality, which are sometimes very expensive  to produce, must be banned forthwith.    The broadcast of banal and sensual music, especially those  types of music that in this branch of the arts lack national  identity and Iranian principles, must be avoided. Music can be  both permitted [halal] and banned [haram]. Its permitted type  should be recognized and used correctly following the clear  instructions of the late Imam [Khomeyni], sanctified be his  dust. Genuine Iranian arts, which suit the spiritual make up  and instincts of our people, should be used more in this context.    In all the programs, the general trend should be toward  confronting the propaganda, cultural and news onslaught of  arrogance. This important principle must be adhered to not only  in news and reports, but also in scientific, social, and  political programs -- especially in artistic and entertaining  programs such as plays, one-off dramas, and serials. This point  should be correctly clarified to all the employees of radio and  television. The alien, attacking culture affects the mind and  actions of the people more through plays and entertaining  programs than through face-to-face talks. This unwanted effect  must be vigilantly and rationally stopped.    On the whole, the Voice and Vision, as the great late Imam,  may he be admitted to God's paradise, had highlighted, should be  a university for all in which religion, ethics, Islamic values,  and the ways and methods of life, as well as new developments in  the world of science and politics -- and new and pioneering  thoughts -- are taught in a clear language comprehensible to all  sectors of society, so that every one, from those with simple  minds to great thinkers and outstanding individuals, can manage  to benefit from the radio and television programs to the best of  their ability, and so that everyone can become fulfilled by the  programs' great bounty.    Programs must be understandable and useful for all people,  but must not, in any way, be banal and frivolous. A Voice and  Vision suitable for Islamic Iran should gradually take shape in  which intelligence, ability, and a general leaning toward  culture, politics, and science exists side by side with  subtlety, taste, and talent, and be accompanied by a spirit of  reconstruction and recreation of a great and proud Iran, natural  to this ancient, yet young nation.    Apart from all that, the share of listeners beyond the  borders -- millions of people who in various states and from  various nations have set their sights to Iran and the voice of  the Islamic revolution -- should be prominently considered.  External programs should be completely free from banality,  repetitiveness, and frivolity and truly depict the Islamic Iran.  The carrying out of this heavy duty -- some of whose  preliminaries have been prepared by the former hardworking  management and officials, and some other sections of which must  be prepared by the current wise and intellectual manager -- no  doubt requires the cooperation of all the connected  establishments, especially the cabinet and the Islamic  Consultative Majles.    I call upon the respected deputies of the Islamic  Consultative Majles and respected cabinet members, especially  the president who is a man of knowledge and is an expert in  Islamic lore, to offer any assistance regarding the budget and  other resources for the move that the Voice and Vision needs  today. I expect the scholars, experts, artists, and other  strata, which are capable of somehow getting this crucial  organization to its deserved place, to cooperate with its  management. Undoubtedly such progress cannot be achieved  overnight. The important thing is that such a direction is  pursued. I beseech God Almighty success and guidance for the  respected head of the organization and the others involved, and  hope that all come under the auspices of the pure prayers of  God's supreme deputy [Vali al-Allah al-'Azam], may our souls be  sacrificed for him, and the assistance of that great one.    Peace be upon all the believing brothers.    [Signed] Sayyed Ali Khamene'i    [Dated] 12 February 1994     "

The explosion occurred in Kanggye in  Chagang Province where military plants are concentrated. In  addition to the loss of life, the accident destroyed several  buildings in the city. The ""Kanggye No. 26 General Plant"" was  North Korea's largest underground facility built in mountain  tunnels with a total of 20,000 people employed there; missile  assembly sites and other functions were reportedly removed  following the accident.    SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained these comments from Ko Chong-song,  32, who lived in Kanggye and defected to the Republic of Korea  via China last June. During a three-year period beginning in  1984, Ko daily went to the plant as a boxer with membership in  the plant's ""sports team."" Moreover, his two brothers were  serving as the accounting department chief and an engineer; he  also had many friends working there. Therefore, he was familiar  with the internal affairs of the plant.    According to Ko, the first explosion occurred around 2130  [1230 GMT] on 30 November. His apartment was approximately 2  kilometers from the plant and was blocked by a hill, but he  reported that the terrible noise and vibrations emanating from  the explosion were like those of an earthquake. The night sky  turned red with fire, and explosions continued until 1030 [0130  GMT] the next morning. The blasts shattered the windows of his  apartment, and many houses in the city were destroyed or burned.    The accident occurred at an outdoor materials dump near no.  11 missile assembly site. Mishandling of explosives set off a  fire which touched off a series of blasts among missiles and  artillery ordinance. The official death toll was put at 127,  but it was rumored among citizens that the toll should be about  200, including civilian casualties.    Immediately after the incident, a ""suicide squad"" was  organized to seal off the entrance to the tunnel to prevent  explosions from spreading inside the underground complex; some  20 volunteers were killed during the attempt. Five were later  awarded the title ""Heroes of the Republic.""    Following the incident, many party and government leaders--  including then-Premier Yon Hyong-mok, Korean Workers' Party  [KWP] Secretary (in charge of military supplies) Kim Chang-ho,  and KWP Second Economic Commission Chairman Kim  Man-song--inspected the plant. Kanggye was sealed off for 20  days following the accident, and a strict news blackout was  imposed on the area.    In addition to missiles, the plant was producing various  munitions, including rocket bombs, depth charges, torpedoes, and  mines. Surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and air-to-surface  missiles were respectively codenamed ""Hwasong [Mars] 1, 2, and  3""; they possessed a range of up to 200 kilometers. Ko noted  the plant is presently producing a new missile with a range of  over 550 kilometers.    All products of the plant were originally designed in the  former Soviet Union. They are exported mainly to Iran and other  Middle East countries. Plant personnel used to say: ""The  Iran-Iraq War was a field experiment for our weapons.""    The plant is built at the foot of a rocky mountain and is 2  kilometers in width. Production sections and assembly sites are  located inside the tunnels, and non-production sections such as  material dumps and management offices are located outside.    Chagang Province is a mountainous region in North Korea  adjoining the Chinese border. North Korea's military industries  are concentrated in the region, and civilian traffic is strictly  controlled. Under such circumstances, the accident has been  kept secret until now.     "

Nevertheless,  people in your country celebrate 10 June -- the date that the  Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation With Russia was signed in  1992 -- as an event of national importance. What is the reason  for that?    [Nanayev] Let us recall the events of the time. Kyrgyzstan  had just proclaimed its independence. The wholesale process of  its diplomatic recognition may be said to have begun. These  were worrying times. But our country was only really conscious  of its independence after Askar Akayev and Boris Yeltsin signed  the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation Between the Kyrgyz  Republic and Russia. This event was the point of departure from  which the current history of our state began. The treaty with  Russia is the foundation of cooperation between our countries  based on equality, respect, and support for our peoples.    [Shinkarenko] The foundation of cooperation....  Construction schedule overruns and unfinished construction are  associated with this word. What a lot of that we can remember!  But what has it really proved possible to accomplish on this  ""foundation?""    [Nanayev] I can say with confidence that the first stories  have already been built. Needless to say, the greatest progress  has been made in the political sphere. Our presidents have  really displayed political will here. Thanks to this the Treaty  on Friendship has been supplemented by dozens of other  agreements and protocols, strengthening the international-legal  base of our bilateral ties.    We fully understand the ways of further developing  Kyrgyz-Russian relations, strengthening cooperation within the  CIS framework, and coordinating actions on the international  arena. Cooperation between our foreign ministries, in the  military-political sphere, and in peacemaking operations has  been comprehensively developed....    [Shinkarenko] The special relations of trust between Boris  Yeltsin and Askar Akayev are well known. However, there are  plenty of problems on which they do not have time to work.    [Nanayev] You're right. It would be unjustified to depict  all aspects of our relations solely in a rosy light. In the  political sphere a great deal is determined by the leaders of  the states. Cooperation in other spheres is strongly influenced  by many factors. This applies particularly to trade and  economic relations. Production is continuing to decline in both  countries. The fall in the standard of living of the bulk of the  population has not yet been halted. Many major enterprises that  were created to meet all-Union needs, particularly in the  military-industrial complex, have been left without orders. And  this means tens of thousands of workers and specialists have  lost their livelihood. We cannot resolve this problem without  Russia's aid.    In Moscow and Bishkek there is shared understanding of the  difficulties that have arisen. For instance, an accord has been  secured on Russia providing credit and on the creation of an  investment fund and joint production units, including some based  on defense enterprises capable of producing output that Russia  also needs. However, the accords are slow to be implemented.    But there have been improvements here, too. Both in  Kyrgyzstan and in Russia it has proved possible to bring down  inflation considerably. The national currency is being  strengthened.... Thus light can already be seen at the end of  the tunnel.    [Shinkarenko] Many people in Russia are talking about the  difficulties that have beset Russian-speaking residents of the  former Soviet republics and about a Russian exodus. How are  things in Kyrgyzstan?    [Nanayev] Following the breakup of the USSR the fate of  their compatriots became a pressing matter for virtually all the  former Soviet republics. Like homing pigeons many people  reached out for their historic roots and origins -- and that is  quite natural. The instinct of self-preservation is always the  first to come into play in critical situations, but there is  also a countermovement. Raisa Fedorovna Kazanina, who now lives  in Volgograd, wrote recently to a Bishkek newspaper that she is  homesick for Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], which she considers her  second home. She wrote that only illness prevents her from  returning home.    Our president is fully determined to support this endeavor  on  the part of the country's Russian-speaking citizens and create  favorable living and working conditions for them, and thus halt  migration. The Republic has formulated a concrete action  program. It has been discussed with the Russian president and is  bolstered by corresponding measures on both sides.    But people have spiritual as well as material needs. In  particular, a great deal has been done to ensure that the  Russian language continues to operate in the Republic as before  and the interests of the Russian-speaking population are not  infringed upon. In 1993 a Slav University where teaching is  conducted in Russian opened in Bishkek. Funding of the  university's activity is shared by Kyrgyzstan and Russia.    There are, of course, many farfetched fears and prejudices  in  the sphere of interethnic relations, and the Republic's  leadership is doing everything it can to dispel them. For  instance, a reasonable approach has been found with Russia to  the so-called dual citizenship problem. I think that this  solution will prove quite acceptable to all the Republic's  inhabitants.    [Shinkarenko] Are there any other events or things that you  would like to point out on the eve of the treaty's second  anniversary?    [Nanayev] First, President Askar Akayev's official visit to  Moscow in February, his meeting with President Boris Yeltsin.  During this summit they discussed the most topical problems in  our contacts, including the sphere of credit and financial  relations, the prospects for the creation of joint ventures, the  position of Russian-speaking residents, ways of strengthening  the CIS, and promoting a settlement in Tajikistan.    I cannot help but underline the following. During the  difficult days this spring a number of regions of the Republic  were beset by gigantic landslides (mountain torrents). Dozens  of people died and the country sustained tremendous material  damage. The Russians, the relevant services of the Russian  Federation Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency  Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters were the first  to respond to the disaster. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of  Russia's Federation Council, visited the scene of the disaster.    Lastly, here is another interesting point. We are currently  preparing for a major event -- the Chuy Valley Days in Moscow  Oblast. This festival is in return for a visit that we were  paid by a delegation from Moscow Oblast. This event, as it may  appear, is of by no means local significance and does not date  from the time of stagnation. Familiarization with our friends'  affairs shows that in the new conditions, our people still have  a tremendous need for contacts with one another and have similar  interests and aspirations. The Chuy Valley Workers' Cultural  Days coincide with the second anniversary of the Treaty of  Friendship and in this respect are particularly symbolic.    [Shinkarenko] Good news and positive emotions are always  beneficial. But what particularly alarms you today, Mr.  Ambassador?    [Nanayev] By the strictest criteria, apart from the  difficulties that I have already mentioned, I do not foresee any  difficulties in either the short or the long term. On the  contrary, there is reason to think that our relations will  continue growing and bear increasingly rich fruit. But one must  not forget that these are relations between real partners linked  by thousands of strands. And, as you know, there have always  been, are, and regrettably will remain problems in our affairs  that we must work on, especially now, when our countries are in  the throes of a profound economic crisis. But unraveling these  ""knots"" is a matter for the political leadership and for us  diplomats.     "

Who Is Supporting Us in International Cooperation  for Protection of Nature'']    [Text] One of the priority areas of the foreign  policy of the Republic of Moldova is international cooperation  in the area of environmental protection. Moldova is joining in  the activity of international environmental protection  organizations and is participating in the implementation of the  corresponding conventions and agreements. To do this, an  Administration of International and Social Relations has been  created under the State Department for Environmental Protection  and Natural Resources, and under the National Institute of  Ecology--a Bureau of International Programs and Projects. The  solutions to problems of international cooperation of the  Republic of Moldova in the area of environmental protection is  discussed by a chief specialist of the State Department for  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Valeriy  Bricag.    The concrete results of the state department's international  activity were the ratification by the parliament of the Republic  of Moldova of the Biodiversity Convention and the endorsement of  such important documents as the World Charter on Nature, the  Convention on Crossborder Impact of Industrial Accidents, and  the Convention on Protecting the Animal Kingdom and the Natural  Environment in Europe. Moreover, in July 1993 the parliament  adopted a decree on the creation of a National Autonomous Center  of the Republic of Moldova in the International System of  Information on the Environment (INFOTERRA), which gave us access  to the World Environmental Data Bank.    It should be noted that in international cooperation in the  area of environmental protection, preference should be given to  concluding bilateral and regional agreements at the state level.  The endorsement of international conventions should take into  account, on the one hand, the republic's financial and technical  capabilities and, on the other, the interests of the state and  the world community. Both state and nonstate organizations can  enter international environmental protection organizations.  Cooperation with international funds, organizations, scientific  centers, and financial structures should include primarily the  development and implementation of national ecological projects.    As early as 1990, the State Department for Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources came out with an initiative to  conclude agreements at the level of environmental protection  organs of the Union republics. This activity has been  continued--draft agreements have been sent to all the  independent states of the former USSR. But not all of them have  shown a readiness to cooperate at this level. Only the first  protocol has been signed between the State Department for  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic  of Moldova and the Ministry of Environmental Protection of  Ukraine.    The Interstate Ecological Council (MES), which anticipates  cooperation among the CIS countries, was formed in February  1992. But the Republic of Moldova did not sign the document to  enter the MES. Moldova has not been represented at a single  session of the MES. But a department worker participated in the  work of the group of experts for preparing for the first session  of the MES, and another one participated as an observer in the  work of the first meeting of the Coordination Group under the  MES for cooperation with UNEP [United Nations Environment  Program] and other international organizations. This group was  formed by a decision of the third MES session, which took place  in Tashkent in May 1993, and its goal is to coordinate the  activity of the MES member countries for creating specialized  organs for cooperation with the UNEP and other international  organizations, and also for developing and implementing joint  ecological projects under the aegis of the UNEP.    In the former USSR, the role of a specialized organ for  cooperation with international environmental protection  organizations, including UNEP and the World Bank, was assigned  to the Center for International Projects (TsMP) under the Union  State Committee for the Protection of Nature. The CIS countries  decided to take advantage of the experience of the TsMP and, on  its basis, to create a consultative-executive organ of the  coordinating group under the MES.    Thus, the CIS countries developed their own mechanism for  interstate and international cooperation, but it is too early to  judge its effectiveness. In October of this year, an official  appeal was addressed to the chairman of the parliament of the  Republic of Moldova from the secretariat of the MES, considering  the entry of the Republic of Moldova into this organization. I  think we should get rid of our excessive suspicion regarding all  structures created within the framework of the former USSR.    Representatives of Russia are working in many international  organizations. The Russian lobby is very influential there. This  could have decisive significance for us--the success of our  cause will depend on the position of one or another  representative of an international organization. Joint entry and  coordination of activity will help incline international  organizations to support our country. The TsMP is making a  commitment to render assistance in international support for  Moldovan ecological projects and is also prepared to help in the  organization of a similar center in our republic.    We are losing a great deal as a result of delay in solving  these problems, and we are being left out of the picture. Thus,  the British company Alexander Jib and Company has monopolized  the right to develop and implement the project for protecting  the basin of the River Prut, which will enable it to dispose of  funds allotted by the World Bank.    Our relations with Romania are being arranged on the basis  of  the Protocol on Cooperation between the State Department for  Environmental Protection of the Republic of Moldova and the  Ministry of the Environment of Romania. In keeping with this, a  Romanian-Moldovan commission was formed for working together in  the Prut basin. But there has been no marked success in this  area. Cooperation is limited mainly to unilateral aid from  Romania. Financial and technical aid has been rendered to the  Moldsilva Association and the National Institute of Ecology--for  forestry and radiological research on the territory of Moldova.    Following the lines of cooperation within the framework of  international conventions, we will have to solve difficult  financial problems. Thus, Moldova has not joined the Geneva  Conference on Crossborder Air Pollution over Large Areas. The  reason is the lack of hard currency to subsidize measures within  the framework of the Convention. As for the Vienna Convention on  Protection of the Ozone Layer, not joining it has entailed  serious consequences for our economy. Starting in 1994,  international sanctions and bans will be introduced on exports  and imports of freon-emitting items. The corresponding sanctions  will be applied to countries that have not joined the Washington  Convention on International Trade in Species of Wild Flora and  Fauna That Are Threatened With Extinction.    In this connection, it must be noted that countries of the  former USSR have the opportunity to join these conventions by a  simple confirmation, announcing this to the corresponding  depository with an official government note. The same thing  pertains to international organizations of the UN system. And if  we are still not cooperating with such well-known organizations  as the UN Environment Program (UNEP), the United Nations  Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the UN Center for  Human Population (HABITAT), the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO), and others, this is because of our  inefficiency and sometimes simply because of our ignorance of  the procedures for addressing, joining, and entering them.    A center for international programs and projects would help  to eliminate this information gap and establish permanent  contacts with dozens of international funds, organizations, and  centers that would be extremely useful to our country. For  example, the Regional Center for Environmental Protection in  Central and Eastern Europe (REK) in 1994 allotted $600,000 in  financial aid to nongovernmental organizations engaged in the  development and implementation of environmental protection  projects. And through the DZhYeF [expansion not given] Fund of  the World Bank, $208 million is being allotted just for projects  within the framework of the Convention on Biodiversity. In order  to participate in these projects, we must either make a request  for financing our projects or submit an application to enter the  REK, MSOP, and so on. But here, as they say, we have fallen  slightly behind.    For the sake of clarity, I will give some other facts. Just  during the past two years, Ukraine has been able to organize the  participation of its specialists in seminars financed by the  governments of the United States and Poland, and the World Bank,  for training specialists in the area of ecological projects and  programs. The United States, additionally, finances the Center  for Ecological Education and Information formed in Kiev. Canada  has allotted to the Ukraine $3 million for a program for saving  the Dnieper River. The Know-How Fund from England renders the  Department for the Introduction of International Projects  consulting aid in the implementation of 13 projects for  ecological restoration of Ukraine. The World Bank has already  allotted to the country about $1 million for carrying out  projects in the Carpathian preserves and the Danube Delta, and  the European Community is financing the development and  introduction of a system of monitoring, legislative acts, and  standards.    Summing up what has been said, I must note that the State  Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of  the Republic of Moldova has adopted a number of measures to work  in the main areas in which our country should cooperate in the  area of environmental protection. Specialists of the state  department are participating in the implementation of a program  for protecting the Danube River and a program for ecological  restoration of the Black Sea basin. Materials are being prepared  for entry into the International Union for Protection of Nature  and Natural Resources and the Regional Center for Environmental  Protection in Central and Eastern Europe. Negotiations are being  conducted with representatives of international organizations to  hold the international fair Eco-94 at the beginning of next  year, and with representatives of the international convention  for one called the ``Role of Information in Overcoming the  Ecological Crisis in Countries of the Former Socialist Camp  During the Period of Transition to a Market Economy.'' Lists of  international conventions and agreements that are of primary  significance to Moldova are being systematized and prepared to  be submitted to parliament.     "

NATO was not willing to compromise and so the two sides laid  aside the issue of signing the ""plan"" once more.    NATO's ""partnership for peace plan"" was put forward in  January this year. To date, 18 East European countries,  countries separated from the former Soviet Union, and neutral  countries of Europe have signed the ""plan"" with NATO and five of  the partners have submitted ""memoranda of cooperation"" to NATO.  The ""Partnership for Peace Plan Coordination Group"" formed by  military officers of the partnership states was set up at NATO's  Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe on 18 April, the  liaison group will start work at NATO headquarters on 3 June,  and the partnership states will carry out joint military  exercises in the next few months. The implementation of the  ""partnership for peace plan"" will undoubtedly strengthen NATO's  position and role in modeling a new pattern for the future  security of Europe.    However, the plan has also met many problems: a crisis of  confidence in the ""plan"" among East European countries;  different views among NATO member states, difficulties in  raising the large amount of funds needed for the implementation  of the plan, and so on. However, the greatest difficulty is how  Russia should join the ""partnership for peace.""    Since the beginning of this year, many negotiations on  Russia  joining the ""plan"" have been held within NATO and between NATO  and Russia. Russia has changed its position on several  occasions and this has greatly troubled NATO. The two sides  have reached an impasse on the issue of a ""special  relationship."" In the beginning, Russia adopted an attitude of  opposing the ""plan"" and later expressed on 21 April its  willingness to sign the ""plan"" with NATO under the condition  that NATO should give Russia the ""status of a special  partnership state."" Because NATO did not agree to meet Russia's  demand and other factors, Russia did not sign as scheduled. In  addition, Russia also formulated a ""document on cooperation  projects"" which it intended to sign with NATO. The document  demands that NATO should inform Russia about bilateral  activities with other partnership states and that should NATO  take any action which involves the security and interests of  Russia or other members of the CIS, it first obtains the  agreement of Russia, and Russia may carry out joint exercises  with NATO within the scope of peace-keeping and other  humanitarian activities, but will not cooperate with NATO in the  formulation of military strategies, defense budgets, the  modernization and standardization of weapons, training of  military officers, and so on. On 6 May, Grachev announced in  Moscow that Russia had drafted new ideas on the ""partnership for  peace"" concerning the security of Europe which would enable  Russia to ""play its role in the establishment of a collective  security structure in Europe.""    It appears that the main considerations which have caused  Russia to change its attitude of opposing the ""plan"" to joining  it on certain conditions are as follows: The first is to avoid  being isolated and to maintain a distance in relations between  NATO and the countries of central and Eastern Europe. The  second is to try to establish a special relationship with NATO,  to jointly manage the countries of central and Eastern Europe  with NATO, and to gradually turn NATO's plan into Russia's  strategic idea of a ""pan-European partnership relationship"" so  that Russia can play a greater role in any European security  system in the future. The third is to alleviate differences and  contradictions on this issue within Russia.    At present, NATO can be said to be in a dilemma. On the one  hand, NATO knows full well that it is impossible to stabilize  security in Europe without Russia, and it therefore hopes Russia  will join the ""plan."" This would make use of Russia's strength  and influence and could also transform and restrain Russia. On  the other hand, NATO does not want to give a special position to  Russia. Otherwise, other partnership states will be disappointed  and dissatisfied. At the same time, NATO wants to prevent  Russia from making use of such a special relationship to take an  equal footing and to change the original objective of the  ""plan."" At present, people at NATO's highest level are stepping  up negotiations with various sides and are striving to reach  special cooperation with Russia while not openly recognizing  Russia's special position. Since neither NATO nor Russia wants  to return to a state of hostility, they may eventually sign the  ""plan"" on the basis of compromise, but this does not mean  differences between the two sides will be removed. Cooperating  with each other while struggling against each other will be a  major characteristics of the ""partnership for peace"" between  NATO and Russia. As for how things develop, the ""plan"" may be  like the Conference on Security and Cooperation of Europe or the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council and could become merely  nominal. At the least, the original idea of the United States  and the NATO states will be changed.     "

Who Is Supporting Us in International Cooperation  for Protection of Nature""]    [Text] One of the priority areas of the foreign  policy of the Republic of Moldova is international cooperation  in the area of environmental protection. Moldova is joining in  the activity of international environmental protection  organizations and is participating in the implementation of the  corresponding conventions and agreements. To do this, an  Administration of International and Social Relations has been  created under the State Department for Environmental Protection  and Natural Resources, and under the National Institute of  Ecology--a Bureau of International Programs and Projects. The  solutions to problems of international cooperation of the  Republic of Moldova in the area of environmental protection is  discussed by a chief specialist of the State Department for  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Valeriy  Bricag.    The concrete results of the state department's international  activity were the ratification by the parliament of the Republic  of Moldova of the Biodiversity Convention and the endorsement of  such important documents as the World Charter on Nature, the  Convention on Crossborder Impact of Industrial Accidents, and  the Convention on Protecting the Animal Kingdom and the Natural  Environment in Europe. Moreover, in July 1993 the parliament  adopted a decree on the creation of a National Autonomous Center  of the Republic of Moldova in the International System of  Information on the Environment (INFOTERRA), which gave us access  to the World Environmental Data Bank.    It should be noted that in international cooperation in the  area of environmental protection, preference should be given to  concluding bilateral and regional agreements at the state level.  The endorsement of international conventions should take into  account, on the one hand, the republic's financial and technical  capabilities and, on the other, the interests of the state and  the world community. Both state and nonstate organizations can  enter international environmental protection organizations.  Cooperation with international funds, organizations, scientific  centers, and financial structures should include primarily the  development and implementation of national ecological projects.    As early as 1990, the State Department for Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources came out with an initiative to  conclude agreements at the level of environmental protection  organs of the Union republics. This activity has been  continued--draft agreements have been sent to all the  independent states of the former USSR. But not all of them have  shown a readiness to cooperate at this level. Only the first  protocol has been signed between the State Department for  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic  of Moldova and the Ministry of Environmental Protection of  Ukraine.    The Interstate Ecological Council (MES), which anticipates  cooperation among the CIS countries, was formed in February  1992. But the Republic of Moldova did not sign the document to  enter the MES. Moldova has not been represented at a single  session of the MES. But a department worker participated in the  work of the group of experts for preparing for the first session  of the MES, and another one participated as an observer in the  work of the first meeting of the Coordination Group under the  MES for cooperation with UNEP [United Nations Environment  Program] and other international organizations. This group was  formed by a decision of the third MES session, which took place  in Tashkent in May 1993, and its goal is to coordinate the  activity of the MES member countries for creating specialized  organs for cooperation with the UNEP and other international  organizations, and also for developing and implementing joint  ecological projects under the aegis of the UNEP.    In the former USSR, the role of a specialized organ for  cooperation with international environmental protection  organizations, including UNEP and the World Bank, was assigned  to the Center for International Projects (TsMP) under the Union  State Committee for the Protection of Nature. The CIS countries  decided to take advantage of the experience of the TsMP and, on  its basis, to create a consultative-executive organ of the  coordinating group under the MES.    Thus, the CIS countries developed their own mechanism for  interstate and international cooperation, but it is too early to  judge its effectiveness. In October of this year, an official  appeal was addressed to the chairman of the parliament of the  Republic of Moldova from the secretariat of the MES, considering  the entry of the Republic of Moldova into this organization. I  think we should get rid of our excessive suspicion regarding all  structures created within the framework of the former USSR.    Representatives of Russia are working in many international  organizations. The Russian lobby is very influential there. This  could have decisive significance for us--the success of our  cause will depend on the position of one or another  representative of an international organization. Joint entry and  coordination of activity will help incline international  organizations to support our country. The TsMP is making a  commitment to render assistance in international support for  Moldovan ecological projects and is also prepared to help in the  organization of a similar center in our republic.    We are losing a great deal as a result of delay in solving  these problems, and we are being left out of the picture. Thus,  the British company Alexander Jib and Company has monopolized  the right to develop and implement the project for protecting  the basin of the River Prut, which will enable it to dispose of  funds allotted by the World Bank.    Our relations with Romania are being arranged on the basis  of  the Protocol on Cooperation between the State Department for  Environmental Protection of the Republic of Moldova and the  Ministry of the Environment of Romania.

Thus, Moldova has not joined the Geneva  Conference on Crossborder Air Pollution over Large Areas. The  reason is the lack of hard currency to subsidize measures within  the framework of the Convention. As for the Vienna Convention on  Protection of the Ozone Layer, not joining it has entailed  serious consequences for our economy. Starting in 1994,  international sanctions and bans will be introduced on exports  and imports of freon-emitting items. The corresponding sanctions  will be applied to countries that have not joined the Washington  Convention on International Trade in Species of Wild Flora and  Fauna That Are Threatened With Extinction.    In this connection, it must be noted that countries of the  former USSR have the opportunity to join these conventions by a  simple confirmation, announcing this to the corresponding  depository with an official government note.

Kim Tae-sun, director of the Moscow office  of the Korea-Russia Science and Technology Cooperation  Center---an annex of the Korea Institute of Science and  Technology (KIST), sent articles on plans for applying the  Russian science and technology he has seen and felt on the scene  since May 1992. We present this in two installments.    One of the fields with the greatest prospects for  cooperation  with Russia is the software industry. Until now, Russia had no  fixed laws on private property. With much investment made in  facilities under these conditions, scientific and technological  cooperation carries with it many risks of various kinds. One  area which is important to us and which minimizes facility  investment is the software industry. The shortage of computers  is serious even in many of Russia's superior research  organizations. Therefore, many research centers make use of PCs  (personal computers), even if that is all they have, to conduct  applied research. As a result, much software and many  applications were developed using PCs.    Another field with prospects for cooperation, even though  less know to us, is dedicated IC (integrated circuit) design and  manufacturing technology. Unilaterally, Russian IC design and  manufacturing technology does not appear to be that superior.  Manufacturing technology in particular is lacking: it can be  said to be considerably behind Japan and the U.S. in  mass-production technology. Therefore, compared to present ROK  memory-IC manufacturing technology, Russian technology can be  said to be markedly backward.    Thinking about dedicated-IC design and manufacture, even in  Russia's present situation, it is a suitable field for  technological-cooperation with ROK industry. In Russia there are  many organizations capable of designing and manufacturing  dedicated IC. The productive capacity of most of these  organizations, however, is considerably inferior. That is,  although the semiconductor industry is not at a high level, it  has many organizations capable of small-quantity-high-variety,  dedicated-IC design and manufacturing. The present circumstances  thus provide related ROK industries with conditions favorable  for cooperation.    As a cooperative sector favorable for dedicated-IC design  and  manufacturing, it could provide good partners for many ROK  enterprises handling the manufacture of electronics-related  instruments. In particular, companies making products (for  example, medical instruments, communications instruments, and  measuring instruments) other than memory chips and similar  mass-produced items could select Russian organizations as good  partners for the dedicated-IC design and manufacture of  electronic-circuit portions of related products.    Russia produces most of the medical instruments manufactured  by advanced foreign nations. To put it another way, it can be  said to possess technology capable of manufacturing all medical  instruments. Even MRI equipment (nuclear magnetic resonance  spectrometer) is being produced and distributed. Visiting many  medical institutions in Russia, however, one can sense the  inferior medical instruments, the deterioration and lack of  facilities of most of them. This reality is the result of  Russia's overall economic difficulties.    It is also a result of the funding shortages experienced by  medical institutions because the medical system is in a  transition period, moving from free medical treatment under  socialism to medical treatment for which a fee is charged.  Russia's medical-instruments industry is also linked with the  program being conducted by the government of privatizing  military industries.    It is a well-known fact that Russia's aviation- and  space-related technology is advanced. It can be called world  class in all areas, from the design of aircraft and spacecraft  to the design and manufacture of mechanical and electronic spare  parts and new materials technology. However, because  aviation-and space-related industries are run by a policy of  large-scale investment at the national level, cooperation in  this field generally can be achieved by state support or large  enterprises. However, there are also fields among related  spare-parts industries in which cooperation can be achieved by  small and medium-sized business.    Laser-related technology too is closely associated with  Russia's advanced military industry. With the program of  conversion to civilian industry, many laser-related technologies  are being applied in laser-using industrial instruments, medical  instruments, laboratory instruments, etc. A phenomenon common to  all products made in Russia, technology for the production of  fresh commercial products is lacking. Although products are made  using superior technology, in various ways they can be said to  be inferior compared to the products of advanced foreign  nations. Therefore, if this is supplemented by ROK technology,  it has the potential for commercial success on the world market.    Through cooperation with Russia, the  communications-instruments and spare-parts sectors have  potential for making inroads into the world market, and also for  making products for sale in Russia. In May 1993, 26 prominent,  communications-industry companies entered Russia in the form of  a joint venture. Russia is producing TDX (time division  exchanges) and other telephone-switching instruments, but its  performance is very backward compared to our ROK technology.  Therefore, cooperation is possible on the sale or on-site  production of ROK products. In the case of cellular-phone,  satellite-communications, and optical-communications technology,  however, Russia is advanced, making possible varied cooperation  in ROK mobile-communications-related industrial sectors.    Other technical fields with prospects for cooperation are  the  processing-related sectors using nonferrous metals such as  aluminum, copper, zinc, and nickel, sectors dealing with the  development and application of new materials, and the  machine-instrument sector. More detailed, useful information on  each sector can be obtained using the relevant reference  libraries of the Korea-Russia Science and Technological  Cooperation Center.    [21 Apr 94 p 16]    [Text] During the last three years, there has been an  exchange between many ROK institutions (research centers,  business, universities, etc.) and Russian institutions. They  have used various methods of contact and exchange for absorbing  Russian technology and applying it to the development of  commercial products. Although some businesses have gained a  measure of success as a result, most obtained no great results,  failing in many cases.    As a result of touring various Russian research institutions  and business up to now, the author believes that it would be  more useful for ROK small and medium-sized businesses to adopt  Russian technology through a cooperative relationship. The  reason for this is that, although Russia's technological level  is high, it has insufficient linkage of this with  mass-production technology, so small-quantity-high-variety  production by small and medium-sized business would be  profitable.    Characteristic of Russian technology is a lack of  systematization of mass-production technology and concepts of  production costs. Therefore, if Russian technology is to be  introduced and applied from product design to production, there  is a high probability of running up against various difficulties  and of failure. Judging Russian technology based on finished  product alone is not a complete method either. Of course, it is  true that if a product's performance is superior, the technology  which made that product is superior. However, there are many  cases in which a products technological level is superior, even  though its performance is not. In this case, there are many  instances in which superior-performance products were simply not  made, rather than being impossible to make due to the  characteristics of Russian society and the Russian economy.    Technological cooperation with Russia must start with these  particular circumstances in mind. Most Russian technology is not  directly linked to production. It is technology with no concept  of production-cost reduction.    To a certain degree, ROK businesses have their own design  and  production technology. However, rather than cooperating in all  technology from design to production, ROK businesses should form  cooperative relationships with Russia after clearly selecting  technology we need for specific fields in which it is lacking.  Cooperative relationships can take various forms: getting  technical training by inviting superior engineers in relevant  fields; purchasing desired technology; development based on  joint research (paying Russian research institutions a research  fee, commissioning technical development); and developing  technology by setting up joint-venture research centers in  Russia.    Inviting technicians could be an effective method, depending  on the kind of technology we need. However, because there are  limitations on the number of technicians who can be invited and  on the length of their stay in Korea, this would not be  efficient in many cases.    Up to now there has been much technological cooperation  between many ROK and relevant Russian institutions in the form  of joint research.    Given Russia's present situation, however, this is one of  several considerably inefficient methods.    Joint-ventures, in the present circumstances, are considered  to enable decreased investment risk while allowing ROK  businesses to adopt Russian science and technology. Not costing  that much and an achievement of the research and development  functions urgently desired by ROK business, the establishment of  joint-venture research centers can be said to be ideal.    In special Russian circumstances, the establishment of  joint-venture research centers can be said to be very effective  for the following reasons.    First, performing research and development through joint  investment by both sides, it is possible to carry out all  processes through product development together with Russian  technicians.    Also, if a contract is concluded so that relevant Russian  institutions provide public facilities and laboratory equipment,  investment risk will be reduced by minimizing research center  set-up costs.    Besides this, use can be made of an excellent research  workforce for wages lower than those of researchers at ROK  research centers.    This technological development through the establishment of  joint-venture research centers in Russia is efficient from  various viewpoints. However, ROK companies can be said to have a  greater probability of succeeding in research and development if  they take the following into consideration.    First of all, having, to a certain degree, its own domestic  research workforce, ROK business must lead research operations  on site in Russia and must be able to domestically absorb the  technology developed. ROK business must be able to handle on its  own the commercialization process resulting from the mass  production of this technology.    Also, with the concept of carrying out research and  development, it must begin a cooperative relationship by using  approximately 10-20 percent of funding used in the domestic  research centers of ROK companies for research centers in Russia.    However, for genuine success in scientific and technological  cooperation, it must start in the concept of mutual ROK-Russian  interests.     "

The six members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Thailand, Singapore -- sit down with their seven ""dialogue  partners,"" including South Korea and five other neighbors, for  the first time in July to address their common security concerns.    There is no telling where this dialogue, named ""ASEAN  Regional Forum (ARF)"" will go, but it is certainly a  symbol-laden beginning in a region where no such dialogue  channel ever existed, mainly due to complex conflict of  political interest, the vestige of the cold war and gap in  historical and economic development history.    South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, currently  visiting Bangkok which hosts the first ARF July 25, called the  forum more symbolic than substantive at this point.    But he sees this as an important impetus for sub-groupings,  what he described as sub-ARF.    For instance, senior officials from Northeast Asian  countries  -- South Korea, Japan, the United States, China and Russia --  may decide to talk amongst themselves on their security issues  before reporting to the ARF, Han said.    ""By having something like the ARF, the region has a growing  chance of engaging in multilateral regional security dialogue,""  he said.    Attesting to South Korea's interest in the forum, much of  Han's meeting with Thai leaders here Wednesday focused on  exchange of opinions on the future of the ARF, its relations  with APEC.    The birth of ARF had more to do with competition with APEC  Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) rather than consensus  of needs.    ASEAN has long functioned as the leader organization in Asia  until APEC came along in 1989 and took the spotlight in economic  affairs of the region.    Unwilling to let go of the spotlight, ASEAN members braved a  new initiative by tackling security agendas.    Last year, 18 nations including ASEAN members, their  dialogue  partners and five guests agreed in July to launch ARF.    South Korea had said that it welcomes such initiative and  promised full participation in the discussion process.    Han had always said Northeast Asia needs security talks of  its own, ideally in the form of mini-Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    ""Our participation in the ARF is more symbolic than anything  else -- symbolic in that we are taking part in this region's  initiative,"" explained Yu Pyong-u, director-general of Asian  Affairs Bureau at the South Korean Foreign Ministry.    ""But our true security interest lies with Northeast Asia,""  he  said.    ""The ARF would certainly be a good precedent, it would tell  us how we can work in a separate channel in Northeast Asia, how  we can complement it to ARF,"" said Yu.     "

After about five years in development, the North American  company American Superconductor in Westborough, Massachusetts,  has introduced the prototype of a superconducting high-current  cable made of high-temperature superconductors (HTSC) and  measuring one meter [in length]. An initial test cable with a  total length of about 30 meters should be completed in about one  year in cooperation with the Italian company Pirelli Cable in  Milan.    This cable will then be able to be used for the first time  in  practical tests in power supply companies. It is hoped that in  two years a one hundred meter long cable will be completed,  which could then be put into trial operation. The cable  corresponds approximately to the requirements for smaller power  supply grids in terms of currents to be carried and the  resultant magnetic field intensity.    The developer reports that a direct current of 2,300 amps  per  fiber can be transmitted, which is approximately double the  value of comparable HT superconductors from other developers.  The magnetic fields in the order of 0.2 tesla resulting at these  current intensities are sustained without the superconductor  breaking at operating temperatures of 77 kelvin.    The cable now being introduced consists of oxides of  bismuth,  strontium, calcium and copper, which are filled in power form in  tubes made of silver and then subjected to the required heat and  acid treatment. Finally the tubes are drawn out to fine  filaments with a diameter of 200 micrometers using a drawing  process developed [by the producer].    The test cable is then weaved together by hand from hundreds  of the fine fibers. The North American superconductor company  has so far been able to produce a filament of this type with a  total length of nearly 1,000 meters.    In this collaboration, the Italian cable producer took on  the  task of putting together the cable with the electric and thermal  isolation. The cable is to have a hollow space at its center  through which the liquid nitrogen used for cooling will be  pumped.    Pirelli also intends to develop with an Italian engineering  company a new machine which can weave the fine filaments  together automatically.    Energy experts estimate that power supply companies will be  able to install the first shorter lengths of direct current  cable in ten years at the earliest; however, the behavior of the  cable will have to be closely monitored for some years before it  can live up to all the technical and safety requirements.    [Experts] are also of the view that it will not be for about  50 years at the earliest that we can think of replacing the  high- voltage operated alternating current transmission supply  lines with superconducting direct current cable, according to  the American Superconductor Corporation (Westborough,  Massachusetts 01581, USA).

The explosion occurred in Kanggye in  Chagang Province where military plants are concentrated. In  addition to the loss of life, the accident destroyed several  buildings in the city. The ""Kanggye No. 26 General Plant"" was  North Korea's largest underground facility built in mountain  tunnels with a total of 20,000 people employed there; missile  assembly sites and other functions were reportedly removed  following the accident.    SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained these comments from Ko Chong-song,  32, who lived in Kanggye and defected to the Republic of Korea  via China last June. During a three-year period beginning in  1984, Ko daily went to the plant as a boxer with membership in  the plant's ""sports team."" Moreover, his two brothers were  serving as the accounting department chief and an engineer; he  also had many friends working there. Therefore, he was familiar  with the internal affairs of the plant.    According to Ko, the first explosion occurred around 2130  [1230 GMT] on 30 November. His apartment was approximately 2  kilometers from the plant and was blocked by a hill, but he  reported that the terrible noise and vibrations emanating from  the explosion were like those of an earthquake. The night sky  turned red with fire, and explosions continued until 1030 [0130  GMT] the next morning. The blasts shattered the windows of his  apartment, and many houses in the city were destroyed or burned.    The accident occurred at an outdoor materials dump near no.  11 missile assembly site. Mishandling of explosives set off a  fire which touched off a series of blasts among missiles and  artillery ordinance. The official death toll was put at 127,  but it was rumored among citizens that the toll should be about  200, including civilian casualties.    Immediately after the incident, a ""suicide squad"" was  organized to seal off the entrance to the tunnel to prevent  explosions from spreading inside the underground complex; some  20 volunteers were killed during the attempt. Five were later  awarded the title ""Heroes of the Republic.""    Following the incident, many party and government leaders --  including then-Premier Yon Hyong-mok, Korean Workers Party [KWP]  Secretary (in charge of military supplies) Kim Chang-ho, and KWP  Second Economic Commission Chairman Kim Man-song -- inspected  the plant. Kanggye was sealed off for 20 days following the  accident, and a strict news blackout was imposed on the area.    In addition to missiles, the plant was producing various  munitions, including rocket bombs, depth charges, torpedoes, and  mines. Surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and air-to-surface  missiles were respectively codenamed ""Hwasong [Mars]"" 1, 2, and  3; they possessed a range of up to 200 kilometers. Ko noted the  plant is presently producing a new missile with a range of over  550 kilometers.    All products of the plant were originally designed in the  former Soviet Union. They are exported mainly to Iran and other  Middle East countries. Plant personnel used to say: ""The  Iran-Iraq War was a field experiment for our weapons.""    The plant is built at the foot of a rocky mountain and is 2  kilometers in width. Production sections and assembly sites are  located inside the tunnels, and non-production sections such as  material dumps and management offices are located outside.    Chagang Province is a mountainous region in North Korea  adjoining the Chinese border. North Korea's military industries  are concentrated in the region, and civilian traffic is strictly  controlled. Under such circumstances, the accident has been  kept secret until now.     "

The two sides observed that the resumption of  the work of the commission (the 18th Bulgarian-Korean commission  was held in 1989), will improve bilateral trade and economic  relations and sci-technical cooperation, the chairmen of the two  sides of the commission -- Bulgarian Deputy Trade Minister Kiril  Velev and the deputy chairman of the Foreign Economic Relations  Committee of the DPRK Ku Bo Te [spelling of name as received] --  told a press conference.    An agreement was reached to cover Bulgaria's  4-million-transferable-ruble surplus in bilateral commercial  exchange by the end of 1995 with the import of raw materials and  consumer goods, Mr. Velev said. Mr. Te said that the Government  of the DPRK gives priority to foreign trade and to promoting and  developing trade and economic relations with Bulgaria.    Ms. Antoaneta Dincheva, expert at the ""Countries in  Transition"" Department at the Ministry of Trade, told BTA that  Bulgaria and the DPRK effected their payments in convertible  currency at the current international prices on the main  commodity exchanges. In June 1993 the two countries signed an  Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation in order to wind up  reciprocal payments in transferable rubles and granted each  other most-favoured-nation status. The DPRK is interested in  the export of raw materials for the Bulgarian silk industry, in  the import of machines and equipment for the light and food  processing industries, in cooperation in the production of  electric and I.C.E. [internal-combustion-engined] lift trucks,  as well as in the setting up in the DPRK of a joint enterprise  for the production of fireproof bricks. In the field of  agriculture the two sides showed interest in the exchange of  genetic material of animal and plant origin and the Bulgarian  side showed interest in importing silkworm grain [as received].    According to data of the Ministry of Trade, in 1993  bilateral  commercial exchange amounted to U.S.$6,343,100, which is  approximately 65 percent up from 1992 (U.S.$3,856,000). In 1991  this figure was U.S.$2,201,000. Bulgarian exports to the DPRK  totalled U.S.$4,282,100 and imports from the DPRK  U.S.$2,061,000. Last year the DPRK remained second among  Bulgaria's partners of the former socialist countries in Asia,  following China. Bulgarian exports to the DPRK comprise mainly  base metals, textile materials, machines and equipment,  transport devices, mineral and chemical products, and the  structure of Bulgarian imports from the DPRK is dominated by  textile raw materials, foodstuffs, cement products, plaster,  ceramics, glass, instruments, etc. In the first three months of  1994 commercial exchange between Bulgaria and the DPRK exceeded  U.S.$1,018,800.    The delegation of the DPRK had meetings at the Ministry of  Industry, the Agricultural Academy and with Deputy Prime  Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev. The next  joint Bulgarian-Korean commission is scheduled to be held in  1995 in Pyongyang.     "

Vivekanand]    [Text] Amman--Jordan and Iraq have agreed to study  possibilities of building an oil pipeline to link Iraq with the  port of al-'Aqabah after International sanctions on Iraq are  lifted, an official statement said Tuesday [25 January].    The statement, issued by Minister of Energy and Mineral  Resources Walid 'Asfur to the JORDAN NEWS AGENCY, PETRA, said  the agreement to conduct a feasibility study for the project was  part of an accord Mr. 'Asfur and his Iraqi counterpart Safa'  Hadi Jawad signed in Baghdad earlier this week.    The statement did not give details of the project except  that  the agreement also include building a refinery at al-'Aqabah  based on studies on Jordan's consumption beyond the year 2010.  In the meantime, Iraqi supplied oil in excess of Jordanian  consumption would be exported.    PETRA quoted Dr. 'Asfur as saying that the project aimed at  securing Iraqi oil supplies in a ""quicker and safer manner once  the sanctions are lifted.""    The findings of the feasibility study will be submitted to  the government of the two countries for approval, he said.    During his visit to Baghdad, Dr. 'Asfur also held talks with  other senior Iraqi officials and attended a meeting with the  energy ministers of Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Turkey on linking the  power grids of the five countries in a regional network.    The agreement signed in Baghdad by Dr. 'Asfur and Mr. Jawad  also renewed an arrangement under which Jordan will buy four  million tonnes of crude and fuel oil from Iraq during the year  1994.    This would roughly mean a daily supply of 50,000 barrels of  crude oil and 25,000 barrels of fuel oil--Jordan's full needs of  imported energy.    According to industry sources, part of the oil will be  supplied free of cost and the rest at market prices.    The Iraqi oil supply to Jordan is exempt from the sweeping  international sanctions imposed against Iraq following its  August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.    Dr. 'Asfur also discussed with the Iraqi officials  possibilities of exchange of expertise in oil and mineral  exploration in cooperation with Jordan's natural resources  authority and conducting studies on the al-Rishah gas fields  near the Jordanian-Iraqi border.    The al-'Aqabah pipeline project appears to be a dusted-off  version of a plan Jordan and Iraq abandoned in the mid-80s after  Israel refused to provide an international undertaking not to  attack the installations.    The Israel refusal, which was demanded by both Jordan and  Iraq, [as published] prompted the U.S. Eximbank to refuse a $550  million loan for the project, which at that time was estimated  to cost $1 billion.    The project was considered at the height of Iraqi oil  exports  through al-'Aqabah when part of the Iraqi oil exporting  facilities were crippled during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.    It envisaged laying a 1,000-kilometre long pipeline of 75-  centimetre diameter from the H-3 pumping station in Iraqi  territory near the border and down south through the desert to  al-'Aqabah.    The H-3 station was part of a pre-1948 pipeline that pumped  Iraqi oil across Jordan to the Mediterranean port of Haifa in  British Palestine.    According to industry sources, the Iraqi part of the  pipeline  remains largely intact. Parts of the line in Jordanian  territory near al-Mafraq have been destroyed.    Another project under consideration in the late 80s was  taping an Iraqi pipeline with the Saudi oil port of Yanbu at  midway and building a link with al-'Aqabah. This project  envisaged the linkage in Saudi territory near the border with  Jordan in the south and would have substantially reduced the  cost when compared with the earlier proposal.    Officials said the project, which at one point appeared to  have been all but finalised, was no longer under consideration.     "

Japan has a responsibility to activate the world economy by  supporting ongoing self-help efforts among Asian economies to  maintain and expand their ""growth dynamism,"" said the annual  report.    To that aim, an international division of roles needs to be  promoted on the investment and trade fronts, the white paper  said, calling for Japan to expand direct investment in and  imports from Asia.    The white paper, prepared by the International Trade and  Industry Ministry, described the newly industrializing economies  (NIES) in Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) as ""the growth center for world economic development.""    ""Such a dynamism in the areas has resulted from an effective  use of market mechanism and an increased linkage with the rest  of the world in trade and investment,"" said the white paper.    This year's white paper paid particular attention to China,  Vietnam and India, devoting much space to analyzing various  problems involved in economic reform efforts in these countries.    China, touted as having the biggest growth potential in the  world, scored a significant real economic growth of a 13.4  percent in 1993 thanks to the increased use of market mechanism.    But the paper cited the need for infrastructure improvement  in the country, especially in the inland area, in order to  correct its economic gap with the rapidly growing coastal area.    The white paper said Vietnam should effectively use aid  funds  extended by Japan and other countries for improvement in  economic infrastructure, and lagging legal and administrative  systems.    The Vietnamese Government also needs to make further efforts  in placing economically inefficient state-owned corporations  into private management, it said.    As for India, the white paper said its legal system has been  upgraded under the ongoing reform program. But further efforts,  particularly deregulation, need to be done in financial and farm  sectors, it said.    The paper also sees the need for India to improve its  infrastructure in utilities, traffic systems and  telecommunications networks.    These efforts would help rectify an inadequate allocation of  wealth among the Indian people, eventually contributing to  higher productivity, the white paper said.    Japan should formulate economic cooperation programs for  other Asian countries while clarifying problems these countries  are facing domestically, it said.    Assistance to them also should be made in a manner that  ensures harmonization with global trade accords recently  concluded under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  negotiations, the paper said.    The paper noted that Japan's economic assistance in 1992  decreased 36.3 percent to 15,944 million dollars, with a smooth  growth in official development assistance (ODA) more than offset  by a substantial drop in private-sector aid.    Japan's ODA for the year increased 2.7 percent to 11,332  million dollars. The sum was the largest in the world,  accounting for 18.5 percent of the global ODA.     "

He urges to join all  forces to combat the crisis and believes that the implementation  of the Maastricht Treaty should be subordinate to fighting to  crisis and unemployment.    [Van Miert] We must recognize that the present crisis is not  just cyclical and that there are also structural weaknesses.  For example there is not enough investment to get the engine of  the economy working again. We cannot reduce unemployment  without normal economic growth. With growth of 2.5 percent, we  are only able to stabilize unemployment. Growth must be higher  if we are to force it down.    We must look for other ways and in the meantime we have  realized that it will become more difficult for a number of  categories of people to find jobs. I am thinking of workers  with little or no qualification. The cost of labor is far too  high. I am not saying that people earn too much, but that the  social charge is pushing wage costs up. And then right away you  reach the problem of financing social security. This financing  is a real problem, at least if you do not want to throw the  basic principles of the system overboard. And neither I nor the  Commission are prepared to repudiate these principles. Let us  be honest: Even if we get some economic growth in the coming  months, the unemployment problem will still not be solved.    All these problems are linked to one another. To solve them,  European cooperation is necessary. Only ""more Europe"" offers a  way out. Of course I can see that other trends are raising  their head and calling for withdrawal into national approaches,  in the false hope or false expectation that things will go  better then. And note that I am saying a false hope or false  expectation.    [Biesemans] But this position says nothing about the  tendency  of European companies to move and produce in areas where wage  costs are lower and social protection represents virtually  nothing. Aren't agreements in this field necessary?    [Van Miert] The European Union is indeed not an island and  the problem of delocalization cannot be denied. We must  certainly strive for rules which apply throughout the world.  The recent GATT agreement on freer world trade does not solve  everything. It is incomplete. We must strive to add social  clauses and minimum agreements on environmental protection to  international treaties. The fact that a number of developing  countries or China are able to produce so cheaply is in part  related to child labor or the forced employment of prisoners,  while environmental standards are scarcely respected, if at all.  Europe must work closely with the United States to push through  such agreements. I believe that there is a common interest.  [passage omitted]     "

The agreement is scheduled to be signed by EU leaders with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin during a European summit on the  Greek island of Corfu on Friday and Saturday next week if two  last-minute hitches are overcome.    ""This means that President Yeltsin should be ready to come  to  Corfu next week to sign,"" the chairman of the European Union's  Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, said.    Officials here said that the ministers had reached an  ""essential political agreement"" to wrap up the accord, but that  two hitches remained.    The Netherlands said it was still waiting for confirmation  in  writing of a Russian assurance that two Dutch banks already  licensed to operate in Russia would be freely allowed to gather  Russian clients.    And the diplomats said there might not be time to translate  the agreement into the European Union's nine official languages  and Russian by the time of the summit.    In that case, a French official said, President Yeltsin  would  probably be invited to the Corfu summit to endorse a declaration  saying that the agreement was settled and would be signed later  when the translations were complete.    The sole outstanding problem of substance concerned the  European Union's insistence that five EU banks be exempted from  a Russian law restricting their right to attract Russian clients  in Russia.    Two of the banks are Dutch. A Dutch diplomat said the  Netherlands was not satisfied with a Russian assurance at the  weekend that the exemptions would be granted. ""We want it in  black and white,"" he said.    The partnership agreement, under negotiation for two years,  is a key part of Western attempts to bolster the Russian  economy. It offers Russia greater access to the EU market and  more political dialogue.    It also holds out the prospect of a Russia-European Union  free trade zone after 1997 if Moscow has made enough progress  towards a market economy by then.    Meanwhile, the European Union confirmed that it would sign a  similar partnership and cooperation agreement with Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk on Tuesday.    Two accords will be signed -- an overall agreement which  faces a lengthy ratification process in Russia, all EU countries  and the European Parliament, and an interim economic pact which  will come into effect immediately.    In separate but related negotiations, the European Union is  also trying to persuade Ukraine to close down the dangerous  Chernobyl nuclear power station, the site of the world's worst  civilian nuclear accident in 1986.    The European Union has pledged to help mobilise Western  countries to pay the costs of closing down the plant, and partly  finance two new nuclear power stations to replace the Chernobyl  output.    But the two sides have not yet reached agreement on the cost  of the Chernobyl closed-down, or the share of the bill to be met  by the West.     "

The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan and  was expanded in 1991 to include Afghanistan as well as the  former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan,  Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.    On the sidelines of the two-day meeting, organised to  discuss  economic cooperation, the ministers of 10 Muslim countries in  the region put forward several ""practical proposals"" to help end  the conflict, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati said.    Speaking to reporters, Velayati acknowledged the difficult  task of restoring peace to Afghanistan, but added that Iran and  other countries in the region ""were determined to continue their  search."" He declined to explain what the ""practical proposals""  were.    Several participants in the meeting revealed that ""a certain  number of ideas"" have been put foreward by the ministers, among  which is establishment of a regional conference under the  auspices of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC),  which comprises 50 Muslim countries.    The OIC's Secretary General Hamid al-Qabid, who took part in  the seminar, said an OIC delegation was currently in the Afghan  capital to try and secure a ceasefire.    He said that he would himself go to Kabul if asked to start  mediation among rival Afghan forces.    Qabid told AFP that the accord reached between the factions  in Islamabad last spring, at the prodding of Pakistan and Saudi  Arabia, was no longer effective but could be used as ""a basis  for future discussions"".    Afghan Foreign Minister Hedayat Amin Arsala told AFP that he  favored a comprehensive solution searched for by the United  Nations or OIC rather than mediation efforts undertaken by  Afghanistan's neighbors, whose ""objectives are not clear so far.""    ""After all, finding a solution is primarily the  responsibility of Afghans themselves,"" he said.    The ministers also addressed other regional crises, namely  the civil war in Tajikistan between the pro-communist government  and the Islamic opposition, as well as the Armenian-Azeri  conflict.    Azerbaijan did not appear to have gathered the solid support  it expected in a bid to impose widespread economic sanctions  against Armenia, according to participants.    The Tajik minister, for his part, categotically rejected  mediation offers by several ECO members, saying his country  prefered wider efforts undertaken by the United Nations.    On the economic front, the countries agreed to cooperate on  setting up a regional trade and development bank, establishing  insurance links and creating a joint airline and shipping  company.    Cooperation in transportation and communication were also  given priority during the conference, as many of the ECO member  states are land-locked and need access to the sea and outside  world, Velayati said.    The ministers also discussed cooperation between the ECO and  several international organisations. Memorandums of  understanding were signed Tuesday between the ECO and the United  Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as well as United Nations  Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO).     "

Meeting with Bhutto on 28 December, Premier Li Peng,  for example, reaffirmed the ""importance"" China attaches to its  ""friendly and cooperative ties"" with Pakistan (Xinhua, 28  December).  He went on to assure Bhutto of China's continued  friendship, stating that ""whatever changes take place in the  world, China will remain Pakistan's trusted friend and continue  to develop good-neighborly ties"" (Xinhua, 28 December 1993).  Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin also underscored Beijing's  commitment to Islamabad at his meeting with Bhutto on the 28th,  hailing the Sino-Pakistani relationship as having ""stood the test  of time"" as ""an example"" for ""relations between countries with  different social systems"" (Xinhua, 28 December 1993).     Focus on Economic Cooperation     Reflecting the continuing expansion of economic ties, the visit  was capped by the signing of five bilateral agreements, including  an agreement for economic and technological cooperation, an  accord extending the border trade agreement between the two  countries, road transport and water resource cooperative accords,  and an agreement to establish sister relations between Pakistan's  Punjab and China's Jiangsu provinces (Xinhua, 28 December 1993).  Calling for the further expansion of bilateral economic relations  Li, at his meeting with Bhutto, said that two countries should  ""seek more ways,"" including more exchanges between enterprises  and setting up of more joint ventures, to ""boost"" their ties and  indicated that the Chinese Government was ""encouraging"" PRC  companies to ""invest"" in Pakistan (Xinhua, 28 December 1993).  During a five-day official visit to Pakistan earlier in December,  Politburo Standing Committee member Li Ruihuan had suggested that  Beijing may be planning to give more aid to Pakistan, noting in  an interview with the Pakistani press--carried by Xinhua on the  6th--that China ""may provide more assistance"" if China's economy  ""develops at a faster pace"" (Xinhua, 6 December 1993).     Military Cooperation     There are also signs that the two countries are continuing to  expand their military ties.  Reflecting this trend, Xinhua on 1  December reported that Gen. Zhang Wannian, Chief of the General  Staff of the PLA, and his host Pakistani Defense Minister Af tab  Shaban Mirani discussed the ""mutual cooperation between the armed  forces"" of the two countries during Zhang's visit.  In another  indication of their deepening military ties, the two sides also  signed an agreement during Zhang's visit granting Chinese  ""credits"" to Pakistan for the ""procurement of defense equipment""  (Xinhua, 4 December 1993).

Al-Fujayrah officials said Saturday that 15,900 tonnes of  oil  -- more than twice the initial estimates -- spilled from the  supertanker Seki after it collided with the tanker Baynunah in  the Gulf of Oman on Wednesday.    International ""help is now required to prevent a major  disaster to the area's beaches and marine life,"" a al-Fujayrah  government spokesman said.    ""Large quantities of oil have come ashore on the beaches  between Lu'lu'iyah and Ras Qadnah, accompanied by dead fish,  turtles and other forms of marine life,"" he said, adding that  scientists had been sent to investigate the damage.    Salvage teams from several oil and shipping companies were  so  far working with the UAE coast guard.    Al-Fujayrah port officials said Hugh Parker, a pollution  expert from the London-based International Tanker Owners'  Pollution Federation, had arrived in the emirate and started  helicopter flights over the spillage.    The anti-pollution firm Fairdeal deployed three skimmers to  tackle the slick, and operators said later they had collected  more than 1,500 tonnes (10,950 barrels) of oil.    Each of the skimmers can collect 20 tonnes (146 barrels) of  crude every 30 minutes and salvage experts said more than three  days would be needed to clear up the slick.    ""We are focusing on the beach area to prevent pollution, but  the problem is that the wind is variable and the crude is  spreading,"" Fairdeal general manager Captain Michael Sarros said.    ""So far there is no threat to the desalination plants or the  nearby Omani coast. But we cannot speculate on the consequences  right now,"" he said, adding that the spillage covered around  eight square kilometres (3.2 square miles).    Captain Musa Murad of al-Fujayrah port told AFP that the  slick covered the stretch of coast north of Khawr Fakkan.    ""It's a catastrophe. Thirty kilometres of coastline have  been hit by the oil slick,"" he said.    The al-Fujayrah spokesman said that according to Seki  officials around 15,900 tonnes of oil was spilled into the sea,  but the spillage from the ruptured tank had stopped Saturday.    First reports said around 7,000 tonnes had leaked.    ""Our initial hopes of containing the spill were dashed when  weather conditions altered during the early hours of Friday  morning moving the slick directly to our shores,"" he said.    The 56,300-tonne Baynunah, built in South Korea, joined the  Abu Dhabi National Tanker Company (ADNATCO) in 1983.    ADNATCO said the tanker was about to head for Kuwait to pick  a shipment of crude for Japan when it collided with the  282,000-tonne Panama-registered Seki some 10 nautical miles (17  kilometres) off al-Fujairah.    Port officials in al-Fujayrah daily handle up to 50 tankers  arriving to load up with fuel by ship-to-ship transfers.    The last accident at the port occurred in 1986 when a tanker  hit a mine during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.    In another accident, a fire-gutted supertanker barred from  port for two weeks will be allowed to dock in the Gulf after it  has unloaded its oil in the next few days, an official with the  firm towing the tanker said Friday.    The Greek-owned Stolidi, carrying the charred bodies of 18  Filipinos killed in a March 20 fire, will transfer its 225,000  tonnes of oil to another ship, an International Marine Services  official said.    ""The Stolidi is now in Gulf waters and unloading operations  may start in two or three days about five to 10 nautical miles  off the coast of Dubai or Sharjah"" in the United Arab Emirates,  he said.

Unconfirmed reports, coming from Middle East sources, have  it  that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has felt the Syrian grip on his  organization tightening up and is now seeking a better base for  the movement.    Through his own contacts with Armenians in Syria and  Lebanon,  sources claimed, Ocalan is currently making arrangements to base  the PKK in Kurdish area of Armenia where the organization has  increasing mass support.    Observers here suspect that such reports aim at putting  Turkey's policy with regard to Syria off track and forcing it to  ease its pressure on the PKK.    Recently, Turkish officials signed a security protocol with  the Syrians, accepting the exchange of terrorists and the  extradition of draft dodgers. A majority of PKK militants are  known to be draft evaders. Syria also guaranteed it would not  allow terrorist organizations to use its territories. Turkey  observes a complete embargo on Armenia and has no diplomatic  ties with the country. Turkish contacts with Armenia only take  place on a multilateral level and are limited to such things as  the Black Sea Economic Cooperation scheme, CSCE and the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council.    With Syria, however, Turkey has strong bilateral ties and  there is considerable U.S. pressure on that country as well.  Official sources in Ankara suspect that the message given via  speculation on the PKK leadership's intention to move is that if  Syria is further pressurized, Turkey may lose any indirect  control it has on this organization.    In other words, the message could be that if Turkish  pressure  goes too far and the Syrians get more disturbed over Ankara's  tightening grip, it could send the PKK off to a country where it  will flourish freely. If the PKK is based in Armenia, it would  be literally impossible to prevent its organizational activities  there with the lack of diplomatic contact.    Meanwhile, security sources on Tuesday denied a report which  appeared as a banner story in the Turkish daily HURRIYET and  said there had been no contact between the National Intelligence  Organization (MIT) and the Syrian secret service, Mukhabarat.    HURRIYET claimed in its report that two MIT officers had  secretly travelled to Damascus last week and were taken to the  house where PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan lived. The report said  the agents saw someone in the garden who ""looked like"" Ocalan  but could not be sure. It also noted that it was not clear  whether the PKK leader was under custody or only protected very  closely. The Syrians reportedly claimed he was detained. An  intelligence source, who asked not to be identified, told the  TURKISH DAILY NEWS that no one from MIT had visited Syria  recently for the said purpose. He said ""the scenario"" described  in the paper was not possible ""since such relations do not exist  between our service and theirs.""     "

This week's program, which lasts  88 minutes, features five senior officials of the Islamic  Revolution Guards Corps [IRGC]: Brigadier General Seyyed Rahim  Safavi, the deputy commander of the IRGC; Brigadier General  Mohammad Baqer Zolqadr, the head of the IRGC's Joint Staff;  Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Razini, deputy to Ayatollah  Khamene'i's representative in the IRGC; Brigadier General  Mohammad 'Ali Ja'fari, the commander of the IRGC's Ground  Forces; and Brigadier General Amir 'Ali Amiri; head of the IRGC  personnel office.    The participants stress the instrumental role of the IRGC in  defending the country and the revolution during the war with  Iraq, and as well as its important contributions to Iran's  post-war reconstruction and development. This is followed by  interviews with members of the public who pay tribute to the  IRGC and its important services, and ask for more information on  the IRGC's involvement in development projects. In reply,  Brigadier General Safavi enumerates a number of projects, such  as construction of dams and gas pipe- lines.    A relative of a martyr asks what assistance is given to the  families of martyrs. Amiri says that part of the IRGC duties is  to identify all IRGC martyrs, visit their families, and  cooperate with the Martyrs Foundation to help these families.  Zolqadr also talks about a university for sciences which is run  by the IRGC.    Razini is asked about the function of the representative of  the leader in the IRGC. He says that the IRGC came into being  to safeguard the gains of the revolution. The task of the  leader's representative is to make sure that the original  revolutionary spirit is maintained. His other roles are to  ensure the guards' ideological suitability and supervise their  promotion, and to conduct a general supervision of the IRGC to  ensure that all its decisions and regulations are in keeping  with religious norms.    One of the guards asks if any attempts are being made to  write a documentary history of the Iran-Iraq war. Ja'fari says  that some cultural and artistic activities are under way to  safeguard the memory of the gains of the war. Safavi adds that  there is a great deal of audio recording about the events of the  war, as well as about 100,000 pages of records about the history  of the war. These will be useful in future for those who wish  to write the history of the war.    Then there are a number of questions about promotions,  transfers, career development opportunities, and pensions and  benefits for IRGC personnel. Amiri provides detailed answers to  these questions.    At the conclusion of the program, Zolqadr refers to the  IRGC's contribution to the fight against terrorists attempting  to hijack Iranian airplanes. He says: ""I only wished to use  this opportunity to mention the efforts of our dear brothers,  the unknown guards who have the very important responsibility of  protecting the aircraft of the country. I must say that during  the period when on the orders of the late imam the IRGC was  given the responsibility of protecting the aircraft of the  country and the flights, 70 plots for aircraft hijacking were  foiled by the dear guards and nothing went wrong during that  period. I should just explain that the last case in which one  of the Oil Ministry's private aircraft was hijacked to Iraq by  the counterrevolutionaries -- that case happened by dint of the  fact that there were no guards on board. The IRGC was not  responsible for that flight, and the aircraft was not guarded by  the IRGC. After that, as a result of the insistence of national  officials, the IRGC was given the responsibility of providing  protection for all flights. It was made responsible for their  protection. I like to thank the brothers for this during these  blessed days.""     "

The idea of forming such a group had been mooted long ago,  but only in recent years, mainly thanks to efforts by Turkey, it  has attracted wide recognition which was implemented with the  signing of the relevant declaration by leaders of 11 countries  on 25 June 1992. That day in effect became the founding date of  the ChES; among the founding members of that organization, in  addition to Ukraine, were Azerbaijan, Albania, Bulgaria,  Armenia, Greece, Georgia, Moldova, the Russian Federation,  Romania and Turkey.    Most of those countries fully support the concept of the  ChES  and have serious, although sometimes dissimilar, intentions to  build the necessary legal foundations for economic integration,  growth of trade and implementation of joint investment projects.  For instance, the position of Greece, Romania and Bulgaria on  investing ChES organizations with considerable powers and  creating special favorable conditions for economic cooperation  in the region has been cautious and reserved. As to creating the  appropriate legal foundations, modifying existing foreign trade  regimes and establishing a free trade zone and other  institutional structures, all this would seriously impact their  status in another, for them more significant organization: the  European Union (EU). (Greece is its full member and Bulgaria and  Romania hold associate membership.)    Ukraine has its own interest in this, and its candidacy as a  leader of the ChES could become an acceptable compromise.  (Initiatives to that effect are the responsibility of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs.) Other solutions are also possible:  representatives of different states could hold this position by  turns.    While discussing the role of Ukraine in the ChES, it should  be mentioned that on Turkish initiative our country was chosen  as the site of a parliamentary session of that organization at  the start of December. Analysts have noted that the ChES  parliamentary session, which took place in Kiev, was very  productive.    Sometimes one hears doubt whether attention should be  focused  on the problems of Black Sea cooperation if for Ukraine, as well  as for other countries in the region, the geopolitical goal is  to become integrated into the EU, or whether hopes to bring  together dissimilar member states within the ChES might not be  Utopian.    Responding to the first of these general questions, we  should  note that it would be irresponsible to define the issue in  either-or terms. For Ukraine to claim a full EU membership  status that would allow it to participate in its integration  processes and make use of all the related advantages, subsidies  and a wide range of favorable opportunities for economic  development would be impossible for many years to come. Yet, the  task of overcoming a severe socio-economic crisis is already  facing our country today. Moreover, strengthening cooperation  with other countries of the ""European underbelly"" as a way  toward Brussels would only give us more weight in the eyes of  desirable partners. Incidentally, these considerations are very  important for Turkish politicians. Thus, we think that Ukraine  should look at the problem more broadly, in the context of its  officially declared intention to seek widest possible  geographical ties and to overcome distortions resulting from a  one-sided orientation.    Clearly, it would be much easier to build economic  cooperation in the Black Sea region as a series of bilateral  projects or broader geographical projects focused on a single  industry. But this does not preclude the possibility, or removes  the need, to build a system of multilateral cooperation, which  would encourage many forms of localized cooperation while, on  the other hand, assuming a much broader form.    During negotiations within the ChES, member states expressed  their interest in cooperating in such areas as construction and  modernization of highway and railway networks; rational  utilization of Black Sea fishery resources; construction,  modernization and improved use of Black Sea ports; improvement  of telecommunications links between ChES members and laying of  the fiber-optic cable between Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria and  Ukraine.    On its part, Ukraine expressed an interest in working within  the ChES framework on modernizing oil refining plants, building  terminals on the shores of the Black Sea for receiving shipments  of oil and liquefied gas, cooperating with foreign companies on  the development of non-traditional energy sources, technical  retooling of metallurgical plants, building new capacities,  implementing a multilateral program to produce electronic  equipment for various sectors of the economy using  semiconductors produced in Ukraine, etc.    At this stage, Ukraine must develop a general conceptual  vision of its economic interests in the ChES, set a target level  for integration into ChES and its organizations and find  practical ways to achieve expected results. The latter task is  related to the need to find out, at last, who is responsible for  what in the context of goals being considered, since it must be  acknowledged that, as a rule, the Ukrainian side does not  generate initiative in developing various business proposals,  and that in our country those who are responsible for this are  often insufficiently active or incompetent.    This is why we must now start serious analytical and  organizational work at state organizations and enterprises. The  future of Ukraine is closely linked to the Black Sea region and  at the early stages it is important not to err in selecting  strategy and tactics, for in no time at all we may find  ourselves on the ""dustheap of history.""

A Hong Kong-based senior Chinese official  told EASTERN EXPRESS that all matters relating to SAR travel  documents were within China's, ""sovereign right"" and were ""none  of Britain's business"", adding that London's demand was  ""ridiculous"". News of the rejection is a serious blow to the  British Joint Liaison Group team which has tried repeatedly  since last July to discuss the issue with Beijing. All  approaches have been met with silence from China.    A British official said London needed to be involved in the  process because Hong Kong was still under British rule. ""In  practical terms, the passport will have to be issued in Hong  Kong,"" he said. ""They are not going to be issued in Beijing,  ""So we need to be fully involved in that activity since Hong  Kong is still under British administration.""    The Chinese official said the Hong Kong Immigration  Department must ""co-operate"" with China in working out the  technical details of SAR passports. Matters to be sorted out  include how Hong Kong residents who qualify as permanent  residents of the SAR should apply for and take delivery of the  document. The Immigration Department will also need to develop  new technology to register passport holders and monitor the  document's use.    Beijing is still considering a design for the passport and  three options have been submitted to the Chinese government so  far.    China's Foreign Ministry will lobby other countries for  official recognition of the passport and, where applicable,  exemptions from visa requirements for passport holders. The  Chinese official said negotiations with countries over the use  of the SAR travel document would be conducted through Chinese  embassies.    The British official maintained that such matters would be  best handled on a joint basis, but he would not disclose what  role Britain wanted to play in the process saying: ""We need to  reach consensus with the Chinese on who does what and when.""    Hong Kong passport holders, he said, already enjoyed freedom  of travel to many countries because of previous arrangements  made by Britain. ""Therefore we need to be involved in  discussions with other countries as well,"" he said. The British  official believed there were other complications that needed to  be resolved, including the definition of who qualifies for Hong  Kong SAR citizenship and right of abode after 1997.    A meeting of the Joint Liaison Group will be held tomorrow  to  discuss the right of abode issue. The British official said he  did not expect a breakthrough. ""Other complications are that  from China's point of view, it is not easy for them to give up  their sovereign right on this issue,"" he said. ""Having the  British or Hong Kong government involved is seen as a delegation  of their sovereignty. Our objective is to ensure ordinary  travellers in Hong Kong have the necessary documents for them to  continue to travel freely after 1997.""    The European Union has said it will recognise the new SAR  passport because provisions for it were included in the Joint  Declaration.     "
0,FT942-928 ,"FT942-928 _AN-EF0DGADEFT 940627   FT  27 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Work and benefits   The greatest challenge facing the member states of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is to expand employment opportunities. In most OECD countries, unemployment has become entrenched at unacceptable levels which waste human resources and strain the social fabric. Rolling it back should be the top priority for governments. Welfare states need to be 're-engineered' so that they do not block the creation of jobs. Much of the growth in the labour market is in low-paid, part-time and casual work. Yet welfare states continue to reflect the less flexible working patterns of earlier decades. They are largely designed to support male breadwinners during periods of temporary unemployment. As a result, benefits are often so high that they discourage the unemployed from taking low-paid work. Any income earned by wives is deducted from the benefits paid to their husbands. And the rates at which benefits are withdrawn as income rises leaves those who take part-time work little or no better off. Welfare benefits thus trap their recipients outside today's more flexible labour markets, rather than helping them back into work. The OECD Jobs Study, published earlier this month, set out a menu of options for reforming welfare states to promote employment. These included widening the gap between benefit levels and after-tax earnings, linking benefits to participation in programmes for getting people back into work and earnings supplements for low-paid jobs. The UK is among the OECD members that have gone furthest in adopting such policies. But much more needs to be done, as a recent study from the Labour party's Commission on Social Justice showed. The bureaucracy involved in the social security system discourages the unemployed from taking up the jobs on offer. Those who take low-paid jobs must endure weeks of financial insecurity before they receive family credit, the in-work income supplement. And the partners of unemployed men cannot take any sort of work without losing most of their earnings in reduced benefits. Better administration of benefits would help reduce these disincentives. But the benefits system needs to be radically shaken up to support people through periods of partial employment and low-paid work as well as during unemployment. The aim should be to ensure that those who take any form of work enjoy higher incomes. The UK government's decision to introduce a new jobseeker's allowance for the unemployed from 1996 provides an opportunity for such re-engineering. Yet as a result of a turf war between ministers, responsibility for the new allowance is to be divided between two government agencies. This classic Whitehall compromise - complemented by the existing three-way split of training responsibilities - is a missed opportunity for which the unemployed will pay the price.

The possibility of  promoting cooperation was studied at the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks. The details of this agreement indicate that  the Japanese and U.S. Governments will select 10 topics such as  development of materials for producing semiconductors and  development of carbon fibers, and start joint research this  fall. The governments of both countries will sign the agreement  in early June. They will promote cooperation mainly in the area  of utilizing military technologies to produce civilian goods by  combining U.S. military technologies with Japanese technologies  for production of nonmilitary goods. Both governments will ask  private industry in their own countries to take part in the  cooperation.    It is expected that Eijiro Hata, minister of international  trade and industry, and Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown--who  will attend the East and West economic officials' meeting  scheduled to be held in Warsaw, Poland, from 6 May--will agree  on an outline of the cooperation.    At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks held in  Washington, Japan and the United States disagreed over the issue  of objective criteria, including numerical targets, and failed  to reach an agreement in three areas; government procurement,  insurance services, and automobiles and auto parts. However,  both countries agreed to promote ""cooperation from the viewpoint  of global prospects,"" such as population and environmental  issues. As one field of ""cooperation between the two countries  in the area of ultramodern technology,"" both countries, as  stated in the Washington agreement, were scheduled to have  detailed discussions to finalize contents of cooperation in  private-sector industrial technology.    Four proposals of the 10-point plan will be implemented  first. They are applications of nitride aluminum, which is used  for tank armor plating and other purposes; applications of  carbon fiber composite material, which is used to produce  structural materials for space shuttles and aircraft, and for  production of nonmilitary goods; application of environmental  technologies for treatment of factory waste fluids and noise  prevention; and structural analysis of proteins.    In addition to these four proposals, other projects to  promote technological cooperation have also been mentioned.  Among them are plans to develop a factory automation (FA)  system by using the target-tracking device on missiles with  machine tools to achieve highly sophisticated factory  automation, and to develop an LCD device to be used for  high-definition televisions.    Both countries will improve development efficiencies by  combining U.S. military technologies and Japanese application  technologies. Ultimately, they plan to promote joint  development for all proposals in the 10-point development plan.    The U.S. Government intends to send a joint study group  composed of both government officials and private-sector  personnel to Japan in June, and hopes that a final agreement can  be reached on cooperation in research work. Following the  investigation team's trip to Japan, Japan and the United States  will establish a joint project team composed of members of state  research institutes, and start research as early as this fall on  each proposal. Through the New Energy Development Organization  (NEDO), which is a corporation having a special status, the  Japanese Government will ask private corporations to join the  plan.     "

Addressing the fourth national conference on cracking down  on  activities of illegal entrepot trade of textiles, Vice-Minister  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said  that in the recent period, the Chinese Government has  strengthened its work on striking back at illegal entrepot trade  activities. He added that leading members of departments of  foreign trade and economic cooperation, customs and departments  for inspection of import and export commodities throughout the  country as well as various textile companies have strengthened  their leadership over the work and have laid down a series of  rules and regulations on it.    Meanwhile, Vice-Minister Shi said, many documents are being  distributed and the mass media are being used to publicize the  significance of the work to allow more enterprises to understand  the severe harmfulness of illegal entrepot trade of textiles.    He explained that illegal entrepot trade of textiles refers  to those activities of enterprises or individuals trying illegal  methods to bypass the administration of textile rations and  export Chinese-made textiles through a third country or region  to those countries and regions which ration the quantity of  imported Chinese-made textiles.    Vice-Minister Shi stressed that China will continue to  actively cooperate with the governments of countries and regions  concerned to crack down on activities of illegal entrepot trade.    The current conference was sponsored jointly by the Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General  Administration of Customs and the State Administration for the  Inspection of Import and Export Commodities.    Zhou Keren, director of the Department of Trade  Administration of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, announced at the conference today that four  enterprises in Liaoning, Fujian and Guangdong Provinces have  been severely punished for their activities in illegal entrepot  trade of textiles.    Shankou Company under Dongmao Industrial Co. Ltd. in  Shenyang, Capital of Liaoning Province in northeast China,  signed in August 1993, with a Hong Kong company to export 6,200  dozens of cowboy shorts and 1,980 dozens of pajamas for ladies  to Singapore. The products were made by three factories in  Shenyang, in Guangdong Province and in Yingkou city. However,  they were labelled Fijian- made and were transited to the United  States in October and November in the same year.    The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation has decided to confiscate all the earnings from the  business of Shankou Company, cut off all its quotas of export  textiles from the business, and deprive it of its right to apply  for such quotas in 1994. Besides, the ministry also ordered the  Shenyang city committee of foreign trade and economic  cooperation to have all the business activities of the company  suspended. The ministry also suggested that the departments in  charge of the company should sanction disciplinary actions for  those people who are responsible for the illegal business.    The other three enterprises punished were Guangyu Xiamen Co.  Ltd. in Fujian Province, and Shifa Garment Co. Ltd. and Yongjia  Garment Co. Ltd., both in Shantou city, south China's Guangdong  Province.     "

Musavi-Nejad recalled that at the outbreak of the Iraqi war  (1980-88), the MKO shouted slogans against Saddam Husayn but  soon, however, it became attached to Saddam Husayn.    He said that during the past two years the MKO had conducted  blasts along the Iran-Iraq border in the name of the masses. He  said the MKO selected young persons in the country with promises  and encouraged them to carry out terrorist operations.    Musavi said those that cooperate with MKO will be considered  as being against the security of the country and will be  prosecuted.    Regarding the reason why the MKO is looking for people  inside  the country for terrorist operations he said there were many  reasons.    ""One of those reasons is, the MKO wants to propagate that it  has cells inside the country, whereas it is not so. The second  reason is, the people deceived by the MKO are without previous  records and if they did anything the MKO can deny their  terrorist acts,"" he said.    The third reason is that the group has been under pressure  since its flight from the country and considers this a way for  its presence.    The fourth reason, added Musavi-Nejad, such people are  considered to be forces at no cost, and the MKO without  incurring any expenditure exploits them.    He said the grouplet is not even willing to pay for the  costs  of exit from Iran of its people and they steal the jewelery of  their mothers or borrow from friends to go abroad.    These measures of the MKO, he said, are exactly the  expectation of Iraq which has always planned subversive  operations in the Islamic Republic.    About the writer of the past regime, Saeedi Sirjani, and his  fate, the Information Ministry official said, Sirjani was  arrested along with an accomplice named Mohammad Sadeq Saeed,  with the nickname Niaz Kermani, for involvement in a drug ring  and for acts against public decency, and both of them have  confessed of their acts.    The two principal accused persons, he said, have been  interrogated by the ministers of information for cooperation  with Savak and for involvement in it.    He said both Saeedi and Niaz Kermani had connections with  Savak, the Shah's notorious secret service, after the triumph of  the Islamic revolution    Musavi-Nejad said the two have already confessed to such  charges as drug trafficking, making and possessing alcoholic  beverages, sodomy, conncections with a group of savak-related  army officers that were involved with the Nowzheh State coup,  and receipt of [word indistinct] amount of foreign exchanges  from anti-revolutionary elements in the United States and Europe.    He said investigations are under way in that connection.     "

The two countries have agreed to include telecommunications as  a ""cooperation sector"" in Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.    A Japan-U.S. roundtable on telecommunications policy may be  set up in September to start work on standardizing advanced  communications and broadcasting systems and equipment.    There have been forums at the governmental level on this  subject between Europe and the United States, or between Japan  and Europe -- for instance, the ""Japan-Europe Telecommunications  Forum"" -- since the beginning of the 1990's. The start of the  planned consultations between Japan and the United States will  practically expand international cooperation in  telecommunications into a trilateral framework.    The ""cooperation sectors"" in the framework talks, unlike the  sector-by-sector negotiations which deal with bilateral economic  friction, refer to sectors where the two countries will promote  cooperation from a global perspective. This includes such  issues as environment and population, and telecommunications has  been included as one sector under commercial technology.    A concrete step in bilateral telecommunications cooperation  is the standardization of next-generation communications and  broadcasting systems and equipment. The two countries are  presently working on a number of large-scale projects to build  next-generation communications networks, including the Global  Information Infrastructure (GII), the National Information  Infrastructure (NII) of the United States, domestic networks for  Japan, and the Asian Information Infrastructure (AII).  Standardizing systems and equipment used in these projects will  facilitate mutual participation of companies from both countries  and prevent bilateral friction.    Furthermore, standardization of equipment will enable mass  production to cut costs, and will give the two countries a  technological advantage in similar projects in other regions.    In discussions on communications cooperation, the Ministries  of Posts and Telecommunications and Foreign Affairs will be the  government offices in charge on the Japanese side, while the  Departments of Commerce and State, the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC), and the Office of U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR), and others will participate on the U.S. side.  Telecommunications and broadcasting companies, and  communications equipment makers will also be invited to  participate when necessary.    Cooperation in telecommunications was suggested by Prime  Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to President Bill Clinton during the  Japan-U.S. summit in April 1993, and the President agreed to the  proposal. However, the United States postponed discussions due  to the intensifying economic friction. The two countries now  plan to begin preparatory meetings in early June, and hold the  first official meeting around the time of the plenipotentiaries'  meeting of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in  Kyoto from mid- September to early October.    Since inauguration of the Clinton administration, the U.S.  Government has given much emphasis to information policy. Apart  from working on building a national information network under  the NII program, it proposes building an international computer  communications network under GII. On the other hand, the  Japanese Government has proposed the AII program covering the  Asian countries. It has started to invite Asian countries to  get involved in this plan by sounding out the ROK government on  possible participation in early May. Japan and the United  States want to accelerate building the infrastructure for the  multimedia age by promoting information policy coordination.     "

FBIS TRENDS-13APR94-CHINA-IRAN         PRC Foreign Minister's Visit Reflects Enhanced Ties with Iran            PRC Foreign Minister's Visit Reflects Enhanced Ties with Iran      SUMMARY                                  Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's early  March visit to Iran as part of a five-nation tour has served to  underscore Beijing's expanding bilateral ties with Tehran.  Although Qian hinted at Beijing's interest in supporting regional  economic cooperation efforts, he adopted a neutral stance on  Iran's role in this regard and appeared wary of Iran's desire to  lead efforts to resolve the political crisis in Afghanistan.                             END SUMMARY      As the latest high-level Chinese visitor to come to Iran (See  Note 1), Qian used his 4-6 March official goodwill visit to  reaffirm the value Beijing attaches to its expanding relationship  with Tehran.  Meeting with his host, Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati on 5 March, Qian reiterated Beijing's intention to  further deepen bilateral ties, noting that the Chinese Government  ""pays great attention"" to developing ""friendly and cooperative""  relations with Iran (Xinhua, 5 March).  Although no specific  agreements were reported signed during the visit, Xinhua's  account of the meeting reported that the two foreign ministers  said that China and Iran have agreed to ""further enhance"" their  cooperative relations in ""various fields including politics,  economics, and trade.""      (Note 1)  Qian's visit was the latest in a series of high-level  exchanges between China and Iran in recent years--including  visits to Iran by PRC Premier Li Peng and then-President Yang  Shangkun in 1991, then-Minister of Defense Qin Jiwei in 1992, and  Politburo member and Vice Premier Li Lanqing last summer; and  trips to China by Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati and President  Rafsanjani in 1992.      Qian's visit comes on the heels of a significant expansion of  economic ties between the two countries promoted by Vice Premier  Li Lanqing's visit to Iran last July.  Li signed a memorandum of  understanding to provide Iran with a $100 million loan for  reconstruction efforts, while Iran agreed to help the PRC ""reform  its oil refineries"" to allow China to import more crude oil from  Iran (Xinhua, 6 July 1993).  Underscoring progress in developing  economic ties, Xinhua accounts during Qian's visit noted that PRC  exports to Iran had grown from textiles and light industrial  products to ""heavy machinery"" and ""high technology"" and that in  1993 trade volume between China and Iran rose to $712 million, a  63.2 percent increase over the previous year (4,6 March).      Caution on Nuclear Cooperation      Apparently reflecting Beijing's sensitivity to recent Western  news reports about possible Chinese nuclear exports to Iran, PRC  media departed from recent practice and reported no remarks by  Qian on China's nuclear cooperation with Iran.  By contrast,  during Li Lanqing's visit to Iran last July, PRC media quoted him  as ""reiterating"" Beijing's standard claim that nuclear projects  with Iran are ""only"" for the ""peaceful use of nuclear energy""  (Xinhua, 6 July 1993).  Beijing had announced its decision to  provide nuclear power plants to Iran during President  Rafsanjani's September 1992 visit to China (Xinhua, 10 September  1992) and since then Chinese media have claimed that the plants  will be the largest that the PRC has built abroad (Xinhua, 22  February 1993; Beijing radio, 6 June 1993).  On 19 January, the  Hong Kong-based PRC-affiliated wire service Zhongguo Tongxun She  reported that the president of the China National Nuclear  Corporation ""disclosed"" that China expected to begin work this  year on the installation of two 300,000 kilowatt nuclear power  generating units it had agreed to provide Iran.      Hints at Regional Economic Cooperation      Although Qian expressed Beijing's support for greater regional  economic interaction in general terms, he stopped short of  satisfying Iran's apparent efforts to elicit a public endorsement  of the Iranian-supported Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO),  an attempt to create a regional economic alliance similar to the  European common market.  In contrast to Iranian media reports  before and during the visit that attributed to Qian statements of  explicit support for the ECO (Tehran Hamshahri, 22 February;  Tehran Abrar, 1 March; Salam, 5 March), Xinhua quoted Qian, at a  press conference on 6 March, as observing only that ""all""  countries he had visited during his tour are trying to ""improve  their economic situation"" and are ""ready for regional  cooperation"" (6 March).      China's Concern over Afghanistan      PRC media reporting on the visit also suggested that Beijing and  Tehran do not see eye to eye on the question of resolving the  Afghan crisis.  Suggesting that Beijing is wary of Iranian  efforts to impose a settlement on its terms, Qian failed to  endorse Velayati's proposal, made at their meeting on 5 March,  that Afghanistan's ""neighboring countries"" should play a greater  role in bringing an end to the civil war there because of the  ""failure"" of U.N. mediation efforts (Xinhua, 5 March).  Instead,  Qian stated only that Beijing was ""deeply concerned"" about the  Afghan situation and repeated China's standard position on such  regional disputes, calling on ""all factions"" to resolve the  confict peacefully.  By contrast, in Qian's 22 February meeting  with Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali in Islamabad  at the beginning of his tour, Qian expressed his ""appreciation""  for Pakistan's efforts to ""settle differences"" among the various  Afghan factions and ""restore peace and stability"" there (Xinhua,  22 February).      Implications     PRC media commentary on Qian's visit underscores Beijing's  continuing efforts to develop closer bilateral ties with Iran,  particulary in economic and trade relations.  At the same time,  although Beijing supports more regional cooperation in principle,  it appears concerned about greater Iranian involvement in the  countries along China's borders.

The investment should promote a reduction in energy  consumption per unit of the product being manufactured.    3.5. The products of an enterprise with foreign investments  have to be market-competitive in international markets.

The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine prepares and publishes,  through the Agency for International Cooperation and Investment,  lists of the enterprises in which foreign investments are  made--provided the criteria indicated in this section of the  Program are upheld--that entail the granting of additional tax,  customs and credit concessions or insurance guarantees. These  concessions may be granted for investments in other entities  that are not indicated on those lists as well, if they  correspond to the criteria of this section of the Program and  are made in the spheres indicated in Section 2 of the Program.    Foreign investments in enterprises that are indicated in the  lists of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine are made on the  basis of competition among investment projects.    Section 4    The Substance of the Concessions That Are Granted in  Relation to Investment Projects in the Priority Spheres    Foreign investment projects in the priority spheres  indicated  in Section 4 of the Program receive the following concessions,  provided they meet the criteria in Section 3 of the Program:    4.1.

The period of exemption from taxation of profits  (income) stipulated by Article 31 of the Decree of the Cabinet  of Ministers of Ukraine, ""Conditions of Foreign Investment,"" is  increased regardless of the amount of foreign investment by one  year for investments of up to 500,000 dollars U.S. inclusive,  for two years for investments from more than 500,000 to five  million dollars U.S. inclusive, for three years for investments  of more than five million to 50 million dollars U.S., and for  five years for investments of more than 50 million dollars U.S.    4.3. The granting of a tax credit on beneficial terms with  regard to those types of taxes that are subject to payment in  the first three years of existence of an enterprise with foreign  investments. The indicated concession pertains exclusively to  items 2.1.1--2.1.5 and 2.4.1.    4.4. The return of 50 percent of the import duty paid for  bringing across the border from abroad goods for industrial  purposes, and 100 percent for parts, units and assemblies  imported under cooperation, if their use for the production of  the enterprise with foreign investments is certified.

Insurance for the investment risks through a special  budgetary fund for insurance guarantees.    Section 5    Improvement of the Legal Regulation of Foreign Investment    It is essential, in order to create reliable legal  guarantees  with regard to foreign investment:    5.1. To resolve the issue of granting enterprises with  foreign investments that have the status of a legal person in  Ukraine the right to own the plot of land on which the objects  of the investment are located.    5.2. To simplify the procedure for the participation of  foreign investors in the process of privatizing state property.    5.3.

To make changes and additions to the Decree of the  Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, ""Conditions of Foreign  Investment,"" with regard to simplifying registration procedures  connected with foreign investment.    5.5. To prepare and reach bilateral agreements with the  countries that are the principal economic partners of Ukraine,  as well as countries that could potentially be a source for  enlisting foreign investments, to encourage and mutually protect  investments and agreements on avoiding double taxation.    5.6. To adopt laws on the protection of intellectual  property  in accordance with prevailing international treaties  (conventions) in this sphere, with the aim of creating  conditions for investments associated with high technologies in  Ukraine.    Section 6    Development of the Infrastructure of International Business  and Other Preconditions of Foreign Investment    It is essential, in order to create suitable conditions for  enlisting foreign investment:    6.1. To make marked improvements in the operating techniques  of the funds exchanges, commercial banks and insurance companies  of Ukraine, create intersector networks of investment companies  and funds of trust and holding companies, auditing and  consulting firms with the enlistment in collaboration and  consultation of specialists from the UN, the World Bank, the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the  Commission of the European Union and other international  organizations, as well as leading foreign firms.    6.2.

To create a Ukrainian Bank for Reconstruction and  Development, to which would be assigned the functions of  granting beneficial credit as envisaged by Paragraph 4.5 of the  Program.    6.4. To create a National Insurance Company of Ukraine to  insure risks as envisaged in Paragraph 4.6 of the Program.    6.5.

To implement, in the shortest possible time, the  introduction of statistical reporting in Ukraine on the  processes of foreign investment based on the utilization of a  system of national transactions and balance of payments of  Ukraine in conformity with international standards for  accounting and reporting.    6.8. To designate the base educational institutions in  Ukraine and abroad for the training and retraining of national  specialists on questions of management, financing, credit,  insurance, currency operations and operations with securities,  banking, accounting, auditing and international law, and to  develop a system of state certification of the national  educational institutions that are conducting training in those  areas.    Section 7    The Role of the Regions of Ukraine in Encouraging Foreign  Investment    The Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea, oblast,  and Kiev and Sevastopol city state administrations can develop  and approve their own programs to encourage foreign investment  proceeding from the specific nature of the economy of the  corresponding regions. These regional programs are realized  through concessions that are granted within the limits of the  corresponding local taxes and levies, as well as the budgetary  funds of the corresponding regions.    This Program may be amended and clarified by resolution of  the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine proceeding from changes in the  economic situation, the appearance of new problems that require  solution, and the gaining of experience in the sphere of  enlisting foreign investment.    The Law of Ukraine on the State Program to Encourage Foreign  Investment in Ukraine    The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine decrees:    To establish that the relations associated with encouraging  foreign investments in Ukraine and the establishment of the  basic priorities for foreign investment in the economy of  Ukraine are regulated by the State Program to Encourage Foreign  Investment in Ukraine appended to this Law, and is an  inalienable part of it.

From  the very beginning, you have been a great supporter of this  integration initiative. How do you see all this now as  reflected in the current summit?    [Goncz] I would not say that the Visegrad cooperation was  buried in Prague, because this is the regional cooperation of  four given countries. In my opinion, this summit gave an  impetus to this cooperation; it will probably accelerate it, or  at least will increase the desire for economic cooperation. At  the same time, this summit could bring the region's stability  closer by the emergence of a negotiating mechanism capable of  solving the possible differences of views. Thus, the common  work of the four definitely contributes to the stability of the  region and plays a balancing role in Central Europe.    [NEPSZABADSAG] However, the Czech leaders openly say that  they have something else in mind and, for some time, they have  practically refrained from uttering the word Visegrad.    [Goncz] It makes no difference whatsoever if someone  mentions Visegrad or not. The essential think today is that the  forms of cooperation have emerged and, although not a security  guarantee, the region received the possibility of a negotiating  mechanism that has a balancing power in itself.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Should one fear that rivalry in Central  Europe might even accelerate after the acceptance of the  Partnership of Peace program?    [Goncz] Yes, there will obviously be criteria here, and the  compatibility of the countries in the region for closer  cooperation with NATO will be examined also from a military  viewpoint. Given the fact that these conditions have not been  formulated at this summit, and they will probably be formulated  later, I cannot tell which country will be the first to join.  Honestly speaking, I think this is a rather secondary issue,  because the stability of the region itself if what matters. I  interpret security in a much broader sense than only military  security. Naturally, NATO is an extremely important element of  European security, but it does not replace an all-European  security system. The way I see it, we have now made a step  forward in this direction, and a considerable step at that.    [NEPSZABADSAG] President Walesa made a particularly dramatic  statement before the meeting. What was your impression about  the Polish attitude in Prague?    [Goncz] My impression is that Lech Walesa came with the most  colorful proposals to Prague. Naturally, it was impossible to  debate these proposals in detail, but this can obviously be done  at a later date.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Does your meeting with Michal Kovac represent  any progress in the Hungarian-Slovak relations?    [Goncz] This was a really important meeting, and it was held  in a very good atmosphere. From Michal Kovac's words, I think  the most important is that they are trying to solve the issues  in harmony with the ideas of the Hungarian minority, and not by  excluding this national minority. This was not my first meeting  with Mr Kovac; I am absolutely convinced of his good will; he  spoke wise and well-thought words. The invitation to come to  Budapest continues to be valid, and I hope that this visit will  take place soon.     "

This is  the location of the Trade and Economic Department of the Embassy  of the Republic of Poland in Ukraine. It is headed by Commercial  Attache Michal Uzemblo. Our BIZNES correspondent met with Mr.  Uzemblo and asked him to describe the state and prospects of the  development of Polish-Ukrainian trade and economic  relations.    [Kvitko] Mr. Uzemblo, it is far from your first year in  Ukraine, and you are well acquainted with our economic  situation. Tell us, please, are there practicable prerequisites  for an increase in mutually profitable cooperation between our  countries?    [Uzemblo] Ukraine has been an independent state only for  three years. It is natural, therefore, that you have had this  whole time to surmount the well-known difficulties of the  formation of statehood. In addition, Ukraine inherited from the  former USSR quite a complex and unregulated economy, and the  economic relations that had operated for years both with  countries of the former USSR and with the participants in the  disintegrated Council for Economic Mutual Assistance (CEMA), one  of the biggest partners among which was Poland, were disrupted.  The command levers of the control of cooperation, which had  frequently flouted considerations of elementary advantage,  ceased to operate, and commodity turnover between our countries  declined.    Account also has to be taken of the fact that by the time  Ukraine had acquired its sovereignty, Poland had already  implemented a number of economic reforms en route to the market.  This meant that trading as before was no longer possible. You  yourself will realize that perfectly understandable  considerations of advantage, without which a real market is  inconceivable, came into play. The decline in commodity turnover  was perfectly natural, therefore. A payments crisis, when  Ukrainian enterprises were unable to pay for supplies from  Poland in hard currency and your national currency rapidly  declined in value, was superimposed in addition. The situation  was rescued neither by commodity-exchange transactions nor  so-called barter....    Nonetheless, I would like to mention that at the interstate  level Poland was one of the first to sign with Ukraine, in May  1992, a treaty on good-neighborliness, friendly relations, and  cooperation, which laid the legal foundations for a  qualitatively new system of relations between our states within  the framework of the process of transformations in Central and  East Europe.    Today economic relations between Ukraine and Poland are  regulated, aside from the said treaty, by:    1) the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation of 4  October 1991.    2) The Convention on the Avoidance of Dual Taxation and the  Prevention of Income and Property Tax Evasion of 12 January 1993.    3) The Agreement on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of  Investments of 12 January 1993.    4) The Agreement on Interregional Cooperation.    An Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and Economic  Cooperation, whose activity is contributing to the further  development of bilateral economic relations, was formed on the  basis of the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation and the  protocol of 12 January 1993.    [Kvitko] And how productive has the commission's  contribution  to bilateral cooperation been?    [Uzemblo] You know that we do not have the right to dictate  to our entrepreneurs with whom they should conclude deals. But  at the government level the parties have agreed for the  establishment of efficient mutually profitable cooperation to  promote a resumption of relations between enterprises and to  support their development at small and medium-sized business  level, to contribute to the creation of joint ventures, and to  establish a system of mutual notification of the parties of  legislative instruments in force in their countries that  regulate financial, legal, customs, and economic matters.    The commission has been quite productive, I believe.  According to Polish customs data, commodity turnover increased  from $337 million in 1992 to $386.8 million in 1993. In  addition, the practice of joint entrepreneurial activity is  characterized by the fact that Poland is in first place in terms  of the number of joint ventures on the territory of Ukraine.  Their number has risen to 580. The exports of these ventures  constitute $22,980,900, and imports, $18,092,100. According to  figures of the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine,  Polish-Ukrainian joint ventures constitute 17.8 percent of the  total number of those operating in the country.    [Kvitko] Nonetheless, use is, most likely, being made of far  from all possibilities for the development and expansion of  cooperation. And the reason is by no means a lack of interest in  Ukraine among our Polish partners. What can you say in this  connection?    [Uzemblo] Polish business has a tremendous interest in  Ukraine. Proof of this is not only the first place in terms of  the number of joint ventures but also the fact that  approximately 50 of our firms have opened and registered their  offices in Ukraine. In addition, Polish entrepreneurs are  readily participating in many exhibitions which are being held  in Ukraine and actively inviting their Ukrainian partners to  exhibitions and fairs in Poland....    But the fact that there has yet to be in Ukraine the total  liberalization of foreign economic activity, economic and  financial stabilization has not been achieved, and your national  unit of currency has not become even internally convertible is a  reality also.    Given the least signs of stabilization in Ukraine, the  Polish  entrepreneur would respond appropriately. And our Ukrainian  partners are well enough aware of our possibilities. This  includes agricultural production and also machinery and  equipment for food and light industry, wood processing and  furniture production, medical equipment, the manufacture of  medicines and veterinary preparations, and much else. What I  have listed, I believe, is merely a small particle of the  possible interaction of our enterprises and entrepreneurs....     "

The secretary of the  General People's Comvittee for Foreign Liaison and International  Cooperation asserted that since the holding of the 10th summit  conference in Jakarta in 1992, the world has been witnessing  quick and successive developments and changes with long terms  effects on international relations on both regional and  international levels including the non-alignment movement as new  economic and political trends emerge requiring our countries to  study them thoroughly and take the necessary initiatives to deal  with them.    He pointed out that the changes which took place in he world  did not end or lessen the validity of the fundamental principles  and objectives of the movement.    He added ""the ideal international order as invisaged by the  founder fathers of our movement is still far from achieving and  that the aspirations of the non-alignment movement countries for  real equality, genuine independence and limited development  continue to clash with the forces who have been accustomed to  achieve their intentions without any due regard for the opinion  and desires of the international community and the U.N  resolutions.    He said against these challenges and the absence of  international balance, the non-alignment movement continue to  represent the appropriate framework for the coordination for the  policy of its members so as to achieve their aspirations, common  action to maintain their sovereign independence and confronting  the tendencies of new domination and the imposition of the will  of the major powers on the whole world.    He added ""our movement will not oe able to fulfil its whole  role except through the enhancement of its unity, rejection of  any attempt to marginalize the role of the movement in  international affairs and to work actively to prevent the  establishment of a descriminator of international order which  would serve only the interest of the northern countries at the  expense of the interest of the south. We are required to find  the necessary means and ways to maintain the power of impetus  within the non-alignment movement so as to fulfil its total role  in formulating the new international relations and influence  them in a manner commensurate with its size and its political  and demographic weight and to contribute towards creating a new  multilateral world free from domination and founded on  cooperation, justice, equity, equality and respect for the  sovereignty of other states.    The secretary of the General People's Committe for Foreign  Liaison and International Cooperation made clear that during the  10th summit of the non-aligned movement, the delegation of the  Great Jamahirya was given tpe opportunity to inform the head of  states of the latest developments in the despute between herself  and the United States of America, Britain and France.    He said ""my country expressed deep satisfaction towards the  stance taken by the movement regarding this dispute as the  summit welcomed Libya's acceptance of the Security Council  Resolution 731 and requested the concerned parties to refrain  from any escalation of the crisis and seek to find a peaceful  and just settlement which may safeguard the interest and rights  of all parties in accordance with the norms and principles of  international law and the U.N. charter. Other organizations  took a similar stance and I refer in this respect to the O.A.U.  which adopted in its recent summit in Cairo a decision  expressing her gratitude to the Libyan initiatives to settle the  dispute in a manner which respects the sovereignty of Libya in  accordance to internatinal norms and Libya's acceptance of the  Security Council Resolution 731 and its request to the U.N  Secretary General to set up a [word indistinct] for the  implementation of the resolution. Also the heads of state  expressed their gratitude to Libya's readiness to cooperate with  judicial and legal parties. A similar decision was taken by the  Islamic Conference Organization.    The secretary added ""in this respect I would like to refer  the Arab League Resolution No 5373 on 27/3/1994 regarding the  trial of the two suspects at the seat of the International Court  of Justice in The Hague. The resolution urged the Security  Council to take into consideration this new proposal which  represents an approriate basis to finding a peaceful eolution  which may satisfy all the varties and prevent any escalation of  the situation which may highten tension in the region.    The Secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign  Liaison and International Cooperation said ""and here my country  declares once again her acceptance the aforementioned proposal  of the League of Arab States as a practical bases to finding a  final solution to this dispute which is in our opinion enough to  reach a solution if these countries had sicncere intentions and  the firm desire for a solution to this issue.    He added ""we are confident that this conference will support  the initiative of the Arab League and urge the Security Council  to respond to it. We rely on the efforts and endeavours of the  non-aligned movement to convience the concerned countries to  accept the proposal of the Arab League and abandon efforts to  impose further sanctions which will only add to the suffering to  the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples who suffered  massive losses as a resultpof the unjust, sanctions of the  Secuirty Council resolutions 748 and 883 and the lifting of  abroagating of these sanctions. The U.N. is one of the biggest  centers for coordinating international which the recent changes  are reflected. However the dominatin of a given geographical  area in the running of the affairs of the organization with the  aim to impose its opinion in various important issues led to a  further [word indistinct] of the developing countries  spear-headed by the non-alignment movement. This emerged  clearly during the debates of the security council on a number  of issues. And there are moves which emerged indeed and warn of  the desire to take similar measures at the U.N. General  Assembly. This shows clearly the danger threatening the  democratic character of the U.N. which has [word indistinct]  since its establishment, safeguarded by the third world  membership and its effective participation in its activities.  These recent developments inside the U.N. are similar to the  crisis facing the non-aligned movement countries. Our movement,  being the biggest international grouping after the U.N., was  able in the past thanks to the balanced democratic debates to  pave the way for the U.N. to take important political, economic  and social resolutions.    The secretary asserted ""the member states of the movement  should make sure to play fundamental role in the formulation in  the future U.N. and its restructuring instead of accepting to be  on the fringe of events and for the movement to take all  effective measures to confront the current challenges.    The secretary added ""to realize this objective, we have to  seek to enhance the U.N. machinery and redirect its activities  in an effective manner so that all countries will be able to  participate in the process of the decisions taken by the  organization and take part effectively in the multilateral  diplomacy which the U.N. is considered to be its axis and for us  to be able to create a new order founded on freedom, equality,  justike, prosperity and the well being of all mankind.    The secretary refered once again to the injustice of the  so-called veto right within the security council enjoyed by five  countries from a total of 184 member states of the U.N.    He pointed out ""unfortunately this privilage was abused in  many circumstances to entrench aggression and terrorizing  smaller nations and the application of double standards in  dealing with many issues affecting the maintenance of peace and  security.    He added ""in this respect I would like to stress Section 32  the decision of the Jakarta Summit which asserts the need for  revising this right in conformity with reforming the U.N. and  demand a review of the Security Council membership so as to  reflect the increasing number of the U.N membership and help  finding fairer and more balanced representation of the U.N.  members also I would like to reiterate the report of the  miniserial committee on policy submitted to Jakarta Summit  stressing the need for effective coordination of the stances of  the movement before and after the convening of the General  Assembly especially regarding the issues on which the movement  took decisions. Furthermore, it is necessary for the decisons  taken by the summit and ministerial conferences to reflect their  true effect by members of the movement within the security  council so as to give it the necessary credibility.

Ambassador al-Tikriti said: ""The project of creating a  Kurdish state incorporating Iraq and Turkey is Britain's. The  United States supports this project.""    He gave assurances to Turkey, saying: ""If the Hammer Force  leaves, we will not allow even a single PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] militant to take shelter in northern Iraq.""    Iraqi Ambassador to Ankara al-Tikriti assessed the latest  developments in the region during his visit to our paper's  Ankara bureau.    Indicating that the Turkey-Iraqi oil pipeline will rust  unless the oil is flushed out, al-Tikriti said: ""Iraq owes some  $1 billion to Turkey. We told Turkey: Take the oil in the  pipeline to enable us to pay our debt; and moreover, do not give  the remaining money to us in the form of foreign currency, we  want foodstuffs. But, the United Nations will not give  permission to Turkey. Turkey is hurt from the embargo the most.  At present, BOTAS [Turkish Pipeline and Oil Transportation  Company] buys oil from other countries at $19 per barrel. It  also pays $1.50 for the transportation of each barrel. Were the  oil pipeline open, this transportation price would not be paid.  That is why BOTAS is losing $1 billion every year. We want to  act within the framework of UN resolutions, but we are being  obstructed. Because of the embargo, 4,500 children in Iraq die  every week.""    ""Cooperation Is a Must""    Indicating that the establishment of a Kurdish state in  northern Iraq will considerably undermine the regional stability  and that the real damage will be done to Turkey, al-Tikriti  said: ""This is because there are more Kurds in Turkey than in  Iraq. The Kurds' goal is obvious. They want to set up a large  Kurdish state in the region. They have even published maps.  These maps were shown on one of your television programs. The  West does not want stability in our region. Turkey and Iraq are  face to face with a plot. The project of creating a Kurdish  state in the region belongs to the British. The United States  is supporting this project.""    Indicating that Turkey and Iraq should cooperate to prevent  the implementation of this project, al-Tikriti said:  ""Otherwise, a Kurdish state will be established.""    Guarantee Given to Turkey    Noting that prior to the Gulf crisis no such tension and  disorder existed in the region, al-Tikriti said that at the time  Iraq gave importance to Turkey's security. Asking ""where was  the PKK before the Gulf crisis?"" al-Tikriti said: ""The PKK will  vanish if the Hammer Force leaves and the oil pipeline is  opened. At present, the PKK is being protected and sheltered by  the Kurds in northern Iraq. Ask the Hammer Force to leave. Once  the Hammer Force leaves, our government will restore authority  in the region. Not even one single PKK militant will remain in  northern Iraq. PKK is a terror organization. Besides, Turkey's  security is important to us.""    Asked what Iraq's position towards the Kurds will be once  the  Hammer Force leaves, al-Tikriti replied: ""We gave official  guarantees to Ozal in the past, and later to Demirel.

He identified the attacker as Ali Houri nick-named ""Popi""  from the Haft Tappeh region of Khuzestan in southwest Iran.    Houri after his failed assassination bid against  Hojatoleslam  Mohammad Abaei-Khorasani just after the latter had finished his  Friday prayer sermons, tried to shoot himself to escape the fury  of the worshippers.    Musavi-Nejad said the attacker who underwent surgery at Imam  Redha (AS) hospital had shot himself with the idea of committing  suicide.    Hoj. Abaei-Khorasani who was struck by two bullets on the  back of his shoulder, is recovering at Qaem hospital where he  was operated upon after the attack. A third bullet fired by the  attacker missed the prayer leader and injured a theology student.    The Information Ministry official asked to comment on the  motives of the attack, said the MKO because of its nature will  not abandon its terrorism. Moreover, he said, it has reached a  deadlock in Iraq.    Musavi-Nejad recalled that at the outbreak of the Iraqi war  (1980-88), the MKO shouted slogans against Saddam Husayn but  soon, however, it became attached to Saddam Husayn.    He said that during the past two years the MKO had conducted  blasts along the Iran-Iraq border in the name of the masses. He  said the MKO selected young persons in the country with promises  and encouraged them to carry out terrorist operations.    Musavi said those that cooperate with MKO will be considered  as being against the security of the country and will be  prosecuted.    Regarding the reason why the MKO is looking for people  inside  the country for terrorist operations he said there were many  reasons.    ""One of those reasons is, the MKO wants to propagate that it  has cells inside the country, whereas it is not so. The second  reason is, the people deceived by the MKO are without previous  records and if they did anything the MKO can deny their  terrorist acts,"" he said.    The third reason is that the group has been under pressure  since its flight from the country and considers this a way for  its presence.    The fourth reason, added Musavi-Nejad, such people are  considered to be forces at no cost, and the MKO without  incurring any expenditure exploits them.    He said the grouplet is not even willing to pay for the  costs  of exit from Iran of its people and they steal the jewelery of  their mothers or borrow from friends to go abroad.    These measures of the MKO, he said, are exactly the  expectation of Iraq which has always planned subversive  operations in the Islamic Republic.    About the writer of the past regime, Saeedi Sirjani, and his  fate, the Information Ministry official said, Sirjani was  arrested along with an accomplice named Mohammad Sadeq Saeed,  with the nickname Niaz Kermani, for involvement in a drug ring  and for acts against public decency, and both of them have  confessed of their acts.    The two principel accused persons, he said, have been  interrogated by the ministers of information for cooperation  with Savak and for involvement in it.    He said both Saeedi and Niaz Kermani had connections with  Savak, the Shah's notorious secret service, after the triumph of  the Islamic revolution    Musavi-Nejae said the two have already confessed to such  charges as drug trafficking, making and possessing alcoholic  beverages, sodomy, conncections with a group of savak-related  army officers that were involved with the Nowzheh State coup,  and receipt of [word indistinct] amount of foreign exchanges  from anti- revolutionary elements in the United States and  Europe.    He said investigations are under way in that connection.     "

The Nikkei was finally up 192.55 at 19,685.07, after opening at the day's low of 19,501.46 and hitting a high of 19,729.65 in the afternoon. Volume remained almost flat, at 250m shares against 244m. Advances led declines by 868 to 179, with 107 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose for the third consecutive day, climbing 21.69 to 1,584.08. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 4.42 at 1,205.70. The bond market closed higher thanks to the stronger yen, prompting renewed hopes of monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. The dollar closed Y1.97 down at Y108.60, while the yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark bond fell 3.5 basis points to 4.425 per cent. Traders said public fund support limited the downside for the Nikkei, but that the unexpected weakness in the economic recovery had limited the prospects of a rise above the 20,000 level. Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities expects the index to move between 19,300 and 20,000 in the near term. 'Market participants still cannot evaluate the implications of the political upheaval,' he added. Mining issues were popular on rumours that Mr George Soros was once again buying the gold market. Sumitomo Metal Mining was the most active issue of the day, forging ahead Y57 to Y1,030, while Mitsui Mining and Smelting rose Y18 to Y515. The higher yen supported electric power utilities, which gained 2.74 per cent on the day. Tokyo Electric Power put on Y50 at Y3,550. High-technology exporters were lower. Short-covering helped steel issues. Nippon Steel moved up Y6 to Y366 and Sumitomo Metal Y8 to Y330.

News Corpor-ation moved forward 9 cents to ADollars 7.54 on expectations of strong profits figures for the current financial year. SINGAPORE suffered a wave of selling in nervous afternoon dealings after Wednesday's rebound, and the Straits Times Industrial index fell 20.21, or 1.1 per cent, to 1,770.90. The nervous tone was attributed to reports of heightened tension on the Iran-Iraq border. BANGKOK was also depressed by reports of heightened tension in the Gulf and the SET index weakened 16.25, or 1.8 per cent, to 894.08. Bangkok Bank of Commerce shed Bt2.25 to Bt22.50 and NTS Steel lost Bt2 to Bt53 after the exchange authorities said that trades in the two issues must be settled in cash, instead of the normal policy of half cash and half credit, following recent 'irregular movements'. SEOUL saw continued profit-taking in blue chip manufacturers and financial issues but the market was carried higher by some healthy demand for small and medium-capitalisation shares.

0,FT921-4499 ,"FT921-4499 _AN-CCIBJAD0FT 920309   FT  09 MAR 92 / Syria and Iran defence link-up: A 'strange marriage' in the Gulf      By TONY WALKER      DAMASCUS   SYRIA and Iran have boosted significantly their defence co-operation since the end of the Gulf crisis, prompting Western suspicions that the two are actively collaborating in securing weapons of mass destruction, notably missiles. There are also fears that the collaboration could ultimately involve joint efforts to secure a nuclear capability. Western concerns about strengthening Syrian-Iranian defence links coincide with a looming international crisis over reports that at least one North Korean ship is bound for Iran's Gulf port of Bandar Abbas with ballistic missiles on board destined for Syria. A Western attache in Damascus described the combination of Iran and Syria as 'potentially very dangerous'. He said the 'strange marriage' could pose the 'next century's threat to the Middle East'. Syria, virtually alone among Arab states, supported Iran in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Another Western official said there were also indications that Syria and Iran were building stronger defence links with China and Pakistan, and this was 'troubling' in the light of fears of the further spread of nuclear technology following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Syria, which had relied on the Soviet Union as its main arms supplier and guardian superpower, has been casting around for new allies and sources of military equipment. China, which is supplying missile technology, is filling part of the gap. Syria last month signed a nuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, entitling it to purchase a small Chinese nuclear reactor for peaceful use. This is Syria's most significant foray into the nuclear technology field. China has also been supplying ballistic missiles to Syria. Last September, a Chinese vessel with what was believed to have been a cargo of either parts or complete M-9 short range missiles called at the Syrian port of Tartus. Washington, meanwhile, is considering whether to order its navy ships in the Gulf region to board the North Korean vessels (there are conflicting reports about numbers), believed to be carrying the Scud-C missiles for Syria and possibly Iran. Israel itself has not ruled out a military strike against the North Korean vessels. But the US feels constrained about boarding ships bound for Iran because its navy deployment in the Gulf is there under United Nations resolutions aimed at enforcing a trade embargo against Iraq. THE US would not be empowered to seize the Scud-C missiles under the terms of the UN resolutions. But a Bush administration official was quoted as saying that in spite of the fact that US naval vessels could not seize the weapons, their discovery would provide 'public proof that Syria and Iran were getting long-range missiles'. The North Korean Scud-Cs are a more accurate version of the Scud-Bs that Iraq launched against Israel and Saudi Arab during the Gulf crisis. Syria's attempts to secure shipments of the North Korean missiles, whose range extends for about 600 kilometres, coincide with signs of a vigorous renewed Middle East arms race, with various states seeking to boost their military capabilities contrary to disarmament trends elsewhere. Iran, the Gulf states and Syria have been at the forefront of these efforts. The US has also been meeting Israeli requests for additional, more sophisticated weaponry, especially to boost its air defences. Western military attaches in Damascus say that the Syrians have been utilising their 'war dividend' of up to Dollars 2bn from Gulf states grateful for Syria's participation in the allied coalition against Iraq to buy weapons cheaply in Eastern Europe.

The official, Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon, also will brief  Chinese officials about the meeting last week in the Siberian city of Irkutsk  at which Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze served notice of their desire for unprecedented  U.S.-Soviet cooperation in Asia, U.S. officials said.    Solomon's mission indicates that the United States is seeking both to enlist  China's support against Iraq and, at the same time, to reassure the Chinese  regime that it need not feel threatened by the closeness with which U.S. and  Soviet officials are now working together.    ""The Chinese are big players, and they ought to be in on these decisions,"" one  Administration official said.    ""We probably would have thought about doing this (sending an emissary to  Beijing) anyway, but (the Iraqi invasion of) Kuwait put it over the edge,"" the  official said. ""You can't have a situation where you appear to be working only  with the Soviets. You've got to include China in the action here.""    Although the Soviet Union and France have been Iraq's two leading arms  suppliers, China also provides significant amounts of arms and military  equipment to Baghdad. In addition, China is a permanent member of the U.N.  Security Council, and its cooperation would be necessary to pass any council  resolution imposing sanctions against Iraq.    Asked two days ago whether China might go along with an arms embargo against  Iraq, Solomon told The Times, ""The Chinese are going to have to decide how  isolated in the world they want to be.""    Shevardnadze told a news conference Friday night in Moscow that the Soviet  Union had not been in direct contact with China concerning the international  efforts against Iraq. U.S. officials at the time declined to say whether they  had talked with Chinese officials, but made clear they expected to do so.    Solomon accompanied Baker during the secretary's just-completed visit to Asia,  including the meetings in Irkutsk, at which Baker and Shevardnadze spoke of the  importance of having Washington and Moscow work together in Asia on Cambodia,  Afghanistan and other issues.    On Friday night, while Baker stopped in Moscow for an emergency meeting on the  situation in Iraq, Solomon left the secretary's entourage to catch a flight to  Beijing.    Solomon is the highest-ranking Administration official to visit China since  National Security Adviser Brent A. Scowcroft made two secret trips to Beijing  last year.    Officially, the Administration still maintains the policy it adopted after  China's 1989 crushing of its pro-democracy movement. The United States has  banned ""exchanges"" with China by any officials at the level of assistant  secretary or higher.    However, the Administration has explained that it defines exchanges narrowly as  meaning a reciprocal trading of visits between Beijing and Washington.    One senior Administration official said he is quite hopeful that China will  join the U.S.-Soviet arms embargo and other international efforts against Iraq.    ""My guess is that the Chinese will be cooperative,"" he said. ""The Chinese  generally don't like it when one country invades another country. They really  got mad at us over (the U.S. invasion of) Panama"" last December.    However, over the past decade, China has carried out an extremely active effort  to develop close friendships in the Middle East. A willingness to supply  low-cost weaponry has been the key ingredient in China's diplomatic effort.  China made huge arms deliveries to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war.    Over the past three years, U.S. officials have been extremely concerned about  the possibility that China would supply newly produced M-9 missiles to several  countries in the Middle East, including Iraq. The missile is still believed to  be in the development stage.      Photo, Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state, traveled to China.

The official, Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon, also will brief  Chinese officials about the meeting last week in the Siberian city of Irkutsk  at which Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze served notice of their desire for unprecedented  U.S.-Soviet cooperation in Asia, U.S. officials said.    Solomon's mission indicates that the United States is seeking both to enlist  China's support against Iraq and, at the same time, to reassure the Chinese  regime that it need not feel threatened by the closeness with which U.S. and  Soviet officials are now working together.    ""The Chinese are big players, and they ought to be in on these decisions,"" one  Administration official said.    ""We probably would have thought about doing this (sending an emissary to  Beijing) anyway, but (the Iraqi invasion of) Kuwait put it over the edge,"" the  official said. ""You can't have a situation where you appear to be working only  with the Soviets. You've got to include China in the action here.""    Although the Soviet Union and France have been Iraq's two leading arms  suppliers, China also provides significant amounts of arms and military  equipment to Baghdad. In addition, China is a permanent member of the U.N.  Security Council, and its cooperation would be necessary to pass any council  resolution imposing sanctions against Iraq.    Asked two days ago whether China might go along with an arms embargo against  Iraq, Solomon told The Times, ""The Chinese are going to have to decide how  isolated in the world they want to be.""    Shevardnadze told a news conference Friday night in Moscow that the Soviet  Union had not been in direct contact with China concerning the international  efforts against Iraq. U.S. officials at the time declined to say whether they  had talked with Chinese officials, but made clear they expected to do so.    Solomon accompanied Baker during the secretary's just-completed visit to Asia,  including the meetings in Irkutsk, at which Baker and Shevardnadze spoke of the  importance of having Washington and Moscow work together in Asia on Cambodia,  Afghanistan and other issues.    On Friday night, while Baker stopped in Moscow for an emergency meeting on the  situation in Iraq, Solomon left the secretary's entourage to catch a flight to  Beijing.    Solomon is the highest-ranking Administration official to visit China since  National Security Adviser Brent A. Scowcroft made two secret trips to Beijing  last year.    Officially, the Administration still maintains the policy it adopted after  China's 1989 crushing of its pro-democracy movement. The United States has  banned ""exchanges"" with China by any officials at the level of assistant  secretary or higher.    However, the Administration has explained that it defines exchanges narrowly as  meaning a reciprocal trading of visits between Beijing and Washington.    One senior Administration official said he is quite hopeful that China will  join the U.S.-Soviet arms embargo and other international efforts against Iraq.    ""My guess is that the Chinese will be cooperative,"" he said. ""The Chinese  generally don't like it when one country invades another country. They really  got mad at us over (the U.S. invasion of) Panama"" last December.    However, over the past decade, China has carried out an extremely active effort  to develop close friendships in the Middle East. A willingness to supply  low-cost weaponry has been the key ingredient in China's diplomatic effort.  China made huge arms deliveries to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war.    Over the past three years, U.S. officials have been extremely concerned about  the possibility that China would supply newly produced M-9 missiles to several  countries in the Middle East, including Iraq. The missile is still believed to  be in the development stage.      Photo, Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state, traveled to China.

[Sabol] The arms industry of the former Czechoslovakia was  organized as a whole. After the federation was partitioned, the  situation changed, but, nevertheless, what sense would it make  to buy something expensive in third countries that we ourselves  can make more cheaply at home? A solution would be to agree on  mutually advantageous economic opportunities. In both the Slovak  Republic and the Czech Republic, there is interest in arms  production because arms, as an important source of funds for the  state coffers, do sell and will sell in the world.    [Zabojnik] As a result of conversion, production was  completely phased out in the Slovak Republic. Will there not be  problems in reviving production?    [Sabol] The arms industry of the Slovak Republic is now  working at 8 percent of its capacity. We do not want the  industry to produce as much as before. However, we can produce  in order to meet the needs of our armies and the armies of  countries with similar equipment that needs to be renewed. The  modernization of equipment produced in the arms factories of the  former federation, the Soviet Union, and the Warsaw Pact  countries could become the second and a larger component of our  common interests. Each of these countries can carry out this  modernization using its own capacities, but full modernization  is not quite possible in that way. Purchasing expensive  technology from Western arms manufacturers may also be involved.  There also is a third possibility: We may reach agreement, and  everyone, according to his possibilities, will help to meet our  common needs. Now, the final problem is: To what extent are we  really able to revive and develop cooperation?    [Zabojnik] What did you learn at the recent IDET '94 arms  fair in Brno? It was possible to compare the products from both  republics there.    [Sabol] I saw both the Czech and jthe Slovak versions of the  modernized tank, and I spoke with experts from both countries.  If we agreed upon joint technological steps, it would certainly  lead to even better results and mutual benefit. Other countries  do not give up their own arms production, either. For example,  Switzerland is developing arms production that is more expensive  than possible purchases abroad. When I asked why they were  taking this course of action, they said: We keep the know-how  at home, the arms industry means the constant development of  technologies, and we provide jobs for our own people. This is  also a way for us, I believe.    [Zabojnik] The Slovak version of the modernized T-72 tank  has  met with a positive response from foreign experts. How are you  satisfied?    [Sabol] Some details can still be improved on ours as well  as  the Czech version. Jointly, we could get even further. I do not  imagine that the Czech side is thinking only about its own army,  but also wants, like ourselves, to assert itself abroad. This  means jobs for people at home and making our presence felt in  the world. We are also aware of the financial problems in some  countries that want to modernize economically but rationally.  This presents great opportunities to the producers in both  countries.     "

The Tehran Declaration,  which was approved in 1371 [year beginning 21 March 1992] by all  members, is the most important focus of the session. During the  Damascus conference, the latest developments concerning drug  smuggling in the Middle East and the way to confront poppy  cultivation and the laundering of money obtained from drug  trafficking will be discussed.    During the past decade the Middle East has witnessed an  increase in drug production, so much so that some countries in  the area have become major heroin and opium exporters. Pakistan  and Afghanistan are among the countries facing increasing  difficulties from an increase in poppy cultivation despite the  struggles by their police forces. In areas in Pakistan that are  far from the central government and outside the control of the  police force, drug smugglers are manufacturing and refining  narcotics in large laboratories. The existence of remote  mountainous regions in Pakistan and civil wars and conflicts in  Afghanistan for many years have paved the grounds for the growth  of drug trafficking groups and the conversion of wheat fields  into fields for the cultivation of narcotics.    Unfortunately, because of its location on the international  drug transit route from the Golden Crescent to Europe, Iran has  gained special importance in the Middle East for large drug  trafficking groups. Thus, the major problem that the Islamic  Republic of Iran is facing in its fight against the big drug  networks is, more than anything else, the problem of regional  smuggling that is carried out from outside its borders.  Smugglers enter the country primarily through the 1,400-km long  eastern border and attempt to transfer narcotics to Europe.    On this basis, in our country special programs have been  introduced, including the establishment of border observation  posts and roving and stationary bases, the creation of a  prohibitive zone in part of the border region, and ambush and  destruction operations, all of which have helped to destroy many  networks.    During recent years, because of more control on the eastern  border and increased field operations, large narcotics bands  have decided to alter their transit routes. Some from the  southern route have chosen Persian Gulf countries, while others  from the northern route have chosen Central Asian countries.  However, Iran continues to be considered the major route.    On this basis, efforts by law enforcement forces have  intensified and the number of narcotic finds are increasing each  year. For example, the quantity of narcotics found during the  past 11 months increased 25 tonnes from the same period last  year.    On the regional level, as a pivotal country in the Economic  Cooperation Organization [ECO], the Islamic Republic of Iran has  started new operations within its framework. In the future, a  memorandum of understanding is to be signed between Iran and  Pakistan, with UN cooperation, under which the control of drugs  in the region will be further facilitated and coordinated.    The Islamic Republic's efforts in the Middle East have led  to  praises by the UN secretary general's executive deputy in charge  of narcotics control and by the Interpol secretary general.  Iran is trying--through regional cooperation and by  intensifying the struggle at home--to create a healthier and  better society for the younger generation. Within this context,  the continuation of the struggle and a more serious approach in  implementing the law- enforcement forces' programs are of great  importance.     "

The  documents were signed by the two foreign ministers during a  ceremony attended by Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy  and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at Government  Palace.    The other cooperation agreements refer to the economy,  natural resources, the environment, health, the duty free  warehouse in Villeta, and tourism issues.    All these agreements were signed during the last visit  President Wasmosy made to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, some  months ago.    Stolen Vehicles    According to the agreement on the recovery of stolen  vehicles, the two countries promise a smooth exchange of  information between their respective police forces regarding the  owners of the vehicles, the reports of theft to the police, and  details of the stolen vehicles.    The accord also establishes the need for a document  certifying that the vehicle has not been reported as stolen and  listing the highways and checkpoints which the vehicle is  authorized to use.    Other preventive measures mentioned in the agreement refer  to  constant patrolling, checking of vehicles, and the establishment  of consultation offices in both countries in their respective  police stations.    Establishment of Grounds for the Construction of a Gas  Pipeline    The agreement for the supply of Bolivian natural gas to  Paraguay is partial, although of an ""indefinite duration"" and  for a volume yet to be determined.    The two countries have agreed to authorize the construction  and operation of a gas pipeline between the two countries, as  well as for the transportation of gas within their own  territories.    The purchase of gas will be made through operators who will  be in charge of the negotiations and of establishing the price,  deadlines, volume, and other pertinent details. Payments will  be made in dollars.    Economic Cooperation    The economic cooperation agreement is basically designed to  step up economic and commercial relations through the  elimination of non-tariff barriers on bilateral trade, and to  promote the expansion and diversification of trade between the  two countries.    Natural Resources    As for the agreement referring to natural resources and  environment, it provides for the exchange of technicians,  professors, and experts for the drafting of joint programs as  well as the exchange of information regarding methods and  techniques.    Tourism Cooperation    The tourism cooperation agreement, among other issues,  provides for regional and subregional integration, the  coordination of promotion events, the consolidation of  integrated tourism circuits, the identification and  consolidation of a land and river corridor between the two  countries, as well as the promotion of integrated tourist  circuits in the international markets.    Villeta Duty Free Warehouse    The two ministers also signed an agreement for the exchange  of reversal notes authorizing the rendering of services for  cargo in transit, for Bolivian cargo in transit and to the  Paraguayan market, and for Paraguayan cargo bound for Bolivia.  The Bolivian Government has offered the Paraguayan Government a  duty free warehouse and storage area in a site yet to be chosen,  under the same terms granted by Paraguay to Bolivia.    Health    The cooperation agreement in this field is designed to  establish an exchange of knowledge and experience, to step up  the training of human resources, establish an information  service on the activities held on the border areas, and adopt  regular notification mechanisms on illnesses that must be  reported.

The Russian Far East is made up of seven administrative  units, such as the Maritime Kray, the Sakhalin Oblast,  Khabarovsk Kray, and the Sakha Republic.    In this region are such resources as rich timber (30 percent  of the total for the former Soviet Union), aquatic products (40  percent), diamonds (98 percent), gold (50 percent), and tin (80  percent).    In terms of industrial structure, lumbering, nonferrous  metals, and fisheries make up 50 percent of the extractive and  manufacturing industries. Its secondary industries lag markedly,  with 80 percent of consumer goods and 50 percent of the food  brought in from other areas.    Efforts were made to develop defense industries in the  1930's; and the city of Komsomolsk-na-Amure became a center for  steel, petroleum refining, shipbuilding and aircraft industries.  Vladivostok provided supplies and repair as a base for the  Pacific Fleet.    Far Eastern Area in Era of Reform    In a speech in Vladivostok in July 1986, Secretary General  Gorbachev stressed that economic development of the Far Eastern  region was inseparable from the strengthening of economic  cooperation and trade relations with Asian nations.    Keenly sensing that if carrying out the ""Program for Far  East  Regional Development by 2000"" (August 1987) were to end in  failure each region, would require economic self-reliance,  Nakhodka, Sakhalin, and Vladivostok applied to the union in  1988-91 for conversion into free-economy zones. The Yakutia,  Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and Maritime regions are proclaiming  sovereignty over management and utilization of resources within  their areas. Also, in August 1990 they set up a Far East  Economic Association, taking up such matters common to each  state as energy, foodstuffs, construction, transportation, and  military-to-civilian conversion, and they plan to pull together.  One of this association's achievements was drawing up the May  1991 ""Concept for Solving the Far East Region's Crisis and  Economic Development by 2000""; but due to the coup of August  1991 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in December that year,  they did not get so far as to draw up an action program.    After that, based on a September 1992 presidential decree,  they deliberated on the ""Far East development program"" in light  of Russian and Far East conditions; and there are moves to try  to draw up the policies.    Economic Cooperation in the Far East    What actions might be needed for now to bring about further  development of economic cooperation?    1. Expansion of Trade Deals    With trade between Japan and Russia totaling $3.48 billion  in  1992, it has fallen to 57 percent of its peak. Likewise, imports  also were down 26 percent to $2.5 billion; but a majority of  that was foodstuffs, lumber, coal, etc., for which the Far East  is a producing area. Hence, the Russian Far East is unchanged in  being a supplier of raw materials. As disruptions in the  economic system are causing the import reductions, considerable  recovery of trade volume is possible by bringing about quality  guarantees and strict observance of delivery dates  (normalization of rail transport and port operations).    2. Effective Use of G-7 Economic Aid    Aid totaling $43.4 billion was set for 1993; but it is  necessary to place all possible emphasis on the Far East for the  portion that is bilateral aid, to quickly set up also the Far  East region's receiving facilities and to put into effect an aid  program for shifting to a market economy.    3. Assistance for Preparing Infrastructure    With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia lost 60  percent  of the port facilities, making the bolstering of its Far East  harbors an urgent task. Also called for are double-tracking of  Amur River bridges which are a bottleneck to Siberian rail  transport, electrification of some rail lines, and adding to and  rebuilding power generation facilities so as to improve the  energy balance. Since these items will be the basis for future  development of the Far East, is not the time upon us when we  must consider the methods for cooperation between Japan and  Russia?    4. Resource Development Projects    ""Siberian development"" in the 1970's gave birth to an era of  Japan-Soviet cooperation centering on coal, lumber, and harbors;  and pushed Japan-Soviet trade up sixfold over a 10-year period.  Areas for cooperation henceforth may center on energy,  especially oil and gas. For the present, it is important to  continue the forestry development and Sakhalin continental shelf  gas and oil exploitation projects that are ongoing and to get  them on track.    Also, the Republic of Korea is considering development of  Yakutia gas by tieing up with the Sakha Republic, and it has  particulars from joint Japan-U.S.-Soviet investigations  conducted in the 1970's. Furthermore, since Yakutia gas also is  positioned to be a major source in Russia's own Far East energy  development plan (the Vostok plan), the chances are high of its  becoming a project for multinational cooperation.    For other subsurface resources as well, the exploitation of  such metals as gold, tin, and lead, construction of iron mills  due to development of Aldan iron ore and copper smelters due to  development of the Udokan copper mines (Chita region), etc., may  become objects for study as future projects.    Pressing To Improve Japan-Russia relations    As discussed above, there are any number of subject areas  for  economic cooperation in Russia's Far East. The premises for that  are Russia's political and economic stabilization and clarifying  the authority of the center and local regions; but resolution of  the territories problem--a longstanding issue between Japan and  Russia, establishing neighborly relations by concluding a peace  treaty and resolving these by organically linking them with  economic cooperation are to be hoped for.    The cold war structure having collapsed, a situation has  emerged in which Japan, as one of the G-7 nations, will take on  a major role in aiding Russia. Russia's Far East has made  requests to the center for assistance; but those have not been  met. There has never been a time like the present when ""new  thinking"" has been so required of both Japan and Russia.     "

In  response to the collapse of the Coordinating Committee for  Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) at the end of March, MITI  has decided to introduce the system as part of the new export  control system for arms-related materials. The decision aims at  establishing a strict export control system by using the  expertise of exporting companies which are familiar with the  performance of export goods and the actual conditions of  importing companies. Since the importance of the  nonproliferation of nuclear and other weapons was pointed out at  the Tokyo summit (meeting of leaders of the seven industrialized  nations) last year, Japan has decided to internationally spell  out its new policy on export control with the Naples summit set  for July.    While exports of certain items are restricted under Japan's  current export control system, other goods are free to be  exported. On the other hand, the ""know control"" system, which  will be introduced, will designate countries subject to export  regulations, and will restrict exports of not only designated  items but also general-purpose goods.    Based on the new system, exporting companies will check the  possibility that even general-purpose goods may be transformed  into weapons in importing countries. If there is such a  possibility, companies will have to cancel the exports  voluntarily. Even if companies fail to find the possibility,  the government may take a view that exported products could be  transformed into weapons. In this case, the government will  urge companies to confirm the final purpose of use of export  goods in importing countries.    The ""know control"" system has already been introduced in the  United States, Germany, and Britain since 1991. The Japanese  system will be basically the same.    However, it is feared that, through the introduction of  these  measures, ""the government may force export companies to closely  investigate the actual situation of importing companies"" (as  stated by the MITI's International Trade Administration Bureau).  In order to minimize such a burden on exporting companies,  unlike the U.S. and European systems, the Japanese system will  set standards concerning the extent of companies' investigation  so that they can prove that they fulfilled their obligation to  study the possibility of their exported goods being transformed  into weapons.    Moreover, MITI intends to take measures not to discourage  companies' trade with countries subject to export regulations,  by excluding items that have nothing to do with the production  of weapons from the list for export control.    The United States and the other countries have introduced  the  ""know control"" system because regulations on items that could be  used for nuclear arms, biological and chemical weapons, and  missiles are insufficient in preventing arms proliferations.    Agricultural chemicals were used to make chemical weapons in  the 1984 Iran-Iraq war. As regional conflicts have intensified  with the years, it has become necessary to take measures to  prevent general-purpose goods from being transformed into  weapons. As a result, the ""know control"" system was worked out  in the United States and Europe. In Japan as well, the Security  Trade Control Panel of the Industrial Structure Council (an  advisory council to the MITI minister) submitted to MITI in June  of last year a report which recommended the establishment of an  export control system like those in the United States and  Europe. In response to this, MITI has been studying the idea.    While the United States is an advanced nation in the field  of  the ""know control"" system, there were demands in the U.S.  Congress for abolishing the system to lighten the burden on  companies. Therefore, MITI was watching the situation concerning  the system in the United States. However, now that the United  States is certain to continue the ""know control"" system, MITI  has made the final decision to introduce the system in Japan.     "

Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan, three neighboring provinces along  the middle reaches of the Yellow River, are now expanding their  cooperation in all aspects of economy, especially in transport,  energy and chemical industries, as well as agriculture.    The provinces share a triangle plain area, where the Yellow  River flows south and then turns east. Covering a total of  40,000 square kilometers, the triangle area has 30 countries and  cities with a population totalling 11 million.    Although they have been neighbors along the Yellow River,  the  provinces had never had any cooperation with one another,  because they had been under independent regional administrations  in China. Provinces and autonomous regions in different  administrational regions hardly cooperated in economy or culture  in the past.    It was not until 1986 that some departments of the State  Council initiated a plan for the three provinces to start  economic cooperation in the triangle area.    With further reforms and opening up, China has encouraged  regional cooperation across the country. So far dozens of  provinces and cities have expanded cooperation with their  neighbors.    The on-going cooperation involving the south-western  provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou has promoted the local  economies. The same is true for the cooperation schemes  embracing provinces and cities on the middle and lower reaches  of the Chang Jiang River and around Bohai Bay. They are now  playing a crucial role in the economy of the whole of China.    Given best opportunities for regional cooperation at the  time, the three neighbors along the Yellow River have worked out  a scheme together to promote their local economy, especially in  the triangle area.    Costing more than 100 million yuan, the Sanmenxia Bridge  across the Yellow River started to be used at the end of last  year. It now contributes much to the coal transport from  Shanxi, a province abundant in coal, to Henan where power energy  is in short supply.    In the past, coal was carried across the Yellow River by  ferry. An annual amount of only 600,000 tons of coal was  ferried. Passengers would wait two or three hours to queue up  for the ferry.    The 1,300-meter bridge has not only put an end to the ferry  between the two provinces across the Yellow River, but also  links up with a national highway leading from Hohhot City in  northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Beihai City  in south-west China's Guangxi Autonomous Region.    Another big bridge now being built across the Yellow River  in  the triangle area is expected to improve the traffic conditions  in the area after it is put into use this October.    The three provinces have technological cooperation as well  to  promote their major industries. A total of one billion yuan has  been invested in their industrial and agricultural projects.    Three thermal power plants with a total annual generating  capacity of six million kw have been set up in the provinces.  Large plants for aluminium, synthetic ammonia, phosphate  fertilizers and urea have been built as well.    The provinces have also upgraded their low-yield land and  land bordering the Yellow River.    Over the past decade, the trade between the cities and  counties in the triangle area has amounted to more than 300  million yuan.    The gross product of the region now is twice the 1985  figure,  and its general industry and agriculture product is 3.4 times  the figure of 1985.     "

The resolution will be  proposed to environment ministers of Asean during the sixth  ministerial meeting on the environment in Brunei's capital  tomorrow.    Representing Thailand will be Deputy Minister of Science,  Technology and Environment Pricha Musikun.    On the agenda are:    -- The Asean plan of action on the environment;    -- The launching of Asean Environment Year 1995;    -- The quality standards for air and river water; and    -- Regional cooperation for the management and control of  transboundary movements of hazardous wastes into and within the  region.    It was initially agreed that some significant framework and  guidelines be established under the Asean strategic plan of  action, the officials said.    ""The member countries are working to develop a common stand  on some international forums like the biodiversity and Basel  conventions,"" a Thai delegate said.    The strategy encompasses such issues as the implementation  of  the so-called Agenda 21, the development of policy directions  and the extension of operational and technical cooperation on  the environment. At the same time, there will be a study on the  implementation of the Asean Free Trade Area on the environment.    Senior officials endorsed the Asean Environment Year --  Asean  Green and Clean -- at the meeting.    Asean Environment Year, which is the initiative of Thailand,  aims to promote public awareness of environmental protection,  according to a Thai delegate. He said the year would be  officially inaugurated on January 1, with a wide range of  regional and national activities in each member country.  Promotion campaigns, however, will start this year.    He said most regional activities would be held in the form  of  seminars or workshops while national activities depended on  arrangements of individual countries. There will probably be a  study camp for young people or a trade fair and an exhibition on  green products. It was agreed member countries must achieve set  air and river water quality standards by 2010.    The standard for air in urban and industrialised areas must  be lower than 200 on the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), one  official said.    The quality standards for river water, were set as follows:  6.0-8.5 for pH, two milligrammes per litre of dissolved oxygen  or more, 10 milligrammes per litre of biochemical oxygen demand  (BOD) or less, and 200 milligrammes per litre of total suspended  solids (TSS) or less.    The officials also discussed a proposal of the Philippine  delegates that Asean adopt its own version of the Basel  Convention which regulates the management and control of  transboundary movement of hazardous wastes.    However, many delegates voiced disagreement with the idea.    ""Asean should adhere to the existing convention. Adopting a  new one is time consuming,"" they said.    One official said he thought the Basel Convention was  comprehensive enough in controlling the export of toxic wastes  from developed to developing countries. ""I don't think we need  another version."" He said the issue would be further discussed  at a meeting of the working group on the transboundary movement  of hazardous wastes which will be held in Bangkok next year.    Each country, he said, would work out its measures to deal  with the issue before next year's meeting. ""In fact, whether  the toxic wastes will be a problem depends on each country's  management and control system. The convention is just a broad  outline,"" he said.     "

Expanding the use of national research facilities can benefit  corporations.    The world is looking for international contributions such as  original research from Japan. Cooperation between the industrial  world, academia, and national laboratories is one element that  is lacking. A survey conducted by the Science and Technology  Agency pointed out the lack of progress in shared use of  advanced research equipment and facilities owned by government  laboratories. The needs of industry and academia which would  like more use of the advanced facilities at national  laboratories have increased. If plans are devised to maintain  the research environment to address this need, major  contributions would be made to the development of leading-edge  basic technologies along with the acceleration of basic  research. Revised plans based on these survey results must be  quickly reflected in policy.    Many of the latest facilities and human resources are needed  to advance the frontiers of basic technological development and  basic research required in the rapid development of society.  However, the facilities are expensive and too risky economically  and in terms of research for corporations to individually  acquire this equipment. If shared use is advanced in government  laboratories, in addition to preventing duplicate investments of  research funds, we could expect more activity in research  exchanges with the government laboratories, in effect, killing  two birds with one stone. However, the connection has only been  opened between university and government lab as in Tsukuba City  in Ibaraki prefecture.    According to the survey, the need for various types of high  performance analysis equipment and special test facilities has  increased. This is because they can be used as tools in a wide  range of research from basic to applied. Corporations, in  particular, wish to use non-destructive test equipment, wind  tunnels, earthquake-proof test equipment, while universities  would like to use radiation test equipment and accelerators.    According to a survey conducted around the beginning of July  by Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun Ltd. of leading corporations (189  responses received), the total amount of investment in research  and development for fiscal year 1993 was 6.3 trillion, a  3.1 billion increase over the previous year. Although the  investment in equipment has decreased significantly due to the  depressed economy, maintenance of RD funds at a high level  was  reported. RD funds, however, are only squeezed out of sales,  thus affect research and development for discovering the seeds  for future businesses given the protracted stagnation, and are  not connected to the provision of an uninterrupted research  environment. Neglecting the provision of research environment  misses the chance of launching new businesses or frustrates the  establishment of basic technology.    The objective is the shared use of government laboratory  facilities. The obstacles to joint research uncovered by the  Science and Technology Agency survey were access difficulty by  corporations, such as ""difficulty in finding research partners""  and ""not obtaining information on research themes,"" as well as  problems associated with handling the results, such as reverting  patents. Although solutions and obstacles were summarized, their  reflection in specific policies is the first manifestation of  the report's significance. Cooperation between industry,  academia, and government has already been established in the  Research Exchange Act and must be promoted in the current  stagnant economy. The fiscal year 1994 opening of the  large-scale radiation facility in Hyogo prefecture currently  under construction by the Science and Technology Agency is a  facility planned in the Act and the provision of research  environment for industry, academia, and government has been  decided.

0,FT911-4360 ,"FT911-4360 _AN-BDSBDAERFT 910419   FT  19 APR 91 / Iran returns Saddam to hate list after experiment with politeness      By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU   SADDAM Hussein has changed from a president into a wolf in the Iranian lexicon. The restrained politeness accorded to the Iraqi leader last year by Iran after he capitulated to Iran's main demands to end the Iran-Iraq war has been all but abandoned, signalling a return to the friction that traditionally characterises relations between the two. The careful neutrality that Iran nurtured while the American-led coalition was bombing Iraq has turned into scantily-veiled calls for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow. Last month, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani called on the Iraqi leadership to 'submit to the will of the people'. Tehran has diverted its attention from calls on the multinational forces to withdraw and allow countries of the regions to solve their own problems, to increasingly identifying President Saddam as the root of these problems. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, has called Saddam an incompetent ruler who brought ruin upon himself and his country through his Kuwait adventure, while Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary, has said that Saddam must be tried as a war criminal. The shift is a measure of the success of Mr Saddam Hussein's internal security forces in crushing internal unrest, staged mostly by the discontented Shia population in the south and the Sunni Kurds in the north. Iran was careful not to appear too supportive of the Iraqi opposition coalition - which includes the Shia groups - at the beginning of the uprising, but has been sorely disappointed that the chance to remove Mr Saddam is rapidly fading. For its part, unnerved by the revolts and anxious to blame them on a foreign enemy, Iraq has abandoned its own caution towards Iran, accusing it of fomenting trouble in the south by sending in saboteurs across the border - charges which Iran denies. However, Iran's news agency has been giving extensive coverage to the disturbances in Iraq, reporting successes which Baghdad claims are exaggerated. A new radio station, the Voice of the Islamic Republic in Iraq, began broadcasting material hostile to President Saddam, from its base in Iran less than four weeks ago. Tehran is also home to the main Shia opposition group, the Supreme Council of the Islamic Republic in Iraq, headed by Ayatollah Mohammad Baqr al-Hakim. Both countries have accused the other of violating the 1988 ceasefire agreement. In a move ominously reminiscent of the situation before Iraqi troops invaded Iran in September 1980, Iraq sent a letter of protest to Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary general, on Sunday, listing Iranian attacks on Iraqi positions on its side of the border. Iran has also firmly ruled out a return of Iraqi aircraft which flew to Iran during the height of US military operations. This week, Dr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, denied that Iran was holding 148 aircraft as Iraq maintained and said it only had 22 - a claim that has mystified Western military analysts, who also support the higher figure. Mr Hassan Ebrahim Habibi, the Iranian first vice-president, denied last month that Iran was considering holding on to the aircraft as war reparations. 'The damage inflicted on Iran during the eight-year war is so huge that a few second-hand and wrecked planes cannot compensate even one thousandth of it,' he said.

Pavel Grachev also told journalists that he would  immediately  inform the Armenian side of this decision and counted on mutual  understanding.    According to the Russian defense minister, during the talks  both sides also discussed some issues concerning putting under  Russian control of the Gabelin radar station which has great  importance for all Commonwealth countries. These issues will be  resolved at the inter-governmental level, the minister stressed.    It was almost impossible to foresee such an outcome of the  talks between the Russian defense minister and the head of the  Azeri Parliament. After all, the talks began from Pavel  Grachev's statement that the February 18 agreement on cease-fire  in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri conflict, reached between  defense minister of these two republics through the mediation of  the Russian minister was, to put it mildly, ignored, and did not  bring expected results.    At the same time, the minister said, Russia continues  intermediary efforts offering its version of cessation of the  armed conflict and transition to the elimination of its  consequences. According to Pavel Grachev, this version was  considered at the expert level at the end of March during a  meeting in Moscow with the participation of representatives of  the conflicting sides and, for the first time, the Minsk group  of Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).  The Russian defense minister also believes that this project  corresponds to the current situation, takes into account the  interests of both sides, and it is desirable that they consider  it. ""We think that this would allow to essentially advance in  the settlement of the conflict,"" Pavel Grachev noted.    As for the problems of functioning of the mechanism for  control over the implementation of the Russian initiatives, the  minister said, both sides should establish joint headquarters.    Before the cease-fire in the zone of the conflict the  minister proposes to check up controllability of all armed  units, first of all stationed on the line of contact.  Uncontrolled military units should be moved to the rear,  forcibly disarmed and disbanded.    After the cessation of fire, combat operations and  disengagement of forces, Pavel Grachev believes, it is necessary  to create a mutual security zone. Joint headquarters, if they  are set up, should establish control over both sides' actions  and set up observation posts. Control over the withdrawal of  forces will be carried out by observers from the Commonwealth  countries and the Conference for Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE).    According to Pavel Grachev, he proposed to the Azeri side to  bring Russian troops to the line of contact and agreed that  these must be military units not stationed in Armenia. The  disengagement will be carried out stage-by-stage.    In accordance with the russian plan of the settlement of the  conflict, Armenian armed units must liberate all earlier seized  Azeri territories and return to Nagorno-Karabakh. If both sides  agree this region of Azerbaijan will be controlled by Russian  troops and international observers.    Pavel Grachev made great efforts to convince Rasul Guliyev  and parliamentarians accompanying him that the Russian plan of  the settlement of the problem is realistic, dispel their doubts  about the appearance of a new wave of refugees after the  withdrawal of the Azeri Army from the present positions, a  confidential source told ITAR-TASS.

WILLIAMS Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER      DUBAI, United Arab Emirates      Two weeks after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, war jitters have eased but not  disappeared in the oil sheikdoms on the Persian Gulf.    In the United Arab Emirates, major developments heard on radio newscasts are  passed quickly into the streets. Cab drivers give passengers the latest word.  In Qatar and Bahrain, travelers say, the anxiety appears to be higher.    But in all three countries, the initial shock has passed, commerce continues  and cautious regimes are working hard to tamp down rumors and build confidence.    In the first 10 days of the crisis, Arab and foreign communities alike were  caught up in nervous uncertainty, despite a steady flow of assurances.    Sheik Mohammed ibn Rashid, the Emirates' defense minister, said in a statement  that appeared on the front page of local newspapers that today's fast-moving  events are ""incidental and transitory."" The people of the Emirates, Arab and  expatriate, ""will remain bound together . . . in good times and bad,"" he said,  in an ""oasis of security, love and peace.""    Rashid's optimistic rhetoric came on the heels of advisories last week from  Washington, London and other capitals that foreigners should consider leaving  the gulf region. The Soviet government said Wednesday that it will begin  evacuating women and children among its nationals in Iraq.    Regional banks reported increased withdrawals by foreign depositors, and travel  agencies were bombarded with requests for bookings on outbound flights.    Anxiety over the rising military confrontation along the Saudi-Kuwaiti frontier  threatened to shred the alliance of Arabs and expatriates that built the oil  fortunes of the gulf states in the 1970s and '80s. Editorialists pointed  fingers at a few foreign managers who reportedly packed up their families and  left suddenly for holidays at home.    But the feared mass flight of expatriates has not taken place, according to  airline officials. Planes are overbooked but are leaving with empty seats.    ""Passengers tend to be overcautious,"" said K. B. N. Nair, airport manager here  for Air India. ""There are cases of travelers making a series of bookings on  different days on different airlines. These create an artificial situation.""    Nevertheless, anxiety continues, and its ups and downs can be measured in  economic terms. For example:    Insurance rates for shipping in the gulf have risen, as they did during the  tense years of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War. Underwriters have raised rates for  general shipping and added a premium for vessels planning to call at ports in  Iraq or Kuwait. During the 1980s war, when there was open conflict in the gulf,  insurers lost more than $1 billion. One life insurance company in Dubai this  week reported 75 callers in one day asking whether their policies covered war  risks.    The invasion of Kuwait touched off a brief rise in food prices. Government  declarations that stocks were sufficient eased concerns, however, and the price  of a 40-pound sack of rice fell from about $80 on the weekend to $64 at  midweek. Government and consumer spokesmen accused traders of taking advantage  of nervous shoppers.    Acting on an alert from currency officials in Qatar, banks and  currency-exchange shops were warned about the sudden appearance of counterfeit  American bank notes in the region. In the days immediately after the Iraqi  invasion, many sought to change their local currency for dollars, their fears  spurred by the overnight collapse of the Kuwaiti dinar.    In Dubai, where the economy is buoyed by oil but focused on trade, newspapers  list on their front pages the exchange rates for a variety of foreign  currencies, along with the price of commodities, shares on foreign exchanges  and gold jewelry, a popular form of investment among Arabs and foreign workers.

Vladislav Kozyakov examines these two events and he writes:    It can safely be predicted that the talks between the  presidents of Russia and the United States, Boris Yeltsin and  Bill Clinton, will be influenced to a very large extent by what  happens in the two preceding days in the Belgian capital.    Russia is worried about information that Western leaders are  looking into requests by a number of East European countries for  membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On  Wednesday, an official reaction to this issue was made known by  the publication of a statement by a presidential press  secretary. The Russian president warned that an expansion of  NATO might lead to a military-political destabilization in key  regions of the world.    True, Washington says it does not intend at present to  support the admission of new members into the alliance. At this  stage, in place of full membership, America is offering the  concept of Partnership for Peace to the newly independent states  of Eastern Europe.    However, this American concept needs further clarification.  It has not been fine-tuned, so to speak, and details have not  been agreed between NATO's members.    The temporary character of the Partnership for Peace also  deserves some attention. After a period, according to this  American concept, all countries wishing to join NATO will be  admitted.    It's paradoxical that in the changing cirsumstances of the  present world, it's precisely NATO that is involved in  generating a feeling of apprehension in Europe. In its time the  establishment of this military bloc drew a corresponding  response and led to the establishment of the Warsaw Pact. Then  followed decades of confrontation. Now at the end of the Cold  War, when NATO has no Warsaw Pact to contend with, it's causing  anxiety with its prospects of an expansion of its membership and  drawing closer to the Russian borders.    The question arises, Why should the stereotypes of bloc  mentality be kept alive in Europe. If Partnership for Peace  intends to establish a system of security in Europe, Russia  including, then why must this system be based on a military  organization of Western Europe.    This question becomes more relevant as a new actual system  is  already in existence. It's the Council for North Atlantic  Cooperation, in whose ranks are NATO members as well as  countries in the former Warsaw Pact.    Why should not the Partnership for Peace see as its final  objective not admission of new members into NATO but the  creation of an all-embracing collective security in Europe and  in the space from Vancouver to Vladivostok, developing for this  project the North Atlantic Cooperation Council? This would be  quite in the spirit of the Council for Security and Cooperation  in Europe.    In Moscow there is support for the American concept of  Partnership for Peace. However, this idea must not be a  prisoner of the bloc mentality. It must take into account the  security interests of all governments without exception.  Partnership for Peace should orientate itself to the creation  of a new mechanism for the provision of security for Europe and  the world.    The new time and the new situation in Europe demands a fresh  untried approach to the problem of cementing peace and the  development of cooperation. To act from a bloc position in this  new era would be at least unrealistic.     "

By OSWALD JOHNSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The Energy Department said Monday that the world will have adequate oil  supplies even if the Persian Gulf crisis escalates into a shooting war with  Iraq.    Energy Secretary James D. Watkins made the assessment at a luncheon session  with reporters, noting that the oil supplies lost as a result of the worldwide  trade embargo against Iraq will be made up -- mainly through stepped-up  production by Saudi Arabia -- by the end of this month.    Watkins, a retired Navy admiral, also expressed confidence that U.S. and allied  forces would be able to defend Saudi oil fields and keep gulf shipping lanes  open to tankers even if the allies begin military action against Iraq.    The only reason oil prices are about 50% above July levels is the fear that  Saudi oil fields would be destroyed in the event of war, Watkins said. But he  asserted that the threat ""is not credible. . . . That's why we're over there --  to protect Saudi Arabia,"" he said.    Watkins warned that some of the panic in oil markets -- which on Monday helped  push oil prices up to more than $33 a barrel -- amounts to a ""self-fulfilling  prophecy"" that simply is ""not justified.""    ""We (the U.S. and allied land forces arrayed in the Saudi desert and the naval  forces in Persian Gulf waters) control gulf shipping, and we control the  defense of Saudi Arabia,"" he said.    The energy secretary also cast doubt on predictions that oil prices could reach  $100 a barrel if war breaks out. ""We've already lost Iraq and Kuwait,"" he said.  ""What's next? Only Saudi Arabia and Iran, and we've been through that already""  during the Iran-Iraq War.    Watkins, whose department also oversees U.S. nuclear weapons management,  declined even to guess at how soon Iraq might be able to produce its own  nuclear weapons. But he warned that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is ""very  serious about getting that capability.""    Watkins said that Iraq's Osirak reactor, which was destroyed by Israel in a  preemptive bombing strike in 1981, is now surrounded by what Watkins described  as a ""100-foot-high berm"" -- presumably to protect it from future attacks  should it ever come back on line. Of Iraq's potential nuclear capability, the  energy secretary declared:    ""There's no question that's what they want and that's what they're going to  get. They are in striking range of achieving that objective.""    Watkins also expressed concern that the Soviet Union, which is the world's  largest crude-oil extractor, is steadily losing production capacity. Soviet oil  production is expected to decline to 10.5 million barrels a day next year from  about 11 million this year.    He said the United States is actively considering ways to help the Soviets step  up their production by modernizing their facilities and upgrading their  management techniques. ""This is very disturbing to us,"" he said of the Soviet  trend.    Watkins also confirmed reports that the Administration is nearing a series of  critical decisions on a long-awaited proposal for a long-term energy policy.  But he said that it is unlikely to be unveiled until sometime in January or  February.    The energy secretary said President Bush would be presented with a package of  about 60 option papers early next month and that he would hammer out his own  program from those recommendations.    He said the program would cover many areas, including production incentives,  expanded use of nuclear power, safe waste disposal, intensified energy  conservation and a menu of environmental issues such as reducing America's  reliance on fossil fuels.    Watkins expressed skepticism about reports that Hussein will allow officials of  the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect Iraqi nuclear sites this  year, despite his nation's obligations under the international  non-proliferation treaty.    He argued that only unannounced spot-checks, rather than scheduled visits,  could be effective in the case of Iraq.

The tanker TNT 5 filled with radioactive  water is still moored at Zvezda in Bolshoy Kamen. Furthermore,  the condition of the vessel is such that there is no guarantee  the death-dealing contents will not spill out into the bay in  the near future. This would be an ecological catastrophe.  [video shows a nuclear submarine in dry dock, a rusty  tanker, a person testing radioactivity in the presence of a  naval officer, and a group of people inspecting the tanker]    Until recently, the liquid radioactive waste was simply  poured into the sea. Now, thanks to the active protests of the  world community, such dumping is forbidden. What are weto do?  The Japanese Government is offering to help us solve this  problem. Representatives of the neighboring states arrived in  the Maritime Kray, and together with our government  representatives and specialists they visited Bolshoy Kamen,  after which they held a meeting at the kray administration.  However, this conference gave rise to a strange feeling. The  sensation was that the terrible misfortune hanging over the  Maritime Kray concerns the Japanese Government far more than the  Russian Government. The Japanese say they are prepared to try  various approaches, allocate millions of dollars, and build and  assemble installations to process the radioactive waste.  However, they need assurances. Where, when, and what will be  the degree of Russian participation? From Russia there is only  incomprehensible haggling and no assurances. [video shows  a meeting of Japanese and Russian officials, then cuts to show  Litus interviewing Ye.I. Nazdratenko, leader of the Maritime  Kray administration]    [Begin Nazdratenko recording] You know very well  that the people of the Maritime Kray have voted overwhelmingly  for the new Constitution. They set a Russian Federation record;  72 percent of Maritime Kray voters cast a ballot. No other part  of the country did that. Maritime Kray once again proved its  maturity and citizenship. Maritime Kray residents once again  underscored that there should be integrity in Russia as stated  in the Constitution. The representatives of the federal  authorities here today said: you are here, it is your problem  and you have to solve it. I get the impression that the  Maritime Kray residents are like a dog which is kind and devoted  to its master. No matter how much the master abuses,  humiliates, or hurts it, this dog always crawls back to its  master. It crawls and crawls to prove its devotion to the  master. The master, who is in an inexplicable state at that  moment, simply kicks it in the face with his boot and pushes it  away, saying I do not want you, so go away. The situation here  strongly reminds me of this analogy. Just look for yourself!  The problems here are your problems, they keep saying.    At the same time, they have weighed us down with customs  duties, tariffs, and all kinds of conditions on maritime  operations. Here we have to implement the state system, laws,  and all the rest of it. This worries me very much and makes me  guarded, although naturally we will continue to fight for  Russian integrity and unity. I am for one president and one  political authority in the Russian Federation, and that all  territories should have completely equal rights as subjects of  the federation in accordance with the Constitution. Presently  this is not happening at all. [end Nazdratenko  recording]     "

The General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT) was signed by 114 nations on 15 December.  Following that the Islamic Republic of Iran's membership in GATT  has been seriously considered by our nation's policymakers and  officials. Conflicting views and explanations have been  presented on this matter. Firuz Dowlatabadi, the Foreign  Ministry's economic adviser and chief of its Office of Economic  and Strategic Coordination, gave an interview to our  correspondent in which he presented his views on this matter,  the details of which are presented for you below:    The foreign minister's economic adviser discussed the  effects  and consequences of joining GATT. He said: International  economic organizations cannot actually be evaluated on the basis  of whether joining them has benefits or disadvantages.    International organizations, especially international  economic organizations, are formed on the basis of a win-win  strategy. Therefore, consensus is a principle in these  organizations, and without a consensus their decisions are not  implemented.    Dowlatabadi said: Membership in these organizations  basically  faces the profitability of the economic system of each country,  and Iran will not be harmed by joining these organizations in  the way that is being mentioned. However, one must assess the  level of relative advantages in Iran and other nations of our  country's steadfastness and determination and the level of the  relative advantages that are in general unavailable to us and  are available to the other member nations.    What will the future of their behavior be towards us in  accordance with the government's policies, whether financial,  monetary, foreign exchange or in commercial policy, and how far  behind are we in this matter, or how far ahead of them are we?    The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and  Strategic Cooperation emphasized: This kind of assesment is the  basis for our estimate of the benefits or disadvantages to GATT  membership. It is really improper for us to ask whether we will  profit or lose by joining GATT, or to ask in what areas we will  profit and in what areas we will lose.    He said: Because our assessment of GATT membership has been  mistaken, despite the fact that the question of joining GATT has  been under discussion continuously for almost 20 years (since  the time before the revolution), no suitable conclusion has been  reached.    The foreign minister's economic adviser noted: In  international relations, if a country has the power to provide  expert counsel and if it has more political and economic  capacity, due to the fact that it has more factors for limiting  trade, it will in turn make more profit.    He noted: One reason we have not gotten the necessary  prerogatives to match the nation's political capacity in  economic negotiations is our weak foundation of expert knowledge  (consultative). Our expert system does not have the necessary  capacity. Because negotiations do not take place at the level of  ministers, deputy ministers or general managers, the weakness of  expert knowledge has kept us from having the power to do the  necessary bargaining, and has prevented us from having the  ability to make use of negotiations.    The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and  Strategic Cooperation added: Of course, GATT membership cannot  be proposed as a means of overcoming this deficiency, but to  compensate for this problem an acceptable level of privileges  must be designated for the experts who participate in the  negotiations, and they must not be allowed to depart from this  framework.    He said: During the process of joining, very close and  active  cooperation must exist between the legislative and executive  powers. With support from the law makers we can make the process  of joining GATT lawful.    The foreign minister's economic adviser was asked whether  there are obstacles to GATT membership in the Constitution. He  said: There is no obstacle to GATT membership in the  Constitution. Of course, support for some goods is provided in  the Constitution and prohibitions are given on imports of some  goods, and in this regard it is necessary to have cooperation  between the legislative and executive powers.    For example, the level of the Majles's willingness to  support  industries in this year's budget law was such that the Majles  added 10 percent to the taxes on imported vehicles.    He added: We will not be able to do this at this rate in the  budget law if we join GATT, and if we join GATT any increase in  tariffs will have to be done through negotiations with other  members.    Dowlatabadi was asked whether aggressor foreign countries  would become active in our country's banking and service affairs  in the event of our GATT membership. He said: If we become a  member, foreign banks will not necessarily become active in our  country. There are many countries, such as Pakistan and  Malaysia, where foreign banks cannot operate despite the fact  that those countries are GATT members.    He emphasized: There are provisions in GATT that allow that  in countries where there are legal obstacles negotiations will  be held and they will be made exceptions to the list of  provisions in the agreement.    The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and  Strategic Cooperation discussed the short-term and long-term  effects of GATT membership. He said: Basically, the process of  acquiring GATT membership is not a short-term process. It takes  at least five years. There can, therefore, be no short-term  analysis of this subject. This certainly has to do with our  long-term behavior.    Continuing, he added: In my view, our country will  definitely  profit from GATT membership and there will be no loss in the  event we join.    Dowlatabadi discussed the formation of a national committee  to study Iran's membership in GATT. He said: I recommend that a  group from the Majles become members of this committee and that  the request for Iran's membership in GATT be pursued rapidly.  The members of the expert negotiation team must be selected.  Iran's strategy for GATT membership must be specified,  especially in areas that have to do with our newly established  support system for exports, production and industries, and it  must be given to the expert team so they will know on the basis  of which items to pursue negotiations. More important is that  there must be continuous and active cooperation between the  legislative and executive powers for the study of GATT  membership.    He emphasized: That illogical fear among policymakers and  that illogical question concerning the profits and losses of  GATT membership must be cleared from the minds of policymakers,  and the process of GATT membership must be seriously pursued.    Dowlatabadi was asked whether we should take fundamental  steps in the nation's economy and then become a member of GATT,  or whether we could join it under current circumstances. He  said: Joining GATT is not dependent on any circumstances.  Nations are members of this organization with the strongest and  the weakest economic foundations. The economic structure of a  nation is not something that can be strengthened in the short  term.    He was asked, in view of the fact that our country is mainly  an importer of agricultural products and that our only export is  oil, which is not related to GATT issues, and that in a few  years the nation's import tariffs would have to be lowered and  the payment of subsidies would gradually have to be stopped,  whether joining would damage the nation's economy. He said: Our  system of tariffs is not efficient, and our tariffs in the  agricultural sector are quite low, even lower than GATT. At the  same time, in other countries the existing tariff percentage is  efficient and effective, and a decrease of several percentage  points will have a great effect on the nation's economy, while  this is not the case in our economy. Most of the tariff  pressures are on the government itself. If we become a member of  GATT we will be able to give greater support to the agricultural  sector.    He added: There is also a 10- to 15-year period allowed to  reduce subsidies. In this regard it is much better for our  economic system to be put under pressure and to bring itself to  the designated stage by that time.    The Foreign Ministry's economic adviser emphasized: There is  no problem regarding the reduction of tariffs in Iran. Tariffs  are no problem in our economic system. Even in a nontariff  system, our nontariff supports are quite low compared to  international members.    The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and  Strategic Coordination discussed the effects of this agreement  on regional economic pacts such as ECO [Economic Cooperation  Organization]. He said: GATT includes an exception for regional  cooperation. These regional cooperation pacts can exist with any  kind of preferential tariff. Therefore, there is no obstacle in  this and it encourages GATT at the outset. At the same time our  economic activity has not yet taken efficient shape in ECO or  any other framework in which it is felt that GATT might be  harmful.    Dowlatabadi was asked whether the fact that America and the  Zionist regime are GATT members with most-favored nation status  might bring about the creation of relations with them. He said:  In the preliminary negotiations one can make some countries  exceptions to economic relations, and the membership of these  two nations is no obstacle to joining GATT.     "

[Spring] I would characterize them as being very good, even  excellent. I fully agree with my colleague, Russian Minister of  Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, who said that the Declaration on  Principles of Relations Between Ireland and Russia, which was  signed in December of last year in Dublin, has not remained  merely as an expression of our good intentions. Rather, it has  become an important starting point for further specific work.  During the visit by the Irish delegation to Moscow, we concluded  an inter-governmental agreement on avoiding dual taxation  between Russia and Ireland. This is very important for expanding  our business ties, and especially trade. Despite its small size,  in volume of trade with Russia Ireland has surpassed all the  countries of the African continent combined. The trade turnover  has grown most significantly during the past year--by  approximately 7-8 times. Moreover, this has been due to Russian  export.    We are very proud of the achievements of Irish business in  your country. The ""Irish House"" on the Arbat, the ""Duty Free""  stores in the airports and hotels of Moscow and St. Petersburg,  the ""Garden Ring"" chain of Moscow supermarkets and other joint  Russian-Irish enterprises are operating and have won popularity  among Moscow residents. And, most importantly, Irish businessmen  have an optimistic outlook and are ready to expand their  activity in Russia. Thus, at the end of May the ""Eire Rianta""  company, together with its Russian partners, is opening one of  the largest trade centers in the capital, the ""Valday Center,""  next to the ""Irish House.""    [Correspondent] Can you name specific new projects of  economic cooperation between Russia and Ireland within the  framework of inter-state agreements?    [Spring] We are planning to step up our cooperation with  Russia on the program of technical aid by the EC [European  Communities] to the CIS country--TASIS [not further expanded],  in which Irish consultants and experts are already actively  engaged today. First of all, this concerns the development and  modernization of such sectors of the Russian economy as  management, banking, the food sector, municipal management and  the sphere of services.    During our meeting with Russian Vice Prime Minister Yuriy  Yarov, he told of the steps which Russia was taking to enter  GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], and we offered  our expert assistance. I believe this offer will be accepted.    [Correspondent] What are the political results of your visit  to Moscow?    [Spring] Although our countries are located at opposite ends  of the European continent, the positions of Russia and Ireland  are very close on a broad circle of international problems. In  the course of negotiations with Andrey Kozyrev, with whom, I  might add, I also have good personal relations, we tried to  strengthen the existing mutual understanding. In our opinion,  Russian will play a very important and constructive role in the  future of the European continent and, as I understand from the  remarks of Mr. Kozyrev, Russia intends to do this specifically  through peaceful regulation of conflicts, economic cooperation  and active participation in the work of the CSCE [Council for  Security and Cooperation in Europe], which we, naturally,  support in every way.    [Correspondent] Upon completion of the negotiations in  Moscow, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs thanked Ireland  for its help in finalizing preparation of the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation Between Russia and the European  Union. Of what, specifically, did this help consist?    [Spring] I believe that I will not be committing a sin  against the truth if I say that, in regard to this agreement,  Ireland took a very active position within the framework of the  European Union. We understand its great importance from a  political and economic standpoint, primarily for stability in  Europe. We worked very actively in the Council of Ministers of  the EC and KEC [not further expanded], striving to conclude this  agreement. Now, we are hoping that its signing is just a  question of a few weeks.    Of course, we should not exaggerate the role which little  Ireland is capable of playing in international affairs. But, as  a participant country in the European Union, where the rule of  consensus is in effect during voting, we are sure that our voice  will be heard at the decision-making table, and that we can make  our contribution to achieving general accord and mutual  understanding.    [Correspondent] The chairman of the Russian government,  Viktor Chernomyrdin, recently announced Russia's intention to  enter the European Union. What can you say in this regard as a  representative of a EC participant country?    [Spring] I believe that this is an interesting proposal. At  the present time, a process of consolidation, or strengthening,  is taking place in the European Union. We are hoping that in  January of 1995 there will be an expansion of the EC--it will be  joined by Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Then, a period of  consolidation will inevitably follow once again. Of course, we  are conducting negotiations on acceptance with the countries of  the Vyshegradskiy group and other East European countries. If we  speak of the long-term prospects, then, when the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation with the Russian Federation is  signed, then, based on it and having normal trade relations, we  will be able to increase our ties. And after an appropriate  interval of time we will make the decision as to subsequent  steps.    [Correspondent] Considering the sad experience of the  religious-ethnic conflict in Ulster, do you believe that the  European states will be able to regulate the conflict in Bosnia  and other inter-ethnic conflicts on the continent?    [Spring] I believe that today there are sufficient grounds  to  believe that the partnership between the EC, Russia, the United  SA and the UN will bring the desired peace to the former  Yugoslavia. Ireland was one of the first to support President  Boris Yeltsin's proposal on holding talks on Bosnia at the  highest level with the participation of these four parties. It  is important to sit down at the negotiating table as soon as  possible. When a direct discussion of the problem begins, it  will not be too difficult to reach a general international  position.

As We Improve  Relations With the North Atlantic Alliance, May We Not Damage  Them With China""]    [Text] To this day, mutual relations between Russia and the  North Atlantic alliance have not been conceptually substantiated  by either side. Two significant questions are being left out of  the scope of all discussions of this topic underway in Russia:  the key historic task Moscow is now facing and Russian interests  in Asia. The issue of whether Russia will join NATO or not may  also be resolved once answers to these questions have been set  forth.    It is obvious that it is necessary to overcome, as soon as  possible, the state of a humiliated great power with a  dilapidated economy and a disfigured national self-awareness.  The main historic task follows from this--to turn within a short  period of time into a great multinational democratic state with  a market economy which has a worthy position in the world.    The strategy of blending into the world economy should be  implemented in the areas where this runs into the least  resistance and begets the greatest cooperation. In other words,  centers of economic power which, for objective reasons, are  interested in the least discriminatory cooperation with Russia  are its natural partners in the outside world. Geographical  neighbors who, proceeding from considerations of their own  security, are interested in the preservation of at least a  stable Russia may be classified as such.    Taking into account the Eurasian affiliation of our country,  it is easy to understand that in the European area, all of the  above refers primarily to the European Union and its core of  integration, France and Germany. In the Asian area, it is  primarily China which is quickly growing into an economic giant.    Therefore, a simultaneous and parallel, primarily economic  rapprochement with both West Europe and China should form the  foundation of a foreign policy strategy.    It will become clear that there is no alternative to  friendly  relations with our Asian neighbor if we take into account that  Russia has the longest land border with China, that China is a  state with a population of 1 billion, and that it has nuclear  potential. It may be said without exaggeration that now that the  threat of a nuclear world war has disappeared, relations between  Russia and China are more important than relations with the  United States from the point of view of ensuring Russia's  security.    The role of China in ensuring Russian interests associated  with economic security is also great. The Chinese leadership is  striving to modernize its armed forces. At present, when many  defense enterprises in Russia are on the brink of economic  demise, even insignificant purchases of armaments by China and  military-technical cooperation with it are helping the survival  of our plants, which concentrate the elite of the  scientific-technical intelligentsia and workers, along with  unique high technology and experience.    Without a doubt, the possible admission to NATO will deal a  blow to the good-neighbor relations between Russia and China. We  would like to recall that a joint Russian-Chinese declaration  signed during the visit by President Yeltsin to China in  December 1992 said directly that the sides undertook to refrain  from participation in military-political alliances aimed against  one another. The Chinese will most likely view Russia's  membership in NATO as a direct violation of these agreements, as  a powerful association of European nations against Asian nations.    It is also beyond a doubt that, reacting to Russia's  membership in NATO, China will take measures in response--it  will begin to wind down economic cooperation and will boost the  military budget and the strength of Chinese troops concentrated  at the Russian-Chinese border.    Therefore the proposal concerning possible NATO membership  for Russia, lucrative at first sight, actually brings about a  perceptible deterioration in its security conditions in Asia,  complications in the course of economic reforms, and  restrictions on independence in foreign policy. Russia's  membership in NATO is not in line with its strategic interests.  However, this is not at all to say that Russia should give up  cooperation with NATO in the course of ensuring European  security.    Certain frictions and contradictions, including territorial  disputes, exist between the former socialist countries of  Central and East Europe. The possibility of armed conflicts  developing between them, i.e., in the vicinity of Russia's  western borders, cannot be ruled out. It is impossible to do  without drawing NATO and Russia into the settlement of these  conflicts. This is why care should be taken in advance to create  a mechanism for interaction between Russia and the alliance,  possibly through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe. Conflicts should be settled under the mandates of the  United Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe, with both NATO and Russia being brought in.  Participation of other CIS member states is also possible. In  the process, Russia should act as a partner of NATO on an equal  footing rather than a member, with not only the peacemaking  forces but their command being joint. The American Partnership  for Peace program lays a foundation for this.    As far as security guarantees to the former socialist  countries in Europe are concerned, Russia should encourage their  rapprochement with the European Union and the Western European  Union--the defense structure of West Europe. In the process  Russia should firmly argue for its negative attitude toward  their possible admission to NATO. This approach will gain  support from Europists, i.e. proponents of restoring the  erstwhile role of Europe as the center of world civilization,  the leadership of the European Union and the Western European  Union, and Germany. This approach will ensure the much-desired  Western security guarantees for former socialist countries.    The signing of a treaty on partnership and cooperation  between Russia and the European Union which is planned for this  year and its implementation will dispel apprehensions existing  here with regard to the possible isolation of Russia from the  West. On the other hand, with this strategy in the Western area,  freedom of actions in Asia is retained in full, in particular,  an opportunity to maintain good-neighbor relations with China.    In turn, the transformation of the Conference on Security  and  Cooperation in Europe from an amorphous forum into a strong  international organization, with its own Security Council and  peacemaking forces capable of preventing and extinguishing armed  conflicts quickly, should become the main avenue for creating a  common European security system.

0,FT922-6361 ,"FT922-6361 _AN-CEZASAAMFT 920526   FT  26 MAY 92 / Kurdish vote leads to show of unity: Political leaders bargained over post-election deals      By GARETH SMYTH      DAHUK   IRAQI KURDISTAN'S first free elections reached almost farcical levels even before the ballot papers were counted. It was never going to be perfect. There was no electoral register - hence the importance of marking-ink to prevent people voting more than once - because of the dislocation of Iraqi society. The Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88 was fought partly on Kurdish soil and culminated in the Iraqi government's use of chemical weapons against Peshmerga guerrillas and civilians. Thousands of villages were razed and perhaps as many as 180,000 civilians 'disappeared' in the late 1980s during a pogrom by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Then in 1991 thousands of Kurds fled to the mountains as Saddam regained strength after being driven out of Kuwait by the western allies. Against this backdrop, widows, orphans, refugee families and Kalashnikov-bearing guerrillas queued on May 19 to place their mark on ballot papers bearing the coloured flags of the Kurdish parties. Between the close of polling at midnight and the broadcast outcome on Friday, politicians bargained over post-election deals in return for accepting the propriety of the poll. Occasionally they called in judge Amier Hawesy, a stern-faced relic from the days of rule from Baghdad and now the 'neutral' head of the electoral commission. When he gave reporters the figures for seats in the new assembly, he was genuinely surprised to be asked for numbers of votes. The Kurds voted against Saddam and for peace. It was less important that Mr Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan Democatic party (KDP) was eventually put at 45.4 per cent and Mr Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) at 43.9 per cent in the assembly elections - or that Mr Barzani was ahead by a slightly larger margin in an election for president, which failed to achieve a definite outcome as no-one reached 50 per cent. The KDP forfeited a two-seat lead over the PUK, giving away one seat to its rival to make them level. The need for unity was greater than the desire for victory. Even the small parties, none of which reached the 7 per cent threshold for representation, would be included in the assembly's executive. Emerging arm-in-arm from the crucial summit at Shaklawa on Friday, Mr Barzani and Mr Talabani verged on the theatrical. But the ostensible political differences between the KDP's 'autonomy' and the PUK's 'self-determination with Iraq' were exaggerated for election purposes. There is a shared appreciation of the considerable problems facing the new administration created to fill the vacuum left by Mr Saddam's withdrawal from the region. Inflation has been rampant. A day's work in the fields is needed to buy a kilo of rice or a can of Turkish beer; two weeks' work will buy a pair of good shoes. While basic requirements filter through the UN embargo on Iraq and the Iraqi embargo on Kurdistan, there are widespread shortages. Saddam has a 100,000-strong army just south of Kurdish-held territory. The debris of burnt-out Iraqi heavy armour littering the road north of Salahuddin is evidence of guerrilla prowess with anti-tank weapons, but defence against helicopter gunships would rely on the allied air cover operating north of the 36th parallel from the Incerlik Nato base in south-east Turkey. An autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan is land-locked and without regional allies. The Kurdish leadership eagerly seizes on any hint that the US, Turkey or Iran are becoming more supportive. As the election fuels Kurdish aspirations in Turkey and Iran, KDP and PUK leaders are expected to attend next month's Vienna conference of the various Iraqi opposition groupings: this, they hope, will please the US.

Debski; place and date not  given: ""Kaliningrad--A Special Town""]    [Text] [Debski] Cooperation between Kaliningrad Oblast  and Polish voivodships located near the border is most commonly  associated with two ""roundtables"" and several seminars  concerning this topic. However, are there any concrete results  of those discussions?    [Matochkin] We believe that ""roundtables"" are a good  organizational form of keeping up cooperation in our region.  They were necessary at the beginning of our cooperation--they  created conditions for its foundation. The most important  matter is the fact that both entrepreneurs and politicians have  already been participating in talks at those tables; they have  shared the necessary information with each other.    [Debski] More specifically, could you tell us how many joint  Polish-Russian companies there are in the oblast and what the  size of Polish investment there is?    [Matochkin] Twenty-eight percent of the trade is with  Poland. We have 742 joint-venture companies; the largest portion  of them, 275, are joint-venture firms with Polish companies.    You are also in a good position as far as investment is  concerned; you occupy the second position, close behind the  Germans, whose financial possibilities are certainly much  greater, and we understand this. For us, Poland is attractive  not so much for the size of its investment but because it has  people who are energetic and entrepreneurial. It is they who  are establishing companies in the oblast and conducting trade.    [Debski] Kaliningrad Oblast has been announced as a special  economic zone. What does this mean to foreign businessmen?    [Matochkin] By virtue of the decision by the president and  the government, the oblast has obtained a number of allowances:    --Tariff concessions--all merchandise coming to us is exempt  from the import customs duty, and merchandise manufactured in  the oblast is exempt from the export customs duty.    --Tax allowances--foreign companies or companies with mixed  capital are exempt from taxes entirely or partially, for a  specified period. The size of the allowances and the time of  their being in force is found on a special scale that depends on  the type of production.    [Debski] According to businessmen, however, not all of these  allowances can be found in practice.    [Matochkin] I can say that tariff concessions are, in fact,  already in force. Indeed, the tax system is not functioning as  it should yet, also because there are still only a few companies  that meet all of the conditions. For example, if a company  wants to get a 50-percent reduction of its income tax, it must  export 50 percent of its products.    We are now dealing with this problem--we are analyzing what  results the allowances and reductions do or do not yield.    We are also analyzing the functioning of tariff concessions  and their influence on the level of our prices. It turns out  that the tariff concession for food, where the tariff to be paid  is approximately 30 percent, decreases the price of food  commodities by 10-15 percent. Thus, reductions are more  beneficial to businessmen than to the inhabitants of the oblast.  We understand, of course, that the profit rate must be higher  here than in other regions of the Russian Federation; however, I  do not think the proportions between the profit and the  reduction of prices are correct.    All things considered, I can say that the special zone is  functioning and yielding results, even though they are still not  the results we would like to see. This is understandable. We  have not been working in this system long. The most recent  allowances and reductions came into effect in February 1994 and  the first ones in late 1992. What is needed, then, is patience,  all the more so because we want to further develop the concept  of this zone.    [Debski] People in Poland are deeply concerned about the  accumulation of troops in the oblast. Some say that there are  as many as 200,000 of them. Why so many?    [Matochkin] I could ask those who say such things to prove  that there are really 200,000.    [Debski] How many soldiers are there really, then?    [Matochkin] If we were to count the soldiers and the  officers along with their families, then, if we assumed that  each of the families consisted of three persons, we would  estimate the figure at 200,000.    [Debski] Along with the families?    [Matochkin] Yes. Along with the families.    [Debski] However, you yourself said once that the military  people constitute 10 percent of the oblast's population, which  is 920,000 people.    [Matochkin] That was the case when I said this, a year and  a half or two years ago. Since that time, we have been  witnessing the process of limiting the armed forces. Standing  units are being liquidated, such as the 24th Brigade of Rocket  Cutters that has arrived here from Poland. Other units are  being reduced in size--for example, divisions are being  transformed into brigades. Moreover, each of the type of troops,  apart from the border-protecting units, has too few soldiers.  Simply, there are not enough draftees.    Russian Defense Minister Pawel Gratchev has announced that  we  are planning, or, more specifically, that we are discussing, the  idea of establishing the so-called Kaliningrad defense region.  It is supposed to save money through the liquidation of  parallel services. Today both the Baltic Fleet and the 11th Army  have their own units of material supply, for instance, even  though it would be cheaper if they were joint. This will lead  to a further reduction in the number of troops.    [Debski] Is there a program for these reductions?    [Matochkin] Yes, there is.    [Debski] For how long is it scheduled?    [Matochkin] Until the year 2000 for the time being. The  fact that your authorities keep repeating the figure 200,000  only proves how poorly your intelligence services are working.  After all, it is not all that difficult to count soldiers.    The Russian Federation does not have the possibilities to  develop its armed forces; it has no money for that. It can only  maintain them on a level that is necessary for our defense.    I believe that the issue of the size of our armed forces is  a  political card that is being played on purpose. There have been  proposals recently, such as the one by Algirdas Brazauskas that  a demilitarized zone be set up here. But why? What are the  arguments for this? Does the oblast threaten anybody?    [Debski] Apparently such are the feelings...    [Matochkin] If so, there must be further logic. If we  demilitarize the oblast, will Lithuania and Poland be  demilitarized as well? Otherwise, we will feel threatened.    [Debski] This is a fundamental problem in our relations as  the Polish president sees it. Now, what problems can you see?    [Matochkin] There are no serious problems. We should try to  cooperate more effectively, more openly; this cooperation should  be more advantageous to both sides. I consider our relations to  be normal. Cooperation with our Polish partners is very good.    There is only one matter we want to complain about. We have  started building the Kaliningrad-Elblag highway, which,  incidentally, was a Polish initiative. We will complete our  portion this year; we will reach the border. And what next?  When will the Poles complete the rest?    [Debski] So the issue of the Vistula Lagoon navigation is  not a problem for you?    [Matochkin] It certainly is. But, all right, let us discuss  problems if you want to. I believe that controversial issues  should be resolved, such as the issue of the Vistula Lagoon or  the highway. Who most wants to see the issue of the Visula  Lagoon navigation resolved? You do. And who wants to see the  construction of the highway completed? We do. Let us, then,  help each other on both issues. Otherwise, it looks like we are  relenting on the issue of the Vistula Lagoon, but you are not  budging on the issue of the highway.    We can see three controversial issues:    a) The Kaliningrad-Elblag highway: What is needed is a clear  answer to whether the Poles want to build it. If you have no  money for it, we will look for some together. For example, we  can visit the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  together and try to get the money there.    b) The Goldap-Gusiew border-crossing site: I want to know  what our side will get out of it and what you will get. Poles  know that this border crossing will increase traffic near the  border. We want it to be the second variant of the road to  Grodno--not through Lithuania.    c) The Vistula Lagoon: Right now, the situation at the  lagoon  is satisfactory as far as we are concerned. I understand, of  course, that Poles have a differing opinion.    What we should do, then, is sit down and discuss all of  these  problems at the same time. In one issue we will make a  concession, in another you will. On all of these issues, the  time for discussions has ended: Specific problems must be  resolved now.    Postscript: When we were saying goodbye to each other, Yuri  Matochkin said: If President Lech Walesa does not believe the  figures we submit, he might come and visit us. I am inviting  him. We will show him all of the places, all of the units he  wants to see. He may see for himself that 200,000 soldiers are  not there.     "

During the U.S. visit, Governor Chen  Huanyou met with New York State Governor Mario Cuomo and Georgia  Governor Zell Miller. Following friendly and frank discussions,  both sides exchanged views on exchange and cooperation, reached  a consensus, and signed four agreements in economic and science  trade. The four agreements were: The Jiangsu-New York  High-Technology Cooperation Agreement; the Jiangsu-Georgia  Economic and Trade Development and Exchange Memorandum; the New  York State Financial Investment Seminar in Jiangsu Memorandum;  and the Jiangsu-New York Comprehensive Visual Testing Agreement.  The U.S. visit marked the first meeting between Jiangsu and  U.S. governors and the signing of the four agreements signified  the actual progress that Jiangsu has achieved in developing  exchange and cooperation with the United States.    To enhance understanding, deepen friendship, and expand  cooperation, the Jiangsu delegation made extensive contacts with  U.S. industry, commerce, science and technology, education,  legal, and media circles and Chinese in the United States. It  attended the opening ceremony of the Jiangsu investment and  trade fair in New York City, visited Ford Motor Company, the  Atlanta Science Park, and New York State University's High  Technology Center. Governor Chen was invited to speak at the  receptions sponsored by the U.S.-Chinese Relations National  Committee; the New York State International Cooperation  Committee; and the business, scientific, and educational circles  of Georgia. He introduced China's opening-up policy, Jiangsu's  economic development and investment environment, and the  prospects of developing Sino-U.S. friendly exchange and  cooperation to those at the receptions. He also fielded  questions posed by business, political, and legal circles and  reporters. Many heads of major corporations discussed with the  delegation the possibility of expanding cooperation. The vice  chairman of the Detroit-based (Carden) Company and his party  took a special nighttime charter flight from Michigan to discuss  investment with the delegation. New York and Georgia officials  said they would organize heads of major corporations to visit  Jiangsu to explore investment projects. Good results exceeding  original expectations were achieved at the investment and trade  fair in New York City, where agreements on 48 projects totalling  $510 million were signed.    The delegation was warmly received everywhere by various  circles and by Chinese in the United States. On its first day  in New York, Chinese organizations in the eastern United States  and Suxing International Trading Company jointly sponsored a  grand reception. Some 250 people turned up at that warm  reception. This showed that Overseas Chinese love their country  and miss their hometowns. During a stopover in San Francisco  following visits to New York and Georgia, the California  governor forwarded a personal letter via his special  representative to the delegation in which he congratulated the  delegation's successful visit and expressed the wish to develop  friendly cooperation. Chinese circles in San Francisco and Los  Angeles hosted a grand reception to welcome Governor Chen and  his party. The delegation also met with Hawaii Governor John  Waihee to discuss exchange and cooperation. During the visit,  Governor Chen met with UN Deputy Secretary General Ji Chaozhu  and many responsible persons at the Chinese embassy and  consulate in the United States. He also met with comrades  working at Chinese enterprises in the United States and urged  them to further emancipate their minds, seize the opportunity,  run well overseas enterprises, and accelerate the pace of  developing overseas markets.    Cao Keming, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC  committee;  Wang Rongbing, vice governor; Liang Baohua, secretary general of  the provincial CPC committee; and Shi Shaoxiang, deputy  secretary general of the provincial government, met the  delegation at the airport. Other delegation members, including  Chen Biting, Ye Jian, Chen Deming, Li Zhonghe, and Gu Mingdao,  returned to Nanjing on the same plane.     "

Korea's exports to China grew by a whopping  165 percent in 1992 and again by 90 percent in 1993. Bilateral  trade between the two countries is expected to grow by an annual  average rate of 33.2 percent between 1993 and 1997 and by 18.9  percent for the 1998- 2001 period. China has also become the  most preferred country for direct investments among Korean  firms. Last year, the government authorized 616 applications  for investment in China, the largest number for a single target  country.    The aggregate amount of Korean investments in China,  however,  is still small because direct investment by Korean firms began  to surge only from 1992. As of the end of 1993, the aggregate  amount of investment authorized by the government is still less  than $1 billion. Of this, $465 million had actually been  invested by the end of last year. China, however, is considered  to be more than a simple trading partner; it is regarded as a  crucial partner for industrial cooperation as well. During  President Kim's visit, the foundation will be laid for strategic  industrial alliance between the two countries.    The government will seek, among other things, an industrial  cooperation agreement with China. Based on the framework to be  provided by the agreement, the soon-to-be-formed Korea-China  Joint Committee for Industrial Cooperation will systematically  promote the industrial alliance. To finance the committee's  activities, the Seoul government will soon inaugurate a fund,  hopefully together with China, of some $6 million.    In the inaugural meeting in Beijing, the committee will  hammer out the principles and types of cooperation, select the  primary areas of cooperation and discuss other avenues of  cooperation.    For Korea, the main fields of cooperation include aircraft,  autos, digital telephone exchanges and nuclear power plants,  while China is interested in cooperation in high-definition TV  (HDTV), facsimile and large-screen color TVs.    In case of aircraft, Korea wants to jointly develop, produce  and sell a commuter aircraft of up to 100 seats. Korea has  already announced an aircraft development plan and China is  expected to be invited to participate in this plan.    In the automobile sector, Korea has been asking China to  allow imports of finished Korean autos and will encourage Korean  parts producers to invest in China.    The Seoul government has also been eager to participate in  China's telephone network modernization programs with Korean-  developed digital telephone exchanges. Cooperation in  developing a next-generation telephone exchanges is also on the  agenda.    The nuclear power sector is another promising avenue of  cooperation as China will construct new nuclear power plants.  The Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) has signed an agreement  to provide operational and management service to the nuclear  power plant in Guangdong Province. Korea may be able to supply  power generation equipment and participate in plant construction.    Korea also plans to help China accumulate technology in such  fields of interest as HDTV [high definition television],  facsimile and large-size color TVs.    Industrial cooperation also involves joint sponsorship of  the  so- called technology mart and exchange of engineers to  facilitate technological exchange in specific sectors and to  help individual firms to address firm-specific needs.    To expand trade further and stimulate direct investment, the  Seoul government will also implement a set of new measures.  First, it intends to increase the provision of loans by the  Export-Import Bank of Korea for deferred payment exports of  Korean industrial facilities to be used for economic development  in China.    According to an official of the Ministry of Trade, Industry  and Energy (MOTIE), the bank is currently evaluating nine  applications for loans amounting to $1.2 billion. Among them is  an application for loans to finance $250 million exports of  rolling stocks to the Guangdong Province of China. The Ex-Im  Bank's loans carry 7-8 percent annual interest rates, not so low  compared with ordinary bank interest rates of around 12 percent.  To alleviate the burden of interest rates on Korean exporters  to China, the government plans to provide them with the Economic  Development Cooperation Funds (EDCF) whose interest rates are  2-2.5 percent a year. The government will expand the coverage of  export insurance for plant exports to China, while at the same  time holding exhibitions of Korean goods in major cities in  China every year.    Within first half of this year, the MOTIE will also come up  with a plan to encourage Korean distributors to advance into  China and build up their own distribution networks. Up till now,  according to a MOTIE official, Korean exports to China have  largely been materials for reexports; Korean goods have not yet  penetrated into the domestic consumption market of China.    Partly, this was the result of the discriminatory tariff  rates against Korean goods which were abolished only in 1992.  Now that Korean goods can compete with foreign products on an  equal footing, Korean exporters are in need of well-functioning  distribution networks just as their Japanese and Hong Kong  rivals do.    This year, the Seoul government will be more prudent in  invoking antidumping and adjustment tariffs against imports from  China to head off unnecessary trade disputes. To stimulate  direct investment in China, MOTIE will select industrial sectors  suitable for production plant transfer to China and will provide  administrative and financial assistance to those who actually  relocate plants. Candidate sectors for this encouragement  measure include footwear and textiles.    Korean investments in China tend to cluster in such  northeastern parts as Shantung and Liaoning Provinces and  Tianjin City near Beijing. According to MOTIE officials,  investments need to be more diversified geographically as each  of the 10 major regions of China has its own development plan.  MOTIE has requested the Korea Institute for Industrial  Economics and Technology to draw up a detailed investment plan  tailored to the development programs of the 10 regions. The  ministry has also told the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA)  to set up trade centers in Dalian and Chonqing this year.  Currently, KOTRA operates trade centers in Beijing and Shanghai.    Korean banks will be encouraged to expand their branch  networks in China and a Korea-China joint venture lease firm  will be promoted to provide Korean firms in China with an easier  access to capital. According to a MOTIE official, the Daewoo and  Halla Business Groups have expressed interest in setting up the  envisioned lease firm.    All these measures are expected to help economic ties  between  Seoul and Beijing evolve into a new dimension. The two  economies are, according to experts, basically complementary in  nature, although in some sectors, they do compete. In  approaching each other, the two countries may as well try to  expand and capitalize on complementarity.     "

However, he added, it is a pity that this cooperative  relationship has been ruined by Chris Patten.    Zhang Junsheng made the above statement to reporters  yesterday evening when attending the founding ceremony of the  Hong Kong Society of Creative Photographic Art. He was asked by  reporters to comment on remarks by the British Foreign Office  minister Alastair Goodlad that Sino-British relations at present  are not too bad.    Zhang Junsheng said: ""I wish it were true. However, now the  problem is that the very important part of Sino-British  relations, that is, the cooperative relationship between China  and Britain on the Hong Kong issue, has been ruined by the  British side, and by Chris Patten in particular. The Chinese  side, of course, hopes China and Britain can maintain a good  cooperative relationship between them, but for the moment  Sino-British relations have actually been greatly impaired.""    Zhang Junsheng said: China and Britain should cooperate more  closely in this late transitional period to ensure prosperity,  stability, and a steady transition, which is the goal clearly  laid down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Now, the  problem is that the British side has ruined cooperation despite  the Chinese side's wish for cooperation. In this case, what can  we do on our part? Now that the British side refuses to  cooperate, the Chinese side cannot stand by idly doing nothing  but waiting for the British side to return to cooperation.    A reporter mentioned that a couple of days ago Chris Patten  had accused the economic subgroup of the Preliminary Work  Committee [PWC] of nursing ulterior motives in inviting Hong  Kong Government officials to visit Beijing to explain a bill on  the Airport Corporation's articles of association. Zhang  Junsheng asked: Then what is the motive? Chris Patten did not  specify it at all. A few days ago, Chris Patten said he would  not restrain British Hong Kong Government officials from  contacting members of the PWC. But now he has categorically  rejected an official invitation from the PWC. In fact, the PWC  economic subgroup's letter of invitation very expressly states  that the PWC needed to study the issue, and its purpose in  studying this is to give advice to the Chinese representatives  on the Airport Committee before further negotiations with their  British counterparts. What is wrong with doing this?    Zhang Junsheng said: Some members of the PWC, when studying  the case, have found that they do not understand or are not  quite clear about some articles in the bill; therefore, they  have asked Hong Kong Government officials to explain the bill to  them. The purpose is very clear, and it has been stated very  clearly in the invitation letter. Should there be any doubts  about this?    A reporter said to Zhang Junsheng: Referring to the  reorganization of the three-tier assemblies in 1997, some PWC  members have suggested that the nonpolitical assemblies be  allowed to switch over by means of endorsement and reappointment  rather than reelection. The reporter asked Zhang whether he  agreed with this idea. Zhang Junsheng said: In principle, all  assemblies should be dismissed and reestablished. However,  before a final decision is made, everybody is welcome to air his  views on the reorganization of these assemblies. Now that PWC  members are voicing their opinions on this issue and are  discussing it, this shows that they are very seriously and  responsibly considering the case of Hong Kong's transition.  With a smile he said to the reporters: ""You may express your  opinions as well!""     "

However,  since internationalized crime poses a common threat to both our  countries, we are making joint efforts to face squarely the  common interests we have on this issue.""    That is the view aired by Robert Gelbard, U.S. assistant  secretary of state for international narcotics matters, in a  speech in Hong Kong yesterday. It was precisely for this reason  that Gelbard recently led a high-level delegation to China to  seek increased cooperation in cracking down on crime.    Since President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton met last  November, Sino-U.S. relations have further improved. Gelbard's  trip proves that, as two big powers, China and the United States  have many spheres of cooperation. With the rise in  international organized crime, the focus of the crackdown has  shifted to how to get more information to accurately deal a  crushing blow from top to bottom at transnational crime  syndicates. This makes it necessary for the law-enforcement  departments of various countries to work with good cooperation.    In his speech, Gelbard described how transnational organized  crime syndicates carry out illegal activities with advanced  weapons, telecommunications, and transport facilities, as well  as monetary means. He said: ""If the boss of an Asian syndicate  enterprise wants to fix up a kidnapping case in New York, he can  order his subordinate in New Jersey by directly dialing his  subordinate's mobile telephone number using satellite  telecommunications equipment. Afterward, they can make contact  again by coded fax. If funds are needed, the money can be  remitted to the United States electronically, possibly through a  Hong Kong bank. The ransom can also be remitted to a bank in  the Bahamas, then sent again from there to Panama, eventually  arriving in a numbered Swiss bank account. The entire process  can be completed in one day.""    This description is like the plot of a movie but it is  really  shocking, especially the fact that what has been revealed is  only the tip of the iceberg. Given such modern methods of  committing crime, it has become even more difficult to crack  down on crime.    Gelbard pointed out that half the drugs on the U.S. market  come from Asia.    With the opening up of the country, the economic  development,  and the influx of Western ideas, various different factors have  contributed to the resurrection of drug-taking in China, where  it had disappeared for decades. The drug-trafficking activities  through China's long borders have also become increasingly  rampant. The crime syndicates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the  United States not only smuggle drugs to other countries through  the Chinese mainland but also smuggle ""human cargo"" to the  United States in a big way, making it more urgent for China and  the United States to jointly crack down on such organized crime.    As a financial and information center, Hong Kong is  naturally  regarded by the international crime syndicates as a paradise for  money laundering and a supreme headquarters for mobilizing and  organizing various criminal activities. What is needed now is  for the world's law-enforcement authorities to make joint  efforts to crack down on the frenzied criminal activities. It  is gratifying that such joint efforts are being stepped up.  Gelbard said that from his talks with Chinese officials he had  got the impression that the Chinese side approached  drug-trafficking and other issues very seriously and  conscientiously and that Sino-U.S. cooperation would be further  strengthened.

The project, in central China's Hubei Province, started last  year and is scheduled to be completed in the coming 17 years;  the 11th year will see the first set of generators producing  electricity.    A group of 26 water turbo-generators for the project are  planned to have an installed capacity of 700,000 kw each. They  will be among the biggest in the world when they are installed.    To pave the way for international co-operation for the  project's generators, a month-long symposium was held late last  year, with more than 90 Chinese and foreign experts taking part.    Many leading foreign companies with experience in building  power- generation equipment above 600,000 kw were represented,  including the Volth and Siemens companies of Germany, G.E. of  Canada, Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsui of Japan, and LMZ and  Electrical of Russia.

However,  since internationalized crime poses a common threat to both our  countries, we are making joint efforts to face squarely the  common interests we have on this issue.""    That is the view aired by Robert Gelbard, U.S. assistant  secretary of state for international narcotics matters, in a  speech in Hong Kong yesterday. It was precisely for this reason  that Gelbard recently led a high-level delegation to China to  seek increased cooperation in cracking down on crime.    Since President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton met last  November, Sino-U.S. relations have further improved. Gelbard's  trip proves that, as two big powers, China and the United States  have many spheres of cooperation. With the rise in  international organized crime, the focus of the crackdown has  shifted to how to get more information to accurately deal a  crushing blow from top to bottom at transnational crime  syndicates. This makes it necessary for the law-enforcement  departments of various countries to work with good cooperation.    In his speech, Gelbard described how transnational organized  crime syndicates carry out illegal activities with advanced  weapons, telecommunications, and transport facilities, as well  as monetary means. He said: ""If the boss of an Asian syndicate  enterprise wants to fix up a kidnapping case in New York, he can  order his subordinate in New Jersey by directly dialling his  subordinate's mobile telephone number using satellite  telecommunications equipment. Afterward, they can make contact  again by coded fax. If funds are needed, the money can be  remitted to the United States electronically, possibly through a  Hong Kong bank. The ransom can also be remitted to a bank in  the Bahamas, then sent again from there to Panama, eventually  arriving in a numbered Swiss bank account. The entire process  can be completed in one day.""    This description is like the plot of a movie but it is  really  shocking, especially the fact that what has been revealed is  only the tip of the iceberg. Given such modern methods of  committing crime, it has become even more difficult to crack  down on crime.    Gelbard pointed out that half the drugs on the U.S. market  come from Asia.    With the opening up of the country, the economic  development,  and the influx of Western ideas, various different factors have  contributed to the resurrection of drug-taking in China, where  it had disappeared for decades. The drug-trafficking activities  through China's long borders have also become increasingly  rampant. The crime syndicates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the  United States not only smuggle drugs to other countries through  the Chinese mainland but also smuggle ""human cargo"" to the  United States in a big way, making it more urgent for China and  the United States to jointly crack down on such organized crime.    As a financial and information center, Hong Kong is  naturally  regarded by the international crime syndicates as a paradise for  money laundering and a supreme headquarters for mobilizing and  organizing various criminal activities. What is needed now is  for the world's law-enforcement authorities to make joint  efforts to crack down on the frenzied criminal activities. It  is gratifying that such joint efforts are being stepped up.  Gelbard said that from his talks with Chinese officials he had  got the impression that the Chinese side approached  drug-trafficking and other issues very seriously and  conscientiously and that Sino-U.S. cooperation would be further  strengthened. His successful visit to China also shows that  through their joint efforts China and the United States can more  effectively crack down on crimes and safeguard people's security  and social stability.

Still, the possibility of the United States turning its chemical weapons on the  Iraqis remains remote, even if Iraq uses chemicals first. For one thing, world  opinion likely would turn against a superpower that inflicted the torture of  chemical weapons; for another, other weapons probably would work better.    ""Rather than make their missile sites more difficult to operate (by disabling  Iraqi troops with chemical weapons), blow them to smithereens,"" suggested  Gordon Burke, senior policy analyst for EAI Corp., a defense-industry  consulting firm. ""That would get to the point much faster.""    Using chemical weapons is a decision that could be made only by the President.  However, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Tuesday that he ""cannot conceive of  a situation"" in which the United States would use chemical weapons against  Iraq.    The world has viewed chemical weapons with particular horror since the Germans  used mustard gas in World War I, killing 100,000 and causing 1.3 million  casualties. Troops sometimes woke up in their foxholes to find that they were  lying in pools of the viscous liquid, which causes terrible blisters when it  touches skin, Burke said. Inhaled, it can blister the inside of the lungs.    Nerve agents, developed in the late 1930s, cause the entire nervous system to  break down. A lethal dose of some types could fit on the point of a pin, and a  liter jar could contain enough to kill a million people, Burke said.    The United States has been building its stockpile of chemical weapons for  decades. Production was halted for 18 years after former President Richard M.  Nixon declared a moratorium in 1969. President Ronald Reagan began pressing for  a resumption early in his Administration, citing evidence that the Soviets were  adding to their chemical arsenal.    The United States acknowledges having about 25,000 tons of chemical weapons, a  supply second only to that of the Soviet Union, which says that it has 50,000  tons. President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed in June  to begin dismantling the two countries' stockpiles, so that neither country  will have more than 5,000 tons by the end of 1992.    In recent years, America produced chemical weapons because it feared that ""the  Soviets might come roaring across Europe behind a cloud of chemicals,"" Burke  said.    But while the United States' top priority was countering a superpower threat,  chemical weapons also were becoming what analysts call ""the poor man's nuclear  arsenal"" -- weapons available to any country with a petrochemical, fertilizer  or pharmaceutical industry, according to a report by the Center for Defense  Information in Washington.    Iraq is believed to have several thousand tons of chemical weapons, CIA  Director William H. Webster told Congress in early 1989.    More frightening than the size of Iraq's arsenal is its inclination to use it.  About 200 civilians died during the Iran-Iraq War when both sides used chemical  weapons, and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has used nerve gas against Kurdish  rebels in his own country.    Both the United States and Iraq signed the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which  banned first use of chemical weapons. The talks currently under way in Geneva  are aimed at a global ban, but it probably will be years before a treaty is  negotiated and signed.

MAJOR POWERS ARE UNABLE  TO CURB A BUILDUP.      By NICK B. WILLIAMS Jr. and DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      NICOSIA, Cyprus      The Middle East, where tanks and air power ruled the battlefields in hostile  decades past, has entered an unsettling era of mushrooming missile arsenals.    Over the past weeks and months, regional military machines have been flexing  their missile strength at an accelerating pace. The contestants give identical  rationales for the buildup: to match strides with their rivals.    Israel and Iraq have test-fired powerful new rockets. Egypt is working on an  intermediate-range missile, and Saudi Arabia has placed in desert silos a  long-range, nuclear-capable heavyweight bought from China.    Other Middle East nations have stocked a range of battlefield rockets over the  years. Even Lebanon's beleaguered Christian forces, once armed mainly with  artillery and hand-carried grenade launchers, are reported to possess a handful  of Soviet-made short-range missiles, supplied by Iraq.    ""We have a missile race,"" affirmed Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist at  London's International Institute of Strategic Studies, in an interview Dec. 15.  ""Everybody is on their toes now.""    Mordechai Gur, a former Israeli army chief of staff, added: ""We have to deter  the use of missiles, full stop.""    Technology for Sale    Technology is bought, adapted or home-developed, and is increasingly beyond the  capability of the United States, the Soviet Union and other major powers  uncomfortable with the Middle East arms race to restrain. The reduction of  big-power tensions in Europe has yet to spill over to the region, and Third  World producers are helping fill the demand for new weapons.    U.S. Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams, commenting on this month's  Iraqi test, warned that the burgeoning arsenals are ""a serious and growing  worldwide concern."" In the taut relations of the Middle East, he said, missile  proliferation ""undermines regional security and peace.""    Officials in the Soviet Union, whose southern territories are within range of  Middle East missiles, have expressed similar alarm.    According to military analysts, only Israel among Middle East powers is capable  of arming missiles with nuclear warheads. But Iraq, Iran and Libya are  reportedly seeking nuclear technology, and they and several other countries in  the region are believed to have the potential to develop chemical warheads,  dubbed by analysts as ""the poor man's atomic bomb.""    Strategically, the development of missile forces by Iran and the Arab countries  threatens to upset the regional military balance characterized by superior  Israeli air power. To keep its foes at bay, Israel had long relied on its  ability to strike at installations deep in enemy territory without fear of  immediate retaliation. Its 1981 bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor outside  Baghdad was a celebrated example.    Now, an Israeli preemptive air strike can be countered with the push of a  button, although Israel's nuclear capability still poses a telling deterrent.    Hedging their bets for a non-nuclear confrontation, the Israelis have embarked  on a U.S.-supported program to develop an anti-missile system called Arrow,  another notch on the gear of escalation.    Outside the Arab-Israeli tensions lies the threat that missile proliferation  poses to the Arab states and Iran themselves. While battlefield missiles were  first used in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, long-range missile warfare was  introduced to the region during the nine-year conflict between Iraq and Iran,  which ended in a fragile truce in the summer of 1988.    Each side threw every available type of missile, from every possible source, at  the other. Soviet-made Scud B rockets, adapted for greater range by reducing  the weight of the warhead, fell on both Baghdad and Tehran. The Iran-Iraq War  also reintroduced another ominous weapon, poison gas, which had not been used  so extensively since during World War I in Europe.    ""The use of missiles was legitimized during the Iran-Iraq War,"" said Shai  Feldman, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv.    French-supplied Iraqi fighters pounded Iranian shipping in the Persian Gulf  with French-made Exocet missiles (and accidentally hit the U.S. frigate Stark  in 1987, with the loss of 37 American lives). The Iranians countered by  deploying Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles along the gulf's strategic  Strait of Hormuz.    Saudi Arabia, alarmed by the buildup, went on the market and bought the  ponderous Chinese CSS-2 East Wind missiles, which have a range of up to 1,800  miles, depending on the warhead. The East Wind can carry nuclear warheads to  the maximum range, but the Saudis insist they have no intention of becoming a  nuclear power. Independent observers say the missiles are being retrofitted  with conventional warheads, which would limit the range to 1,000 miles, still  sufficient to hit targets in Iran, Israel or elsewhere in the Middle East,  though without pinpoint accuracy.    Kopietz, the London analyst, labeled the Saudi weapons a ""psychological  cosmetic,"" but added that that is what spurs proliferation.    ""The Saudis are telling Iran, 'We can buy these and we can use them,' "" he  explained. ""The Iraqis are building their own because neither the Soviet Union  nor the United States will sell them a missile.""    In the race to match missile for missile, there have been few restraints except  price and availability. And even those restraints are being evaded by the  ambitious development and adaptation programs in Iraq, Iran and Egypt,  reportedly with technical help from Argentina.    In 1987, seven Western industrial nations, including the United States,  Britain, Japan, France and West Germany, formed the Missile Technology Control  Regime, with the aim of curbing the spread of missiles with a range of 180  miles or more. The signatories are committed to block the sale of missile parts  and related equipment to Third World countries. But the commitments have proven  less than airtight.    According to the chief prosecutor in Munich, a West German company has sold  components for a rocket valve to Libya. An official with the French firm  Aerospatiale told a reporter at this year's Baghdad air show that his company  was prepared to ""respond to any need of the Iraqi defense production."" The  official was quoted as saying that negotiations for the transfer of missile  technology were under way.    Meanwhile, according to press reports, Libya's Moammar Kadafi is shopping in  the missile market, reportedly for the Brazilian-made Oteiba, which has a  375-mile range.    Iraq's claim Dec. 7 that it had launched a 48-ton rocket into Earth orbit and  developed two models of 1,200-mile-range military missiles surprised even  analysts who had closely followed its wartime and postwar efforts.    ""We achieved a complicated scientific leap,"" Military Industries Minister  Hussein Kamel, brother-in-law of President Saddam Hussein, told Baghdad Radio.  "" . . . We successfully tested the launching of a three-stage rocket to outer  space.""    Not until 48 hours later did U.S. officials authenticate the claim.    ""I can confirm that the Iraqis have launched a rocket powerful enough to put a  small payload into space,"" a Pentagon spokesman said. Another Defense  Department official said the North American Aerospace Defense Command had  tracked an object ""for four or five revolutions"" of Earth, although it was not  clear whether it was the final rocket stage or a payload.    Kamel said the test was the first phase of a space program, presumably aimed at  putting a spy satellite into orbit over the Middle East.    The 1,200-mile-range missiles that Iraq claims to have developed would have  direct military application.    At U.N. headquarters in New York on Dec. 14, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz  said of the intermediate-range rocket: ""We have to take into consideration, for  defense purposes, that our country is still being threatened by Iran. We are in  a position of no war and no peace.""    The same weapon could reach Jerusalem, as can the Scud B rockets fired at  Tehran during the war. They have a range of about 570 miles, boosted by more  than 150 miles through alterations reportedly designed with the help of West  German engineers. Syria, Egypt and the Saudis also own missiles capable of  hitting Israeli targets, and the Soviet-supplied Syrian SS-21 Scarab missiles  have a high degree of accuracy.    There has been no Iraqi claim that their new intermediate-range missiles have  been tested. Intelligence reports on Iraq have focused instead on development  of an advanced version of the Argentine Condor rocket, reportedly in  collaboration with the Egyptians and the Argentines. In the Middle East, the  rocket has been dubbed Badr 2000, and has a projected range of about 600 miles.    More alarming than Iraqi success with a mid-range rocket would be the potential  of the tested space booster, which could put Iraq in a satellite-launching club  with Israel and developing countries such as India and China.    Senate Legislation    The U.S. Senate is considering further legislation to combat the spread of  ballistic missiles, although the effort seems to be aimed primarily at Syria  and Libya rather than Israel, an ally of the United States.    However, Kopietz, the International Institute of Strategic Studies analyst,  argued that Israeli power is the problem.    ""To end this race,"" he said, ""America will have to get Israel to step down  first"" in any disarmament program.    Israel, meanwhile, has moved ahead with its own rocket program. In September,  in a report that Israeli officials refused to confirm or deny, the Soviet news  agency Tass said Israel had test-fired a surface-to-surface missile from an  area near Jerusalem 900 miles west into the Mediterranean.    Other reports identified the missile by the code name Jericho 2, the same  rocket that put a satellite into orbit in September, 1988. The Israeli Jericho  1, current kingpin of their missile force, has a range of 375 miles and can be  fitted with chemical, conventional or nuclear warheads.    Meanwhile, nuclear technology is also being sown throughout the region. A West  German company and China are said to have provided Iraq with technology to  produce enriched uranium, the key ingredient for building nuclear weapons.    Israel has reportedly helped South Africa build a long-range missile in return  for guaranteed supplies of enriched uranium and facilities to test booster  rockets in South Africa.    The State Department, in response to reports of Israeli-South African missile  and nuclear cooperation, pressed Israel to sign the international Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, but Israel has refused. The Israeli government does  not confirm that it has nuclear weapons, and compliance with the treaty would  open its nuclear facilities to international inspection.

Kopietz, the London analyst, labeled the Saudi weapons a ""psychological  cosmetic,"" but added that that is what spurs proliferation.    ""The Saudis are telling Iran, 'We can buy these and we can use them,' "" he  explained. ""The Iraqis are building their own because neither the Soviet Union  nor the United States will sell them a missile.""    In the race to match missile for missile, there have been few restraints except  price and availability. And even those restraints are being evaded by the  ambitious development and adaptation programs in Iraq, Iran and Egypt,  reportedly with technical help from Argentina.    In 1987, seven Western industrial nations, including the United States,  Britain, Japan, France and West Germany, formed the Missile Technology Control  Regime, with the aim of curbing the spread of missiles with a range of 180  miles or more. The signatories are committed to block the sale of missile parts  and related equipment to Third World countries. But the commitments have proven  less than airtight.    According to the chief prosecutor in Munich, a West German company has sold  components for a rocket valve to Libya. An official with the French firm  Aerospatiale told a reporter at this year's Baghdad air show that his company  was prepared to ""respond to any need of the Iraqi defense production."" The  official was quoted as saying that negotiations for the transfer of missile  technology were under way.    Meanwhile, according to press reports, Libya's Moammar Kadafi is shopping in  the missile market, reportedly for the Brazilian-made Oteiba, which has a  375-mile range.    Iraq's claim Dec. 7 that it had launched a 48-ton rocket into Earth orbit and  developed two models of 1,200-mile-range military missiles surprised even  analysts who had closely followed its wartime and postwar efforts.    ""We achieved a complicated scientific leap,"" Military Industries Minister  Hussein Kamel, brother-in-law of President Saddam Hussein, told Baghdad Radio.  "" . . . We successfully tested the launching of a three-stage rocket to outer  space.""    Not until 48 hours later did U.S. officials authenticate the claim.    ""I can confirm that the Iraqis have launched a rocket powerful enough to put a  small payload into space,"" a Pentagon spokesman said. Another Defense  Department official said the North American Aerospace Defense Command had  tracked an object ""for four or five revolutions"" of Earth, although it was not  clear whether it was the final rocket stage or a payload.    Kamel said the test was the first phase of a space program, presumably aimed at  putting a spy satellite into orbit over the Middle East.    The 1,200-mile-range missiles that Iraq claims to have developed would have  direct military application.    At U.N. headquarters in New York on Dec. 14, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz  said of the intermediate-range rocket: ""We have to take into consideration, for  defense purposes, that our country is still being threatened by Iran. We are in  a position of no war and no peace.""    The same weapon could reach Jerusalem, as can the Scud B rockets fired at  Tehran during the war. They have a range of about 570 miles, boosted by more  than 150 miles through alterations reportedly designed with the help of West  German engineers. Syria, Egypt and the Saudis also own missiles capable of  hitting Israeli targets, and the Soviet-supplied Syrian SS-21 Scarab missiles  have a high degree of accuracy.    There has been no Iraqi claim that their new intermediate-range missiles have  been tested. Intelligence reports on Iraq have focused instead on development  of an advanced version of the Argentine Condor rocket, reportedly in  collaboration with the Egyptians and the Argentines. In the Middle East, the  rocket has been dubbed Badr 2000, and has a projected range of about 600 miles.    More alarming than Iraqi success with a mid-range rocket would be the potential  of the tested space booster, which could put Iraq in a satellite-launching club  with Israel and developing countries such as India and China.    Senate Legislation    The U.S. Senate is considering further legislation to combat the spread of  ballistic missiles, although the effort seems to be aimed primarily at Syria  and Libya rather than Israel, an ally of the United States.    However, Kopietz, the International Institute of Strategic Studies analyst,  argued that Israeli power is the problem.    ""To end this race,"" he said, ""America will have to get Israel to step down  first"" in any disarmament program.    Israel, meanwhile, has moved ahead with its own rocket program. In September,  in a report that Israeli officials refused to confirm or deny, the Soviet news  agency Tass said Israel had test-fired a surface-to-surface missile from an  area near Jerusalem 900 miles west into the Mediterranean.    Other reports identified the missile by the code name Jericho 2, the same  rocket that put a satellite into orbit in September, 1988. The Israeli Jericho  1, current kingpin of their missile force, has a range of 375 miles and can be  fitted with chemical, conventional or nuclear warheads.    Meanwhile, nuclear technology is also being sown throughout the region. A West  German company and China are said to have provided Iraq with technology to  produce enriched uranium, the key ingredient for building nuclear weapons.    Israel has reportedly helped South Africa build a long-range missile in return  for guaranteed supplies of enriched uranium and facilities to test booster  rockets in South Africa.    The State Department, in response to reports of Israeli-South African missile  and nuclear cooperation, pressed Israel to sign the international Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, but Israel has refused. The Israeli government does  not confirm that it has nuclear weapons, and compliance with the treaty would  open its nuclear facilities to international inspection.

As no presidential lawyer turned up for the hearing on the opening day of the trial, Judge Benyamin Mangkudilaga of Jakarta's State Administrative Court said he had no option but to put it off until Oct. 31. Mr Suharto is not expected to testify in the trial, the first time he has been taken to court in his three decades of power. The suit, filed by six environmental groups in August, accuses Mr Suharto of ignoring ecological concerns by diverting Dollars 183m in state forestry funds as an interest-free loan to the state-owned Indonesian aircraft industry for a project to develop a passenger plane. The prototype of the 64-seat turboprop plane is scheduled to roll out of the plant next month, coinciding with a summit of heads of state from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

The present conference, the top Russian diplomat noted, is  yet another attempt to ""tackle seriously the extremely dangerous  manifestations of aggressive nationalism, xenophobia, ethnic and  religious intolerance"".    Russian foreign minister reiterated that the initiative to  organize this conference concerned nine states of Central and  Eastern Europe which agreed to it. They are preparing to become  members of the European Union and wish to discuss the problems  connected with the condition of national minorities and fraught  with possible complications.    It is quite natural, Andrey Kozyrev said, to seek to link  this work to the context of the Conference for Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and rely on support from the  countries participating in the all-European process.    ""Certainly, within this framework Russia is prepared to make  its own contribution in such a form which will be considered  expedient,"" the Russian foreign minister elaborated.    He believes that the main thing is that the chosen  negotiating model -- the organizing of regional tables -- should  not lead to duplication, to weakening of the existing  international institutions and negotiating mechanisms but  concentrate on concrete steps for the establishment of  inter-ethnic relations and the guarantees of the rights of  national minorities.    ""This is particularly necessary for the three Baltic states  -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,"" Andrey Kozyrev stressed.    The problem of national minorities is inseparable from the  general establishment of goodneighborly relations, the Russian  minister said, and the work on the ""Pact on Stability in Europe""  is to become yet another contribution to the formation of  unified Europe of partnership and prosperity which must succeed  not only Cold War but also uncertainty of the post-confrontation  period. In this context, he noted, discussing of issues related  to state borders just as national minorities, should be held  exclusively within the framework established by the Conference  for Security and Cooperation in Europe.    ""The enhancement of the effectiveness of the CSCE and its  transformation into a supreme political organization on the  European continent is a key element of the concept of the  all-European partnership put forward by Russia,"" Andrey Kozyrev  stressed.    The head of the Russian foreign office expressed hope that  the forthcoming summit meeting will strengthen a special role of  the CSCE and its responsibility for the general development of  European affairs. In the near future, he said, Russia will  submit comprehensive and concrete proposals on these issues.    The merit of the present Paris conference, the minister  emphasised, is that this forum is considering the problems of  stability ""from the angle of democracy and human rights but not  in the military context"". At the same time, he noted, military  and political aspects must find its place in the course of wider  efforts.    In this connection Andrey Kozyrev dwelt on mutual relations  between Russia and NATO. Russia, he said, will join ""the  Partnership for Peace"" program and sign a corresponding  framework document with NATO along with a substantial program of  cooperation which certainly will reflect a special role of  Russia as a nuclear power"".    ""We stand for the deepening of equal partnership between  Russia and NATO without mutual vetoes and surprises,"" the  foreign minister accentuated.    Andrey Kozyrev expressed confidence that the Conference on  Stability in Europe would be an important link in the process of  forming the all-European future which may become a reality only  with the help of joint efforts by all states.

We are pleased to note that the relations of friendship and  multifaceted cooperation between our two countries, during the  past period, have consistently strengthened and expanded. The  exchange visits of high-level delegations of the two countries  have contributed to significantly developing this relationship  and strengthening mutual understanding and trust between the two  countries.    In recent years, there have been great and fundamental  changes in the regional and world situations. The most  outstanding feature is that nations wish to attain peace,  stability, and security in order to develop further. The trend  of regional cooperation is vigorously developing.    We highly appraise the Philippine Government's efforts to  support Vietnam becoming an ASEAN observer, to encourage it to  participate in the regional cooperation mechanism, and to invite  it to join ASEAN at an appropriate time. I am firmly convinced  that the visit to Vietnam by the Philippine president will be  crowned with success, thus opening up a new chapter in the  relations of friendship and cooperation between our two nations  for the interests of the two peoples and for peace, stability,  cooperation, and prosperity in Southeast Asia and the world.    President Le Duc Anh proposed a toast for the development of  the relations of friendship and multifaceted cooperation between  Vietnam and the Philippines, for the happiness and prosperity of  the Vietnamese and Philippine peoples, for peace and progress in  Southeast Asia, and for the good health of the Philippine  President and the distinguished guests.    In the reply speech, President Fidel Ramos sincerely thanked  President Le Duc Anh for his kind words and hospitality extended  to the Philippine delegation.    President Fidel Ramos stressed that this is the first visit  by a Philippine President to Vietnam. As a result, the visit is  a significant event in the history of the two nations. He said:  The purpose of my visit is to restore our relations, which were  interposed by history. The president further said: The  foundation of friendship between the two nations has been  strengthened since the establishment of diplomatic relations  after the reunification of Vietnam. Our relations were further  consolidated when we reached agreements in 1978 and 1992 to  respect each other's national dependence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity.    After asserting the Philippines' commitment to these  agreements, President Fidel Ramos stressed: Manila was proud to  host a forum two years ago at which Vietnam gained access to the  Southeast Asia Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and became  an observer to ASEAN. On that occasion ASEAN approved the  Manila Declaration on the Eastern Sea and Vietnam promptly  welcomed the declaration. The Philippine president contends  that the sooner Vietnam joins ASEAN the better for ASEAN and  Southeast Asia.    Dealing with the conflict in the Eastern Sea, the Philippine  President said: We should not focus on suspicion among countries  in the region but should concentrate on promoting cooperation to  achieve mutual trust among countries concerned.    After reviewing the similarities between the two countries  and their common wish to expand bilateral relations in the  economic, cultural, social, investment, and tourism domains, the  Philippine President recalled that, in a famous message to the  Philippine people, President Ho Chi Minh wrote: Only when the  root is firm can the tree live longer. President Fidel Ramos  expressed the wish to promote and strengthen the relations of  friendship and cooperation between the two countries.    The Philippine President proposed a toast for the happiness  and prosperity of the Vietnamese people, for the development and  long-lasting relations between the Philippines and Vietnam, and  for the good health of President Le Duc Anh.

[Yanai] When the Cold War ended, the international situation  became fluid and complicated. Japan was confronted with the  question of how to maintain its security, stability, and  prosperity as well as the task of building a post-Cold War new  international order; hence the need to create an organization in  the Foreign Ministry which could properly respond to such  situations. During the Cold War, one diplomatic policy was to  belong to either the East or West camp. But a new world order  has not yet been formed in place of the Cold War, and it demands  Japan deal with the new era in a positive manner.    In the report of the third Council for Administrative  Reform,  an opinion was expressed that the Foreign Ministry needs to have  an organization which can deal with such situations. In  response, the Consultation Group for Consolidated Diplomacy was  formed with Ryuzo Segawa as its chairman. More concrete views  on reorganizing the ministry were exchanged at the meeting, and  a report was compiled in December 1991. The report recommended  the ministry create two bureaus -- a consolidated policies  bureau and an international information bureau, although names  were not specified.    In the background were such concrete realities as the  experience and reflections of the Persian Gulf crisis which took  place in August 1990. In the sense that the war erupted in the  Persian Gulf, the Middle East and African Affairs Bureau was in  charge of the affair, but the initial diplomatic efforts to deal  with the situation were made at the United Nations and the  Security Council. In the meantime, the coalition forces were  organized with the United States as its main component, joined  by the United Kingdom, France, and other countries. The Middle  East and African Affairs Bureau alone could not handle such a  situation. The matter of transporting refugees of Asian origin  was related to the Asian Affairs Bureau. When situations arose  in which periphery countries were seriously affected by the war  and needed assistance, the Economic Cooperation Bureau had to  step in.    Therefore, crisis management was required for wider spheres  and more subjects than in the past, and this could not be  properly handled by the existing organizations. It was keenly  felt that an overall organization such as the Foreign Policy  Bureau was necessary.    [GAIKO FORUM] As a matter of fact, the United Nations Bureau  was reorganized, was it not?    [Yanai] Most functions of the United Nations Bureau were  taken over, and the Policy Planning Division of the Information  Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau was added. In addition,  the General Affairs Section was newly created in the Foreign  Policy Bureau. Simply speaking, the United Nations Bureau was  dissolved for a better setup with additional functions. By  nature, the United Nations deals with everything in the  universe. In that sense, the United Nations and what the  Foreign Policy Bureau plans to contend with are closely related.  Therefore, the bureau took over such functions.    [GAIKO FORUM] Were there rearrangements with other bureaus?    [Yanai] There were some, but they were not limited to mere  adjustments. The new bureau is in charge of planning and  framing foreign policies which are across-the-board,  comprehensive, and long-range in nature. In the past, no  bureaus existed to handle such matters.    Adjustments with other bureaus were then needed to deal with  various problems in a more concrete manner. This did not mean  replacing other bureaus, but working out an overall policy by  coordinating the matters under other bureaus' jurisdiction.    Comprehensively Coordinating Multinational Matters    [GAIKO FORUM] Matters which cannot be solved by one nation,  such as problems of displaced persons and human rights, have  taken place in record numbers in recent days, have they not?    [Yanai] The Global Issues Division is in charge of matters  on a global scale. As a whole, the bureau consists of nine  divisions [ka] and five sections [shitsu].    Organizational Chart of the Foreign Policy Bureau   Main Body   Administrators                             Divisions   1)Director-General, Foreign Policy         General Affairs Division  Bureau 2)Councilor   Planning Division   National Security Policy Division   United Nations Policy Division   International Peace Cooperation Section   Arms Control and Scientific Affairs Councilor Organization   1)Councilor, Arms Control and Scientific   Arms Control  Disarmament Division  Affairs 2)Counselor   Nonproliferation of Weapons-Related  Materials Section   Scientific Affairs  Nuclear Energy  Division   International Science Cooperation  Section   Department of International Cooperation   1)Director, International Cooperation      United Nations Administration  Department 2)Counselor                     Division   Specialized Agencies Administration  Section   Human Rights and Refugees Division   Refugee Assistance Section   Global Issues Division      The deputy director-general of the bureau is a councilor,  and  the councilor of the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs  Department as well as the director of the International  Cooperation Department have counselors under them. Basically,  the organization of the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs  Department and the International Cooperation Department are  headed by persons with director-general's rank. Therefore, you  may construe they are almost independent organizations even  though they fall within the Foreign Policy Bureau. These days  there are matters which cannot be solved by a nation, and many  things which are beyond the abilities of a superpower such as  the United States. The organization was formed with this in  mind.    [GAIKO FORUM] In order to practically strengthen foreign  policy, coordination with the cabinet and Foreign Ministry, or  with other ministries or civilian needs, is necessary. What do  you think about this?    [Yanai] The cabinet is in charge of ironing out differences  of opinion between the ministries and coming up with a  conclusion as a whole. But in the process of drawing up and  working out foreign policy, it is naturally required to  coordinate and cooperate with other government agencies and  private organizations, including the mass media and the Diet.  Such work is not monopolized on by my bureau, for other bureaus  do the same work as well. For domestic coordination and  negotiations with foreign countries, it is convenient in many  ways for the Foreign Ministry as a whole to have a general  policy. That point is different from past practices.    [GAIKO FORUM] Your bureau practically came into being with  the inauguration of the Hosokawa cabinet. Did you make  preparations for the Japan-U.S. talks between Prime Minister  Hosokawa and President Clinton?    [Yanai] Japan-U.S. relations are handled by the North  American Affairs Bureau. The Japan-U.S. talks took place in  September of 1993 when the prime minister attended the United  Nations General Assembly. My bureau was directly involved in  the preparations for the prime minister's attendance at the UN  General Assembly and in working out the contents of his speech.  Not confined just to Japan-U.S. relations -- for example,  President Yeltsin's visit to Japan -- direct bilateral  negotiations are handled by either the North American Affairs  Bureau or the European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau. But in such  bilateral talks, there arises matters of global scale as well as  multinational matters. My bureau will be involved in such  matters in order to coordinate them comprehensively.    On Japan's Becoming a Permanent Member of the Security  Council    [GAIKO FORUM] Newspaper reports had it that the cabinet and  Foreign Ministry maintained opposing views on Japan's becoming a  permanent member of the UN Security Council.    [Yanai] Delivering an address at the UN General Assembly was  the first opportunity for the Hosokawa cabinet to manifest its  foreign policy. Domestically, there was an address at the Diet  as well as news conferences, but externally that was the first  official speech.    The most essential problem in the making of an organization  for the new world is how to reorganize the Security Council. In  his address, the prime minister touched on this. As a matter of  fact, the Japanese view was made public in a proposal to the  United Nations secretary-general in early July near the end of  the Miyazawa cabinet. Since the basic foreign policy of the  Hosokawa cabinet was to succeed the former cabinet's,  fundamentally there were no problems.    Since it was an address designed for the General Assembly,  the expression sounded naturally different from the proposal.  Frankly speaking, it is only natural that the nuance become  different to reflect various opinions in the coalition. In that  sense, it cannot be denied there were controversies in the  process of drafting the manuscript for the General Assembly.  The mass media exaggerated it to sound as if there were basic  changes in their way of thinking, but I do not agree with that.    [GAIKO FORUM] It was reported the Foreign Ministry  positively favored Japan's becoming a permanent member, and that  Prime Minister Hosokawa was reluctant to be so hasty.    [Yanai] I do not understand the intention of that kind of  report. It is an important problem, but the nation as a whole  does not correctly comprehend the advantages or responsibilities  once Japan becomes a permanent member of the Security Council.  In that sense, I am of the opinion the matter should be  thoroughly debated domestically.    Internationally, the reorganization of the Security Council  has become a potential reality in a hurry. In the process,  international opinion is conspicuously gaining force that Japan  and Germany should be made permanent members. More than 20  nations are in favor of the idea. A great number of countries  which have not made their views public are wishing Japan and  Germany would contribute by becoming permanent members in view  of their present power status in the world. However,  representatives of developing nations have to be considered for  the position if Japan and Germany are to be members. Such  adjustments require time.    There is a consensus that several new nations should be  added  to the permanent membership, and that the permanent membership  itself should be expanded. While there is the need to  thoroughly discuss the matter domestically, there are risks in  being left behind internationally if Japan indulges in domestic  discussion because international movements are gaining speed.    [GAIKO FORUM] With reference to the dispatch of the Japanese  Self-Defense Forces to foreign countries in relation to  peacekeeping operations [PKO], there seems to be apprehension  about Japan becoming a permanent member because it may  contribute to increased military burdens. What is your opinion?    [Yanai] There are no United Nations forces as such provided  for in the UN Charter, and becoming a permanent member does not  immediately cause a nation to make its armed forces available.  As for present permanent member nations, they bear the  responsibility of providing troops or other facilities to the  United Nations only after they work out special agreements with  the UN. So long as there are no commitments, no differences  exist among permanent or nonpermanent member nations of the  Security Council and ordinary UN member nations.    Japan's Constitution has no provisions for the PKO. Member  nations have discretion as to whether they participate, using  their own judgment. A permanent member nation has no obligation  to participate. Until recently it was the rule that the five  major powers -- all permanent members -- did not participate in  the PKO. It was only in recent days that they began to  participate.    As another example, let me cite the coalition forces  during the Gulf war. At the time, use of force was authorized  by a UN Security Council resolution which Russia [then the  Soviet Union] supported, with China abstaining. Although their  standpoints were different, the Soviet Union and China did not  send troops. Therefore, in compliance with the UN Charter, an  obligation to provide military cooperation does not come about  based merely on grounds of a nation being a permanent member of  the Security Council.    Since all problems of international importance related to  peace and security are debated at the Security Council,  overwhelmingly voluminous information can be gathered. Being  present at all times will be advantageous for Japan which seeks  the right to speak on such matters as promoting peace and  disarmament.    Another point I have to make is that Japan is the second  largest contributing nation to the upkeep of the UN, only after  the United States. Furthermore, Japan is paying its share on  time in comparison to the United States which has a major amount  in arrears. Thus, Japan is the best financial contributor. In  view of the democratic principle of ""no taxation without  representation,"" it is a problem for Japan to pay for decisions  made without Japan's participation.    Task of Positively Working for Peace    [GAIKO FORUM] What sort of diplomatic tasks do you have in  mind for Japan to deal with in the future?    [Yanai] Maintaining peace is a vital problem, although it is  difficult to decide what problems should be given priority.  After World War II, Japan enjoyed peace, even though there was  no guarantee it would last forever. Pacifism thus has taken  root. Japan would never engage in aggression nor become a  military power. However, I do not think a majority of Japanese  have ever thought of such pacifism when Japan actively  contributed to creating organizations or engaged in activities  to ensure world peace. But the Persian Gulf crisis was  instrumental in initiating earnest talks about such matters and  in creating in the Japanese such a consciousness. Therefore,  Japan's major task is to make positive efforts for the cause of  peace. Then there are problems of freedom, democracy, and human  rights which are not heeded in many countries of the world, thus  destroying peace. In addition, there are problems of poverty  and maintaining standards of living, which could be defined as  the foundation or infrastructure of peace. Fortunately, Japan  has the strength to contribute to many countries in such fields,  creating such foundations of peace as human rights, humanity, or  economic development. Japan has made considerable contributions  so far in economic cooperation, and such contributions will  continue to be necessary in the future.    There is still the long-range problem of the environment. It  is further deteriorating toward the end of this century, and  Japan has to make more contributions since it has the ability to  do so. In close relation with the problem of peace, Japan has  to make parallel efforts in dealing with such problems as  disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  These are major subjects to be dealt with.    Methods of Propelling Asia-Pacific Cooperation    [GAIKO FORUM] In retrospect as regards Japanese diplomacy,  the problems of the Meiji era were said to be amendments to  unequal treaties and problems related to the Korean peninsula.  Presently, although the Soviet Union has collapsed, the  existence of Russia poses great concern for Japan. Some  American journalists are said to have predicted Japan's going  nuclear once North Korea [DPRK] possessed nuclear arms. There  are also many things to be apprehensive about as regards  post-Deng Xiaoping China. In brief, East Asia -- which is  closely related to Japan -- seems to be an unpredictable area.    [Yanai] As you said, security and peace in Northeast Asia  has been one of the most vital aspects for present as well as  past Japanese diplomacy.    After the Soviet Union collapsed, a considerably large  portion of it was inherited by Russia, and Russia itself has  created many unstable factors during its process of change. Of  course, it has not gone back to the times of czars; rather, it  is making efforts to become a democracy and a market economy.  For the sake of stability in that region, Russia wished to make  headway in that direction by all means, and Japan is determined  to assist in any way it can. At the same time, Japan will  attempt to settle territorial disputes revolving around the  so-called northern territories in order to expand equilibrium.    China has been pursuing reform and modernization, and seems  to have achieved considerable success in improving its economy.  It is most desirable for regional stability that China becomes  more open and modernized; Japan may be able to assist in that  direction.    The Japan-ROK relationship has greatly improved, but it  deserves more in view of our grueling historical past. The  North Korean regime and its economy is isolated and closed to  the outside world; it should be made a member of the  international community so the security of this area can be  greatly enhanced. Presently North Korea is suspected of  developing nuclear weapons; that question should be solved by  all means so that North Korea can become an ordinary member of  northeast Asia. It necessary to do everything possible in order  to attain that goal.    Unlike in Europe, there is little regional cooperation in  this area, much to our regret. It is true Europe worked a  considerably long time to achieve what it has today. Asian  nations need time to cooperate with other nations in the  Asia-Pacific region in a broad sense, and to establish  cooperative relations in East Asia or Northeast Asia in a  narrower sense. This is considered one of the tasks of the  Foreign Policy Bureau.    [GAIKO FORUM] Asia seems to have antipathy against the human  rights diplomacy of the United States, harboring the concept  that a dictatorship is tolerable for the sake of development.  Is it not Japan's vital role to act as go-between for the human  rights ideology of the United States and the realities of  developing nations?    [Yanai] Attitudes in Asia about human rights certainly  differ from those of the United States and Europe, nor are they  the same between the United States and Europe. It is important  to respect basic human rights, of course; peace cannot be  maintained without it. On the other hand, it is self-evident  that human rights problems in places where overcoming poverty is  the burning question are different from those in countries  enjoying a relatively high standard of living.    Therefore, as regards world standards of respecting human  rights, there is naturally a limit to which a country can  intervene by praising or condemning another country's human  rights record based on its own standards. It is better to a  certain degree to deal realistically with the problem of human  rights in order not to come into conflict with the sovereignty  of those countries in question. Asia covers a broad area, and to  a certain degree the way of thinking in some Asian countries is  comparatively moderate with respect to human rights.    Necessity of Sharing International Information    [GAIKO FORUM] Today diplomacy and internal affairs are  closely related and inseparable as in no other time in the past.  Have you anything to add in relation to domestic society?    [Yanai] In the past, diplomacy found points of contact with  domestic affairs in relation to war and peace, and in rare cases  with trade. Economic and social affairs between Japan and  foreign countries allowed them to have contacts. Contrarily,  today almost every element of both domestic and foreign  communities is interrelated. For that reason, it is necessary  to coordinate with internal affairs in order to execute good  diplomacy. Diplomacy will never succeed without the support of  the people.    [GAIKO FORUM] Other government agencies are closely related  to private enterprise or regional communities because they have  the right to authorization or licenses. However, it is pointed  out that the Foreign Ministry does not have such a domestic  foothold. Do you have any countermeasures?    [Yanai] Domestic information is not automatically gathered,  and problems related to internal affairs are not easy to  understand. In order to gather and absorb domestic information  or demands, efforts are necessary to contact other government  agencies, politicians, the mass media, and private enterprises  within the country. The Foreign Ministry has networks in  foreign countries which provide access to local feelings. But  these feelings are not necessarily understood at home. Therein  lies the difficulty, and it is necessary to make available  domestically the information gathered abroad, and not keep it in  the ministry. It has become more and more necessary to gather  information rapidly and correctly, and to share it with others.    So far I have talked mainly about the Foreign Policy Bureau  in relation to the recent reorganization of the Foreign  Ministry. But the International Information Bureau was created  at the same time. This means functions not related to  information are transferred to the Foreign Policy Bureau, and  the International Information Bureau is to exert more effort in  gathering and analyzing information. Organizational changes were  made simultaneously in order to make the information gathered  available domestically.    One of the tasks of the Foreign Policy Bureau is to become  the center of crisis management in the event of large-scale  emergencies. The Foreign Policy Bureau has the General Affairs  Division as part of its main body; this division will become the  center of the entire Foreign Ministry and will deal with large  emergencies such as the Persian Gulf war. In the past, such  functions did not exist. When emergencies arose, task forces  were quickly formed, but they were not permanent. Now that the  General Affairs Division exists under the Foreign Policy Bureau,  emergencies will be dealt with at all times.    [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.     "

The discussions  between the Greek delegation, headed by Alternate Minister of  the National Economy Ioannis Papandoniou, and the Albanian  delegation, headed by Minister of Trade and Industry Selim  Belortaja, took place in an especially warm atmosphere and were  evaluated by the two sides as conclusive benchmarks for the  advancement of bilateral economic development.    Mr. Papandoniou also met with Albanian Prime Minister A.  Meksi, Deputy Prime Minister B. Kopliku, Minister of Foreign  Affairs A. Serreqi, Minister of Energy A. Xhaja, Minister of  Finance P. Dishnica, Minister of Agriculture H. Halili, and  Minister of Transport F. Bitincka. He also met with the governor  of the Bank of Albania, D. Vrioni.    These were some of the issues discussed:    Investments: There was a discussion of problems related to  Greek investments in Albania and it was emphasized that it was  necessary to conclude the essential procedures for protecting  investments, by initialing, as soon as possible, the agreement  on exemption from double taxation. It was stated that more than  50 Greek enterprises have been established in Albania and that  concrete interest has been demonstrated in setting up many more  in various sectors, mainly as joint enterprises with Albanian  companies.    The Banking Sector: The Albanian side said that it considers  the willingness of the Greek banks to be a dynamic presence in  Albania to be a positive element and it promised that it would  reduce to 90 days the deadline for examining the applications  presented to it. At this time, it was mentioned that the  National Bank of Greece has shown interest in this matter.    Projects in the Infrastructure: The two sides agreed to  cooperate on pinpointing projects in the infrastructure,  especially in the transportation sector, with the aim of  securing financing from Community sources and, concretely, by a  PHARE [Reconstruction Aid to Poland and Hungary]/INTERREG  [transnational cooperation program] coordinated initiative.  Importance was given to the Ioannina-Kakaviie-Vlore-Durres  highway and the railroad systems of the two countries.    The Agricultural Sector: It was agreed that there should be  an evaluation of possibilities for cooperation in the  agricultural sector by means of technical assistance by both  sides in the training and specialization of cadres and technical  assistance by the Greeks in the production of products of animal  and plant origin, assistance in agricultural projects, in  irrigation, in the mechanization of agriculture, and in research  and applications in agriculture.    The Energy Sector: Cooperation should be expanded in this  sector, on the one hand, with the construction of a  hydroelectric power plant on the Vjose River on Albanian  territory on the border between the two countries (the Greek  Public Electricity Enterprise is collaborating with the Albanian  Electricity Corporation on this project), and, on the other  hand, with general cooperation of these two organizations in the  electric power sector.    Technical Assistance: The Greek side stated that, in the  framework of the bilateral technical assistance program, the  implementation of the following projects in Greece or in Albania  might be studied during 1994: technical assistance programs in  the form of seminars and laboratories, the placement of Albanian  experts in such sectors as public administration, the management  of public service enterprises, management in enterprises, in  tourism, in the banking sector, in the health field, in  agriculture, in public works, in transportation, and in  environmental protection, as well as cooperation between the  institutions of higher education of the two countries.    The two parties found that there were extensive  possibilities  for the further development of cooperation in various sectors  such as fishing, light industry, wood processing, mining,  metallurgy, transportation, shipbuilding and repair,  telecommunications, tourism, the production of construction  materials, science, technology, and so forth.

They discussed the long-term foreign policy of both  countries  as a preliminary to Italy's more active support of Slovenia's  inclusion in the European integration process, especially the  Partnership for Peace and the European Union. It was also  necessary to remove Italian suspicions that Slovenia leans too  closely to central Europe, namely, to the Germanic world.  Peterle mollified them, emphasizing the priority Slovenia places  on its relations with Italy. The minority and the property  claims issues were also on the agenda. It was agreed that a  protocol on diplomatic and accelerated economic cooperation  would be prepared shortly.     "

Vasylyuk: ""Moscow Statement Is a Compromise""  -- first paragraph is KYYIVSKA PRAVDA introduction published in  boldface]    [Text] Last weeks' equivocal events in the life of  Ukraine's foreign policy have elicited many doubts,  controversies, and hopes. It is hard to comprehend all the  subtleties of politics and understand the official position of  Kiev regarding these events without comments by a government  official or diplomat. This fact prompted a meeting between  Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk and journalists. The  conversation went beyond the protocol, and therefore, responding  to numerous questions, Mr. Tarasyuk briefed us about:    ...The Meeting Between the Ukrainian and Kazakhstani  Presidents    Unfortunately, due to the intensity of the latest events,  the  first official visit to Ukraine by Kazakhstani President  Nursultan Nazarbayev went almost unnoticed. This was a very  important event, since the visit become the first step toward  rapprochement of both presidents' positions on cooperation  between Ukraine and Kazakhstan in the framework of the CIS and  beyond this structure. It is not a secret that Leonid Kravchuk  and Nursultan Nazarbayev had differing viewpoints on an economic  union among former USSR republics and the CIS in general. After  the visit, the emphasis will apparently be placed on bilateral  relations.    It is hard not to appreciate future cooperation between  Ukraine, one of the key countries in Central-Eastern Europe, and  Kazakhstan, a leading state in Central Eurasia.    Borys Tarasyuk emphasized that this visit initiated a new  stage in Ukrainian-Kazakhstani relations. The presidents signed  a new interstate agreement. A declaration signed by the two  presidents became a milestone for bilateral relations between  our countries. The declaration emphasizes, in particular, the  necessity of establishing a universal interregional security  system ""from Vancouver to Vladivostok,"" which would include all  countries without exception, as well as preventing the  establishment of new blocs on the territory of new independent  states which have ended up in a ""security vacuum.""    The presidents reached an agreement as to concrete fields of  cooperation such as, for example, space exploration. Although  Ukraine's contribution to the development of space exploration  amounted to 40 percent of the total share during the USSR era,  the country does not have capabilities of using such a great  potential. Kazakhstan possesses testing ranges and launching  facilities.    ...The Tripartite Statement [as published] by the Ukrainian,  U.S., and Russian Presidents Signed in Moscow on 14 January    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine is convinced that  the signing of the statement conforms to the vital interests of  Ukraine. Regarding the compensation for nuclear weapons, the  statement envisions such compensation for Kazakhstan, Belarus,  and Ukraine in exchange for highly enriched uranium from nuclear  warheads.    The statement is not an international agreement and it must  be ratified by the legislatures of the three countries.  Although it is important to know what is the attitude of the  Ukrainian legislature toward the statement, this document acts  as a response to the reservations expressed by the Ukrainian  legislature toward the signing of the agreement on nuclear  weapons. The Moscow statement was signed by the presidents of  three states, and this fact put it beyond the framework of a  political statement, said Mr. Tarasyuk. It provides for concrete  actions. Each one of the three states made certain concessions.  This is a compromise among the three presidents. Ukraine  obtained a response to the question concerning security  guarantees, material and technical assistance in disarmament,  and compensation. The participants in the negotiations reached  an accord that, in case Ukraine signs documents on nuclear  weapons, a multilateral document will be signed -- Great Britain  also is willing to sign such a document.    What is the deadline for dismantling nuclear weapons  deployed  in Ukraine? This is a technical condition of nuclear warheads.  The predetermined shelf life of many nuclear warheads will  expire as early as this year, and next year this process will  have an avalanche effect.    ...The Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet    Asked by journalists whether the complex economic situation  will lead to a partition of Ukraine into separate territories,  particularly with regard to the Crimea, Borys Tarasyuk replied  that the international community, including Russia, recognized  Ukraine as an independent state with defined borders in 1991.  The UN Security Council recognized as groundless the 9 July  statement issued by the Russian legislature on the status of  Sevastopol. The tripartite statement signed by the Ukrainian,  U.S., and Russian presidents says that the United States and  Russia respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and existing  borders.    Speaking about the prospects for the withdrawal of the  Russian part of the Black Sea Fleet from Ukraine, the Ukrainian  Deputy Foreign Minister stated that the Black Sea Fleet, de  jure, remains under the authority of the Ukrainian and Russian  presidents. The political atmosphere between our countries has  improved, following the Moscow summit. There are certain  grounds to expect that the Black Sea Fleet issue will be  resolved already this year.    Certain political leaders of the Crimea, noted Mr. Tarasyuk,  were looking for Russia's support. Nevertheless, we do not have  any evidence to claim that Russia's Government rendered any help  to political forces in the Crimea.    The issue of leasing by Russia certain onshore facilities  located on Ukrainian territory still remains on the agenda.  However, this does not concern the city of Sevastopol but only  several facilities.    ...The Nonbloc Status Proclaimed by Ukraine and Perspectives  for Cooperation With NATO    Ukraine announced its nonbloc status in the 1990 declaration  on state sovereignty. Since then, the geopolitical situation  has changed. Although the Warsaw Pact does not exist, there  still is NATO, and new military-political alliances have  appeared on Asian territories. Given these circumstances,  Ukraine could end up between two military blocs. Today, we  remain in the so-called ""security vacuum."" Cooperation with  NATO, CSCE, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, does not  contradict our main goals.    The authors of the U.S. initiative ""Partnership for Peace""  believe that such cooperation does not mean membership in NATO  but rather bilateral cooperation. Security guarantees,  essential for every country, should include our own armed  forces, cooperation with neighboring states, and participation  in international security systems or military-political  organizations.    Providing these explanations, Borys Tarasyuk recalled  consultations with government experts from all East and Central  European countries conducted at a meeting devoted to  establishing a security system, which was held in Pushcha-Ozerna  in the vicinity of Kiev. The experts met to find ways of  implementing Leonid Kravchuk's initiative for establishing a  stability zone in Central-Eastern Europe and the U.S. initiative  ""Partnership for Peace."" The main goal of the consultations was  the rapprochement of positions, searching for compromises and  common approaches to security issues. There will be another  round of such consultations, which are eventually aimed at  signing a multilateral agreement on the security system in  Central and Eastern Europe. In the best case, noted Borys  Tarasyuk, such an agreement should be signed already this year.     "

The officials said the two countries are expected to  announce  the contents of the agreement at a summit meeting in Washington  between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Friday.    The agreement covers bilateral exchanges of information in  17  areas, including the development of technology to control  automobile emissions, a system for using integrated circuits to  examine commuter tickets, and a railway signaling system which  relies on satellites.    The magnetically levitated transport system is seen as a  possible superfast alternative to conventional road and rail  transport.

This week he embraced Mr Saddam and said he thought they could do a deal. In the intervening days, of course, the Iraqi army had all but crushed the post-war uprisings in Kurdistan and in the Shia Moslem towns of southern Iraq. But Mr Jalal Talabani, the veteran Kurdish guerrilla leader and politician, has stunned many of his supporters with a U-turn so remarkable that it stands out even in a nationalist movement famous for its shifting alliances and loyalties. Mr Talabani, now a grey-haired 57-year-old, has alternately fought and negotiated with his enemies since he joined the late Mullah Mustafa Barzani's Kurdish Democratic party at the age of 12. He split from the KDP in 1964, and Barzani - hardly a man of unchanging allegiances himself - once sneeringly described him as 'an agent for everybody'. In the current negotiations with the Iraqi regime, however, Mr Talabani is not alone, although it was he who spoke for the Kurdish delegation this week after the first round of talks. The Kurdish side included Mr Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (which he founded in 1975), the KDP (now led by Mustafa's son, Masoud Barzani, who is expected to lead the next round of discussions) and other members of the Iraqi Kurdistan Front. Mr Talabani and his fellow Kurds are taking an extraordinary political risk by talking to President Saddam at such a time and by urging Kurds to return home when their long-term safety from government reprisals is not assured, but they feel they have no choice. They do not want the nearly 2m Kurds who have fled to the borders with Iran and Turkey to become permanent refugees. At the same time they believe the west has accepted that Mr Saddam will stay in power, and they want to squeeze concessions from the Iraqi leader while he is still weak in the aftermath of the war over Kuwait. 'We are alone,' Mr Talabani said at rebel headquarters in Shaqlawa after his meeting with Mr Saddam. 'We have no friends . . . The Iraqi government wanted to crush us, but was unable to do so. And we wanted to overthrow the government but have not been able to do so.' So the negotiations continue. Nobody would have been surprised at Mr Talabani's decision to talk to his enemies in the Iraqi government, or at his subsequent optimism about the prospects for democracy in Iraq and autonomy for Kurdistan, had he not been so widely admired as an astute and prudent politician. Many Shia Moslems are furious at what they see as Mr Talabani's betrayal of the 17-party Iraqi opposition coalition which is seeking to overthrow Mr Saddam, but his friends and allies are confident that he is not about to throw caution to the winds. 'I don't think he can be deceived or be made to agree to something that does not accord with his principles,' says Mr Ibrahim Ahmed, his father-in-law. Mr Talabani, who is married with two sons, is as relaxed in a western suit and sitting on a sofa as he is in baggy trousers and turban sitting on the ground surrounded by his pesh merga (the Kurdish guerrillas, or 'those who face death'). Years ago he often used to harangue his PUK colleagues and threaten to resign as leader if he did not get his way. He would fling down his revolver, tell his colleagues to do what they wanted without him and make as if to leave. They invariably urged him to stay, handed back his revolver, and yielded to his wishes. But one day, so the story goes, when times were hard in Kurdistan before the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, an angry pesh merga bodyguard pointed his Kalashnikov at Mr Talabani's stomach and told him to pick up the revolver and take responsibility for the mess into which he had led the Kurdish people. Mr Talabani retrieved his gun. 'Since then he's stopped doing that,' says one of his acquaintances. A fluent English-speaker, the exiled Mr Talabani has impressed his interlocutors in the west and elsewhere with a mixture of determination, moderation, honesty and humour. 'He was always a shrewd politician and he has only one main occupation - the Kurdish problem,' says Mr Kamran Karadaghi, the Kurdish foreign editor of the Arabic newspaper al-Hayat. 'When he speaks about the Kurdish cause he talks with the same enthusiasm and emotion as he did when he was 15 years old.' His early differences with the Barzani clan arose partly because he and his leftist allies saw the Barzanis as tribal and backward, and to this day Mr Talabani's supporters say he has a much better grasp of international affairs and their relevance for the Kurdish problem than most of his rivals. He was particularly anguished when the Iranian government used Iraqi Kurds based in Iran to fight Iranian Kurds during the Iran-Iraq war. Like many Kurds, he espouses ideals of cross-border Kurdish nationalism but has come to accept that complete independence is not a goal which can be achieved in the teeth of opposition from Turkey, Iran and Iraq. His aim now is an autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan within a democratic Iraq, an ambition so acceptable to Turkey that he was invited to meet Turkish government officials in March. He is already close to the Syrians and sometimes lives in Damascus. As for the Iraqis, this is the third time that Mr Talabani has done serious business with the government in Baghdad, although this time the stakes are higher. Since he last met President Saddam in 1984, the Iraqi government has gassed to death the residents of Halabja and all but finished its programme of depopulating the Kurdish countryside by demolishing villages and deporting the inhabitants. Some Kurds are inordinately proud of the 1970 autonomy agreement reached with Baghdad by Mustafa Barzani, and it is on this agreement that the proposed deal between the Kurds and the Iraqi government is to be based. Kurds admire the 1970 accord because it represents a far greater series of concessions from a central government than the Kurds have won in Iran or Turkey, but it remains a piece of paper of the kind not normally respected by Mr Saddam. Mr Talabani and his allies are nevertheless hoping to put it into practice and to enforce it by means of international guarantees. 'I have never seen in all this time such a positive spirit, such a positive climate, such positive ground for negotiation on Iraqi Kurdistan,' said Mr Talabani after meeting Mr Saddam. His supporters are praying that his political acumen has not deserted him.  The Financial Times   London Page 6 Illustration (Omitted).  "

By announcing on 6 April that Russia would join the  program in the near future, President Yeltsin temporarily put an  end to the argument in Russia. It is reported that Russia is  likely to sign the program's framework agreement on 21 April.    The ""partnership for peace"" program was approved at a NATO  summit meeting early this year. Its main contents are: NATO  will not be expanded for the time being, but will establish a  partnership with countries in Eastern Europe and the  Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS] so that they can ""make  a gradual transition toward NATO member status.""    Russia welcomes the NATO ""partnership for peace"" program,  holding that it will prevent another split in Europe, but that  it is not fully in keeping with Russia's interests. The Russian  Government is sharply divergent on whether it should join the  program. The Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry hold:  Russia cannot prevent NATO from developing relations with East  European countries. If Russia disregards this reality, it will  be excluded from the new European security system.  Participation in the program will be conducive to coordinating  its relations with the United States and other Western countries  and it can transform this program internally to make it conform  to Russia's interest. Russian parliamentary leaders and others,  however, are opposed to hurriedly joining the NATO mechanism on  the grounds that it is out of keeping with Russia's status as a  big power and that it will probably result in Russia losing its  room for diplomatic maneuvering and its right to carry out arms  trade and hamper strategic cooperation within the CIS. The  parliament's International Affairs Commission approved a  resolution saying that only when NATO accords Russia ""special  status"" will it join the program.    Under such circumstances, while announcing that Russia would  join the program, President Yeltsin emphatically pointed out:  Russia's partnership with NATO should ""be in keeping with  Russia's status and role in world and European affairs and with  Russia's military strength and nuclear status"" and ""be different  from other countries' relations with NATO in terms of scope and  contents."" Judging by the Russian leader's statement, the  ""special status"" Russia is seeking in the NATO program generally  includes the following aspects: allowing Russia to attend NATO  membership meetings and join in making important policy  decisions; recognizing Russia's ""special responsibilities""  toward the former Soviet region; and taking into consideration  Russia's interest on such issues as military transformation and  defense structures. Moreover, Russia also wants to link its  participation in ""partnership for peace"" with its participation  in the G-7 economic group so as to get more economic aid.    Russia's demand for a ""special relationship"" poses a  difficult problem for NATO. Acceding to its demand is  tantamount to a recognition that the CIS belongs to Russia's  sphere of influence, thus upsetting the course of Eastern  European states joining the program. Poland, the Czech  Republic, and Ukraine have warned NATO that ""accommodating  Russia"" is likely to scuttle the entire ""partnership for peace""  program.    In fact, NATO and Russia have their own axes to grind. The  United States and its allies are attempting to fill the  ""security vacuum"" in Eastern Europe and establish a new system  of European security, with NATO as the nucleus. Russia,  however, is worried that NATO will place Eastern Europe in its  sphere of influence and thus threaten Russia's security  interests. Therefore, it wants to maintain Eastern Europe as a  buffer zone, with Russia and the West guaranteeing its security.  It wants to develop a partnership for Europe as a whole through  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council. This actually reflects the  strategic differences between the two parties. Consequently,  even if Russia signs the ""partnership for peace"" program, it  will still bargain hard with the West about the essence of this  program.     "
0,FT924-8113 ,"FT924-8113 _AN-CKLB2AF1FT 921112   FT  12 NOV 92 / Rules switch on Iraq arms sales kept secret      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   BRITISH government ministers agreed in 1989 to withhold from parliament details of a decision to reinterpret the rules banning the sale of defence-related equipment to Iraq. The agreement, revealed in previously-classified Whitehall documents, is likely to add fuel to the political furore over the illicit defence trade with Iraq. The documents were made available to the court during the unsuccessful prosecution of three former directors of Matrix Churchill, the Midlands-based machine tool company. The 500 pages of documents reveal consistent efforts by ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry to weaken or remove the official guidelines. The policy was opposed, with only limited success, by Mr William Waldegrave, then a Foreign Office minister and now a member of Mr Major's cabinet. The papers include several specific references to a decision in 1989 to withhold from MPs details of the relaxation in interpretation of the rules which had been set out in 1985 by Sir Geoffrey Howe, then foreign secretary. They show that while the government was committed publicly to an even-handed approach as regards defence-related exports to Iran and Iraq, in practice the regime applied to Baghdad was significantly more liberal than that imposed on Tehran. The relaxation for exports to Iraq was agreed in December 1988 - some 5 months after a ceasefire agreement had ended the Iran-Iraq war. The shift in policy was subsequently used by the DTI to justify its backing for the export of the machine tools at the heart of the failed prosecution of Matrix Churchill. In April 1989, ministers decided on a form of words to be used in parliament which was broad enough to encompass the shift but would not signal to MPs that their approach had changed. The phrasing was settled on in a meeting between Mr Waldegrave, Lord Trefgarne, then defence procurement minister, and Mr Alan Clark, the then trade minister. Mr Waldegrave successfully resisted pressure from his colleagues for abolition of the Howe guidelines. But his private secretary's summary of the meeting's conclusions, set out in a letter to Mr Clark dated April 27 1989, recorded: 'We agreed that we should continue to interpret the guidelines more flexibly in respect of Iraq, as we have done in practice since the end of last year; but that we should revert to a stricter interpretation for Iran, along the lines which operated before the ceasefire.' The document adds: 'It was preferable not to have to announce publicly any change in them (the guidelines).' The form of words to be used if ministers were 'pressed' on the issue in parliament was: 'The guidelines on the export of defence equipment to Iran and Iraq are kept under constant review, and are applied in the light of prevailing circumstances, including the ceasefire and developments in the peace negotiations.' It is understood that the ministers decided that as the guidelines were being re-interpreted rather than abolished, there was no formal obligation to tell MPs. A few days earlier Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then prime minister, had told the House of Commons: 'The government have not changed their policy on defence sales to Iraq.' Other documents reveal Whitehall's sensitivity over the new formulation agreed for use in parliament. The minute of a meeting of officials belonging to the Interdepartmental Committee on defence sales to Iraq and Iran says because of the different treatment of the two countries it was 'essential' that departments 'consulted closely' before answering questions from MPs.

The two sides pointed out with satisfaction that in recent  years the two countries have established effective cooperation  in the political, economic, trade, scientific, technological,  cultural, military, and public security spheres and are willing  to further expand and strengthen their cooperation in all these  fields.    Both sides reiterated that they would stick to the  principles  laid down in the joint statement of 18 December 1992 on the base  for Sino-Russian relations, and they are determined to set their  eyes on the 21st century to move Sino-Russian relations into a  new stage of development. The two sides share a firm belief  that the maintaining of a long-term, stable, good-neighborly,  and friendly relations characterized by mutually beneficial  cooperation accords with the fundamental interest of the two  countries and their peoples and constitutes an important factor  in promoting peace, stability, and development in the  Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole.    Further advancing the cooperation in the economic, trade,  and  scientific and technological fields between China and Russia was  the main theme of the talks. The two sides spoke positively of  the achievements made in recent years by the two countries in  their mutually beneficial cooperation in these fields. Both  sides held that there are huge potentials in developing the  Sino-Russian economic ties and trade. The two countries are  willing to take full advantage of their geographical closeness  of a common border and their mutually supplementary economies to  vigorously develop and expand cooperation in these fields on the  basis of equality and mutual benefit so that cooperation will  reach a higher level which is compatible with the Sino-Russian  good-neighborly and friendly relations and with the economic  potentials of the two countries. For this reason, the two sides  conducted serious discussion and reached a wide-ranging common  understanding on such questions as new areas, new forms and  prospects of further cooperation, how to enhance cooperation  efficiency, and how to improve infrastructure. The two sides  agreed to participate in the construction of some bilateral and  multilateral projects, including the ""continental bridge""  linking Europe and Asia. The two sides reiterated that the two  countries will continue to strengthen their military-technology  cooperation under the conditions of abiding by their  international obligations.    The two sides held that border and inter-regional economic  cooperation is an important part of Sino-Russian economic and  trade relations. The sides agreed to further improve the  relevant legal basis and to promote border and inter-regional  trade, joint business operations, investment, cooperation, and  other forms of ties.    The two sides positively appraised the ongoing negotiations  on borders and on cutting the military presence in the border  areas and enhancing mutual trust in the military field; and  agreed to stick to the provisions in the agreement on the  eastern section of the Sino-Russian border, be willing to  continue talks on other leftover border issues, and speed up  preparation for the agreement on western section of the  Sino-Russian border. The two sides believe that it is of great  significance to reach an agreement as soon as possible on  cutting the military presence by both sides in border areas and  enhancing mutual trust in the military field.    Both sides believe that further promoting an atmosphere of  peace, good-neighborliness, and cooperation in the border areas  between the two countries is conducive to enhancing mutual trust  and mutual understanding between the two countries and to  maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.    The two sides comprehensively exchanged views and enhanced  mutual understanding on economic reform issues. The two sides  share quite a few common points of view with regard to the  process of reform; and believe that despite the different  conditions of the two countries, the introduction of each  other's theories and practice in economic reform and the  exchange of experience are beneficial.    The leaders of the two countries exchanged views on the  current international situation and some major international  issues and held identical or similar views in many aspects. The  two sides agreed to reinforce constructive cooperation in many  respects of regional and international affairs and regard  cooperation as an important factor in ensuring stability and  security in Asia and in comprehensively improving the  international environment. The two sides pointed out the great  significance of multilateral economic cooperation in Northeast  Asia and the Asia-Pacific Region, and their willingness to  support each other in participating in Asia-Pacific economic  cooperation.    In addition Beijing, chairman Chernomyrdin and his party  also  visited Shanghai and Dalian. The distinguished Russian guests  were accorded a warm and friendly reception wherever they went.    Both sides agreed to continue and develop positive dialogue  at all levels, including the summit level, and consider dialogue  to be of great significance in enhancing mutual understanding  and mutual trust and promoting the constant development of  Sino-Russian good-neighborly, friendly, mutually beneficial, and  cooperative relations. On behalf of the Government of the  Russian Federation, chairman Chernomyrdin invited Premier Li  Peng of the People's Republic of China to pay an official visit  to Russia in 1995. Premier Li Peng accepted the invitation with  pleasure. The date of the visit will be decided later through  diplomatic channels.     "

The Americans, for instance, understand  very well that any prospective economic niche will be filled by  their competitors. Even Austria did not remain out of the  action. Its government delegation signed an agreement on  construction of various communications projects.    I cannot cease being amazed by the powers of observation and  wit of my friend Linh Van Nhan. A specialist on Russia, he  regularly watches information programs on the ""Ostankino""  channel. And once in a while comments on them. His latest  comment: ""The ghost of the unforgettable Leonid Ilich has  returned to the Kremlin.""    ""What makes you think so?"" I ask, perplexed.    ""From watching Clinton's visit,"" replies Linh Van Nhan,  without blinking an eye. ""You know very well how such historic  visits used to be covered in the past on the 'Vremya' program.""    Needless to say, the dean of the Russian language department  had me flat on my back. True, in those ""stagnation times"" that  have already become part of mythology, when Linh Van Nhan was a  student at Voronezh University, Central Television was under the  direction of Suslov, the country's chief ideologist. Naturally,  all events involving our general secretary ""for life"" were  presented as historic milestones. Whenever someone visited  Moscow, ""Vremya"" expanded beyond any size.    For the Vietnamese press, television, and radio that are not  infected with ""Ostankino"" syndrome, the main news is still  closer to Vietnam.    For instance, much has been written about the visit to the  Vietnamese capital of prominent French political figure Jacques  Chirac. The mayor of Paris, who has his sights on the  presidency, decided--as did current president Mitterrand--to  build a solid bridge with the countries of Indochina, on the  reasonable assumption that in the future they will take their  proper place in the dynamically developing Asia-Pacific  corridor. In conversation with the Vietnamese leadership, Chirac  emphasized many times that France attaches priority significance  to developing relations with Vietnam. And this is not a mere  declaration. In terms of investment in the Vietnamese economy,  France is third in the world after Hong Kong and Taiwan, and  first in Europe.    One of the permanent foreign policy topics in the Vietnamese  mass media is the host of American delegations that have  descended on Vietnam. Congressmen, senators, and businessmen  have begun to frequent it. Still, business rules politics, no  matter how the latter may try to subordinate it. Representatives  of IBM, General Motors, ATT, Kodak, and a number of other  companies held consultations with Vietnamese Deputy Prime  Minister Phan Van Khai as part of the research group of American  industrialists and political scientists.    At a meeting with journalists, Ho The Lan, a representative  of the SRV Ministry of Foreign Affairs press department, read  out a long list of foreign delegations planning to visit  Vietnam. There were no delegations from Russia and the CIS  countries on that list. I have to admit that I am tired of  repeating the reasoning regarding the potential benefits of  cooperation with Vietnam. Therefore, today I will not do so. Let  those Russian officials who visited Vietnam last year do it.  They promised cooperation to the Vietnam side. And they were not  the only ones. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin himself talked to  Vietnamese Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Manh Cam last fall  in Moscow. It is hard to tell, though, how much these promises  are worth.    But should we become like those Russian diplomats in Hanoi  who, in a pique of temper, accused local journalists of not  being objective in their coverage of Russian realities?    The discouraged Vietnamese colleagues, deprived of the  propaganda materials they used to get from the now-abolished  Hanoi bureau of RIA-NOVOSTI, are hurt by this allegation flung  at them by the diplomats.    ""Is what we publish about Russia or show on television not  true?"" one of the journalists asked me.    ""Unfortunately, it is,"" I replied.     "

By 1993, urban-suburban joint economic entities of various  types have reached 3,746 from a mere 520 manufacturing  businesses a decade ago.    The set-up also expanded to other areas such as scientific  and technological cooperation and business with overseas  ventures.    In the industrial sector, there are 200 subsidiary member  factories in the outskirts now. The suburban establishments are  able to provide more space and labor as well as capital the  urban factories need in order to expand.    A survey shows that close to 20,000 specialists from  Beijing's institutions of higher learning and research  institutes are working for the suburban enterprises. The  technology input has helped invigorating the rural industries by  diversifying the product mix and lifting the quality to a high  level.    Last year, the value of industrial output in urban and  suburban joint ventures amounted to the tune of 15.5 billion  yuan, up 48.2 percent over 1992.

The two  nations believe that the dispute over the islands should be  settled immediately to prevent it from becoming a ""thorn"" that  may undermine close bilateral relations.    Malaysia and Indonesia agree that there are no obstacles  standing in the way of strengthening good relations and further  expanding cooperation in any field. We are convinced that  recriminations and heated arguments over international problems  will not bring any benefit to either party, but would rather  open the possibility of outsiders interfering in their internal  affairs -- something which may complicate the situation. Of  course, many parties are awaiting to take advantage of a rift in  relations between Malaysia and Indonesia, which belong to one  family. We are convinced that the strong solidarity of the  Malaysian and Indonesian people and leaders cannot be easily  overshadowed or eroded by self-interest or the interest of any  party who does not understand the basis of the strong  relationship, although the two nations are separated by the  Straits of Malacca. Although the brotherly relationship was  once undermined by a confrontation, their historical and  cultural ties have since eliminated any useless prejudices. It  is with this intimate relationship that we seriously want to  establish a new force to face challenges and tackle various  economic and political problems to serve our common interests.    Nevertheless, we feel that the island dispute has been  dragging on unwarrantably although the matter has not been  raised at the international level. Meetings and discussions  have taken place alternately, but there has been no agreement to  settle the matter. Indeed, it is not logical that the close  relationship may be affected simply by the dispute over two  small islands. As the islands are small, we hope that only few  meetings will be needed to settle the matter in a very short  time. Will lengthy discussions mean that the two sides are not  being serious? Perhaps the postponement of a ministerial  meeting from last Saturday until next year was indicative of  their lack of determination and seriousness. The islands have  commercial value and can be developed into tourist resorts and  marine sports centers. Both nations recognize this potential  and any delayed solution will surely inflict financial losses to  both sides.    Nevertheless, we are convinced that Malaysia and Indonesia  strongly hope that something positive will come out of a  three-day meeting of the Joint Working Group on Sipadan and  Ligitan Islands due to start in Jakarta on 7 September. We are  strongly convinced that this trivial matter will be settled in a  spirit of harmony and compromise if we are serious about seeking  a solution. Izhar Ibrahim, director general for political  affairs of the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs [name  and title as published], who headed a 29-member Indonesian  delegation, said that his country was committed to seeking  whatever means is available to settle the dispute in a spirit of  friendship.    In fact, the two nations have agreed on many matters at the  negotiating table. Let's see cooperation in the automobile and  aircraft industries, which have not only demonstrated the  expertise of the Malay nations but have also contributed to  ASEAN efforts to further enhance cooperation in Southeast Asia.  We are also happy over Indonesia's full support for the  establishment of the East Asian Economic Caucus [EAEC] and  commitment to the establishment of a growth triangle covering  Sumatera in Indonesia, southern Thailand, and the northern part  of peninsular Malaysia, and over the fact that Indonesia has  increased the frequency of sea and air traffic between the  peninsula and Sumatera, encouraged the development of the  financial services industry, and signed an investment guarantee  agreement with Malaysia. Cooperation in trade, information,  science and technology, agriculture, and tourism can be further  developed to cover various new issues.     "

The assertion of the business quarter appears, at first  sight, to have propriety in logic. First, in the event that the  labor- intensive light industry of South Korea, whose  competitive power is falling behind with each passing day, is  moved to the North or subcontracts with the North Korean side,  production costs would be drastically reduced. In other words,  as North Korea has cheap, good-quality, well-trained labor power  in abundance, it would offer an excellent opportunity to  revitalize our light industry. In addition, since the price of  land in North Korea is not burdensome, one's investment of  capital in North Korea would undoubtedly be successful.    Besides, some businessmen in the South believe that when  they  expand their enterprises by properly managing their business in  North Korea, their influence and pressure would certainly help  the North Korean regime turn to the moderate line from the  hardline.    The theory put forward by the academic circle pertaining to  the separation of economic cooperation from the nuclear issue  appears to be emphasizing only the idealistic point of view. In  other words, since North Korea is suffering a serious food  shortage, we should seek improved relations with the North by  starting an agricultural exchange first, thus separating it from  complex political and security issues. This theory stresses  that we should also enable the Korea Agricultural Corporation  and other various farmers' organizations to come forward for  agricultural cooperation with the North.    Another pretext put forward by the academic circle for  promoting economic cooperation is the urgency in the long- and  short-range economic development plans of North Korea.  According to a recent report, research organizations and  advisory organs in the United States and Japan, not our country,  received requests from the North Korean Government for working  out long- and short-range plans for national land development  and economic development in North Korea.    If this report is true, unique, independent plans, which are  not linked with the South Korean economic structure and land  utilization situation, would be adopted. As a result, even  after our nation is reunified, economic division would persist,  thus hindering the nation from becoming one country in  actuality. This would cause the people's concern. Therefore,  the assertion stresses, economic exchange with North Korea  should be realized even before the nuclear problem is resolved.    All these allegations sound reasonable at first glance.  However, if we evaluate them in a cool-headed manner, we will  come to realize that these are indeed dangerous and immature.  There is no change, first of all, in the Kim Il-song  dictatorship whatsoever, and North Korea is overflowing with the  so-called chuche idea, stressing that ""Korea is one and it is  under the benevolence of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il."" Even if  our business firms and organizations propose economic  cooperation, it would not be accepted so easily as we expect.  This would be possible only through the benevolence of Kim  Il-song and his son. Thus, our proposal would be reduced to  merely a ""begging.""    The North Korean regime is attempting to use the  humanitarian  standpoint heightened in our side as a weak point. The North  Korean regime, in an emergency, would apply various restrictions  to our business firms that advanced to North Korea, and would  threaten with such disadvantageous restrictions in a bid to use  them as a negotiation card.    What is important is, above all, for our government, while  maintaining a cooperative system with world nations, to urge the  North Korean regime to make a change in its policies. However,  North Korea will not make such change voluntarily. The change  would be possible only when North Korea hangs out a white flag  toward the whole world or when internal confusion occurs within  its system.    Therefore, the act of hastening economic cooperation with  North Korea will only reduce the probability of its change, and  will not be helpful in achieving reunification.     "

Referring to the visit to Saudi Arabia of the U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher, `TEHRAN TIMES' said the visit has two  objectives.    The first, said the paper, is to speed up the process of  signing the Gaza-Jericho peace accord despite popular  Palestinian opposition, and the second is to justify the illegal  presence of the U.S. in the Persian Gulf and push the sale of  U.S.-made arms to members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation  Council (PGCC).    U.S. policy in the Middle East is to legitimize the presence  of the Zionist entity in the region at any cost, said the paper  noting that America must realize that even the Palestinian  Liberation Organization (PLO) has reached the conclusion that no  peace will be achieved unless `all Palestinians' unanimously  accept the terms.

I sincerely welcome you to ancient Kiev in the hospitable  land of Ukraine. I am confident that today's meeting will play  an important role in strengthening relations and promoting  greater understanding understanding among the countries of the  Black Sea region.    I am especially pleased that Ukraine was chosen as the site  of the second session of the Parliamentary Assembly of Member  States of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization. This  event is of truly symbolic significance to our country, because  tomorrow marks the second anniversary of the day when the Act of  Proclamation of the Independence of Ukraine was ratified by a  national referendum. Despite the shortness of the period during  which we have been building our statehood and setting our own  foreign policy course, the process by which Ukraine has gained  international recognition as an independent state and joined the  world community of nations as an equal is now virtually complete.    In July of this year, the Ukrainian Parliament approved the  ""Principal Directions of Ukraine's Foreign Policy""--a document  that sets forth the fundamental national interests of our  country, the goals of our foreign policy, and the principles  underlying this policy. These principles are based on the  universally recognized norms and principles of international  law, the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, and the Paris  Charter for the new Europe.    Our foreign policy is based on pursuing an open foreign  policy and a desire to cooperate with all interested states. We  are building our bilateral and multilateral relations with other  countries and international organizations on the principles of  voluntarism, mutual understanding, equality, mutual respect, and  noninterference in domestic affairs. Ukraine also adheres to the  principle of the indivisibility of international peace and  international security and believes that a threat to the  security of any one state carries with it a threat to  international security as a whole. Our country's approach in  foreign policy is ""security for Ukraine through security for  all.""    One of the key principles of Ukraine's foreign policy is our  desire to attain nonnuclear status in the future. Recently the  Supreme Council took a step forward in this direction, although  I am convinced that this was only the first step and that we  must return to this issue.    Our policy must be consistent and predictable. To make this  possible, apart from all else, we need the support of the  world's countries, understanding of our difficult situation, and  assistance in ""clearing away the impediments"" that were created  when the USSR collapsed, including those involving nuclear arms.    We emphasize: in following the path of nuclear disarmament,  Ukraine expects to receive national security guarantees from the  U.S., Russia, and other nuclear states, as well as the financial  and other assistance that we need to destroy our nuclear  weapons. These are not conditions, as some would like to portray  them, but a foundation without which the actual process of  destroying nuclear weapons may become complicated. We simply do  not have the money for this. Our economic situation is  difficult. We look upon our nuclear arms not as weapons but as  material assets and ask for compensation. I consider this to be  a normal demand.    The decision of the Supreme Council confirms that Ukraine's  policy to attain nonnuclear status remains unchanged, and all  the Supreme Council's earlier decisions on this issue remain in  force.    This is the most important thing. We have to move forward,  based on today's circumstances, focusing our attention not only  on criticism of the Supreme Council's decision, but also on  constructive actions.    This will produce profitable results and open up the way to  new steps in nuclear disarmament. I believe that this unchanging  position will enable us to find a solution that will serve the  interests of the Ukrainian people, those of the world community,  and the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons in the  world.    Esteemed guests and participants in the session!    Ukraine is interested in developing mutually advantageous  bilateral relations with other countries and in expanding her  role in regional cooperation and in the work of the United  Nations and of other international organizations of a universal  nature.    In our opinion, Ukraine's geopolitical location, the long  history and cultural traditions of her people, her rich natural  resources, and her large economic, scientific-technical, and  intellectual potential not only allow Ukraine to view a European  orientation as paramount in her foreign policy, but also to play  an important role in safeguarding Europe's political and  economic stability.    Having a deep-seated sense of herself as a European state,  Ukraine wants to move as fast as possible ""to build strong  bridges"" of cooperation with the countries along the entire  perimeter of her borders.    It is a universally recognized truth that the international  position of any state is judged primarily by the relations that  it enjoys with its neighbors. That is why we have taken an  unequivocal stand on this matter: we regard all of Ukraine's  neighbors as priority partners.    An important component of this approach is regional and  subregional cooperation. It is quite natural and essential in  international relations to look for points of convergence and  common interests with close neighbors, in particular with the  kind of neighbors that the countries of the Black Sea region  are. The notion of an opening to the sea as a country's ""window""  in one direction or another has now become commonplace. For  Ukraine, the Black Sea serves as such an opening to the  Mediterranean region, the Near East, and North Africa, not to  mention the states of the Black Sea region.    Ukraine--and it gives me great pleasure to underscore  this--was one of the initiators of the creation of the Black Sea  Economic Cooperation Organization. The history of relations  between countries in this region is measured not in years but in  centuries. Since the earliest history of the Pontus Euxinus, or  the ""Hospitable Sea"" as our ancestors called the Black Sea,  there have been close and vigorous trade links and friendly  relations among the peoples living along its coasts. Of course,  there have also been difficult periods, but the wars and  conflicts always passed and were followed by periods of peaceful  cooperation.    Today, as never before, there exist exceptionally favorable  conditions for the countries of this region to develop mutually  advantageous cooperation in all spheres of interstate relations.  By coordinating our efforts towards this end, we can transform  the Black Sea region into an important area of cooperation in  the new Europe.    In today's difficult times, when crisis phenomena in the  economies of many countries are being exacerbated by domestic  political conflicts or even armed hostilities, coordinated  actions, support, and mutual assistance are especially  important. We need to keep strengthening the ties that evolved  over the centuries in the Black Sea region and developing them  on a new basis that takes into account the new historical  realities.    We are very interested in developing friendly relations and  close cooperation with the countries of the Black Sea region. It  is Ukraine's position that the realization of the plan to  transform the Black Sea into a zone of peace and multilateral  economic cooperation will in a short time create conditions  conducive to expanding mutually advantageous relations in such  areas as sea transport, the development of the fuel and energy  and the agroindustrial complexes, health care, and the  pharmaceuticals, food, and processing industries.    In our view, the progressive growth of multilateral economic  cooperation in the Black Sea region will create the most  favorable conditions for establishing a Black Sea foreign trade  and investment bank. We should make an immediate start at  further institutionalizing this cooperation, establishing  permanent commissions and working groups to resolve various  important issues.    To promote the expansion of political and economic relations  within the framework of the Istambul Declaration we need to work  out an additional contractual and legal basis for multilateral  economic cooperation aimed at fostering broad trade and economic  links, the growth of entrepreneurship and business ties at the  state level by making possible the free movement of goods and  services. The Black Sea is already a zone that is free of  nuclear weapons. The reduction of military activity by the  countries of this region could be the next positive step towards  creating a zone of peace, stability, and prosperity along the  Black Sea coast. Unfortunately, today the waves of the Black Sea  also carry human blood that is being shed along its shores.    The wider the horizons of cooperation within the framework  of  the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization become--in terms  of economic relations, parliamentary contacts, cooperation in  the sphere of culture--the less tolerance there will be for the  existence of ""hot spots"" in this region. Our common and  paramount goal is to put an end to the terrible advance of war.    Expanding economic cooperation in the Black Sea zone is the  most effective means of strengthening trust among the countries  of the Black Sea basin. The development of commercial and  economic ties, increasing investments in the economies of  neighboring countries, establishing the most favorable possible  regimes for trade, and participating in joint economic projects  will promote increased economic interdependence among states,  thereby objectively reducing the threat of potentially new  conflicts among them involving the use of military force.    At the same time, the expansion of mutually advantageous  bilateral and multilateral economic relations is being hampered  by the fact that the Black Sea zone of economic cooperation is  still a zone of military conflicts. In those places where blood  is being shed, other, so far unresolved, problems in the  bilateral relations of a number of countries, including the  inviolability of borders, pose a potential threat to peace and  stability in the region.    Given the military hostilities that are continuing inside  some countries or between countries, as well as the tension that  remains in the relations between some neighboring states, the  growth of military activity in the Black Sea and its coastal  regions is cause for grave concern. Recognizing that economic  cooperation is not possible unless a climate of trust is  established among the member states of the Black Sea Economic  Cooperation zone and stability and security in the region are  assured, Ukraine proposes implementing the following measures to  build trust in the military and political spheres:    If this formula is accepted, the necessary details can be  worked out:    1. That provisions for holding naval exercises be worked out  with a view to reducing them, as well as reducing the number of  military vessels in peacetime, thereby helping to reduce  hostilities.    2. That a declaration on the sanctity and inviolability of  the sea borders of the countries in this basin be adopted.    3. That the countries of the Black Sea region sign a  memorandum renouncing the use of naval forces, either directly  or in other ways, against one another.    4. That the countries of the Black Sea basin adopt a  declaration committing them to refuse the use of their territory  for acts of aggression or subversion against other Black Sea  states.    The above is only an outline of our initiative. We are  prepared to join in working out the details of this proposal,  taking into account the interests of all interested states. What  is needed is joint action and collective wisdom.    [I would also like to deal with] another issue. There is an  increasingly urgent need, in my view, to concretize an  environmental policy in Black Sea cooperation. It is  exceptionally important to work out a convention on protecting  the Black Sea from pollution. This convention should cover a  wide range of issues with respect to improving the ecological  state of the Black Sea and utilizing and developing the  bioproductive potential of this body of water.    For Ukraine, with her first-hand experience of a real  ecological disaster resulting from the Chernobyl catastrophe,  the establishment of environmental safety guarantees and the  implementation of a plan to improve the quality of the  environment are ""vital issues"" in the full sense of the term.  The Mediterranean countries, too, have directed their efforts at  improving the environment by their recent adoption of a number  of joint measures designed to accomplish this goal. If we  consider that the Mediterranean and Black seas comprise a single  natural organism, the need for ecological cooperation becomes  obvious.    Esteemed participants in the session!    I have already stated that the ancient name for the Black  Sea  was Pontus Euxinus. But legend has it that it was also known by  another name, Pontus Axenos, which means the ""Inhospitable Sea.""  That was the name given it by those who came to its shores by  force and with evil intent.    I believe that productive cooperation among the peoples of  the countries of the Black Sea region is the best guarantee of  this sea always being hospitable to them.    Allow me to welcome you once again at the start of this  forum  and to wish you success.    Thank you for your attention.     "

The deputy prime minister,  Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, told a news conference in Kota Kinabalu  today that the decision was taken after consultations with the  prime minister, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, and other  National Front [BN] leaders. Datuk Sri Anwar said there is no  way the federal government can cooperate with a PBS-led state  government, as its policies and personalities were inconsistent  with those adopted by the BN.    On the privatization of several key government agencies in  Sabah, Datuk Sri Anwar said the process was conducted contrary  to the principles and rules of privatization adopted by the  federal government. Any project privatized by the federal  government is first evaluated by the Economic Planning Unit  before it is considered and approved by the cabinet. The  interest of the government and the respective states is always  safeguarded. In the case of Sabah, privatization is decided by  a single person and the interests of Sabah were ignored.     "

At a news conference joined by visiting U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry, Chernomyrdin told reporters that Russia  has accepted the NATO's partnership proposal without putting up  any preconditions.    The U.S. defense secretary also pointed out that the  partnership for peace plan would not be practical until the end  of March, when Russia formally applies for the partnership, the  first step toward the full NATO membership.    The two ministers have worked on the issue of nuclear  weapons  and discussed specifically the disarmament of the nuclear  arsenal in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, reportedly the  world's third largest.    Cooperation on the conversion of military industries into  civil business and destruction of chemical weapons were also  among the subjects they discussed, said the Russian prime  minister.    Before leaving Moscow for Alma Ata, Perry and Russia's First  Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Kokoshin signed an agreement  on military conversion this afternoon.     "

The alliance reconfirmed its  traditional function -- safeguarding the territorial integrity  of all members. The aim, point, and objective of NATO have once  again proven themselves indispensable and irreplaceable.  [applause]    At the same time, the alliance defined clear cut objectives  for the future. In doing so, it is continuing its process of  change and strengthening its ability to act. Who would have  believed the role NATO would be given with the disappearance of  the bipolar world, following its original task as a collective  defense system against the East. Conflict scenarios have been  replaced today by strategies for cooperation, and that is to be  welcomed. [applause]    This means NATO is moving into a new epoch in which security  is having to be considered in a wider sense. Widened in  geographic terms, as the summit decided in principle, widened in  functional terms by early warning and conflict prevention,  widened in conceptual terms by early warning and conflict  prevention, and by means of economic, ecological, social, and  cultural components, because security can only decreasingly be  guaranteed by military means alone. [applause]    The NATO summit decided on the evolutionary concept of a  gradual, organic expansion of the alliance. I have supported  and suggested this concept of a differentiated, multilayered  interlocking with the East from the beginning, and the former  Warsaw Pact countries are pushing powerfully into our alliance.  What greater change can there be in this world than that those,  who just a short while ago were, so to speak, our arch enemies,  now want to meet their security needs by entering our Western  alliance, NATO. [applause]    The summit showed the path toward membership for these  countries. We must now, however, move along it patiently but  with purpose and determination. The alliance is thus  consistently pursuing the course begun in 1991. At that time,  on a German-U.S. initiative, we began with the founding of the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council to open the door to  cooperation with the Eastern neighbors. The Partnership for  Peace supplements the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and  widens the range of concrete cooperation. Without  discrimination, it opens up further opportunities for  differentiated interlocking relations.    The German Government has always taken very seriously the  worries and expectations of our eastern neighbors and partners.  We understand their warnings about a gray zone and their  concern about isolation. However, the answer cannot and must  not be to divide Europe again between black and white. Germany  sees itself, and I adhere to this image, as the advocate of the  interests of our neighbors to the East, and we do not merely say  that, Herr Klose, but we act in accordance with it, in all  areas. [applause]    The reforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe know  they can depend on us in a special way. They also turn to us in  a quite definite way but also Russia, Ukraine, and the other  countries come to us and say: You will take special care that we  do not become isolated, pushed away. We need a balanced  solution, and we found that at the NATO summit in Brussels.  [applause]    [Parliamentary Speaker Rita Suessmuth] Mr. Kinkel, would you  permit a question from Deputy (Seifert)?    [Kinkel] Yes.    [Seifert] Foreign Minister, could you tell me why you are  channeling so much effort into realizing your strategies for  cooperation through a military alliance and not through the  CSCE, which is already in existence and which was set up  expressly as a body for cooperation?    [Kinkel] Who says we are not also trying to do this through  the CSCE? The new European security architecture we have to  build is, of course, linked to NATO, the CSCE, the NATO  Cooperation Council of the WEU [Western European Union], and the  European Union in both political and economic spheres. And it  is precisely this which we are trying to bring about. The CSCE  is playing a decisive role in the interlinking architecture that  we want to and have to find, a point to which I shall return.  So, the CSCE is not being neglected. [applause]    On the other hand, it is the case that no third state has  ever been able to claim a right of veto with respect to alliance  membership, and this is how it has to stay. But we should not  create any new grounds for antagonism or any new rifts.    At the same time, however, it is true that in the end the  best security guarantee for Europe lies in a stable, democratic,  economically efficient, and cooperative Russia. Russia has  taken decisive steps toward this objective, thanks not least to  our massive political and economic support. It is on the  historically unique path from a planned to a market economy,  from Communism toward democracy. And it would be naive, really  naive not to expect setbacks, mistakes, erroneous paths being  taken by extremist, nationalist policies, as well as problems of  economic policy. Nevertheless, we shall not allow Mr.  Zhirinovskiy to talk us into any new hostile images [applause],  quite simply because we want partnership, not hostility. I  remain confident, very confident actually, that the majority of  the Russian population thinks exactly the same way. We cannot  say no to Russia as long as Russia says yes to Europe.    At least it was right, and I adhere to this view, to deny  Mr. Zhirinovskiy an entry visa to Germany for his 18-day  political show, a propaganda tour, the direction of which one  could predict. [applause]    Ladies and gentlemen, it is just as important that countries  such as Ukraine, the Baltic republics, and the countries of  southeastern Europe should not get the impression that the door  to the expansion of Western structures of stability will open  only once, and just for a few, only to close again all the more  firmly afterward. No, our guiding principle is a unified Europe  in which no new chasms are created. [applause]    Ladies and gentlemen, a certain impression arose at the  summit as if NATO expansion, relations with the East, were the  only topics. That was not the case. The great tasks lying ahead  for German security policy in Europe were also discussed at the  NATO summit in Brussels. First, the NATO summit gave an  impressive commitment to the European security and defense  identity. The U.S. President supports the efforts for more  European independence in the fulfillment of our European  security interests. The opportunities for action by the WEU  were considerably broadened, and some NATO resources were placed  at its disposal. The European pillar is being strengthened, but  it must remain placed firmly against the Atlantic pillar. If  the European Union takes on additional competences on issues  relating to politics and security, there must be deepened  transatlantic consultation and coordination mechanisms, and the  Atlantic must not be allowed to widen. [applause]    The United States of America has made a strong avowal of  lasting commitment to Europe. We welcome, in particular, the  declaration by the U.S. President that in future hundreds of  thousands of soldiers will be left in Europe. This is of  extrordinary significance for us and our European allies.    Now I come to what Herr Klose was urging this morning:  Second, the opening of markets, intensification of trade and  economic relations, in addition to cultural exchange are also  elements of security. And the prospects of NATO expansion that  have now opened up must be seen in the context of these other  prospects of interlinking and expansion for the European Union.  Both the prospects are interlinked and interconnected. A  Europe that left its security up to NATO alone will remain  incomplete. But at the same time, a European Union without the  same security for all members is inconceivable. [applause]    Third, my French colleague [Alain] Juppe and I proposed that  those countries with the prospect of joining the European Union  should be brought closer to the WEU now, giving them additional  anchorage and interlinking in terms of security policy, and I  will emphatically press the WEU, as I have already done, to  implement this proposal. [applause]    Fourth, the CSCE has long since made the concept of expanded  security its own. It links military aspects of security with  questions of human rights, democratic checks on power, and  economic cooperation. It is to the CSCE's lasting credit that  the huge political and military change in Europe was able to  take place without the serious threat of military confrontation  between the former blocs. We Germans of all people wish to  retain the idea of the renunciation of violence, understanding,  and the willingness to compromise.    And this applies particularly with regard to former  Yugoslavia. The situation in former Yugoslavia figured largely  at the summit, and in some respects overshadowed the talks a  little. Our ability to help and mediate is not inexhaustible.  The willingness to help is also declining tangibly among those  countries that have contributed troops, with all the  incalculable consequences, by the way, for the supply of  humanitarian aid that would then no longer reach those in need  if there actually were a withdrawal of the soldiers on the  ground.    The signal coming from the summit, that reaffirmed its  willingness to mount possible air strikes, is also an expression  of growing impatience and disappointment. Nevertheless, the  European plan of action, that is still based on the  Franco-German initiative, remains urgently necessary. The  signal from the summit, I have to repeat, was also that a  certain turning point has been reached regarding the situation  in former Yugoslavia. It might be difficult to remain confident  on this issue, but peace is too important for us to give up  hope. However -- and this is something I stressed clearly to  Izetbegovic and Tudjman during the Petersberg talks -- peace  will only be possible if the warring parties want it and work to  make it happen. [applause] We give thanks to all those who are  helping, even to the extent of laying down their lives, to  prevent the dreadful violations of human rights, or at least are  trying to alleviate them.    Fifth, the offer of a peace partnership is aimed beyond the  range of the members of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council,  but also at other CSCE members. I have already advocated the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council opening up in principle to  all CSCE members. This will give the CSCE process greater  substance and effectiveness. The North Atlantic Cooperation  Council and thus, also NATO, are being given new options for  prevention of conflicts, crisis management, and peace missions.  The CSCE summit in Budapest this year must further develop the  scope of action of the CSCE and its interlinking with the United  Nations and NATO.    Sixth, NATO declares its readiness to support peacekeeping  measures and other missions by the CSCE and the United Nations.  In this way the alliance is affirming the unique responsibility  of the United Nations for international peace order. That means  for us that we also must be prepared to take part in these  alliance tasks. If we do not wish to isolate ourselves here,  then we urgently need a clarification of the constitutional  issues. [applause] I will repeat my appeal to you, ladies and  gentlemen of the opposition, to shoulder your share of the  responsibility -- give up your blockade of a constitutional  amendment! [applause] Our country is being damaged. During the  Brussels summit, the chancellor and I were on several occasions  -- and I add this to the appeal -- in a very, very difficult  situation, in a situation that is sometimes beneath the dignity  of a country that is now the largest at the heart of Europe and  that has additional responsibilities. I can only reiterate: In  the interests of this country, we will not put up with this  situation for very much longer. Give up your blockade!    Seven, with great emphasis the heads of government in  Brussels declared the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction as a danger for international security. The members  of the UN Security Council had already made it clear at their  summit meeting two years ago that a legitimate concern, a very,  very important concern of the community of nations, was to  control and stem weapons of mass destruction and their carrier  systems. Germany is the only country to have voluntarily and  permanently renounced weapons of mass destruction. At the  beginning of December, I already formulated my proposals in a  10-point plan to strengthen the policy of the nonproliferation  of nuclear weapons. We will energetically pursue this  initiative. Our aim is to prevent new nuclear weapons states  from coming into being in the world by means of timely, active  cooperation with the countries in question. [applause]    Nine [as heard], Ladies and Gentlemen, an agreement to  regulate the elimination of the former Soviet nuclear weapons  based in Ukraine is scheduled to be concluded tomorrow. The  Federal Government made a decisive contribution to this  breakthrough by means of intensive dialogue with Kiev on  security and disarmament questions. And we hope that this  agreement finds sufficient internal political support in  Ukraine. For then, the path will be free for Ukraine membership  in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state.  This will increase the chances for an unlimited and  unconditional extension of this treaty. Then intensive and  comprehensive cooperation with this hugely important state -- a  particularly important country for Europe's security  architecture -- could at last be concluded.    The cooperation agreement between the European Union and  Ukraine must also be concluded. The difficult relationship  between Ukraine and Russia should be eased by means of a treaty  on good-neighborly relations and the renunciation of the use of  force. We are prepared to help in this to the best of our  ability, but as far as Ukraine is concerned, the European  Community has undertaken a lot -- thank God -- because we must  ensure that we carefully observe and watch what is going on in  Ukraine, as we have done with the Central and Eastern European  states, and particularly with Russia.    Ladies and Gentlemen, the result of the NATO summit fits  smoothly into the concept of increased security for the whole of  Europe. This concept arises from our interest in peace and  stability in the whole of Europe. And we will continue to  pursue this with determination. Clarity, conflict prevention,  and confidence-building are the central issues. The last 45  years have produced an exemplary network of stability through  the European Community in Western Europe. Now it is important  finally to connect the security network in the second half, so  to speak, of the European Union process. We will have achieved  our aim when old differences in the east of our continent are  overcome by the strength of the European Union, to the same  extent as this has been achieved in the West. We will have  achieved our goal when the other states bordering on Europe, and  this also includes our partner Russia, do not see this growing  together of Europe as a threat, but as an advantage for their  own security and prosperity. The road there is long but we want  a foreign policy that goes beyond the present day.    Ladies and gentlemen, let me say one more thing in  conclusion  that occurred to me at the NATO summit and which I think is  important for us: Our Bundeswehr enjoys enormous respect within  the framework of NATO and in NATO. I think we should be proud  of that. [applause]    It [the Bundeswehr] is and remains the guarantor of our  security and an effective tool of our peace policy. Our  alliance capacity depends on it, and I say that it needs secure  planning, not only with regard to finance, but even more with  regard to an unambiguous definition of its tasks. It cannot and  must not be right for us to say that we have such-and-such an  amount of money, we can afford such-and-such a size of  Bundeswehr. It should be the other way round: We must say we  need the Bundeswehr for such-and-such tasks, and the money  needed for this must then be available. [applause] And we should  be careful to keep the Bundeswehr, which is a very important  part of our society, out of attempts at party political  posturing -- this is a prime concern for me.     "

Some asbestos has been discovered in the Paris think-tank's main building. Employees were given the chance to take yesterday and today off, while experts evaluated the risk. Most shot out of the building like corks out of Bollinger bottles: 'You should have seen the number of chain-smoking Frenchmen haring out of here on the off-chance of a millionth part of asbestos in the air,' said a non-French staffer. Staffan Sohlman, Sweden's OECD envoy and acting head of the organisation, was already a safe 400km away in Strasbourg. There he made the implausible claim that OECD countries are deadlocked over selecting a new leader because 'they care for the organisation'.

Veterinarians concluded that contamination of the Mediterranean had broken down  the immune systems of these sleek animals, leaving them too weak to fight off a  viral infection.    It was a dramatic reminder that the calm and light-blue waters of the  Mediterranean have become polluted in the last few decades by the immense  industrialization of southern Europe and by the 50 million tourists who crowd  onto the sun-drenched beaches every year.    The Rhone River alone, which courses past some of France's most potent  petrochemicaland nuclear energy plants, each day deposits an enormous tonnage  of nitrates, sulfates, iron, sewage, mercury and pesticides into the sea.    The issues thus seemed obvious enough when the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) opened its meeting on the Mediterranean  environment here almost a month ago.    But the Mediterranean, usually described as the cradle of European  civilization, has often been a crucible of conflict as well. So, it was not too  surprising that the meeting of 35 nations, which ended with flowery and general  promises of cooperation Friday, was caught up in tense wrangling during key  moments of negotiation.    A political problem erupted on the first day when Spanish Foreign Affairs  Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, supported by the Italian foreign  minister, called on the member governments ""to apply the spirit of Helsinki to  the Mediterranean and Middle East"" and create a new organization, the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean.    The proposal touched the heart of the history of the organization. The CSCE, a  meeting ground for Europe's Western and Communist camps, first met in Helsinki  in 1973 and produced a series of agreements on human rights two years later  that became known as the Helsinki Accords. Since the Soviet Union had signed  the accords, dissidents in Eastern Europe embraced them as justification for  their cries for freedom.    With the world in crisis over Iraqi aggression in the Middle East, Fernandez  Ordonez said, it is time to create an organization that would provide a meeting  ground for all Mediterranean peoples, no matter how much in conflict. Steps  might somehow be taken, for example, to ease relations between Israelis and  Arabs just as the Helsinki Accords gradually led to an easing of U.S.-Soviet  relations.    The Spanish-Italian proposal hit some delegations like a wet fish. Ambassador  John Davis, the U.S. delegate, insisted it simply was out of place: It had  nothing to do with the Mediterranean environment.    The U.S. government obviously looked on the proposal as a Pandora's Box, one  that might create a new forum for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq or lead to  the kind of international conference on the Middle East that the United States  has long opposed. In the end, the U.S. view prevailed: The final communique  merely noted that the proposal had been made.    The conference also had the usual tug of wills between environmentalists and  protectors of economic interests. In the end, according to the private  environmental organization Greenpeace, the economic interests won.    Xavier Pastor, a Spaniard in charge of Greenpeace's Mediterranean studies,  denounced what he called the incompetence of many delegations and singled out  the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and the European Common Market  secretariat as the main diluters of tough resolutions.    Britain, according to Pastor, had rejected a proposal by Italy to ban the  mile-long drift nets that catch every small species in the way while trapping  commercial fish in the Mediterranean.

Veterinarians concluded that contamination of the Mediterranean had broken down  the immune systems of these sleek animals, leaving them too weak to fight off a  viral infection.    It was a dramatic reminder that the calm and light-blue waters of the  Mediterranean have become polluted in the last few decades by the immense  industrialization of southern Europe and by the 50 million tourists who crowd  onto the sun-drenched beaches every year.    The Rhone River alone, which courses past some of France's most potent  petrochemicaland nuclear energy plants, each day deposits an enormous tonnage  of nitrates, sulfates, iron, sewage, mercury and pesticides into the sea.    The issues thus seemed obvious enough when the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) opened its meeting on the Mediterranean  environment here almost a month ago.    But the Mediterranean, usually described as the cradle of European  civilization, has often been a crucible of conflict as well. So, it was not too  surprising that the meeting of 35 nations, which ended with flowery and general  promises of cooperation Friday, was caught up in tense wrangling during key  moments of negotiation.    A political problem erupted on the first day when Spanish Foreign Affairs  Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, supported by the Italian foreign  minister, called on the member governments ""to apply the spirit of Helsinki to  the Mediterranean and Middle East"" and create a new organization, the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean.    The proposal touched the heart of the history of the organization. The CSCE, a  meeting ground for Europe's Western and Communist camps, first met in Helsinki  in 1973 and produced a series of agreements on human rights two years later  that became known as the Helsinki Accords. Since the Soviet Union had signed  the accords, dissidents in Eastern Europe embraced them as justification for  their cries for freedom.    With the world in crisis over Iraqi aggression in the Middle East, Fernandez  Ordonez said, it is time to create an organization that would provide a meeting  ground for all Mediterranean peoples, no matter how much in conflict. Steps  might somehow be taken, for example, to ease relations between Israelis and  Arabs just as the Helsinki Accords gradually led to an easing of U.S.-Soviet  relations.    The Spanish-Italian proposal hit some delegations like a wet fish. Ambassador  John Davis, the U.S. delegate, insisted it simply was out of place: It had  nothing to do with the Mediterranean environment.    The U.S. government obviously looked on the proposal as a Pandora's Box, one  that might create a new forum for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq or lead to  the kind of international conference on the Middle East that the United States  has long opposed. In the end, the U.S. view prevailed: The final communique  merely noted that the proposal had been made.    The conference also had the usual tug of wills between environmentalists and  protectors of economic interests. In the end, according to the private  environmental organization Greenpeace, the economic interests won.    Xavier Pastor, a Spaniard in charge of Greenpeace's Mediterranean studies,  denounced what he called the incompetence of many delegations and singled out  the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and the European Common Market  secretariat as the main diluters of tough resolutions.    Britain, according to Pastor, had rejected a proposal by Italy to ban the  mile-long drift nets that catch every small species in the way while trapping  commercial fish in the Mediterranean.    Pastor pronounced the conference ""a complete failure."" In the end, he said, the  delegates failed to adopt any resolution that ""will make a substantial  difference in what is going on in the Mediterranean.""

WILLIAMS JR. and DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      NICOSIA, Cyprus      The Middle East, where tanks and air power ruled the battlefields in hostile  decades past, has entered an unsettling era of mushrooming missile arsenals.    Over the last weeks and months, regional military machines have been flexing  their missile strength at an accelerating pace. The contestants give identical  rationales for the buildup: to match strides with their rivals.    Both Israel and Iraq have test-fired powerful new rockets. Egypt is working on  an intermediate-range missile, and Saudi Arabia has placed in desert silos a  long-range, nuclear-capable heavyweight bought from China.    Other Middle East nations have stocked a range of battlefield rockets over the  years. Even Lebanon's beleaguered Christian forces, once armed mainly with  artillery and hand-carried grenade launchers, are reported to possess a handful  of Soviet-made short-range missiles, supplied by Iraq.    ""We have a missile race,"" affirmed Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist at  London's International Institute of Strategic Studies, in an interview Dec.15.  ""Everybody is on their toes now.""    Mordechai Gur, a former Israeli army chief of staff, added: ""We have to deter  the use of missiles, full stop.""    Technology is bought, adapted or home-developed, and increasingly beyond the  capability of the United States, the Soviet Union and other major powers  uncomfortable with the Middle East arms race to restrain. The reduction of  big-power tensions in Europe has yet to spill over to the region, and Third  World producers are helping fill the demand for new weapons.    U.S. Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams, commenting on this month's  Iraqi test, warned that the burgeoning arsenals are ""a serious and growing  worldwide concern."" In the taut relations of the Middle East, he said, missile  proliferation ""undermines regional security and peace.""    Officials in the Soviet Union, whose southern territories are within range of  Middle East missiles, have expressed similar alarm.    According to military analysts, only Israel among Middle East powers is capable  of arming missiles with nuclear warheads. But Iraq, Iran and Libya are  reportedly seeking nuclear technology, and they and several other countries in  the region are believed to have the potential to develop chemical warheads,  dubbed by analysts as ""the poor man's atomic bomb.""    Strategically, the development of missile forces by Iran and the Arab countries  threatens to upset the regional military balance characterized by superior  Israeli air power. To keep its foes at bay, Israel had long relied on its  ability to strike at installations deep in enemy territory without fear of  immediate retaliation. Its 1981 bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor outside  Baghdad was a celebrated example.    Now an Israeli preemptive air strike can be countered with the push of a  button, although Israel's nuclear capability still poses a telling deterrent.    Hedging their bets for a non-nuclear confrontation, the Israelis have embarked  on a U.S.-supported program to develop an anti-missile missile system called  Arrow, another notch on the gear of escalation.    Outside the Arab-Israeli tensions lies the threat that missile proliferation  poses to the Arab States and Iran themselves. While battlefield missiles were  first used in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, long-range missile warfare was  introduced to the region during the nine-year conflict between Iraq and Iran  which ended in a fragile truce in the summer of 1988.    Each side threw every available type of missile, from every possible source, at  the other. Soviet-made Scud B rockets, adapted for greater range by reducing  the weight of the warhead, fell on both Baghdad and Tehran. The Iran-Iraq war  also reintroduced another ominous weapon, poison gas, which had not been used  so extensively since World War I in Europe.    ""The use of missiles was legitimized during the Iran-Iraq war,"" said Shai  Feldman, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv.    French-supplied Iraqi fighters pounded Iranian shipping in the Persian Gulf  with French-made Exocet missiles (and accidentally hit the U.S. frigate Stark  in 1987, with the loss of 37 American lives). The Iranians countered by  deploying Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles along the gulf's strategic  Strait of Hormuz.    Saudi Arabia, alarmed by the buildup, went on the market and bought the  ponderous Chinese CSS-2 East Wind missiles, which have an range of up to 1,800  miles, depending on the warhead. The East Wind can carry nuclear warheads to  the maximum range, but the Saudis insist they have no intention of becoming a  nuclear power. Independent observers say the missiles are being retrofitted  with conventional warheads, which would limit the range to 1,000 miles, still  sufficient to hit targets in Iran, Israel or elsewhere in the Middle East,  though without pinpoint accuracy.    Few Restraints    Kopietz, the London analyst, labeled the Saudi weapons a ""psychological  cosmetic,"" but added that that is what spurs proliferation.    ""The Saudis are telling Iran, 'We can buy these and we can use them,' "" he  explained. ""The Iraqis are building their own because neither the Soviet Union  nor the United States will sell them a missile.""    In the race to match missile for missile, there have been few restraints except  price and availability. And even those restraints are being evaded by the  ambitious development and adaptation programs in Iraq, Iran and Egypt, which  reportedly is receiving technical help from Argentina.    In 1987, seven Western industrial nations, including the United States,  Britain, Japan, France and West Germany, formed the Missile Technology Control  Regime, with the aim of curbing the spread of missiles with a range of 180  miles or more. The signatories are committed to block the sale of missile parts  and related equipment to Third World countries. But the commitments have proven  less than airtight.    According to the chief prosecutor in Munich, a West German company has sold  components for a rocket valve to Libya. An official with the French firm  Aerospatiale told a reporter at this year's Baghdad air show that his company  was prepared to ""respond to any need of the Iraqi defense production."" The  official was quoted as saying that negotiations for the transfer of missile  technology were under way.    Meanwhile, according to press reports, Libya's Moammar Kadafi is shopping in  the missile market, reportedly for the Brazilian-made Oteiba, which has a  375-mile range.    Iraqi Strides    Iraq's claim on Dec. 7 that it had launched a 48-ton rocket into Earth orbit  and developed two models of 1,200-mile-range military missiles surprised even  analysts who had closely followed its wartime and postwar efforts.    ""We achieved a complicated scientific leap,"" Military Industries Minister  Hussein Kamel, brother-in-law of President Saddam Hussein, told Baghdad Radio.  "" . . . We successfully tested the launching of the a three-stage rocket to  outer space.""    Not until 48 hours later did U.S. officials authenticate the claim.    ""I can confirm that the Iraqis have launched a rocket powerful enough to put a  small payload into space,"" said a Pentagon spokesman. Another Defense  Department official said the North American Aerospace Defense Command had  tracked an object ""for four or five revolutions"" of Earth, although it was not  clear whether it was the final rocket stage or a payload.    Kamel said the test was the first phase of a space program, presumably aimed at  putting a spy satellite into orbit over the Middle East.    The 1,200-mile-range missiles that Iraq claims to have developed would have  direct military application.    At United Nations headquarters in New York Dec.14 Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq  Aziz said of the intermediate-range rocket: ""We have to take into  consideration, for defense purposes, that our country is still being threatened  by Iran. We are in a position of no war and no peace.""    Threat to Israel    The same weapon could reach Jerusalem, as can the Scud B rockets fired at  Tehran during the war. They have a range of about 570 miles, boosted by more  than 150 miles through alterations reportedly designed with the help of West  German engineers. Syria, Egypt and the Saudis also own missiles capable of  hitting Israeli targets, and the Soviet-supplied Syrian SS-21 Scarab missiles  have a high degree of accuracy.    There has been no Iraqi claim that their new intermediate-range missiles have  been tested. Intelligence reports on Iraq have focused instead on development  of an advanced version of the Argentine Condor rocket, reportedly in  collaboration with the Egyptians and the Argentines. In the Middle East, the  rocket has been dubbed Badr 2000, and has a projected range of about 600 miles.    More alarming than Iraqi success with a mid-range rocket would be the potential  of the tested space booster, which could put Iraq in a satellite-launching club  with Israel and developing countries such as India and China. Theoretically,  the booster could be adapted for use as an intercontinental ballistic missile,  some Western experts noted.    The U.S. Senate is considering further legislation to combat the spread of  ballistic missiles, although the effort seems to be aimed primarily at Syria  and Libya rather than Israel, an ally of the United States.    ""I don't believe that the likelihood of Great Britain, France or Israel  engaging in atomic/biological/chemical weapons is anything but remote,"" said  Arizona Sen. John McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  speaking on a television hook-up to a recent conference in Tel Aviv. ""I don't  have confidence"" about Hafez Assad, the Syrian president, or Kadafi. ""So the  legislation and the effort I have been engaged in have clearly tried to  differentiate those countries I have mentioned and those which are less stable  and are in fact more aggressive.""    However, Kopietz, the International Institute of Strategic Studies analyst,  argued that Israeli power is the problem.    ""To end this race,"" he said, ""America will have to get Israel to step down  first"" in any disarmament program.    ""For the time being, these weapons are being sought by people for essentially  defensive purposes,"" Don Kerr, another IISS analyst in London, declared before  the Iraqi test. ""These states want to be listened to.""    Israel, meanwhile, has moved ahead with its own rocket program. In September,  in a report that Israeli officials refused to confirm or deny, the Soviet news  agency Tass said Israel had test-fired a surface-to-surface missile from an  area near Jerusalem 900 miles west into the Mediterranean.    Other reports identified the missile by the code name Jericho 2, the same  rocket that put a satellite into orbit in September, 1988. The Israeli Jericho  1, current kingpin of their missile force, has a range of 375 miles and can be  fitted with chemical, conventional or nuclear warheads.    Meanwhile, nuclear technology is also being sewn throughout the region. A West  German company and China are said to have provided Iraq with technology to  produce enriched uranium, the key ingredient for building nuclear weapons.

WILLIAMS JR. and DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      NICOSIA, Cyprus      The Middle East, where tanks and air power ruled the battlefields in hostile  decades past, has entered an unsettling era of mushrooming missile arsenals.    Over the last weeks and months, regional military machines have been flexing  their missile strength at an accelerating pace. The contestants give identical  rationales for the buildup: to match strides with their rivals.    Both Israel and Iraq have test-fired powerful new rockets. Egypt is working on  an intermediate-range missile, and Saudi Arabia has placed in desert silos a  long-range, nuclear-capable heavyweight bought from China.    Other Middle East nations have stocked a range of battlefield rockets over the  years. Even Lebanon's beleaguered Christian forces, once armed mainly with  artillery and hand-carried grenade launchers, are reported to possess a handful  of Soviet-made short-range missiles, supplied by Iraq.    ""We have a missile race,"" affirmed Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist at  London's International Institute of Strategic Studies, in an interview Dec.15.  ""Everybody is on their toes now.""    Mordechai Gur, a former Israeli army chief of staff, added: ""We have to deter  the use of missiles, full stop.""    Technology is bought, adapted or home-developed, and increasingly beyond the  capability of the United States, the Soviet Union and other major powers  uncomfortable with the Middle East arms race to restrain. The reduction of  big-power tensions in Europe has yet to spill over to the region, and Third  World producers are helping fill the demand for new weapons.    U.S. Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams, commenting on this month's  Iraqi test, warned that the burgeoning arsenals are ""a serious and growing  worldwide concern."" In the taut relations of the Middle East, he said, missile  proliferation ""undermines regional security and peace.""    Officials in the Soviet Union, whose southern territories are within range of  Middle East missiles, have expressed similar alarm.    According to military analysts, only Israel among Middle East powers is capable  of arming missiles with nuclear warheads. But Iraq, Iran and Libya are  reportedly seeking nuclear technology, and they and several other countries in  the region are believed to have the potential to develop chemical warheads,  dubbed by analysts as ""the poor man's atomic bomb.""    Strategically, the development of missile forces by Iran and the Arab countries  threatens to upset the regional military balance characterized by superior  Israeli air power. To keep its foes at bay, Israel had long relied on its  ability to strike at installations deep in enemy territory without fear of  immediate retaliation. Its 1981 bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor outside  Baghdad was a celebrated example.    Now an Israeli preemptive air strike can be countered with the push of a  button, although Israel's nuclear capability still poses a telling deterrent.    Hedging their bets for a non-nuclear confrontation, the Israelis have embarked  on a U.S.-supported program to develop an anti-missile missile system called  Arrow, another notch on the gear of escalation.    Outside the Arab-Israeli tensions lies the threat that missile proliferation  poses to the Arab States and Iran themselves. While battlefield missiles were  first used in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, long-range missile warfare was  introduced to the region during the nine-year conflict between Iraq and Iran  which ended in a fragile truce in the summer of 1988.    Each side threw every available type of missile, from every possible source, at  the other. Soviet-made Scud B rockets, adapted for greater range by reducing  the weight of the warhead, fell on both Baghdad and Tehran. The Iran-Iraq war  also reintroduced another ominous weapon, poison gas, which had not been used  so extensively since World War I in Europe.    ""The use of missiles was legitimized during the Iran-Iraq war,"" said Shai  Feldman, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv.    French-supplied Iraqi fighters pounded Iranian shipping in the Persian Gulf  with French-made Exocet missiles (and accidentally hit the U.S. frigate Stark  in 1987, with the loss of 37 American lives). The Iranians countered by  deploying Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles along the gulf's strategic  Strait of Hormuz.    Saudi Arabia, alarmed by the buildup, went on the market and bought the  ponderous Chinese CSS-2 East Wind missiles, which have an range of up to 1,800  miles, depending on the warhead. The East Wind can carry nuclear warheads to  the maximum range, but the Saudis insist they have no intention of becoming a  nuclear power. Independent observers say the missiles are being retrofitted  with conventional warheads, which would limit the range to 1,000 miles, still  sufficient to hit targets in Iran, Israel or elsewhere in the Middle East,  though without pinpoint accuracy.    Few Restraints    Kopietz, the London analyst, labeled the Saudi weapons a ""psychological  cosmetic,"" but added that that is what spurs proliferation.    ""The Saudis are telling Iran, 'We can buy these and we can use them,' "" he  explained. ""The Iraqis are building their own because neither the Soviet Union  nor the United States will sell them a missile.""    In the race to match missile for missile, there have been few restraints except  price and availability. And even those restraints are being evaded by the  ambitious development and adaptation programs in Iraq, Iran and Egypt, which  reportedly is receiving technical help from Argentina.    In 1987, seven Western industrial nations, including the United States,  Britain, Japan, France and West Germany, formed the Missile Technology Control  Regime, with the aim of curbing the spread of missiles with a range of 180  miles or more. The signatories are committed to block the sale of missile parts  and related equipment to Third World countries. But the commitments have proven  less than airtight.    According to the chief prosecutor in Munich, a West German company has sold  components for a rocket valve to Libya. An official with the French firm  Aerospatiale told a reporter at this year's Baghdad air show that his company  was prepared to ""respond to any need of the Iraqi defense production."" The  official was quoted as saying that negotiations for the transfer of missile  technology were under way.    Meanwhile, according to press reports, Libya's Moammar Kadafi is shopping in  the missile market, reportedly for the Brazilian-made Oteiba, which has a  375-mile range.    Iraqi Strides    Iraq's claim on Dec. 7 that it had launched a 48-ton rocket into Earth orbit  and developed two models of 1,200-mile-range military missiles surprised even  analysts who had closely followed its wartime and postwar efforts.    ""We achieved a complicated scientific leap,"" Military Industries Minister  Hussein Kamel, brother-in-law of President Saddam Hussein, told Baghdad Radio.  "" . . . We successfully tested the launching of the a three-stage rocket to  outer space.""    Not until 48 hours later did U.S. officials authenticate the claim.    ""I can confirm that the Iraqis have launched a rocket powerful enough to put a  small payload into space,"" said a Pentagon spokesman. Another Defense  Department official said the North American Aerospace Defense Command had  tracked an object ""for four or five revolutions"" of Earth, although it was not  clear whether it was the final rocket stage or a payload.    Kamel said the test was the first phase of a space program, presumably aimed at  putting a spy satellite into orbit over the Middle East.    The 1,200-mile-range missiles that Iraq claims to have developed would have  direct military application.    At United Nations headquarters in New York Dec.14 Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq  Aziz said of the intermediate-range rocket: ""We have to take into  consideration, for defense purposes, that our country is still being threatened  by Iran. We are in a position of no war and no peace.""    Threat to Israel    The same weapon could reach Jerusalem, as can the Scud B rockets fired at  Tehran during the war. They have a range of about 570 miles, boosted by more  than 150 miles through alterations reportedly designed with the help of West  German engineers. Syria, Egypt and the Saudis also own missiles capable of  hitting Israeli targets, and the Soviet-supplied Syrian SS-21 Scarab missiles  have a high degree of accuracy.    There has been no Iraqi claim that their new intermediate-range missiles have  been tested. Intelligence reports on Iraq have focused instead on development  of an advanced version of the Argentine Condor rocket, reportedly in  collaboration with the Egyptians and the Argentines. In the Middle East, the  rocket has been dubbed Badr 2000, and has a projected range of about 600 miles.    More alarming than Iraqi success with a mid-range rocket would be the potential  of the tested space booster, which could put Iraq in a satellite-launching club  with Israel and developing countries such as India and China. Theoretically,  the booster could be adapted for use as an intercontinental ballistic missile,  some Western experts noted.    The U.S. Senate is considering further legislation to combat the spread of  ballistic missiles, although the effort seems to be aimed primarily at Syria  and Libya rather than Israel, an ally of the United States.    ""I don't believe that the likelihood of Great Britain, France or Israel  engaging in atomic/biological/chemical weapons is anything but remote,"" said  Arizona Sen. John McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  speaking on a television hook-up to a recent conference in Tel Aviv. ""I don't  have confidence"" about Hafez Assad, the Syrian president, or Kadafi. ""So the  legislation and the effort I have been engaged in have clearly tried to  differentiate those countries I have mentioned and those which are less stable  and are in fact more aggressive.""    However, Kopietz, the International Institute of Strategic Studies analyst,  argued that Israeli power is the problem.    ""To end this race,"" he said, ""America will have to get Israel to step down  first"" in any disarmament program.    ""For the time being, these weapons are being sought by people for essentially  defensive purposes,"" Don Kerr, another IISS analyst in London, declared before  the Iraqi test. ""These states want to be listened to.""    Israel, meanwhile, has moved ahead with its own rocket program. In September,  in a report that Israeli officials refused to confirm or deny, the Soviet news  agency Tass said Israel had test-fired a surface-to-surface missile from an  area near Jerusalem 900 miles west into the Mediterranean.    Other reports identified the missile by the code name Jericho 2, the same  rocket that put a satellite into orbit in September, 1988. The Israeli Jericho  1, current kingpin of their missile force, has a range of 375 miles and can be  fitted with chemical, conventional or nuclear warheads.    Meanwhile, nuclear technology is also being sewn throughout the region. A West  German company and China are said to have provided Iraq with technology to  produce enriched uranium, the key ingredient for building nuclear weapons.    Israel has reportedly helped South Africa build a long-range missile in return  for guaranteed supplies of enriched uranium and facilities to test booster  rockets in South Africa.

By ED BLANCHE, ASSOCIATED PRESS      NICOSIA, Cyprus      Iran's government is intensifying a birth-control program -- despite opposition  from radicals -- because the country's fast-growing population is imposing  strains on a struggling economy.    ""If the Islamic Republic's government does not implement proper and swift plans  for controlling population growth in Iran, future generations will definitely  face severe social and economic problems,"" Tehran's Kayhan International  newspaper warned recently.    ""Can we be proud of a nation of hungry Muslims who have to beg the infidels of  the world for charity?"" declared Mohammed Yazdi, a member of the 12-member  Council of Guardians, a legislative watchdog body.    Iran has one of the highest birth rates in the world, between 3.5% and 4% a  year. Even in the Middle East, where soaring populations are the norm, Iran's  baby boom is fast outstripping development.    Before the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran had about 35 million people. Last  month, the government's chief statistician, Majid Shamshidi, said the  population had reached 55 million.    Experts estimate that by the year 2010, Iran will have 140 million people. They  warn that unless something is done soon to curb the birth rate and rapidly  expand the economy, the country faces a major social explosion.    While Iran struggles to cope with its baby boom, rival Iraq is striving to  expand its population to keep up with the Iranians should the Iran-Iraq War,  halted by an August, 1988, cease-fire, flare up again.    Iraq has about 16 million people, and President Saddam Hussein has declared  that increasing its birth rate a ""strategic duty."" He offers hefty financial  incentives, including cash grants and interest-free home-purchase loans.    Iran launched a half-hearted birth-control campaign last year, with some  religious leaders encouraging Iran's predominantly Muslim population to have  fewer children. Now Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has  declared that birth control is not un-Islamic, although abortion is illegal.    The Health Ministry announced it has set up centers in major cities to provide  free contraceptives. But the contraceptives reportedly are in short supply.    Some newspapers say that unless more is done to get the message across, the  government program will have little impact on Iranians, who have traditionally  favored large families.    The English-language Tehran Times called in December for a media campaign to  warn Iranians of the danger of unrestrained population growth ""to bring this  immense problem . . . under control.""    Kayhan International declared: ""This phenomenon should be seriously and  properly dealt with. Using economic incentives, the government should encourage  Iranian couples to have only two children.""    One of President Hashemi Rafsanjani's most important priorities is expanding  the economy to at least five times its current size to accommodate the expected  population growth.    As it is, Western economists believe the economy, plagued by bad management  during the revolution and the 8-year war with Iraq, is already severely  stretched and needs massive investment just to cope with the current crisis.    Rafsanjani's rivals oppose birth control. They believe that the larger Iran's  population, the greater its chances of becoming the undisputed leader of the  Muslim world.    By the year 2020, demographers estimate that the Muslim population will be 2.5  billion, double the present total and more than one-quarter of the projected  world population in the first quarter of the next century.    The Third World, which would account for more than 80% of the projected world  population by then, would provide fertile ground for the Islamic revolution,  the hard-liners argue.    When a 1986 census showed that 11 million Iranians had been born since the  revolution, then-Prime Minister Hussein Moussavi publicly rejoiced that they  had been reared to the credo of ""Death to America!"" and ""Allahu akbar!"" or ""God  is great!""

Rafsanjani's postwar development plan calls for building 12 industrial cities  in five years to help absorb the swelling population.    Tehran's population has swollen to an estimated 8 million in recent years amid  a widespread drift from the countryside to urban areas. Officials say the city  is bursting at the seams, with housing, water and electricity shortages,  traffic-clogged streets and worsening pollution.    Oil-rich Iran was able to feed itself 10 years ago, but now has to import $2  billion worth of food a year.    Agricultural output has slumped severely.

In mid-1990 in  London the alliance formulated the offer for cooperation with  the East and, a few months later, it confirmed it in the CSCE  Charter of Paris. A year later in Rome NATO adopted its new  strategic concept, which is adapted to the changed situation.  Almost at the same time, the 12 member states of the  then-European Community agreed on the treaty for the  establishment of the European Union (EU), which envisages an  independent foreign and security policy by using the Western  European Union (WEU) as a complementary institution to NATO.    Already these few stations mark the speed of development  following the upheavals in the East. Nevertheless, now in  Brussels there were once again new factors, such as, above all,  the uncertainty about the Russian reform policy, that  characterized the debate, at the end of which it remains unclear  what the security structures on the old continent will be like  in the end but whose result should clarify the relationship  between Europe and the United States and the former East Bloc at  least for some time.    In shaping relations with Russia, the other CIS republics,  as  well as the Central East European countries, which are all  already cooperating with NATO in the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council, the alliance partners agreed to the U.S. concept of  Partnership for Peace without any major debate.    Bilateral Cooperation    It offers these countries the opportunity to introduce close  bilateral military cooperation with NATO, for instance through  joint maneuvers, training for peace missions, and consultations  in the case of a threat. Accession to the alliance, which is  demanded above all by the reform states Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia as well as by the Baltic countries  after the election success of Russian rightist-nationalist  Zhirinovskiy, is offered as a prospect, but without giving any  specific date.    This is done out of consideration for Russian fears of being  surrounded and avoids drawing a new, at least theoretical border  in Europe. This priority set by Washington is useful certainly  as long as there are justified hopes that the Moscow reform  process will be continued. Furthermore, this method of action  also corresponds to the rhythm of the EU, which has established  links with most of these countries through an association with  the promise of membership at a later, unspecified date.    The Second Pillar of the Alliance    For the relationship between Europe and its most important  partner on the other side of the Atlantic U.S. President Bill  Clinton surprisingly provided a positive emphasis in Brussels by  confirming a minimum U.S. troop presence of 100,000 men and the  express support of the independent foreign and security policy  development of the EU as a second pillar of the alliance. The  indispensable security policy ties between the United States and  Europe have been clearly affirmed. At the same time, the new  Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Twelve can now be  initiated more quickly after the Maastricht Treaty came into  force with delay at the beginning of November 1993.    The envisaged close interlacement with the WEU, of which  almost all EU states are members, can be intensified because of  the readiness of the alliance to enable the WEU to use NATO  resources for independent operations. During his visit to the  Brussels EU Commission today the agreement on concluding the  Uruguay round, which was achieved recently after long conflicts  between the EU and the United States, gives Clinton the basis  for contributing further elements to improving the Transatlantic  climate also in the field of the economy.    The NATO summit gives the impression of being a further step  in the direction toward a new security policy structure in  Europe after the end of the Cold War. Of course, it would be  more convincing if the partners were not still helpless in the  face of the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia. The renewed  affirmation of the alliance's readiness for limited air strikes  at Serbian positions in Bosnia hardly gives rise to hope in view  of the previous experiences.     "

The outcome of the talks was disclosed by  Minister-State Secretary Murdiono as follows:    [Begin Murdiono recording] The two sides, both at the  ministerial and head of state levels, share the view that  current bilateral ties are very cordial and based on mutual  understanding. The Vietnamese president's current visit is  viewed as an important momentum for upgrading existing bilateral  relations. The two sides believe there is no bilateral problem  which cannot be solved.    During their talks, the two leaders briefed one another on  the domestic situation of their country, especially regarding  economic development. Both leaders are confident that bilateral  ties can be further upgraded in the coming years. Both also  praised each other's successes in economic development.    Touching on political issues, both sides exchanged views on  how to solve the problem of the overlapping continental shelf.  Consequently, both sides agreed that this problem should be  settled quickly on the basis of the Law of the Sea Convention.  It was also agreed that technical officials should speed up  their work. Should they fail to reach an agreement on this  issue, they must report it to the higher authority immediately.    The two sides also discussed the issue of Vietnamese  refugees, or boat people, currently held at Galang island. More  than 8,000 Vietnamese refugees still remain at Galang island.  Only a few of them can expect to get political asylum and be  resettled in a third country, while the majority of them consist  of people who must be repatriated to Vietnam. The two sides  also agreed to find an early solution to the refugee problem.    When the two leaders discussed multilateral and regional  issues, the Vietnamese leader indicated his country's desire to  get an observer status at the next meeting of APEC [Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation] in Jakarta. Whether Vietnam's request  will be granted depends on the APEC criteria on the status of  observer. As we know, for the time being, namely, for three  years, APEC will not consider accepting new members. During the  talks, President Suharto stressed the importance of APEC views  and resolutions, which will benefit not only its members but  also all countries, including developing ones.    Vietnam also expressed its desire to join ASEAN and  President  Suharto once again explained ASEAN's views and objectives,  namely, forging cooperation so as to boost the welfare of each  member country and strengthen national resiliency. These  objectives are not aimed at other countries. ASEAN does not  want to become part of other regional groupings in the world.    The Nonaligned Movement [NAM] was another topic of  discussion  between the two leaders. Both at the ministerial and  presidential levels, Vietnam expressed its high appreciation of  the role played by Indonesia as NAM chairman. Vietnam also  praised Indonesia's success in implementing resolutions adopted  at the NAM summit meeting in Jakarta in 1992 and in raising the  prestige of the movement. President Suharto also mentioned  important moves he had initiated in his capacity as NAM  chairman. We all know that the NAM chairman's meeting with the  Japanese prime minister at the G-7 summit meeting in Tokyo was  indeed an important breakthrough in the efforts to reactivate  the North-South dialogues.    As for economic talks, Vietnam invited Indonesia to take  part  in its infrastructure development, which now involves carrying  out economic reforms and adjusting to the situations in other  countries. Cooperation in agriculture was also another topic of  discussion with Vietnam expressing its desire to buy fertilizers  from Indonesia. Cooperation in marketing coffee and rice was  also discussed. I must stress here that it is not Indonesia's  policy to export rice. What is important is how to maintain our  rice self-sufficiency, which we successfully achieved in 1984.

President Boris Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor  Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) agreed during  their meeting in Bonn to bring about a cooperation agreement  between the European Union (EU) and Russia under the German EU  Presidency beginning early in July, which would help Russia in  the economic area. Yeltsin announced that Russia would join the  Partnership for Peace with NATO, if Russia's particularities  were first considered in a protocol. Kohl and Yeltsin agreed to  honor the withdrawal of the last Soviet troops from Germany on  31 August with a ceremony in Berlin and not, as originally  planned, in Weimar. Kohl and Yeltsin were in the Palatinate on  12 May; earlier, Yeltsin met with Social Democratic Party [SPD]  Chairman Rudolf Scharping in Bonn.    Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party -- FDP)  played tennis with his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, on  13 May and then made an excursion to Cologne. They also took  part in a ceremony in Aachen, in which Norwegian Prime Minister  Gro Harlem Brundtland was awarded the Charlemagne Peace Prize.  Kinkel will hold talks with Yeltsin in Bonn this Friday [13  May], he will then go to Stuttgart to conclude his visit.  Kinkel and Kozyrev will jointly fly to Geneva to take part in  the meeting of the contact group of several foreign ministers  dealing with the war in Bosnia. Yeltsin, Kozyrev, Economics  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  had negotiated with Kohl and other German government members on  11 May; Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) did not take part in  these negotiations because he was in the island of Ruegen where  he met with the Danish and Polish defense ministers. State  Secretary Schoenbohm stood in for Ruehe in Bonn and held a  separate discussion with Grachev on 12 May.    Yeltsin demanded ""access to all European organizations"" and  to the international trade forum, GATT, for Russia. People  should not forget that ""we are a European country."" Kohl  promised he would work to allow Russia to take part in the world  economic summit of the seven major industrial nations (G7)  without any restrictions in the future. He said that this could  not be expected for Naples in July where Russia would only take  part in the political talks. However, the desire for Russia to  cope with the transition problems made it necessary for the G7  to allow Russia, in the foreseeable future, to take part in  economic discussions: ""Developments are tending to go in this  direction."" Yeltsin and Kohl described Russia and Germany as  the most important mutual partners in Europe.    Kohl confirmed Germany's interest in Russia developing into  a  democratic, economically stable country: ""Within the scope of  our possibilities, we will support Russia in word and deed  wherever Russia considers this desirable."" According to the  chancellor, this holds true for its inclusion in the work of the  World Bank, the IMF, and the EU. ""We are betting on and fully  support President Yeltsin's reform effort."" Russia's full  membership in the EU ""is not of current interest."" First of all,  we must energetically ""pursue association."" Yeltsin voiced the  hope that within a month, agreement could be reached with  Brussels on quotas and access to the market. Being a European  country, Russia should also be a member of the Council of  Europe, he said.    Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) and his  counterpart,  Aleksandr Shokhin, agreed on an order worth 500 million German  marks for the German railroad wagon company, Deutsche Waggonbau,  in Halle this year. To guarantee this project financially,  Germany will again grant special conditions. In 1995, smaller  orders will follow. This cooperation is intended to lead to the  joint development of Russian railroad wagon capacities.    The German and Russian government members said relations  between the two countries were free from burdens and troubles.  A commission of historians was instituted which will begin, at  the end of June at the latest, to utilize the sources that have  now become accessible for evaluation of recent history. By the  middle of June, the next meeting of the German-Russian  commission on the return of artistic items, which so far has  been unsuccessful, will take place. Kohl insisted that the  cultural agreement should form the legal basis for the return of  such items. Now ""concrete results"" must be achieved: ""Several  problems have yet to be clarified."" Yeltsin said that he and  Kohl would agree on a schedule for further commission meetings  before the end of this year. The negotiations on the opening of  a consulate-general in Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad) have not made  progress.    Yeltsin linked his wish for Russia's participation in the  world economic summits with Moscow's cooperation within the  Partnership for Peace and said that both were elements of ""the  all-round integration processes of Russia for the preservation  of peace and security."" Russia's ""great role"" must be taken  into account, he said. In return, Russia supported Germany ""as  a worthy candidate"" for a permanent seat on the UN Security  Council. Because Germany was the second largest country in  Europe after Russia, the close relations with Bonn were making  it easier for Moscow to find a place in Europe's security  system, said Yeltsin. ""However, without a special protocol, we  cannot sign the document on Partnership for Peace, with which we  basically agree."" Yeltsin said that what had to be considered  as distinctive was the fact that Russia has an Army of 3 million  men and equipment that is not in accordance with NATO standards.  ""Russia will start work with NATO in May to formulate the  protocol."" Yeltsin said: ""Following the signing of the  protocol -- and I do not think there will be any major problems  -- Russia will also sign the Partnership for Peace document.""    Yeltsin was satisfied that following the differences over  the  farewell ceremonies for the Russian troops, Kohl ""has seen the  mood of the people and their president."" Referring to the  military's annoyance with the original plan for a civilian  ceremony in Weimar, Yeltsin said: ""One cannot proceed in such a  way that the situation in Russia is destabilized."" ""Therefore,  the federal chancellor quickly agreed to hold the ceremony in  Berlin, but without the allies."" Kohl said it was his ""wish to  see off the soldiers in a dignified and respectful manner and in  a friendly spirit."" He added that he and Yeltsin would  ""personally deal"" with the details of the ""entire ceremony in  Berlin, in order to meet our responsibilities.""    Kohl indicated that he would like to see Russia bring its  influence to bear on the Serbs, and said that both sides were in  agreement that a solution for Bosnia was urgent. Yeltsin  reiterated his suggestion of a ""summit meeting"" in Moscow of  Russia, the United States, the Eu, and the parties involved in  the Bosnian war: ""However, at first we must be sure that the  problem will be solved."" That is why the meeting must be well  prepared: ""The foreign ministers have started work."" He said  that nationalism had also provoked wars in some CIS republics of  the former Soviet Union: ""We in Russia have shed no blood for  such reasons."" Yeltsin said he was not afraid of Zhirinovskiy  and his nationalists: ""No, no, we are not afraid of him; he has  no substance."" Yeltsin added: ""Russia, which suffered in the  war from 1941 to 1945, knows what nationalism means.""     "

China agreed to  allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing to investigate suspected  factories under certain conditions and to adjustments for  natural growth in some principal textile quotas proposed by the  Americans, while the U.S. side agreed not to impose the quota  reductions from 25 to 35 percent and not to send a fact-finding  mission.    An official of the China Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation said: Since the third Sino-U.S. textile  agreement expired on 31 December 1993, the two sides began talks  in September last year on renewal of the bilateral agreement.  But the two sides failed to reach agreement in the previous  three rounds of talks, so a fourth round was held in the last  three days. Under the principle of consultation on the basis of  equality and mutual understanding and accommodation, the two  sides made concerted efforts and finally reached a new agreement.    He pointed out: To reach agreement the two sides have made  concessions. China made concessions as follows: 1) China  agreed to allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing to accompany  Chinese officials on inspection tours of textile factories on  the mainland suspected of engaging in illegal transshipment of  textiles, given approval of the Chinese side and the factories  concerned; 2) China agreed to major adjustments of the annual  natural growth in some principal categories of the textile quota  proposed by the U.S. side; and 3) if it is amply proven that  individual Chinese enterprises have engaged in illegal  transshipment and have done so once and again, China agreed to  accept some quota reduction but no more than three times the  amount of textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally  transshipped. While the Americans agreed: 1) Not to imposed  the quota reductions from 25 to 35 percent demanded earlier; and  2) not to apply the anti-corruption random clauses [fan wu bi di  sui yi xing tiao kuan 0646 5294 1705 4104 7151 1942 1840 2742  2949], which allow the U.S. authorities to send special  fact-finding missions to China to investigate enterprises  suspected of violating the agreement.    The official added: Apart from the foregoing, the two sides  also made corresponding concessions on a number of important  issues. The concrete contents of the agreement and of the  concessions will not be published until later.    He continued: The key problem of the current negotiation  concerned the investigation of and cracking down on illegal  transshipments. Illegal transshipment refers to the practice of  some illegal businessmen, who transshipped textiles to the  United States by taking advantage of the balance quota of third  countries to avoid quota controls exercised by importing and  exporting countries. Such illegal transshipments only helped  those ""intermediaries"" and illegal businessmen to make a  windfall but damaged the interests of both countries.    He further pointed out: The illegal transshipment  jeopardized the normal order of textile trade between the two  countries and also led to chaos in the market. Therefore  measures must be taken to ban and crack down on the illegal  activities. As exporters in China, importers in the United  States, and middlemen in third countries were involved in the  illegal transshipment, which made the situation very  complicated, the two countries must join force to effectively  stamp out the illegal activities. The two countries have common  positions, interests, and objectives on this matter.    Regarding China's measures against illegal transshipment,  the  official said: The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation has formulated many laws and regulations and begun  to investigate relevant illegal activities in light of the  information collected by itself and supplied by the Americans.  In the last two years, China's relevant departments have taken  action against 17 enterprises and a foreign office in China.  China will reduce the quota of enterprises found guilty, revoke  their right of export, ban them from serving as middlemen, and  even withdraw their licenses. In the meantime, China will take  legal action against those people engaged in the illegal  activities. In the future, China will try to enforce relevant  laws in a more effective way and intensify cooperation with the  United States including exchange of information and joint  investigations.     "

During the meeting, the Korean side demanded that China  allow  in 5,000 Korean cars. The Chinese, however, failed to set a  specific target, according to a Ministry of Trade, Industry and  Energy official.    ""We think the export contract will pave the way for formal  exports of Korean-made automobiles to China,"" the official said.  ""Daewoo's export contract will not be just a one-time contract  and domestic manufacturers could export (their cars) to China  continually.""    Daewoo Motor Co. has signed a contract with a Chinese firm  to  ship out 5,000 Lemans, Espero and Prince autos to China around  August or September, according to sources.     "

The aim of her visit to Hong Kong and Macao was to  participate in the meetings of the boards of Hong Kong's China  Resources Group and Macao's Nam Kwong Group, which are  subsidiaries of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation [MOFTEC]. Therefore, except for holding meetings  and visiting some Chinese-funded enterprises, she did not appear  on any other occasion. From the first day she arrived in Hong  Kong, however, she became the focus of the well-informed Hong  Kong and Macao media. Reporters began to follow her wherever  she was. Television, radio, and newspapers carried reports  about her.    Closely Bound Up With Hong Kong's Economy    The reason Hong Kong media paid so much attention to Wu Yi's  Hong Kong visit is, first, because Hong Kong and Macao media  were very concerned about the results of the minister's  just-ended visit to the United States. The development trend of  economic relations and trade between China and the United States  -- and particularly the question of whether the United States  would extend China's most- favored-nation [MFN] trading status  -- is closely bound up with Hong Kong's economy. According to  the Hong Kong Government's estimation, if MFN status were  terminated, Hong Kong would suffer a loss of trading  opportunities ranging from HK$133 billion to HK$187 billion,  Hong Kong's GNP would shrink by a range between HK$19 billion  and HK$26 billion, and the number of people whose employment is  affected will range between 54,000 to 57,000.    In a special interview with our staff reporters in Hong  Kong,  Wu Yi said that one of her important tasks during the U.S. visit  was to preside, together with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald  Brown, over the meeting of the Eighth Sino-American Commerce and  Trade Joint Commission, held in Washington 13-14 April. She  thought that the meeting was a success and that it laid a good  foundation for the establishment of long-term, stable  cooperative economic relations and trade between China and the  United States.    As an annual meeting between the Chinese and U.S.  Governments, the meeting of the Sino-American Commerce and Trade  Joint Commission was the most important mechanism of  consultation for questions related to bilateral economic  relations and trade. Wu Yi said: ""The meeting discussed a wide  range of economic and trade issues of common concern. Both  sides thought this kind of discussion was frank and pragmatic.  At the end of the meeting, a joint declaration regarding  cooperation in industrial technology was signed.""    Please do not think the phrases ""a wide range of,"" ""frank,""  and ""pragmatic"" are some everyday diplomatic terminology. As  far as this author knows, behind these adjectives were practical  contents. For example, questions the two ministers discussed  included MFN status, trade deficit, market access, and  intellectual property rights. Moreover, under the framework of  the three working teams for investment, industrial cooperation,  and law, the Joint Commission meeting was divided into 18 small  groups for discussions on special topics including finance,  trade statistics, export control, commercial law, and  intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the joint declaration  the was finally issued announced the establishment of  trade-financing and trade-promotion working teams, thus  restoring the bilateral law symposium and establishing a  commercial law working team. These were two highly constructive  concrete results.    Advance Amid Frictions    Wu Yi's basic comment on Sino-U.S. economic relations and  trade was ""advance amid frictions."" She said that despite the  frequent frustrating and restless days, trade volume between the  two countries increases at a rate of 20 percent each year.    She held that the biggest shadow on Sino-U.S. economic  relations and trade is the U.S. annual review of MFN status for  China. She stressed that if the United States continues to  attach conditions to MFN, the consequences will be more serious.  If the two sides confront each other, they will suffer and  neither side will win. The delegation's visit to the United  States fell on the eve of the U.S. Congress' debate over MFN  status. It was a subtle and sensitive moment. On her visits to  U.S. Vice President Gore, Treasury Secretary Bentsen, and  National Economic Council Chairman Rubin, and Commerce Secretary  Brown, she repeatedly stated China's position.    Wu Yi said: MFN status is purely a trade issue. We  consistently oppose the linking of it with non-trade issues. If  confrontation arises from this issue, then not only will  Sino-U.S. economic relations be clouded in a shadow, but there  also is the possibility they may break up. She said that China  is fully prepared if the United States chooses to confront China  and that China will not crumble without MFN status.    While  in the United States, she always cited the Chinese saying to  explain China's diversified market policy: ""If there is no  light in the east, there is light in the west. If there is  darkness in the south, it will not be dark in the north."" There  now are 228 countries and regions that have economic relations  and trade with Mainland China. Wu Yi said: ""China's door has  been opened to the whole world. It is impossible for anyone to  close it.""    An Economic Card    Some media hold that during her U.S. trip, Wu Yi played a  good ""economic card"": She headed a 200-person investment and  trade delegation for the trip across the Pacific at the same  time. The delegation -- which was comprised of high-ranking  officials, experts, and entrepreneurs from the eight ministries  and commissions of the State Council and from the 26 provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions -- offered more than 800  projects for negotiation. They launched large trade-promotion  campaigns in Los Angeles and New York. It has been learned that  the delegation was the largest ever sent to the United States by  China. In the 10-day trade talks, at least $1.3 billion of  contracts were signed and the total amount as stated in letters  of intent exceeded $4 billion.    U.S. financial, industrial, and commercial circles responded  enthusiastically. Various multinational corporations and  medium-sized and small investors kept visiting, and a total of  1,200 or more people participated in the trade talks.    Everyone knows that last year, more than 300 large U.S.  corporations sent a joint letter to President Clinton, asking  for the unconditional renewal of China's MFN status, ending the  annual debate at an early date, and eliminating destabilizing  factors. Since the end of the Cold War, the international  macroclimate has developed in the direction of ""economics and  trade,"" and among corporations from around the world China has  become a large market to scramble for. So far, of the 500  largest corporations listed by FORTUNE, 52 have set up factories  in China, and U.S. economic interests have been expanding  continuously. Therefore, the call for the resolution of China's  MFN status comes mainly from U.S. industrial and commercial  circles. They were extremely interested in the MOFTEC  minister's visit.    Moreover, many U.S. industrialists and businessmen know that  Wu Yi was once an entrepreneur in charge of a large  petrochemical company and that she has excellent expertise. On  one occasion when she met IBM's new president in Beijing, her  familiarity with and knowledge of IBM's business greatly  surprised the guest, who exclaimed: ""I am wondering if I am the  IBM president or you.""    Historical Opportunity for Sino-U.S. Economic and Trade  Cooperation    During the U.S. trip, Wu Yi paid a special visit to the  McDonnell Douglas Corporation, and General Electric's president  flew Wu Yi, head of the Chinese Government Economic and Trade  Delegation, and Ye Qing, the deputy head and vice minister of  the State Planning Commission, to its headquarters on a special  plane. In their last day in New York, the U.S. top boss  (Greenburgh) came to see her and held a farewell party for Wu Yi  and her party, at which dozens of bosses of well-known U.S.  corporations gathered, making the night a brilliant one.    Wu Yi placed a big order with the U.S. entrepreneurs: ""In  the next seven years, China's total imports will reach $1,000  billion. China's emphases of development are in such areas as  communications, telecommunications, and energy -- precisely  those in which the United States has an advantage. U.S.  economic circles are faced with a historical opportunity to  develop Sino-U.S. economic cooperation.""    Over the past four years, the U.S. Congress has been a major  obstacle to the smooth extension of MFN status. In recent  years, following large numbers of visits to China by congressmen  and their assistants, plus the positive and effective lobbying  of U.S. industrialists and businessmen, more and more  congressmen have come to support the unconditional extension of  China's MFN status. On the trip to the United States, Wu Yi met  with more than 30 congressmen and was invited to the Congress,  where debate was under way. According to data supplied by the  Chinese Embassy in the United States, that was the first time a  senior Chinese official had met so large a number of congressmen.    Effective Cooperation Will Create a Miracle    Another reason Hong Kong and Macao were so concerned about  Wu  Yi's visits was because the popularity of this female minister  is rapidly increasing in international economic circles. Since  the end of 1991 when she, as the head of the Chinese  representatives to the Sino-U.S. talks on intellectual property  rights, finally succeeded in the nagging talks following an  arduous battle of words, has been considered a strong rival in  talks by Western countries, especially by the United States,  which is the de facto controller of several major world economic  organizations. Although she did not have to participate in  talks as her duty during the delegation's visit to the United  States, she demonstrated a frank, forthright, calm, and  resourceful personal character in her contacts with government  officials and entrepreneurs, and won many new friends. Her  style has become a new image of openness of senior Chinese  officials and is drawing increased attention.    She said: ""The United States is the most developed country  in the world. It possesses a great wealth of capital and  advanced technology. China is the world's largest developing  country and possesses a wealth of human resources and a  practical and potential huge market. If China and the United  States can achieve effective cooperation, then we believe that  an economic miracle will be created.""     "

The guidelines are expected to urge APEC members to enhance  antipollution measures and improve labor conditions like wages,  the source said. Japan aims at presenting the draft for the  guidelines to 17 APEC members in preparatory work for the annual  ministerial meeting to be held in Jakarta in late November, he  said.    The APEC, established in 1989, groups Japan, Malaysia,  Canada, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, China, South Korea,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Brunei, Indonesia, the United States,  Philippines, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, and Mexico.    The guidelines will include protection of tropical forest,  introduction of a minimum wage ceiling system and enforcement of  compulsory education with their medium-and long-term targets,  the source said.

Schrempp, who arrived in Jerusalem on Monday  [14 February] for a brief talk with Israeli head of government  Yitzhaq Rabin, told the press afterwards that both sides could  benefit from such cooperation.    The Dasa chief had visited, among other things, the Israeli  aviation corporation Israel Air Force Industries (IAI) and the  armament company Rafael. He noted that the high-tech companies  have excellent quality, which need not shy away from  international comparison. Both sides would benefit from an  exchange in the field of technology. As fields of cooperation  he cited defense technology, satellite technology, and aircraft  construction. Schrempp spoke of efforts by Airbus to sell planes  to the Israeli El Al airline. Smaller planes could be of  interest for El Al, if regional aviation becomes more important  as a result of a stable peace in the Middle East.    In his talk with Schrempp, Rabin explained his government's  interest in balancing the high deficit in his country's trade  balance with Europe. However, politics can provide industry  only with a framework, which then has to be fleshed out by the  companies themselves, Rabin noted.     "

The government will send six experts through the Japan  International Cooperation Agency (JICA), in response to a  request from the Government of Ecuador, the ministry said.    The group, comprised of experts on birds, reptiles and  botanical ecology, will visit Isabela Island, the largest of the  Galapagos group, to survey the effects on wildlife of the  prolonged forest fire that has been burning since April 12, it  said.    The experts will also offer advice to Ecuador's presidential  panel for disaster prevention on measures to protect and  increase reproduction of wildlife, to repair damage, and on  monitoring the natural environment, the ministry said.    The forest fire on the 460,000-hectare Isabela Island has  not  yet been completely extinguished. As of April 26, some 10,000  hectares had been devastated by the fire, it said.    Wildlife peculiar to the Galapagos Islands, such as iguanas  and giant tortoises, is endangered by the fire. The island's  ecosystem is also seriously affected, the ministry said.     "

The following figures indicate the dynamics of such  crimes: last year they increased at a rate of over 2,120 percent  and more than 7,060 cases of counterfeiting--21 times more than  the previous year--were recorded. But if the difficulty in  recognizing the counterfeit money is taken into account, many  more of the crimes are actually being committed.    In analyzing the reasons for this type of crime, the  specialists associate it with the interruption or weakening of  economic ties among the republics. Taking advantage of this  situation, criminals are actively saturating the currency market  with a large number of counterfeits, including those with high  printing quality. The fact that the free circulation of ready  cash in foreign currency was banned previously in the Soviet  Union is also very important. And bank and cashier personnel had  no experience in determining the authenticity of one bank note  or another. Even now they have practically no experience.    On the other hand, there is a convincing explanation for  that. The extent to which even specialists are informed in  determining the authenticity of paper bank notes has been  extremely meager thus far. For example, they lack professional  descriptions of SKV [convertible currency] bank notes, as well  as the methods of identifying the means of protection and  determining the authenticity of paper money. There is not enough  of the equipment needed to test the bank notes.    There are specialized reference publications from Interpol,  but they have not been adapted to conditions in the CIS  countries and they are inaccessible to most users because of  their high price.    The problem of combating the counterfeiting of money and its  further illegal use is many-sided. And law enforcement and other  organs have been called upon to play a specific role in solving  it. But what is most important, it seems, is to improve the  skill in this area of specialists in the financial field, as  well as all citizens. The Moscow publishing firm ""Ivan and  Partnership"" has made its contribution to a solution of this  problem. It has begun turning out reference and procedural  literature which makes it possible to test and expose  counterfeit bank notes with a high degree of reliability. This  work is being conducted with the participation of specialists  from the Central Bank and the Russian Ministry of Internal  Affairs.    According to the assessment of specialists in law  enforcement  organs, publications by the ""Ivan and Partnership"" firm contain  the most complete description of convertible currency bank notes  with a detailed analysis and illustration of the elements and  degree of protection. In other words, the publications help one  see for himself the high quality of printing in the bank notes.  It is very difficult for any one of the counterfeiters to  achieve such a level of quality. So it turns out that the  workmanship here actively withstands counterfeiting.    In addition, in the experts' opinion, the firm's  publications  have an advantage over a similar publication from Interpol  because of their saturation with information and simplicity for  the user.    It is worth noting that the Russian Federation Ministry for  Cooperation With CIS Member-States is very concerned about  prospects in the struggle against counterfeiting. Incidentally,  it conducted a special analysis of reference literature, both  domestic and foreign, on the problem of exposing counterfeit  bank notes and monitoring their authenticity, and it found the  ""Handbook on Convertible Currency Bank Notes"" [Spravochnik  banknot SKV] published by the ""Ivan and Partnership"" firm to be  the most promising at this time.    There is a direct recommendation from the Ministry for  Cooperation With CIS Member-States to organizations in CIS  countries that they devote their attention to this handbook.  They believe here that it contains a volume of knowledge that is  unique in the world, and much of it is being published for the  first time. The book actually presents a new system for visually  monitoring the authenticity of bank notes on the spot. In short,  the publication may become an indispensable aid both in banking  and currency and cashier operations, as well as for the activity  of criminological experts in law enforcement organizations. Let  us hope that it will help us to climb one more step on the  stairway leading to a civilized market.     "

Shot in various Iraqi towns, the first in four episodes  focused on complaints by Iraqis about the effects of the  sanctions on their daily lives and comments by Iraqi officials.    Several of those interviewed said they could not understand  why the embargo was being maintained ""after Kuwait was returned  to the Kuwaitis"" and called for the Arab states to support  Baghdad's position to have the sanctions lifted.    The UN embargo was imposed days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on  August 2, 1990.    Iraqi Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih also told the  program that his country opposed a UN resolution allowing for  the sale of limited quantities of oil under United Nations  control.    Iraq says the restrictions for the sale harm its  sovereignty.    Besides Oman, which has always maintained normal relations  with Iraq, Qatar is the only GCC country to have restored links  with Baghdad after it participated in the U.S.-led coalition  that ousted Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991.    The GCC also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab  Emirates and Bahrain.     "

The  Chinese delegation visited U.S. Government research institutes,  met with U.S. Government senior officials, and made contacts  with people of U.S. high-tech enterprises.    The nine-member delegation headed by Song Jian arrived in  Washington on the evening of 10 April to attend the sixth  meeting of the Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation  Joint Committee at the invitation of John Gibbons, U.S.  presidential science and technology advisor and head of the  Science and Technology Policy Office of the White House. The  principal members of the Chinese delegation include Liu Jiang,  minister of Agriculture; Yan Hongmo, director of the State  Maritime Bureau; Hu Qiheng, vice president of the Chinese  Academy of Sciences; Ba Denian [1572 1795 1628], president of  the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences; and Ye Ruqiu, deputy  director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau. This  morning, the Chinese delegation visited the U.S. National  Standardization Technology Research Institute. Delegation  members heard an introduction on the institute's ""advanced  technology plan"" and ""manufacturing and promoting cooperation  partners project"" and also visited two institute laboratories.    This afternoon, Song Jian had a meeting with U.S. Interior  Secretary Bruce Babbitt and exchanged opinions with him on  cooperation in protecting wild animals. According to a Chinese  delegation member who took part in the meeting, Babbitt pointed  out that he was ""deeply impressed"" with China's protection of  giant pandas and other rare wild animals and China's enforcement  of laws against the trade of animals that are in imminent  danger. Song Jian proposed that the two sides strengthen  unified management on the issue of exhibition of giant pandas  abroad. He said that, in addition, the two countries could  cooperate to improve the technology of multiplying giant pandas.    In a meeting with Neil Lane, chairman of the U.S. National  Science Foundation, Song Jian expressed the hope of expanding  cooperation in the field of ""major sciences [da ke xue 1129 4430  1331]."" Neil Lane was interested in China's desire to expand  cooperation and invited China to take part in the plant genetic  map project that is being undertaken in the United States.    Later, Song Jian met with U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel  O'Leary  and the two sides discussed prospects of cooperation in the  utilization of conventional and new energy sources and nuclear  energy.    This afternoon, Song Jian also met with U.S. Deputy Defense  Secretary Frank Wisner and discussed with him cooperation in  utilizing military technologies by civilian sectors. The U.S.  deputy defense secretary held that China started the work of  having military technologies serve the civilian sectors  relatively early and gained some experiences that the U.S. could  borrow.    This evening, the U.S.-China Trade Committee and several  U.S.  high-tech companies, mainly aerospace and aeronautics  enterprises, gave a dinner party in honor of Song Jian and  delegation members. More than 70 people attended the party.  Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu and several  U.S. congressmen and former congressmen attended the party.  Robert Rowe, former chairman of the U.S. House Science  Committee, spoke at the dinner. He pointed out: Both China and  the United States are big countries. The two should join  efforts, cooperate with each other, and should not be entangled  in issues like the most favored nation treatment.    Starting tomorrow morning, the science and technology  delegation and the U.S. side will take part in the biannual  Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Joint Committee  meeting. The Chinese delegation will end its activities in the  United States on 13 April.    On the eve of his departure for the United States, Song Jian  was interviewed jointly by XINHUA and KEJI RIBAO reporters.  Song Jian pointed out: Sino-U.S. cooperation in science and  technology has great potential and broad prospects because the  cooperation can play a role in leading and promoting the  constant development of the economy and trade of the two  countries. He emphatically pointed out: Strengthening  exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in science  and technology is not only in accord with the basic interests of  the two countries but also beneficial to the progress and  development of all of mankind.

By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Jordan, once regarded as a massive gap in the trade-sanctions ring around Iraq,  now is in full compliance with the U.N.-imposed embargo and is entitled to  ""generous"" economic aid from the world community, the Bush Administration said  Friday.    The new assessment is a dramatic reversal of the Administration's earlier  complaints that Jordan, for years Washington's closest Arab ally, had thrown in  its lot with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.    ""We now consider Jordanian compliance with sanctions to be good,"" State  Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. ""When we have made our concerns  known to Jordan, Jordan has addressed them and taken steps to meet them.  Jordan's economy is being particularly hard hit by this crisis; we believe that  Jordan's compliance warrants generous support.""    Boucher's comments came as Michel Marto, deputy governor of the Central Bank of  Jordan, was visiting Washington in search of support for his nation's fragile  economy, which was devastated by the loss of its traditional markets in Iraq  and Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council imposed the trade embargo shortly after  Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.    Although Marto conceded that it took some time for the Amman government to wind  down its commerce with Iraq, he insisted: ""We are now 100% . . . adhering to  the sanctions.""    Marto said Administration officials who gave him a chilly reception last month  now demonstrate an ""understanding of our problems."" He said he was assured that  ""it is in the interest of the United States to have stability in Jordan.""    Despite the U.S. endorsement, however, Jordan still faces deep economic  problems. Congress has approved $35 million in U.S. economic aid. However,  Saudi Arabia, once the source of massive assistance, is not yet ready to  forgive Jordan's King Hussein for his diplomatic flirtation with Iraq's  Hussein. (The two are not related.)    Before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Jordan was exporting 500,000 tons of fruit  and vegetables -- a substantial share of its total production -- a year to  Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Marto said. Moreover, Jordan was receiving about  $500 million a year in economic aid from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other gulf  states. After the invasion, that trade and aid ended.    In addition, Marto said, before the invasion about 400,000 Jordanians were  working in Kuwait, most of them sending part of their pay home to extended  families in Jordan. Today, 150,000 of those workers have returned home in the  face of rising unemployment. Those who stayed are being paid in Iraqi dinars,  an unconvertible currency that is virtually worthless outside Iraq and Kuwait.    The economy will certainly contract, Marto said. If Jordan gets massive foreign  aid, the decline will be about 10%. Without such a transfusion, the skid could  reach 40%, he added.    Boucher said the United States will urge other international donors to increase  their support for Jordan. He noted that the United States is acting as a  coordinator for donors, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,  Japan, Germany, the 12-nation European Community and the exiled government of  Kuwait.    In response to questions, Boucher said Washington would support a resumption of  Saudi aid and trade with Jordan.    But Saudi sources said there is little likelihood that the two kingdoms will  patch up their dispute any time soon.    ""The Saudi grievances are a lot bigger than that embargo,"" one source said.    For instance, he noted that the Jordanian government allowed pro-Iraqi  Jordanians to buy advertisements in Jordanian newspapers while refusing to  permit pro-Saudi Jordanians to do the same.    King Hussein angered both the U.S. and Saudi governments by touring the Arab  world in search of an ""Arab solution"" to the gulf crisis that would not require  Iraq's total and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. Washington and Riyadh  have ruled out ""partial solutions"" that would leave Iraq anything to show for  its aggression.    Asked why Jordan, which has suffered more than any nation except Kuwait from  the Iraqi invasion, would support measures that would give Saddam Hussein a  partial victory, Marto said: ""We have always been encouraged to negotiate. The  United States always tells us to negotiate.""    Marto confirmed reports that in the early days of the crisis, the Central Bank  of Jordan accepted a $50-million payment intended for Iraq. But he denied that  the bank was laundering money for Baghdad. Instead, he said, the money was  applied to Iraq's debt of more than $300 million to Jordan resulting from loans  during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.    ""The $50 million has been frozen,"" he said. ""But we took it as payment. They  (the Iraqis) owe us a lot of money.""

By RONALD J. OSTROW and ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      WASHINGTON      The United States repeatedly turned a blind eye to Iraqi-sponsored terrorism  during the 1980s by leaving the nation off its official terrorist-state list,  the CIA's former counterterrorist operations chief charged Tuesday.    ""We looked the other way when we knew that Iraq was carrying out a terrorist  operation,"" said Vincent M. Cannistraro, who retired from the CIA on Oct. 1. He  branded the decision to keep Iraq off the terrorist list -- a designation that  carries economic sanctions -- ""a terrible mistake.""    A government counterterrorism official who declined to be identified contended  that Cannistraro was ""stretching things a bit.""    While ""we knew they didn't have completely clean hands,"" there was no evidence  of terrorism after the end of 1982, the year Iraq was dropped from the State  Department listing of specific terrorism sponsorship, he said.    An official of another agency with counterterrorism responsibilities said he  would not dispute the retired CIA official's assessment but would give no  specifics.    Cannistraro declined to give details of U.S. knowledge of Iraqi sponsorship of  terrorism. Now a senior fellow with the National Strategy Information Center, a  nonprofit organization concerned with intelligence issues, Cannistraro formerly  held intelligence positions with the National Security Council and the Pentagon  in addition to his service at the CIA.    Talking with reporters, Cannistraro said: ""There was intelligence information  available at various stages that indicated quite clearly that Iraq was involved  in the sponsorship of terrorism. This goes over two Administrations,"" he added,  referring to the Bush and Reagan administrations.    Cannistraro said Iraq was kept off the State Department list because during the  Iran-Iraq War the United States considered Iran its principal enemy.    ""This was an instance of our using short-term policy interests to confuse our  longer-term coherent policy objectives,"" he said. ""That's what I'm opposed to.""    Cannistraro's allegations would indicate significantly greater tolerance of  Iraqi misdeeds than earlier known at a time when the United States was trying  to cultivate favor with the government of Saddam Hussein.    Earlier, officials have acknowledged that the United States supplied Iraq with  military intelligence to use against Iran and later allowed export of some  technology that might have military applications.    Until now, there has been no indication that the United States was willing to  overlook terrorism by the Iraqis. Iraq was returned to the list of states  sponsoring terrorism in September, a month after it invaded Kuwait.    Cannistraro contended that government officials who were monitoring Iraq saw  involvement in terrorism ""very clearly,"" but were undercut by the Iraqi desk at  the State Department, which oversees U.S. relations with that nation.    ""The country desk would constantly undercut the intelligence information by  saying, 'No, no that's not valid. You've only one source for that,' ""  Cannistraro said. ""In other words, there'd be a whole series of  rationalizations for why they should not believe that Iraq was involved in  terrorism, because it wasn't in their interest to believe it.    ""That's a major problem,"" he added. ""We've seen that with Iraq, and I think  we're seeing that today with Syria.    ""We are now very anxious to cultivate relations with (Syrian leader Hafez)  Assad, because from a foreign policy point of view it is important for us to  have a larger Arab component in Saudi Arabia. And therefore we're overlooking  some of the really horrible things Assad has done and continues to do,""  Cannistraro said.    Turning to the investigation of the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight  103, Cannistraro said the Justice Department ""has made substantial progress in  identifying the modus operandi by which that bomb got on board.""    He said he thought the department was ""very, very close"" to obtaining an  indictment of those who carried out the bombing of the New York-bound flight  from London.    The bombing killed all 259 people aboard and 11 residents of Lockerbie,  Scotland.    But a source familiar with the investigation disputed Cannistraro's timetable,  suggesting that he was confusing intelligence information with that needed to  support a criminal indictment.    Cannistraro also contended that ""there is a lot of evidence that puts the  commissioning of the (Flight 103) terrorist incident at the doorstep of the  Iranian government. I'm persuaded that that's true. . . . That's not to say  that the Iranian government implemented it.    ""I'm saying that the majority of the ruling members of the Iranian government  made a conscious joint decision to commission that,"" he said. ""It was not a  rogue operation.

A well-informed Austrian source told KUNA here today that  Kuwaiti officials have expressed deep concern over the contacts  between some Austrian companies and a delegation from the Iraqi  Ba'th Party which visited Austria recently under the leadership  of former ambassador 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, the director of  foreign affairs in the Ba'th party.    The source also said that Kuwait is closely following these  contacts and officials consider that ""the relevant Austrian and  other European companies are in breach of the international  sanctions imposed on Iraq"" at a time when the Iraqi regime is  not committing itself to implementing the UN resolutions as a  condition for lifting the economic sanctions imposed on it since  it occupied Kuwait in 1990.    Kuwaiti officials do not rule out the possibility of  interrupting cooperation with those companies if they continue  their contacts and cooperation with the Iraqi regime before it  implements all the UN resolutions.

Seoul  proposed to Washington the formation of a Korea-U.S. committee  on industrial cooperation when Trade-Industry-Energy Minister  Kim Chol-su visited the United States last April.    Kim's proposal was aimed at introducing advanced technology  to wipe out trade disputes by linking Korean and U.S.  manufacturers through technological tie-ups. But Minister Kim  seemed unaware of the differences in the economic structure of  the two countries, an observer said.    In Korea, the government is able to easily guide enterprises  in whatever direction it wants, but in the United States,  government intervention in private business is impossible  because of its free market mechanisms, the observer explained.  Minister Kim proposed to form an alliance between Korea and the  United States in technology, investment and overseas market  development in high-tech industries during Washington talks with  Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown.    During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  conference in Seattle last November, Kim and Brown agreed, in  principle, that the committee will be launched when trade  ministers talks are held again this year.    Seoul also proposed to form nine subcommittees on  semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, medical equipment,  computers, machine tools and power generation facilities,  environment-related facilities, automobiles and aircraft, a  Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry official said. But Washington  has cited various difficulties in proceeding with ahead with the  bilateral industrial cooperation program under the government  initiatives.    The official is pessimistic about the proposal, citing a  bilateral science and technology cooperation committee whose  inauguration has still yet to be seen due to passive attitude of  the U.S. government although Seoul proposed nearly 10 years ago.    Korea has also suggested establishing a fund on industrial  and technological cooperation each with money provided by each  government and businesses to carry out projects.    Korea has set up a fund this year with 3.2 billion won  donated by the business circle and 800 million won of state  subsidy. The government plans to increase the fund to $20  million (some 16 billion won) by 1997.    The government has also drawn up a concrete program on the  operation of the fund when the subcommittees are established.  The official said that the fund will be used to support joint  venture projects, introduction of advanced U.S. technology,  feasibility studies to sort out areas for possible cooperation  and exchanges of science and technology researchers. But the  U.S. government has turned down the suggestion, reportedly  saying that it is unable to set aside money from its budget and  to force businesses to donate to that purpose, the ministry  official said.    Korea also proposed that both government officials and  businessmen participate in the nine subcommittees. But the U.S.  government objected to the inclusion of public servants in the  subcommittees, the official said.    During the conference of the Dialogue for Economic  Cooperation (DEC) in Washington last month, the two sides agreed  to change the subcommittees to private advisory forums composed  of businessmen from both countries. But the U.S. reiterated  that public officials should be excluded.    As expected, the U.S. government has also faced difficulties  in arranging for American companies to take part in the  formation of the advisory forum in each field, although Korea is  ready to do so, according to the Trade-Industry-energy Ministry.    U.S. officials reportedly insist that technology transfers  can be possible on commercial basis among companies and as a  result their government can hardly intervene in private  businesses.    Although Minister Kim's idea is good, he does not understand  the different industrial structure of the two nations, an  official of the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), a private  interest group of large business concerns.    ""In fact, there are many sectors for manufacturers of both  nations to cooperate,"" the FKI official said, adding that Korean  and U.S. companies will be able to join hands to advance to  China with the enormous market potential with U.S. high  technology and Korea's experience of massive production and  still cheap skilled manpower.    He said, ""The urgent problem to be tackled for high-tech  imports is to create an atmosphere for foreign investment here  and trust on Korean firms.""    ""Restrictions in the financial sector, acquisition of real  estate, construction of plants are a great hindrance to foreign  investment,"" the FKI official stressed.    The WALL STREET JOURNAL recently reported that 220 foreign  firms withdrew $369 million in investments here in 1992 and 52  of them completely closed their plants here due to the  unfavorable business environment.

Relations with Germany occupy an important place in our  entire policy, Meksi said at the beginning of his speech. This  is based on the special economic assistance and the full  political support that your country has rendered to Albania so  far and in the good wishes and will of both sides further to  strengthen our friendly relations.    Talking concretely about the present level of cooperation in  the economic, political, technical, scientific, and cultural  spheres, Meksi considered these to be successful and stressed  that, nevertheless, there exist more favorable possibilities so  that these relations be more intensively developed in other  fields as well. Important positive factors are the good progress  of the economic reform in Albania in its main indices and the  completion of the fundamental legal framework to attract foreign  investment. Overall production has increased and there is a  decrease in the budget deficit and inflation. Stability can be  noticed in the lek's exchange rate with foreign currencies. We  can say that we have left behind the most difficult period. We  have approved the main laws on investment, business, and the  banking and credit system, and the civil and penal codes are in  the process of being approved.    Meksi further stressed that the completion of a series of  bilateral agreements that are in the process of being drafted,  such as the abolition of double taxation, tourism, road and  maritime transportation, and scientific and cultural  cooperation, will create a more facilitating legal framework to  expand relations between our two countries.    Focusing on the problem of foreign investment, Prime  Minister  Meksi said that German capital is involved in Albania in special  investment, such as that of Siemens for Rinas Airport, and in  the form of joint ventures. However, he said, we expect German  investment to grow considerably during 1994 and beyond and to  include such fields as infrastructure and telecommunication,  road constructions, such as the east-west road, aqueducts,  energy, etc.    We greatly appreciate Germany's role both on the bilateral  level and within the framework of the European Union [EU], in  which Germany is the main contributor.    Mr. Meksi also dwelt on the problem of the foreign debt of  our banks and discussed ways of settling it, as another  guarantee for attracting foreign investment. He stressed that  contacts with German partners have been strengthened and hoped  that with the Paris Club Agreement, this problem will find the  way to solution in the framework of the general debt.    For his part, Mr. Kinkel said that Germany understands quite  well the difficult problems that you are encountering during the  transitional period and that Germany is committed to help as  before on the bilateral and the EU level. Albania is a country  that has suffered the most in the past. That is why you fully  deserve special assistance on our part, Kinkel stressed.  Germany will fully support you in your goals for an the  quickest possible political and economic approach to the EU,  membership into the Council of Europe, the cooperation with BEP  [expansion unknown], and the strengthening of the security of  your country, both with the NATO integration and the bilateral  level.    For this reason, we are ready to exchange high-level visits  and sign a joint statement to display our very good relations  and the goals of cooperation in the future.    In the economic level, our assistance will be increased and  will be concentrated on the system of energy supplies, the  construction of roads, economic development, etc. Though we  have to face our problems with eastern Germany, our attention  toward Albania will be increased. I also agree to abolish visas  for diplomatic and business trips.    Further on, Kinkel appreciated the achievements in the  sphere  of the institutional and legal reform and expressed his pleasure  that the judicial system is functioning well. He was ready for  assistance in this direction as well.    To conclude, Meksi said that Albania is a small country and  with a little investment, it can overcome this situation. We  have understood that the main factor of development is within  us, our work, which, with your assistance, can give rapid  positive results.    They also discussed German assistance in education, culture,  and science, the problem of Albanian refugees, and the situation  in the region.     "
0,FT924-7456 ,"FT924-7456 _AN-CKQCNAACFT 921117   FT  17 NOV 92 / Scope of probe into arms for Iraq is widened      By PHILIP STEPHENS, DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS   THE government last night announced wide-ranging terms of reference for the judicial inquiry into Britain's defence trade with Iraq. But as Mr John Major set out to quash claims of a cover-up, it emerged that senior ministers had been preparing to relax the arms trade restrictions just two weeks before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The prime minister said Lord Justice Scott's inquiry would not be restricted to Matrix Churchill and would be free to delve into related issues such as the Supergun affair. He emphasised it would be free to focus not just on 'arms questions', but on 'decisions taken on the prosecution of companies and on public interest immunity'. 'All ministers who are called will give evidence,' Mr Major said. In addition, civil servants would be instructed to co-operate and all papers called for would be made available. Lord Justice Scott, who was appointed last week to head the inquiry, would be free to decide on the publication of his report and of evidence taken from witnesses. But the government is likely to face fresh questions over Matrix Churchill following confirmation by senior Whitehall officials last night that ministers agreed just two weeks before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait to relax restrictions on defence-related sales to Baghdad. The decision, taken at a meeting on July 19 1990 chaired by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, was not implemented because it was overtaken by the outbreak of hostilities on August 2. The agreement was subject to the approval of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then prime minister, and would have been announced to parliament. The ministerial meeting was the culmination of more than two years of Whitehall battles over guidelines set out in 1985 by the then foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, to prevent Britain from arming either side in the Iran-Iraq war. It was called at the request of the Department of Trade and Industry, the government department which consistently backed the sale of Matrix Churchill machine tools to Iraq even after it was shown they were used for military purposes. The officials said that the ministers at the July 19 meeting - representing the cabinet's overseas and defence committee - agreed that the rules should be relaxed to take account of the peace accord between Iran and Iraq. Downing Street has refused to divulge the names of the other ministers present at the talks, but said that Mr John Major, then chancellor, did not attend. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday launched a fresh series of allegations about the extent of the prime minister's knowledge during his time as foreign secretary and chancellor. Mr Cook supported his claims with documents from the Matrix Churchill trial, but failed to provide more than circumstantial evidence linking Mr Major to the events outlined in the documents. Downing Street emphasised that Mr Major had been concerned to make the terms of reference for the inquiry as wide as possible, but said it was still open to Lord Justice Scott to seek to extend them further. Opposition MPs dubbed the terms of reference 'unsatisfactory' and complained that the powers of the judge to enforce witnesses to attend were insufficient. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the inquiry would not look at whether ministers misled parliament, or require evidence to be given on oath or in public. Nor would it have powers to force former ministers to co-operate. Earlier, Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney general, indicated in the Commons that current or former ministers could expect to be prosecuted if evidence that they had committed criminal offences came to light.

'Should there be borders between Iraq and Kuwait? No,' said a 26-year-old theatrical director. 'We all know, from since we are kids we've known, that Kuwait is part of Iraq.' 'I cannot stand to hear say that we are to recognise Kuwait, even my body shakes,' said a 44-year-old shopkeeper, who was indeed shaking. 'My arm is trembling when I hear this, because we have for years known that Kuwait is an Iraqi country.' In fact, Iraq has long maintained that Kuwait has always been Iraqi - from Ottoman times. Iraqi historians have taught generations of Iraqi schoolchildren that the emirate was part of the vilayet, or administrative district, of Basra. Western and Kuwaiti historians contend the emir of Kuwait enjoyed considerable freedom from Ottoman rule and that Iraq's claim is poorly based. While successive Iraqi rulers have held diplomatic ties with successions of Kuwaiti counterparts - including, up to the summer of 1990, Mr Saddam and Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti emir - Iraq sought to invade its southern neighbour first in 1962, when a joint British-Arab force held the line, then again, with a seven-month occupation and bloody consequences, in 1990. If Mr Saddam unequivocally recognises Iraq's border with Kuwait, which for the first time was formally demarcated by a UN commission after the Gulf conflict, he would be the first Iraqi leader to do so. Iraq has never been content with the loosely sketched British demarcation of 1922. Though this served as the roughly accepted line until the UN demarcation, it relied on such imprecise markers as palm trees and low rising rock formations in the featureless desert scrub. Kuwait quietly ceded a strip of its northern coast to Iraqi control during the Iran-Iraq war as a gesture of support for Baghdad, which used the land to build a military hoverport at Umm Qasr, a facility now formally back in Kuwait and housing the headquarters of the Unikom force which monitors the present border. Before the past week's border crisis, Unikom frequently reported shootings across the desert line and, in January last year, incursions by Iraqis which included the theft of a Silkworm missile stored in what used to be an Iraqi military bunker. Yesterday's declaration by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, that Iraq would now recognise the border and Kuwait's sovereignty with 'no conditions' holds some promise of closing this chapter of Gulf border belligerence. But if Iraq's recognition suggests that the Kuwait invasion and subsequent war - costing tens of thousands of Iraqi lives - was a mistake, few Iraqis will risk saying so in public. Instead, they argue that Mr Saddam has rightly decided to remove any further pretext for continued sanctions or further bombardment of their cities. News that Russian diplomacy and apparent Iraqi concessions might bring relief from the increasingly bitter scourge of sanctions was greeted with cautious relief, deep scepticism that America will allow this to happen, but an unmistakably profound desire that it should be so. 'It will be a better life for me,' said a tea vendor in his 30s who said he fought in the Gulf war. 'I will be able to get married, have a wife and child and have a better life. Conditions are not for this now.' Booming over the posh but increasingly impoverished Baghdad suburb of Mansour, the preacher's voice after Friday prayers implored: 'Please help us to bring our enemies to reason.' That task has now been entrusted to the Russian foreign ministry and Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, who will take their diplomatic package to the UN Security Council next week.

Internationally, along with the end to the East-West Cold War,  the building of a new international order is becoming a pressing  issue. At home, the 1955 order centering on both the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party of Japan  (SDPJ) has ended and an effective method is being sought to  proceed with foreign policy under a ruling coalition composed of  eight parties. The following is an introduction to the officials  that are proceeding with Japanese foreign policy under the most  difficult set of circumstances since the war.    Minister and Parliamentary Vice Minister    On 1 August, MOFA carried out its greatest structural reform  since the war. The two pillars of structural reform were the  abolition of the United Nations Bureau along with the  establishment of the General Foreign Affairs Policy Bureau and a  change of the mantle for the Information Analysis, Research, and  Planning Bureau into the International Information Bureau. Along  with this, personnel changes were carried out on a ministry-wide  scale for the most part, including those overseas.    Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs  Tsutomu Hata is leading MOFA in this difficult situation. As the  head of the Shinseito Party, he contributed to the victory of  the non-LDP forces in the general election and the establishment  of a coalition administration centering on Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa. He personally denies it, but according to  those around him, it is said that he desired the appointment to  foreign minister at an early date and ultimately fulfilled his  desire.    He presents a slightly different foreign policy ideology  from  that of foreign ministers of the LDP regime era. For instance,  he advocates expressing general responsibility for World War II  and refraining from visits to Yasukuni Shrine on the 15 August  anniversary of the end of the war.    The parliamentary vice minister for foreign affairs, who  assists the foreign minister, is Shozo Azuma of the Komeito. It  is said that the appointment of the parliamentary vice minister  for foreign affairs from the Komeito was due to the strong  desire by that party and the desire was realized with the  appointment of Azuma. Ironically, his electoral district is the  Tokyo No. 6 District, the same area as former parliamentary vice  minister for foreign affairs, Koji Kakizawa, and it can be  called a personnel change due to an awareness of activities in  the era of Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs  Kakizawa.    Administrative Vice Minister, Deputy Vice Minister for  Foreign Affairs, and Chief of Protocol    Supporting the two politicians, Tsutomu Hata and Shozo  Azuma,  are Administrative Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Kunihiko  Saito (passed foreign service exam in 1957, same for below) and  the following foreign service officers:    Saito, the administrative vice minister following previous  Vice Minister Hisashi Owada, has superior ability that was noted  early on in his career. He normally followed after Owada and  studied his foreign policy methods, as he was councilor for the  Treaties Bureau when Owada was director of that bureau and was  deputy vice minister for foreign affairs (in charge of political  affairs) when Owada was administrative vice minister for foreign  affairs.    However, Saito's foreign policy methods are a contrast to  Owada's. For example, Owada diligently looked over documents  himself and corrected them in ink in small letters. As opposed  to Owada who was not satisfied unless he participated in  everything himself, Saito is a rare type among recent senior  officials,who "" leaves the work to subordinates but takes the  responsibility upon himself.""    Naturally, Saito is popular among subordinates. In his days  as director of the Treaties Bureau, once Diet deliberations had  stopped as a result of his replies and when the evening came, he  left the office promptly. As might be expected, his subordiantes  were flustered at that. It is a fact that the sense of tension  in the ministry in the Owada era has dissolved with the  appointment of Saito, and the atmosphere has become animated.    There is obviously a lot of anxiety under a composite  administration, but he does not seem perturbed, saying ""The  continuation of foreign policy is included in the consensus of  the eight parties, and I am not worried at all. I am confident  that policy decisions will be made so as not to lose  opportunities.""    Following No. 1 Saito on the administrative side are the two  No. 2 deputy vice ministers for foreign affairs, Hiroshi Fukuda  (1959) and Koichiro Matsuura (1958). Fukuda is in charge of  political affairs, and Matsuura is in charge of economic  affairs. These two are called ""vice minister class.""    After serving as private secretary to Prime Minister  Yasuhiro  Nakasone (at the time) and director of the Treaties Bureau,  Fukuda served abroad as ambassador to Malaysia for about two  years and nine months.    The major jobs for the deputy vice minister for foreign  affairs in charge of political affairs are consulting with the  vice minister class of major countries and preparing discussions  on political issues at summits. His schedule is rather hard and  among senior councilors, for example, some are forced to retire  from overwork due to consecutive trips abroad.    Experience as a private secretary to the prime minister and  director of the Treaties Bureau is useful in the administrative  work of a deputy vice minister for foreign affairs, but  nevertheless, a hiatus of two years and nine months is big.  Therefore, he currently is receiving discourses on each topic  from administrative authorities. For the present, it seems that  preparations for the Japan visit by Russian President Yeltsin,  scheduled for the middle of October, will be the test case.    Matsuura scored further points by shepherding the success of  the Tokyo Summit in July. After enjoying hiking in the Northern  and Southern Alps on a brief summer vacation, he will undertake  U.S.-Japancomprehensive economic talks from September on. With  this as his final job, he will be transferred to an  ambassadorship in the European area at the end of 1993 or the  beginning of 1994.    The chief of protocol, Junichi Nakamura (1957), also will be  transferred to an ambassadorship after the Europe visit of the  emperor and empress in September. It has been informally decided  that his successor will be Makoto Watanabe (1958), director of  the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).    The private secretary to the minister of foreign affairs is  Yoichi Nishizawa, who is young, but enjoys confidence of Hata..  Lately, there is the trend in MOFA for the minister's secretary  for political affairs to become the private secretary to the  minister of foreign affairs.    Kaoru Ishikawa (1971) substantially serves as private  secretary in handling the private secretary administrative work  of the foreign minister. He was appointed from the position of  chief of the First West Europe Division, and there had been a  move for his appointment in the era of the previous Foreign  Minister Kabun Muto. However, just when he had begun making his  rounds of greetings, the former appointee was retained in his  post by the voice of authority of former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe. He was thoroughly prepared for his appearance this  time. He is a second-generation foreign service officer  following his father who served as ambassador to Kuwait. He  resembles his father in both spoken and written eloquence.    Another person who handles the private secretary  administrative work of the foreign minister is Kazuhiro Fujimura  (1982), a young foreign service hopeful with a promising future.    Next, let's look at the new major foreign affairs lineup  after the August personnel changes by bureau.    Minister's Secretariat    The director of the Secretariat is Sadayuki Hayashi (1959).  He had the strong trust of the previous vice minister, Owada,  and will be promoted to deputy vice minister for foreign affairs  in charge of economic affairs, the successor to Matsuura, at the  end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994. It is said to be ""a  parting present personnel change"" by Owada. Since he has a  sincere personality and is the type who carries out instructions  silently, he is highly rated by superiors.    Saito also cited ""Hayashi's remaining in his post for at  least a half year"" as a condition for accepting the vice  ministership.    The press secretary, who is the spokesman for MOFA, is  Kisuke  Terada (1961). He was appointed from the position of director of  the Central and South American Affairs Bureau, and because of  his experience as private secretary to Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita, chief of the Press Division, and councilor in charge  of the press and public relations, he has many acquaintances  among the press-related people at home and abroad. He is perhaps  the most suitable person for the position.    His ambition is modestly ""not to have misreadings by  press-related people,"" but he knows the vital points of the job.    Incidentally, Terada is an expert in Spanish. He even has  the ability to serve as an interpreter for heads of state  conferences. Moreover, he is also skillful respectively in  English, which every foreign service officer can speak, and in  French due to his wife's being French. The press secretary for  foreign affairs has a news conference with foreign special  correspondents in Tokyo twice a week in the news conference room  on the third floor of MOFA, and the birth of a press secretary  proficient in languages has been favorably received by foreign  reporters.    The general councilor in charge of the Diet is Atsushi  Hatanaka (1964). It seems that there is considerable confusion  on Diet measures because the LDP has become an opposition  party, a ""strong opposition party"" has appeared, the ruling  party is a coalition of eight parties, and the SDPJ, which had  been far from the government foreign affairs, security, and  defense policies up to now, has become a party in power.    The councilor in charge of the press and public relations is  Sadaaki Numata (1965). He is an expert in English and previously  served as an interpreter at U.S.-Japan summit conferences. Like  Terada, foreign special correspondents in Tokyo have come to  rely on him.    The chiefs of the major divisions in the Minister's  Secretariat are Rokuzen Nishimura (1966), chief of the General  Affairs Division; Shotaro Taniuchi (1968), chief of the  Personnel Division; and Ichiro Fujisaki (1968), chief of the  Financial Affairs Division.    Among them, Nishimura is a foreign service officer who  joined  MOFA from Sophia University and was appointed chief of the  General Affairs Division after serving as chief of the Press  Division and counselor for the Information Analysis, Research,  and Planning Bureau. At MOFA, the chief of the General Affairs  Division, Minister's Secretariat, is a ""pivotal"" post in charge  of coordination with the prime minister's official residence and  the various ministries and agencies. There will be many  instances when he is appointed to a bureau director position in  the future.    In his days as counselor for the Information Analysis,  Research, and Planning Bureau, Nishimura achieved results by  undertaking, without sleep or rest, the problem of fund  cooperation ($13 billion) for realizing peace and security in  the Gulf region. Japan went so far as to increase taxes to  implement the fund. He has become the personal adviser on  foreign affairs for the prime minister due to school ties with  Prime Minister Hosokawa.    It has been a characteristic of Nishimura that in  undertaking  foreign policy problems, he has tried to make a fresh approach  that is different from ordinary foreign service officers'  approaches.    Insofar as Taniuchi served as a private secretary in the  days  when Nobuo Matsunaga was administrative vice minister for  foreign affairs, he is an affable person and also does his work  well. Having passed the foreign service test in 1968, he  probably is a future candidate for vice minister, along with  Hitoshi Tanaka mentioned later (chief of the General Affairs  Division, General Foreign Policy Bureau).    Fujisaki is the son of Kazusato Fujisaki, former director of  the MOFA Treaties Bureau, who served as a supreme court justice.  There are many second-generation foreign service officers within  MOFA.    Chikahito Harada (1973), who became chief of the Press  Division in the August personnel changes, was a selection that  upset the expectations of many people. Previously, a senior  foreign service officer of the division chief class has been  appointed the chief of the Press Division. Since Harada, the  youngest of the division chiefs, was appointed, those within  MOFA were surprised.    Before returning as chief of the Status of U.S. Forces  Agreement Division of the North American Affairs Bureau at the  MOFA, Harada served as secretary in charge of public relations  at the Japanese Embassy in Russia and was popular among the  Japanese press corp in Moscow.    In his days as chief of the Status of U.S. Forces Agreement  Division, he sought understanding and cooperation in the  maintenance of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty while exchanging  drinks with the mayors of cities, towns, and villages embracing  U.S. military bases throughout Japan. He was familiar with ""the  scene,""a rare attribute for a foreign service officer. This  record of performance was seen in his appointment to chief of  the Press Division, which taxes one's nerves due to the  association with press-related people.    Harada's language of expertise is Russian. The Japan visit  of  President Yeltsin in October probably will be the first  opportunity to show his skill.    General Foreign Policy Bureau    The August structural reform was inaugurated with a flourish  of trumpets. MOFA has been a vertical administration with the  Asian Affairs Bureau, North American Affairs Bureau, and  European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau, but the reason this bureau  has been established is to deal with international situations  that are rife with fluidity, by developing horizontal,  comprehensive foreign policy.    Behind this is the reflection that vertical administration  was a disaster and a swift response was impossible at the time  of the 1990 Gulf war.    The first director of the bureau is Shunji Yanai (1960), who  served as the first director general of the International Peace  Cooperation Headquarters in the era of the previous Miyazawa  administration. This bureau created the draft of the foreign  policy portion of the general policy speech delivered by Prime  Minister Hosokawa in the special session of the Diet. This  bureau also was in charge of the policy of taking general  responsibility for World War II that has been advocated by  Foreign Minister Hata. Furthermore, this bureau has begun to  make the draft for Prime Minister Hosokawa's general discussion  speech at the ordinary general session of the United Nations.    Novel ideas, in addition to ample knowledge of internationl  law, are sought in the officers of the bureau, but the best  fitted was Yanai who served as director of the Treaties Bureau  and was concerned with the first full-scale UN peacekeeping  operation [PKO] for Japan.    Yanai looks back on his year as director general of the  International Peace Cooperation Headquarters as ""having  continuous application to everday problems."" His hobby is being  a Sunday carpenter and he apparently makes furniture.    Councilor Yoshikazu Nogami (1965) was known internationally  for his activities in the multinational conference on peace in  the Middle East during his previous job when he was councilor  for the Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau. He is viewed  as a talent most appropriately appointed to the General Foreign  Policy Bureau (at MOFA abbreviated and called Soseikyoku) where  new ideas are needed.    The major division chiefs are the aforementioned Hitoshi  Tanaka (1968), chief of the General Affairs Division; Yoichi  Otabe (1973), chief of the Planning Division; Sumio Tarui  (1970), chief of the Security Policy Division; and Mototake  Yoshikawa (1973), chief of the UN Policy Division.    Tanaka is ""an able man"" who served in the past as the senior  administrative official of the First North America Division and  chief of the Second North America Division. There is the feeling  that MOFA heads chose talented men such as Yanai, Nogami, and  Tanaka to produce results in this new bureau.    Asian Affairs Bureau    It was traditionally the most rightwing bureau before the  inauguration of the General Foreign Policy Bureau, but it has  yielded that position with the birth of the General Foreign  Policy Bureau.    The bureau director is Tadashi Ikeda (1961), an expert on  China. Since the time of his appointment, it has been said that  he was appointed so that the historical visit to China by the  emperor and empress could end successfully. The China visit of  both their majesties ended without incident as expected and his  popularity within MOFA quickly rose. Some call for him to be the  next director of the Secretariat disregarding Yukio Sato,  director of the North American Affairs Bureau, who is highly  recommended by some to be the next director of the Secretariat.    During his days as a minister in Thailand, he had contacts  with officers of the Pol Pot faction in the jungle near the  Cambodian border. He has increased his fans in MOFA by his  sincere courtesy without the unapproachableness that is apt to  exist in foreign service officers.    The councilor is Yukio Takeuchi (1966) who served as private  secretary to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa (at the time). The  counselor is Akimoto Takano (1966) who served in the handling  of the private secretary administrative work for Foreign  Minister Shintaro Abe (at the time, now deceased).    The division chiefs are Seiji Kojima (1971), chief of the  Regional Policy Division; Shigeru Nakamura (1972), chief of the  Northeast Asia Division; Yoshio Nomoto (1971), chief of the  China Division; Tadamichi Yamamoto (1973), chief of the First  Southeast Asia Division; Keiichi Hayashi (1973), chief of the  Second Southeast Asia Division; and Yasuaki Tanizaki (1974),  chief of the Southwest Asia Division.    Among these, Nomoto was appointed from his position as chief  of the General Affairs Department (Taipei) of the Exchange  Association with Taiwan. In the previous MOFA personnel changes,  it would not have been considered because of concern for China,  and it can be called a sign that Japan's foreign policy on China  has changed from ""outward formality"" to ""inward feelings.""    Yamamoto's outstanding English capability and superior  diplomatic abilities that were demonstrated in the series of  Cambodian problems have received a high rating inside and  outside MOFA.    North American Affairs Bureau    The bureau director is Yukio Sato (1960), the ablest man in  MOFA. The prospects are that he will be promoted to director of  the Secretariat at the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994.    At MOFA, the Economic Affairs Bureau stands at the front  line  in the economic area of U.S.-Japan relations, but Sato directed  talk preparations for the opening of the first talks between the  U.S. and Japanese heads of state for the Hosokawa administration  in New York in the latter part of September.    The councilor is Ryozo Kato (1964), and the chiefs of the  major divisions are Toshiaki Ozawa (1972), chief of the First  North America Division, and Shinichi Nishimiya (1975), chief of  the Second North America Division. Kato is a future candidate  for vice minister.    Central and South American Affairs Bureau    The bureau director is Kiyohiko Arafune (1961), who was  called back from his position as ambassador to Nicaragua to  replace Terada, who became press secretary. He has had a broad  range of work and friendly relationships, being temporarily  transferred to the Finance Ministry and serving as head of the  Nagoya Customshouse, and it seems to have become a plus in his  career as a foreign service officer afterward.    The counselor is Shinya Nagai (1967), and the chiefs of the  major divisions are Akira Miwa (1974), chief of the First  Central and South America Division which covers South America,  and Masuo Nishibayashi (1974), chief of the Second Central and  South America Division which is in charge of Central America and  part of South America.    European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau    The bureau director is Issei Nomura (1962), an expert on  Russia. It seems his ability will be evaluated by whether or  not he will be able to make the official visit to Japan by  Russian President Yeltsin in the middle of October the first  step in the resolution of the pending northern territories  problem.    The councilor is Shigeru Tsumori (1964), and a major  division  chief is Tsuneo Nishida (1969) who transferred to the Russian  Division from chief of the Press Division. Nishida is an expert  in English and it is unusual to appoint a chief of the Russian  Division who does not speak Russian. There is a strong view that  it is an expression of MOFA's desire to handle foreign policy on  Russia using a new concept.    Yasuo Saito (1970), who handled private secretary  administrative work for the previous foreign minister, is the  chief of the First West Europe Division which is in charge of  France and Germany, etc., and Akitaka Saiki (1975) is the chief  of the Second West Europe Division which is in charge of Great  Britain, etc. Saiki is known as a ""forceful foreign service  officer.""    Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau    The bureau director is Takaya Sudo (1961), an Arabist.  Although he was appointed after serving as councilor for science  and technology, he should be quite satisfied with the  appointment as an expert. For the time being, the big job will  be preparations for the ""Africa Development Conference"" to be  held under the sponsorship of the Japanese Government in Tokyo  in October.    The counselor is Toshinori Shigeie (1968) who returned to  the  home ministry after serving as a minister to the United  Nations. The chiefs of the divisions are Hideo Tanaka (1970),  chief of the First Middle East Division which has jurisdiction  over Egypt and Israel, etc.; Toshihiro Okuda (1974), chief of  the Second Middle East Division which is in charge of the Gulf  nations such as Saudi Arabia; Kensuke Tsuzuki (1974), chief of  the First Africa Division; and Hisao Yamaguchi (1974), chief of  the Second Africa Division.    Shigeie, who has had experience as chief of the Security  Division, North American Affairs Bureau, etc., is greatly  trusted by high-ranking officials, but it seems that his actions  will be the key to deciding the value of the bureau.    Economic Affairs Bureau    The bureau director, Kazuo Ogura (1961), along with  classmate  Minoru Tanba (director of the Treaties Bureau), is an elite  foreign service officer. of whom it was said from early on,  ""Ogura or Tanba will become administrative vice minister for  foreign affairs."" He has both written and spoken eloquence and  the articles that he contributes once in a while to the  ""Foreign Affairs Forum,"" the public relations magazine of MOFA,  almost always are popular inside and outside the ministry.    The councilors who assist Ogura are Kazuo Asaumi (1961) and  Nobuyasu Abe (1966). Asaumi is the son of former Ambassador to  the U.S. Koichiro Asaumi, and formerly served as interpreter for  U.S.-Japan heads-of-state talks. Abe worked hard and rendered  distinguished service behind the scenes in the economic area for  the success of the Tokyo summit in July.    The general affairs counselor, who also can be called the  director of the Secretariat for the Economic Affairs Bureau, is  Yoshiki Mine (1967). The chiefs of the divisions are Kojiro  Shiojiri (1972), chief of the First International Economic  Affairs Division which is in charge of trade with the European  Community (EC) and economic integration, and Koro Bessho (1974),  chief of the Second International Economic Affairs Division in  charge of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). The  other division chiefs are a galaxy of able men.    Japan took the lead role at the Tokyo summit, and it was  agreed to conclude successfully the Uruguay Round (new  multilateral trade negotiations) within the year, but it will be  a test case of the Economic Affairs Bureau whether or not this  can be realized.    Economic Cooperation Bureau    Hiroshi Hirabayashi (1962) was appointed bureau director  after serving as a minister to the United States in the August  personnel changes. He immediately displayed his skill in the  Cambodian postwar reconstruction problem, etc. In his days as  minister to the United States, he appeared on U.S. television,  etc., and as a result of his blunt speeches that were  disagreeable to U.S. ears, it seems that he was kept at a  distance. When he believes it to be true, he speaks out  without reserve. From the standpoint of a friend, there is no  person with such dependable fighting power.    The councilor is Shohei Naito (1965). During the Gulf war,  Japanese in Kuwait became hostages of Iraq and he worked hard  without sleep or rest for their release. The counselor is  Hideaki Ueda (1966). Originally, he was in Russian service, and  economic cooperation has been a different field, but he has been  cheerfully carrying out his work, including trips to Central  Asia, ever since his appointment.    For the chiefs of the major divisions, Nobuichi Kitajima  (1970) is the chief of the Planning Division, which can be  called the secretariat of the Economic Cooperation Bureau. He is  one of the few foreign service officers in MOFA who came from  Keio University, but he has melded into the ministry so well  that officers in the ministry who do not know from what  university he came are surprised and say, ""Did he come from Keio  University?"" In the days of his former job as chief of the First  International Organizations Division of the Economic Affairs  Bureau, he worked hard on arrangements for the Uruguay Round and  was deeply trusted by Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe (at the  time).    The chief of the Technical Cooperation Division is Mitsuo  Sakaba (1972). Due to joining the ministry from Yokohama City  University, it seems that human relations were difficult for him  at first. However, he is deeply trusted by his subordinates for  his quiet and refined style of work. In addition, Shigekazu Sato  (1973) is chief of the Loan Aid Division and Masahito Kodera  (1975) is chief of the Grant Aid Division. On the occasion of  the visit to China by the emperor and empress, Kodera  contributed to its success by working devotedly behind the  scenes as senior administrative officer of the China Division in  the Asian Affairs Bureau.    Treaties Bureau    The bureau director is Minoru Tanba (1961). The director of  the Treaties Bureau has important jobs such as responding in the  Budget Committees of both the House of Councilors and the House  of Representatives and attending conferences with Russia, with  whom a peace treaty has not been concluded.    Tanba is extremely popular with the LDP opposition party and  therefore it looks like that he need not to worry about being  bullied by ""the strongest opposition party in history.""    He is an expert on Russia and previously has been known as a  hardliner on Russian policy, but recently, he has a touch of  consideration for the U.S. and European position of support for  Yeltsin and much more flexible.    The councilor is Hiroharu Koike (1965), who is working at  the home ministry for the first time in a long time, after  serving as a minister of the Japanese Government mission at the  United Nations.    The lineup of division chiefs are Ichiro Komatsu (1971),  chief of the Treaties Division; Kenjiro Moji (1974), chief of  the International Conventions Division; and Tetsuo Ito (1972),  chief of the Legal Affairs Division.    International Information Bureau    The bureau director is Haruhiko Shibuya (1962). He slid over  horizontally from the position of director of the United Nations  Bureau, which was abolished along with the inauguration of the  General Foreign Policy Bureau.    Previously, as councilor of the Asian Affairs Bureau at the  time when the crew of the Fujiyama Maru No. 18 was released by  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), he  traveled together with Ichiro Ozawa (currently acting secretary  general of the Shinseito) to take charge of the crewmembers in  Pyongyang. When the special plane landed at Haneda, the  television [broadcast] that was relayed showed Shibuya who was  mistaken for a released crewmember.    He has many fans at MOFA with his polite manner and honest  personality that are not common in a foreign service officer.    The councilor is Kiyohiko Nanao (1965). It previously seemed  that his specialty field was economic foreign policy, but since  serving as a minister to South Korea, he also has become strong  in the political field.    The division chiefs are Makoto Mizutani (1970), chief of the  International Information Division; Akio Suda (1970), chief of  the First Analysis Division; and Hiroyuki Kishino (1974), chief  of the Second Analysis Division.    Other    The chief of the Cultural Affairs Department is Takayuki  Kimura (1961). The weight occupied by cultural exchange in  Japanese foreign affairs has been increasing year by year, but  actual results steadily have been produced in diverse fields  such as Japanese language education abroad, cooperation for  Japanese research, introduction of Japanese culture abroad, and  cooperation in the preservation of cultural heritage.    Assisting Kimura and substantially working on cultural  foreign policy are the three, Councilor Takashi Nakamoto (1965),  Osamu Shiozaki (1972), chief of the First Cultural Affairs  Division, and Nobutaka Shinomiya (1973), chief of the Second  Cultural Affairs Division.    Nakamoto has served as private secretary to director of the  Secretariat, Takao Fujinami (at the time) and is one of the  hopeful leading foreign service officers with expectations for  the future.    Appreciation for the existence of the Consular and  Emigration  Affairs Department is increasing more and more along with  Japanese living and traveling abroad. There also should be some  people among the general public who have been assisted by the  department once or twice.    Chief of the department is Yoshihisa Ara (1961) and the  counselor is Norio Hattori (1967). Previously at the time when  there were many hijacking incidents by the Japanese Red Army,  the counselor of the Consular and Emigration Affairs Department  was appointed under careful instruction beforehand about the  possibility of being exchanged for hostages.    Speaking of that, Ryohei Murata, the current ambassador to  Germany, had experience in that post. He remembers the episode  on the occasion of the Kuala Lumpur incident when he was  exchanged for hostages and passed the time by solving crossword  puzzles in the aircraft together with the enemy, the Japanese  Red Army.    In the same department is the Foreign Nationals Affairs  Division whose workload has expanded in both quality and  quantity with the rapid increase of foreigners coming into Japan  recently. The experts from Division Chief Akio Egawa (1974) and  on down are tackling the surge of visa applications.    An organization that is substantially the same as a  department is the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs Councilor  Organization. The head is Akira Hayashi (1963), and the  counselor is Yoshitaka Kawamura (1967) who was transferred from  the Asian Affairs Bureau.    There are two divisions and two offices in the organization.  The chief of the Arms Control and Disarmament Division is  Takeshi Nakane (1973), and the chief of the Scientific Affairs  and Nuclear Energy Division is Yukihisa Amano (1971). Waiting  for Nakane is the issue of creating the draft for the nuclear  test ban treaty, etc.    Chief of the International Social Cooperation Department is  Kojiro Takano (1963). In his days as chief of the General  Affairs Division of the Japan International Cooperation Agency  (JICA), he directly faced the incident of the murder of a JICA  expert by antigovernment guerrillas in Peru, and his memories of  skillfully dealing with the difficult problem are fresh.    In his new post, he handles highly contemporary problems  such  as UN administration and finance, human rights, refugees, drugs,  and wildlife protection. It probably should be viewed as facing  a chance to make further strides.    The counselor is Itaru Umezu (1967), who has had experience  as the consul in New York. For division chiefs, Yuji Kumamaru  (1974) is chief of the United Nations Administration Division  and originally was an expert on China. Chief of the Human Rights  and Refugee Division is Toshio Kunikata (1975), and chief of the  Global Scale Problems Division is Toshiki Kanamori. Kanamori is  a temporary transfer from the Finance Ministry. His proficient  language capability gives him the advantage.    In addition, the councilor in charge of inspection is Takao  Kawakami (1960). He is the former director of the Economic  Cooperation Bureau, but the opinion is strong that he will be  appointed chief of the Cabinet Foreign Policy Councilors'  Office some day.    The ambassador in charge of international trade is Nobutoshi  Akao (1960). He bears the heavy responsibility for reaching an  agreement within the year in the Uruguay Round.    The ambassador in charge of negotiations on normalizing  relations between Japan and North Korea is Tetsuya Endo (1957).  He is a classmate of Vice Minister Saito and also is in charge  of Asian Pacific cooperation. Japan-North Korea negotiations  never have been held since Endo became in charge of them,  and it is not certain whether or not he will be able to put a  period to the last postwar disposition of Japan. In so far as  North Korea has been awkward as a negotiation partner, it seems  that he has faced his crucial moment as a foreign service  officer.    As director of the Foreign Service Training Institute,  Shintaro Yamashita (1957) is in charge of training young foreign  service officers. As general guidance officer, Yuji Miyamoto  (1968) helps Yamashita.    Among the foreign service officers temporarily transferred  to  other ministries or agencies, Sakutaro Tanino (1959) is the  chief of the Cabinet Councilors' Office on External Affairs. He  is an expert on China, has obtained overwhelming support from  the China school within the ministry, and many have anticipated  that he will be appointed deputy vice minister for foreign  affairs after Saito is promoted to vice minister.    Hisami Kurokochi (1957), who is known as the oldest forceful  foreign officer, serves as the chief of the House of  Representatives Committee on the Foreign Affairs Research Office.    The second secretary general of the International Peace  Cooperation Headquarters is Katsunari Suzuki (1961), the  previous director of the Information Analysis, Research, and  Planning Bureau. He immediately made an inspection tour of the  scene in Cambodia. Yoshiyuki Sadaoka (1973) is the counselor for  the International Peace Cooperation Headquarters and supports  Suzuki.    In addition, Kazuyuki Hiraoka (1953) is the director of the  state guest house, Kiyoshi Kadotani (1948) is the lord  chamberlain of the household, Azusa Hayashi (1968) is chief of  Police Headquarters, Iwate Prefecture, and Masaji Takahashi  (1960) is director of the Immigration Bureau, Ministry of  Justice.    The president of JICA is Kensuke Yanagiya (1948). He is  famous for taking a part in the nuptials of the Crown Prince and  Masako. JICA director Makoto Watanabe (1958) soon will return to  the home ministry and is scheduled to be appointed the post of  Chief of Protocol.    Also from MOFA are Shinichiro Asao (1950), director of the  Japan Foundation, and Toshijiro Nakashima (1948), Supreme Court  justice.    Overseas Establishments    Finally, let's mention the major ambassadors among the  foreign service officers who are serving in overseas  establishments.    In the Asia Pacific region, Toshio Goto (1953) is in South  Korea, and Michihiko Kunihiro (1954) is in China. Goto has been  a consul in South Korea in the past, has served as director of  the Asian Affairs Bureau, and is most suitable as ambassador to  South Korea.    Kimio Fujita in Indonesia and Hiroaki Fujii in Thailand both  passed the foreign service officer exam in 1955, and are fellow  rivals. Along with Koji Watanabe, ambassador to Italy in the  same 1955 group, they are called the triumvirate of vice  minister candidates. In Australia Kazutoshi Hasegawa (1956) who  served as private secretary to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone  (at the time).    In the North American region, Takakazu Kuriyama (1953) is in  the United States. It was rumored that Hisashi Owada, previous  administrative vice minister for foreign affairs, would be  appointed ambassador to the United States and it seems that  Kuriyama has difficulty doing the job, but he will continue  until at least the end of 1994. Noboru Nakahira (1953) is in  Canada. In his previous appointment, he served as ambassador in  charge of Japan-North Korea negotiations.    Turning an eye to the European region, Sumio Edamura (1951)  is in Russia. He will retire after the visit to Japan by  President Yeltsin in October and Koji Watanabe will take his  place. Hiroshi Kitamura (1952) is in Great Britain, Atsuhiko  Yatabe (1951) is in France, and Ryohei Murata (1951) is in  Germany.    In the Middle East and African region, Taizo Watanabe (1956)  is in Egypt, Hiroshi Ota (1959) is in Saudi Arabia, and Takeshi  Ohara (1960) is in Iran.    In charge of international agencies, Yoshio Hatano (1952) is  at the United Nations, Yoshitomo Tanaka (1955) is at the  Disarmament Conference, and Yoshiyasu Sato (1957) is at the  Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. Sato is  from Hitotsubashi University. He is strongly trusted by his  schoolmate, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, and if  Foreign Minister Watanabe had continued on, it is said that he  would have been appointed vice minister instead of Saito.    Among these ambassadors, Kitamura and Hatano are scheduled  to  be replaced in the near future, and the personnel changes for  successors probably will be a topic of conversation.     "

In a statement given to CTK today the Ministry expressed  surprise that the Hungarian foreign minister has assumed the  right of arbitration in assessing whether the Slovak Republic is  fulfilling its multilateral obligations. Jeszenszky again  described Slovakia's attitude towards the Hungarian minority as  the only problem in Slovak-Hungarian relations and stressed that  the problem of borders between the two countries did not exist  and that there was thus no need to deal with it.    Slovakia is interested in concluding a basic interstate  treaty with Hungary and it reiterates its readiness to provide  guarantees that Hungarian minority rights will be observed in  Slovakia in the spirit of international norms. However at the  same time Slovakia demands that a clause on inviolability of  borders be included in the treaty, the statement says.    Jeszenszky's statements do not serve to create mutual trust  and they could lead to the strengthening of the positions of  extremists on both sides, which could endanger the atmosphere  for solving other open questions between the two countries, the  statement says.

Among topics are prevention of air and water pollution,  disposal of harmful waste and preservation of Siberian forests  to help prevent global warming, the officials said.    The talks are aimed at working out concrete projects for  bilateral cooperation, they said.    In Russia's Far East region, about 800,000 hectares of trees  are cut down annually, posing a threat to forests which are said  to keep global warming in check.    Also part of the frozen soil in Siberia has melted recently  to release methane gas, a substance said to promote global  warming.    Japan has carried out a joint survey since 1992 to measure  the density of methane in the air above Siberia.    The Japanese team at the talks will consist of officials of  the Foreign Ministry, the International Trade and Industry  Ministry and the Environment Agency. The Russian delegation  will be from the Environmental Protection and Natural Resources  Ministry.    The meeting will be the first on cooperation on the  environment since Japan and the former Soviet Union signed an  agreement on such deals when then Soviet President Mikhail  Gorbachev visited Japan in April 1991, they said.

Membership would  include Finland in the EU's economic and social policy decisions  and would also have an effect on security policy issues.    ""From a standpoint of military security, this change would  not appear to significantly affect Russia's position as  Finland's neighbor, nor does it effect Finland's position as  Russia's neighbor,"" said Klenberg, in a speech, last Monday [14  February] in Tampere.    According to Klenberg, a possible peace partnership with  NATO, NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], or serving as  an observer within the WEU [Western European Union], should not  change Finland's security situation. On the other hand, if  Finland chose to join NATO or the WEU, that would drastically  change Finland's military security status.    Klenberg feels that it is uncertain whether the CFE  [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe] agreement, concerning  limiting conventional weapons in Europe, will become effective  in the areas surrounding Finland.    In Klenberg's view, the CFE agreement has reached ""an  interesting stage.""

On the brink of his visit to Tehran, Qian who doubles as the  Chinese foreign minister, said that Iran and China maintain  historical relations and have cordial cooperation. Economic and  commercial relations between the two countries have considerably  expanded over the past few years, he added.

This invitation was made by Iranian Foreign Ministry Under  Secretary Mohammad Javad Zarif, who did not rule out that this  committee could become a nucleus for a security alliance  grouping all states situated on the Gulf. Well-informed sources  have said that the Iranian invitation is addressed for the time  being to the six GCC member states but could include Iraq later,  specifically after its present problems are settled.    The Iranian official said that such a committee would enable  the region's states to discuss all their problems and analyze  the threats to their joint security.    Diplomats believe that the Iranian proposal is aimed at  splitting the ""Damascus Declaration,"" which includes the GCC  states, Egypt, and Syria.    Iran proposed the idea in the past but the proposal  collapsed  because of the Iranian-Iraqi dispute.    Observers believe that this proposal may face the same fate  as a result of the disputes between Iran and a number of states  in the region, especially the United Arab Emirates, which claims  sovereignty over three islands currently occupied by Iran.

While Iraqi managers multiply visits to Paris, an official  employers' delegation is planning to travel discreetly to  Baghdad on 24 or 25 June, from Jordan, where the CNPF [National  Confederation of French Employers] delegation will also be  staying at the same time.    After Israel, Iraq. Last month, a CNPF delegation, led by  its chairman Francois Perigot, made an official visit to Tel  Aviv, ending years of ostracism of the Jewish state. Now it is  Iraq's turn to welcome France's employers.    No doubt this will be a very discreet, almost clandestine  visit. The 20 or so companies on the trip (including, according  to our information, Citroen, Renault, Alcatel, EDF [French  Electricity Company], Schneider, Babcock, and others) have  planned to make only a detour to Iraq, under the pretext of an  official visit to Jordan on 24 and 25 June. But this is one of  those visits whose symbolic importance outweighs its brevity.  Any one can be sure that the Baghdad regime will take  advantage, if only toward its public opinion, of the discussions  which the French delegation will have with Iraqi leaders (no  doubt with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz, or even with  Saddam Husayn, who doubles as head of state and head of  government).    It is true that Baghdad is in an unpleasant position. On 18  July, the UN Security Council will examine, as it does every two  months, whether it is appropriate to maintain or lift the  embargo against Iraq decreed in 1990, immediately after the  invasion of Kuwait. Barring last minute surprises, everything  leads us to believe that once again, the ""most hideous crime of  history"" (as the Iraqi press describes the embargo) will be left  untouched, and that, from August onward, Baghdad will have to  undergo a fifth year of embargo.    This status quo is due to Washington's intransigence. For  Washington and its British ally, Saddam Husayn's regime has  still not conformed to the many UN resolutions and ""sanctions  must remain in place,"" at least until the end of the year.    France would like to be more accommodating, in the name of  ""progress"" made by Iraq on the path of disarmament. In the name  also of commercial interests. With Iraq, these were previously  substantial. In 1982, in the midst of the Iran-Iraq conflict,  Baghdad absorbed more than 7 percent of France's non-OECD  exports, making Paris Iraq's third largest supplier of  non-military goods.    Oil Contracts    It is the threads of this privileged relationship which the  French groups are discreetly trying to retie, pending the  eventual lifting of the embargo. Thus, several French companies  are negotiating agreement protocols with Baghdad for the repair  of equipment previously sold by France. This is already the  case in the water treatment area, and will no doubt be so soon  in the telephone sector. A delegation of senior officials from  the Iraqi Transport and Communications Ministry is currently  negotiating with Alcatel [French telecommunications concern].  ""Between Frenchmen and Iraqis, the welcoming back has been  warm,"" we are assured by a businessman who frequently shuttles  between Paris and Baghdad.    All these deals which are being arranged have a strong smell  of oil about them. Heavily in debt and lacking foreign  currency, Baghdad is relying on its crude oil resources (10  percent of world reserves) to finance the reconstruction of the  country. In this area, too, French companies are in the lead  (footnote 1) (Dr. Fadel A. Othman [name as published], the  director general of SOMO, the company in charge of selling Iraqi  crude, will be in Paris on 27 June to take part in a symposium.)  For more than two years, ELF has been negotiating for the  exploitation of the giant Majnoun oil field in the south of  Iraq. Total is similarly negotiating for the Nahr-Umr field,  also in the south of the country, while Italy's AGIP is well  placed to obtain the operator slot for Halfaya, a third ""giant""  field. (Footnote 2) (Exploitation of a fourth giant field, that  of West Kurnah, is said to have been entrusted to the Russians,  who already began exploiting it several years ago with the help  of the French engineering company Technip.) On each of these  fields, whose exploitation will require billions of dollars, the  French and Italian companies will not remain alone. If  negotiations are successful, they will have to integrate their  participation and, with Baghdad's blessing, bring in foreign --  probably American and British -- partners.    But will ELF and Total, who maintain difficult relationships  in Iraq, end up carrying off the deal after years of laborious  discussions? Will Baghdad not finally prefer foreign  competitors? ""Negotiations are well advanced. The items still  open no longer constitute an obstacle,"" one of the negotiators  affirmed. ""The decision whether or not to sign the contracts  lies now with Baghdad.""     "

Before the signing ceremony, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing  met with representatives of the five overseas firms: the Italian  Agip, the French Elf, the Japanese Energy Corporation, the  Japanese Petroleum Exploration Company and Texaco of the U.S.A.    The contract is the second one on petroleum prospecting and  exploration in the Tarim Basin. It is also the second one in  China's world-wide public tendering for cooperation in  exploiting China's land oil.    Under the new contract, the foreign firms will for the next  eight years shoulder all the expenses and risks in prospecting;  when oil and gas fields are found, the two sides will jointly  invest in exploration and production, and share the crude oil in  proportions laid down by the contract.    It is learned that since March 1 last year, when the China  National Petroleum Corporation opened the first round of public  tendering for the project, 68 corporations from 17 countries had  applied for the tendering documents and 54 of them had sent  representatives to Beijing to study relevant materials.

He said: It is  natural that we seriously assess any negative development that  might emerge in this field in all its aspects. Turkey has  always opposed the linking of U.S. aid -- which is supplied as a  requisite of mutual defense and cooperation within the framework  of the Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement -- to outside  factors. Turkey, which has been faced with terrorism for years,  does not deem it appropriate to link aid to certain conditions  for unrealistic reasons and pretexts.    Ataman stressed: The suspension of 25 percent of the  security aid by the House of Representatives as a result of  allegations of human rights violations is an issue that must be  assessed within this framework.    Ataman concluded by saying: We hope that a more responsible  attitude will be adopted to eliminate this injustice in the  future stages of the foreign aid bill as it goes through the  U.S. Congress.

It is a war that has largely been overshadowed by Kurdish campaigns in  neighboring Turkey and in Iraq itself.

His successor, Sa'eed Badal, said Qassemlou went to Vienna in response to an  offer from Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani to negotiate an end to the  Kurdish rebellion.    Badal said he believes Qassemlou was killed by agents of radical Iranian  factions in an attempt to torpedo Rafsanjani's efforts to end the mountain war,  a move that would have strengthened his credibility as a pragmatist.    Badal said the KDP has turned down an Iranian proposal to resume negotiations  because ""we no longer trust them.""    The guerrillas, known as Peshmergas, or ""those who face death,"" say hundreds of  young Iranian Kurds have joined them in recent months.    Kurdish chieftains decline to divulge their strength but claim that they are  pinning down some 200,000 Iranians. Diplomatic sources in Baghdad estimated  that as many as 2,500 KDP guerrillas are in Iraq, with thousands more operating  inside Iran.    ""Everybody in my village said the Peshmergas are working for a better future  for the Kurdish nation, so I decided to join them,"" said Farouk Hassan Pour,  14, who trekked across the mountains for seven days until the guerrillas found  him.    About 200 youngsters are undergoing guerrilla training in this camp high in the  northern Iraqi mountains overlooking the Iranian border.    In the camp are about 1,000 guerrillas, dressed in their distinctive baggy  trousers and turbans. Several thousand Kurdish women and children live in  villages in the surrounding valleys.    The KDP runs the camp, but the area is under Iraqi military control. The  guerrillas are not allowed to leave without Iraqi permission.    The Kurds grow their own vegetables and tend their cattle in the lush uplands.  The Iraqis provide flour, rice and fuel oil.    A rehabilitation center has been set up in the camp for guerrillas who have  lost limbs. Among the 30 undergoing therapy is Ismail Muradi, 23, who lost an  arm in a recent raid.    ""I don't care if I have to live in this camp, deprived of the good things of  life, for 50 years, so long as the next generation of Kurds can live as free  human beings,"" said Muradi, who joined the guerrillas last year.

Perhaps this was justified by certain  circumstances and by bilateral relations that did not require  constant contact in order to be developed. Moreover, the  political situation in Iraq at that time allowed it to achieve  successes at the UN because of the Iranian rejection of any  peaceful settlement to the Iraqi-Iranian conflict. This is in  addition to the fact that most other countries understood Iraq's  stand, except for major and Western countries, which had selfish  interests and sought to prolong the conflict on the ground,  taking advantage of the United Nations as a political forum that  provided them with an opportunity to avoid a peaceful solution.  This is similar to the present situation, but with a different  form and method aimed at keeping Iraq in its current situation  for the longest time possible so that these countries can meet  their agenda in the region. This was clear in their alternating  support for Iraq and for Iran.    It is also obvious that the means available to Iraq at the  time were no longer available after 2 August 1990 and the  subsequent barbaric aggression against Iraq. On the contrary,  the United Nations became a field for political confrontation  against Iraq, through the use of all its institutions, as a main  tool to break the will of and destroy Iraq. This restricted the  role of Iraq in terms of influencing these institutions and the  UN member states because of U.S., Western, and Zionist hegemony.  This fact led to the conclusion that all of Iraq's efforts at  the international organization's level would not achieve their  objectives even though Iraq mobilized all legal, political, and  factual arguments to support their case.    In light of this situation, I believe that Iraq should no  longer deem it enough to work with the United Nations alone --  although this is something that has been imposed on Iraq and  Iraq has been given no other choice. In order to support and  render its work a success, Iraq should intensify its bilateral  contacts, not only with UN member states, but also with all  countries of influence within their particular geographical  groups, based on a plan created by the Foreign Ministry. If  this is achieved and we are able to realize tangible progress in  those relations that were greatly harmed, then our stand in the  United Nations will improve and our proposals and views will  have an effect on friends and just nations. This is especially  true if we take into consideration that the current  international situation has changed and that there has been an  emergence of many countries that could express their viewpoint  in a manner different than that during the Kuwait crisis.    I note, regrettably, that we have ignored our continuing  ties  with our friends. Our moves were confined to certain periods of  time, after which we forgot about such moves until major events  on the level of our relation with the United Nations occurred.  Even if we made a move toward one of these nations, such a move  basically ended up in New York because we did not have many  ambassadors in many important countries that could have  influence on a case such as ours.    Based on my study of the developments in countries' stands  toward us, I find it appropriate that the Foreign Ministry's  action plan should cover many fronts:    Within the framework of inter-Arab relations, it is  necessary  to continue our contacts with the countries whose stands toward  us continue to be relatively positive.    As for the Gulf countries, it has become clear to every  observer that there has been a change in their stands toward  Iraq. Some are even publicly announcing their stands and their  sympathy with us without any fear from the media. These  developments should be an incentive for us to intensify and  broaden our contacts with these countries.    We also find that stands on the international level are  tangibly improving. Even though it did not make a declared  stand exactly as we wanted, Britain is no longer raising the  banner against Iraq as it did before. Mr. Tariq 'Aziz's meeting  with the British ambassador at the Security Council may not be  considered a bad step. What applies to Britain also applies on  other European countries, including France, Italy, Spain, and  former socialist states, led by Russia. If we are able to reach  out to these countries and talk to them in the language of  interests that they understand, then I am confident that we can  reach good results.    It is important not to restrict our moves toward certain  countries. There are countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin  America that have influence in the international arena and at  the same time have economic interests and problems that Iraq can  help solve.     "

By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Oil prices reached their highest levels in five years Monday and gasoline  prices continued to spurt upward as uncertainty in the wake of the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait fueled fears of shortages.    Prices could go as high as $40 or $50 per barrel if a worldwide embargo  succeeds in eliminating Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil from world supplies, analysts  added.

It brought the price of the crude grade to near its all-time high of $30.15,  reached in 1984 during the Iran-Iraq war.    ""Prices are moving further and faster than any of us have given them credit,""  said Peter Beutel, a trader with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York.    At the gasoline pump, the average cost of self-serve unleaded gasoline jumped  7.1 cents per gallon over the weekend, the American Automobile Assn. said  Monday. In California, some areas reported price increases of 12 to 15 cents  per gallon, the association said.    The increases were the fastest since those in the two-week period following the  March, 1989, oil spill in Alaska, when prices rose nearly 12 cents a gallon,  the association said.    The AAA's Fuel Gauge Report, which is based on a spot check of 1,400 service  stations around the nation, showed self-serve unleaded gasoline averaging  $1.186 per gallon nationally, up from $1.115 on Friday and $1.075 on Wednesday.    The price hikes were driven largely by fear and market psychology, as well as  by demand to beef up oil inventories, even though current stocks of oil remain  ample, analysts said.    Prices could go even higher if real shortages develop as feared. Experts say  prices easily could peak at $40 to $50 a barrel before demand would fall  sharply. An increase of oil prices to $40 per barrel could boost the price of  gasoline by 25 to 60 cents per gallon.

Shortages could develop under the move by virtually all major consuming nations  -- and a vote Monday by the U.N. Security Council -- to bar imports of Iraqi  oil. If strictly enforced, a worldwide embargo would eliminate from world  supplies Iraq and Kuwait's combined oil production of 4 million to 5 million  barrels per day.    That likely would push up prices to $30 per barrel in the next two or three  weeks, barring some action to counteract the shortfall. Gasoline prices could  be expected to follow, increasing by 2 to 5 cents per gallon for every $1 per  barrel increase in crude.    Such an embargo would likely require a military blockade of Iraqi ports and  pipelines that cross Turkey and Saudi Arabia.    The embargo is already having an effect: Iraq shut down one of its twin oil  pipelines running through Turkey to the Mediterranean on Monday, and curtailed  flow through the other, in the face of dwindling demand for its oil.    Price shocks would be dampened if other oil producing countries take up the  slack. But the Middle East Economic Survey, a weekly newsletter, reported that  current excess capacity by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  Countries amounted to only 3.5 million barrels of oil a day.

By SHIREEN T. HUNTER, Shireen T. Hunter is a deputy director of the Middle East  program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.      The West is once more in danger of misreading the nature of Iraq's president,  Saddam Hussein, and his ambitions for his country. Unless there is a  clear-sighted view of his intentions and an effective response to them, Western  interests in the Persian Gulf will be in deep jeopardy.    The record of Western misapprehension about Hussein's regime is extensive,  going back to 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran. Ignoring a raft of evidence,  Western analysts and policy-makers attributed Iraqi aggression to fear of Iran  and its revolution, rather than to Iraq's ambitions to become the dominant  power in the Persian Gulf and the Arab world.    These analysts made their next serious mistake by interpreting Hussein's  downshifts in rhetoric, necessitated by war needs, as indicating deep and  long-lasting ideological and institutional transformation of Iraqi politics and  society. This misreading led to Western expectations about Iraqi behavior that  could only be characterized as wishful thinking. For example, it was generally  expected that Iraq would liberalize its political system and play a positive  role in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Perhaps it would even join Egypt  and Jordan in an Arab coalition willing to make peace with Israel. The pay-off:  total Western support for Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.    Because of this sort of analysis, the West -- the United States and Europe --  helped Iraq economically and militarily far beyond what was necessary to  contain Iran. Simultaneously, by weakening Iran more than was necessary to keep  it from dominating the Persian Gulf, the West helped to create a disequilibrium  in the regional balance, which Saddam Hussein has exploited ever since.    After the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, and despite the obvious shift in the  regional military balance, the West persisted in viewing Iran as the greater  threat and refused to force Iraq to live up to its commitments under U.N.  Security Council Resolution 598, the basis for the cease-fire.    The West also continued to turn a blind eye to Iraq's massive human-rights  violations and was years late in condemning Iraq's use of chemical weapons, the  most extensive since the World War I. The Western attitude toward Iraq's drive  for nuclear capability has also been muted.    Last week, Iraq's threat to Kuwait's security and territorial integrity was  seen by many Western analysts as mere posturing in order to boost oil prices at  the OPEC meeting in Geneva. As usual, they cautioned against antagonizing  Hussein.    This analysis is seriously in error. There can be no doubt that Iraq wants to  become the dominant power in the Persian Gulf, which its own 30 miles of  coastline does not merit. Thus, it must control the Iranian shoreline or that  of Kuwait.    Saddam Hussein is a typical Arab nationalist, in the Nasser mold, who views the  gulf rulers as reactionary Western surrogates and impediments to achievement of  Arab nationalists' goals. Now that he is riding high in popularity among the  Arab masses, and because of Arab frustration over the Palestinian problem, he  is testing to see whether he can supplant these gulf leaders or at least bring  them under his control. Nor would Iraq need to launch a full-scale military  invasion of Kuwait to achieve its goal. It could force Kuwait to surrender or  lease strategic islands or even to unite with Iraq.    If successful, critical Iraqi influence over the West's oil lifeline would lead  Hussein to pressure the West on the Palestinian problem.    Under these circumstances, what is the West to do? It has already narrowed its  options by having indulged Hussein for too long. For example, given Iraq's  current military strength, it would not be easy to mount a U.S. naval operation  similar to the re-flagging and protecting of Kuwaiti tankers that was carried  out at the height of the war in 1987-88.    Nevertheless, the West must act before it is too late. First, it must finally  see Hussein for what he really is and stop entertaining false hopes. It must be  more prudent about Iraq's nuclear program, and it must apply economic pressure  while Iraq is still financially vulnerable. Let's hope the U.S. Senate's voting  of economic sanctions Friday marks the start of a long-term policy  re-evaluation. The West, including Europe, must stop new credits and loans to  Baghdad, and if that is not sufficient, an economic boycott, including Iraq's  oil, may be necessary.    The West also must try to restore some balance in the region by helping Iran's  moderates, easing Iran's re-integration in the world community and encouraging  Arab-Iranian reconciliation.    Finally, the West must do all it can to break the deadlock on the Arab-Israeli  peace process and find a solution to the Palestinian problem -- the single most  important rallying cry for frustrated Arabs and the best tool of manipulation  for their ambitious leaders.

0," LA030890-0154   186544    March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 1; Column 6; Foreign Desk      856 words      U.S. STEPS UP EFFORTS TO HALT LIBYA GAS PLANT      By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The Bush Administration called Wednesday for ""vigorous efforts"" to stop Libya's  production of poison gas at a desert factory, and it pointedly refused to rule  out military action against the regime of Col. Moammar Kadafi.    The plant ""is dangerous and becoming more so,"" said a statement read to  reporters Wednesday morning by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ""The  international community,"" he added, ""should step up its efforts to deny Libya  the ability to continue operating the plant.""    Asked several times if the United States has any plans for military action  against Libya, Fitzwater refused to comment, saying only, ""We don't rule  anything out.""    The concern arises from a factory in Rabta, a desert town about 60 miles south  of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. The Libyans have insisted it was built to  make medicines. But American officials say they have confirmed that the plant  is manufacturing at least limited quantities of mustard gas and perhaps other  chemical weapons.    In 1986, then-President Ronald Reagan ordered U.S. jets to bomb Tripoli in  retaliation for Kadafi's support of terrorism. But, despite the implied threat  of military action against the Rabta plant, the main focus of the Bush  Administration's efforts so far appears to be an attempt to cut off the supply  of chemicals needed to produce gas at the plant. In the past, the  Administration has made public statements about the chemical plant to put  pressure on U.S. allies to police chemical shipments to Libya.    ""We want everyone to make sure that they've taken all precautions against  (shipments to Libya) occurring,"" Fitzwater said.    Libya's potential to produce poison gas has been a major American concern for  at least two years, since reports of the construction of the Rabta plant first  became public. At the time, Administration officials said West German companies  were deeply involved in helping build the facility.    ""At that time, we received assurances from the German government that the  problem was corrected.""    Now, ""I don't think we can say we know where the chemicals are coming from,""  Fitzwater said, noting that there are ""many routes"" and that the Administration  does not want to ""discuss any specific countries.""    ""We certainly would urge all countries to survey their internal situation,  inventory their chemical productions facilities and to make their own judgments  that they are not a source for any of these chemicals,"" he added.    Last fall, a West German court ordered the detention of a senior official of  Imhausen-Chemie, a West German chemical company that has been under  investigation in connection with the Rabta plant.    Policing the international flow of chemicals that could be used to produce  poisons for military purposes has proven extremely difficult. Many of the  chemicals used to make nerve gases and other military toxins are also used to  produce pesticides and other legal products. International chemical firms have  resisted some efforts to monitor production and sales of their products,  arguing that they could lose control of important trade secrets.    Mustard gas, in particular, is a relatively easy chemical to manufacture,  although some experts believe the Libyan plant may be capable of producing more  sophisticated nerve gases. Such gases attack the central nervous system,  inhibiting breathing and usually causing a quick death. Mustard gas sears the  lungs and skin, causing painful and crippling disabilities or death.    The use of mustard gas in warfare is prohibited by the 1925 Geneva Convention,  adopted after the widespread use of poison gases in World War I. No treaty,  however, bans the production and possession of chemicals weapons, and both the  United States and the Soviet Union possess large chemical weapons stockpiles.    Many Third World nations, seeing chemical bombs as a relatively cheap weapon  with great power that could be used by them -- or against them -- by enemies,  have built plants capable of producing poison gas. U.S. experts believe that  about two dozen countries now have such capability.    President Bush has proposed an international treaty to ban the weapons, and the  Soviet Union has expressed support for his position. Efforts to draft a treaty,  however, have been complicated by questions about how it would be policed.    Chemical weapons have been used repeatedly in recent years in conflicts between  Third World nations, particularly in the Iran-Iraq War. In addition, U.S.  officials worry that the chemicals could also be used by terrorist groups to  attack civilian populations. Kadafi's links with terrorists have made Libya's  production of poison gas of particular concern.    The Libyans consistently have denied that the plant is designed to produce  chemical weapons, a position they reiterated Tuesday.    Jana, the Libyan news agency, quoted an unnamed Libyan Foreign Ministry  official as having ""disclaimed"" reports that Libya had produced ""quantities of  chemical weapons in (the) Rabta medicine factory.""

Moammar Kadafi.    The plant ""is dangerous and becoming more so,"" said a statement read to  reporters Wednesday morning by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ""The  international community,"" he added, ""should step up its efforts to deny Libya  the ability to continue operating the plant.""    Asked several times if the United States has any plans for military action  against Libya, Fitzwater refused to comment, saying only, ""We don't rule  anything out.""    The concern arises from a factory in Rabta, a desert town about 60 miles south  of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. The Libyans have insisted it was built to  make medicines. But American officials say they have confirmed that the plant  is manufacturing at least limited quantities of mustard gas and perhaps other  chemical weapons.    In 1986, then-President Ronald Reagan ordered U.S. jets to bomb Tripoli in  retaliation for Kadafi's support of terrorism. But, despite the implied threat  of military action against the Rabta plant, the main focus of the Bush  Administration's efforts so far appears to be an attempt to cut off the supply  of chemicals needed to produce gas at the plant. In the past, the  Administration has made public statements about the chemical plant to put  pressure on U.S. allies to police chemical shipments to Libya.    ""We want everyone to make sure that they've taken all precautions against  (shipments to Libya) occurring,"" Fitzwater said.    Libya's potential to produce poison gas has been a major American concern for  at least two years, since reports of the construction of the Rabta plant first  became public. At the time, Administration officials said West German companies  were deeply involved in helping build the facility.    ""At that time, we received assurances from the German government that the  problem was corrected.""    Now, ""I don't think we can say we know where the chemicals are coming from,""  Fitzwater said, noting that there are ""many routes"" and that the Administration  does not want to ""discuss any specific countries.""    ""We certainly would urge all countries to survey their internal situation,  inventory their chemical productions facilities and to make their own judgments  that they are not a source for any of these chemicals,"" he added.    Last fall, a West German court ordered the detention of a senior official of  Imhausen-Chemie, a West German chemical company that has been under  investigation in connection with the Rabta plant.    Policing the international flow of chemicals that could be used to produce  poisons for military purposes has proven extremely difficult. Many of the  chemicals used to make nerve gases and other military toxins are also used to  produce pesticides and other legal products. International chemical firms have  resisted some efforts to monitor production and sales of their products,  arguing that they could lose control of important trade secrets.    Mustard gas, in particular, is a relatively easy chemical to manufacture,  although some experts believe the Libyan plant may be capable of producing more  sophisticated nerve gases. Such gases attack the central nervous system,  inhibiting breathing and usually causing a quick death. Mustard gas sears the  lungs and skin, causing painful and crippling disabilities or death.    The use of mustard gas in warfare is prohibited by the 1925 Geneva Convention,  adopted after the widespread use of poison gases in World War I. No treaty,  however, bans the production and possession of chemicals weapons, and both the  United States and the Soviet Union possess large chemical weapons stockpiles.

He is accompanied by Dutch Foreign Minister  Pieter Kooijmans.    The formal talks between the Dutch delegation and Deputy  Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, now acting prime minister,  lasted more than two hours. Bulgarian Foreign Minister  Stanislav Daskalov also attended the talks. ""It is the sides'  shared opinion that there are still untapped possibilities in  the field of economic relations which should be further  developed based on the good relations the two countries  maintain,"" the spokesman for the Bulgarian Government reported  after the meeting.    Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev believes that it is possible  to activate bilateral economic relations mainly in the field of  investment, production, finance and lending. He thanked the  Dutch side for its assistance in the stabilization of Bulgaria's  balance of payments. Bulgaria expressed its readiness to accept  Dutch investments in the construction of a transport corridor  from the Black Sea to Bulgaria's western border, a transport  corridor connecting the south and the north by building a tunnel  under the Shipka Pass (in the Balkan Range), and the  construction of a new bridge across the Danube. ""The Bulgarian  side hopes that the Netherlands will continue to support  Bulgaria's efforts for integration with all the European  structures and will ratify its Interim Agreement on Trade with  the European Union at an early date,"" Deputy Prime Minister  Matinchev was cited as saying.    The prime minister of the Netherlands described  Bulgarian-Dutch cooperation within the framework of the  International Monetary Fund as very successful and praised  Bulgaria's joining the Partnership for Peace plan. Mr. Lubbers  admitted there are many potentials for the advancement of  bilateral relations, pointing out the need of updating all older  bilateral agreements and creating a modern legal framework for  the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments. He  showed interest in the political and economic situation in  Bulgaria at the moment, the problems of ethnic minorities in  Bulgaria and human rights, Bulgaria's position on the conflict  in ex-Yugoslavia, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  Balkan relations.    In Mr. Matinchev's opinion, the ongoing process of  Bulgaria's  settling its debts to the Paris Club of official creditors and  the London Club of creditor banks is a light at the end of the  tunnel. Mr. Matinchev sees the lack of an earlier settlement of  Bulgaria's external debt problem and the Yugo-embargo as the  main reasons for the slow progress of reforms in this country.  According to calculations made by employing the methods of the  world body, Bulgaria has suffered a loss of 3,200 million U.S.  dollars as a result of the strict application of sanctions  against the former Yugoslavia. The direct losses in the  country's balance of payments since the beginning of this year  only are estimated at 700-900 million U.S. dollars. Mr.  Matinchev informed Mr. Lubbers about the political life in  Bulgaria, stressing that despite the heated debates in  parliament, the country is an island of peace free of  interethnic or other conflicts.    Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov made a  detailed  analysis of Bulgaria's position on the Yugo-crisis and outlined  the parameters of its Balkan policy and its relations with  Greece, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] and Turkey.    After the formal talks the foreign ministers of Bulgaria and  the Netherlands signed a joint political declaration between the  Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the two countries. ""This is  the first declaration signed by representatives of the two  countries since the collapse of communism in Bulgaria,"" the  media were told by Dutch Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans.  ""The document spells out everything that Bulgaria and the  Netherlands have in common, the two countries are members of  many international organizations and have many common goals,""  Mr. Kooijmans said. Listing those common goals, he stressed the  stability and economic prosperity of Europe and cooperation in a  lot of fields. ""Most important is the prevention of conflicts,  and stability also means security, the European countries should  cross-cooperate in the military organization, it is very  important to make the idea for peace a reality,"" the Dutch  foreign minister said.    ""The joint political declaration makes provisions for  bilateral cooperation in economy, politics, trade and culture in  the light of the two countries' common goals,"" Bulgarian foreign  minister Daskalov specified.    Tomorrow the Dutch delegation will have meetings with  President Zhelyu Zhelev and National Assembly Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov.     "

The state delegations for withdrawal talks voiced the  probability during mutual consultations, Andrejevs noted. The  next round of talks is scheduled to open Monday in Moscow.    As reported, Russia offered Latvia 2 million USD per each  year of the operation of the radar after the troop withdrawal is  completed. The Latvian counterproposal was 400 million U.S.  dollars per year.    Chief Russian negotiator Sergei Zotov has no authority to  alter the Russian proposal but Latvia also cannot make that  large concessions, said Andrejevs.    In addition, Andrejevs said that Russia has drafted a  timetable for the withdrawal of troops from the Baltic country.

But prices of crude oil for November delivery moved back up near the close to  settle at $38.69 a barrel, down $1.71 from the previous day's record closing  price on the New York Mercantile Exchange.    The volatility highlighted the nervousness that has overshadowed the  fundamentals of supply and demand in oil markets. ""Today's activities are a  microcosm of everything that's happened since Aug. 2,"" when Iraq invaded  Kuwait, said Sal Gilbertie, a trader with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York.    November crude skyrocketed to a high of $41.15 a barrel in early trading  Wednesday before beginning a dramatic plunge that took prices as low as $38 a  barrel on the NYMEX.    Prices of refined products also closed down. Unleaded gasoline for November  delivery lost 4.66 cents a gallon to close at 93.60 cents. Heating oil for  November delivery closed down 5.10 cents a gallon at $1.0105.    The fall ended three days of rapidly rising prices, spurred by political  tensions arising from the shooting deaths of 19 Palestinians in the Old City of  Jerusalem on Monday and the subsequent harsh speech by Saddam Hussein a day  later.    But there was little news Wednesday to sustain the high prices. ""The market is  a bit like a hot-air balloon, and it requires fresh doses of hot air to stay  aloft,"" said Michael Wilner, president of Hilltop Trading Co. in New York.    Wednesday's high was a record for oil futures since contracts began trading in  1983. It also approached the record price for a U.S. grade of crude oil on cash  markets, where oil is traded for immediate delivery.    Traders believe that record was set Tuesday, when some U.S. grades were offered  for nearly $42 a barrel, apparently exceeding prices during the last oil crisis  in 1979-1980 at the onset of the Iran-Iraq war. Records of cash transactions  during that period are incomplete. On Wednesday, prices for U.S. crude on spot  markets fell to around $38.70 a barrel.    Wednesday's decline began as a rumor spilled over from other futures markets  that Saddam Hussein had been shot or overthrown.    ""No one took it seriously, but (the selloff) indicated that the market was  looking for an excuse to take profits and technically correct itself,"" Wilner  said.    The plunge gained momentum as prices fell through the $40.10-a-barrel price  that had been Tuesday's low, then through $39, then lower.    ""There was very nervous trading,"" said Tom Bentz, director of trading at United  Energy Inc. in New York. ""It seems that whenever the market breaks, whether to  the up side or to the down side . . . the volume comes in very quickly . . . It  makes for a very exaggerated type of move.""    But market watchers denied that speculation was fueling the wide price swings,  despite accusations to that effect by President Bush and others. On Wednesday,  Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), was reported to have asked regulators to  look into the way business is conducted on the mercantile exchange.    ""My sense is that a substantial part of the buying all along has been from  people who actually have a use for either the crude oil, the gasoline or the  heating oil and that their primary motive or concern in life is having supplies  to sell,"" said William Byers, manager of commodity futures research at the  investment firm of Bear, Stearns & Co. in New York.    Current supplies of oil remain adequate for now, analysts said. On Wednesday,  Reuters news agency reported that Saudi Arabia has managed to boost its oil  production to 7.7 million barrels a day, up from 7.5 million at the beginning  of the month and an increase of more than 2 million since the Iraqi invasion.    Production boosts by other countries have replaced all but 1 million to 1.5  million barrels a day of the 4 million or so daily barrels lost to world  production under the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait, said Joseph Stanislaw, a  Paris-based international oil economist with Cambridge Energy Research  Associates.    It is not clear where prices may go from here. Traders normally seek clues from  weekly oil inventory statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, which  were released after the close of trading Wednesday.    But those figures provided no clear signals. Oil stocks in the week ended Oct.  5 fell strongly, by 4.2 million barrels from the previous week. But crude  stocks, which normally fall at this time of year as refiners turn large amounts  of it into heating oil, remain above year-ago levels, analysts said.    Similarly, the figures showed an 1.8-million-barrel buildup of gasoline stocks,  which is expected with the end of the vacation driving season. Stocks of  distillates, including home heating oil, fell 1.5 million barrels, again in  line with seasonal expectations.

Wednesday's high was a record for oil futures since contracts began trading in  1983. It also approached the record price for a U.S. grade of crude oil on cash  markets, where oil is traded for immediate delivery.    Traders believe that record was set Tuesday, when some U.S. grades were offered  for nearly $42 a barrel, apparently exceeding prices during the last oil crisis  in 1979-1980 at the onset of the Iran-Iraq war. Records of cash transactions  during that period are incomplete. On Wednesday, prices for U.S. crude on spot  markets fell to around $38.70 a barrel.    Wednesday's decline began as a rumor spilled over from other futures markets  that Saddam Hussein had been shot or overthrown.    ""No one took it seriously, but (the selloff) indicated that the market was  looking for an excuse to take profits and technically correct itself,"" Wilner  said.    The plunge gained momentum as prices fell through the $40.10-a-barrel price  that had been Tuesday's low, then through $39, then lower.    ""There was very nervous trading,"" said Tom Bentz, director of trading at United  Energy Inc. in New York. ""It seems that whenever the market breaks, whether to  the up side or to the down side . . . the volume comes in very quickly . . . It  makes for a very exaggerated type of move.""    But market watchers denied that speculation was fueling the wide price swings,  despite accusations to that effect by President Bush and others. On Wednesday,  Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), was reported to have asked regulators to  look into the way business is conducted on the mercantile exchange.    ""My sense is that a substantial part of the buying all along has been from  people who actually have a use for either the crude oil, the gasoline or the  heating oil and that their primary motive or concern in life is having supplies  to sell,"" said William Byers, manager of commodity futures research at the  investment firm of Bear, Stearns & Co. in New York.    Current supplies of oil remain adequate for now, analysts said. On Wednesday,  Reuters news agency reported that Saudi Arabia has managed to boost its oil  production to 7.7 million barrels a day, up from 7.5 million at the beginning  of the month and an increase of more than 2 million since the Iraqi invasion.    Production boosts by other countries have replaced all but 1 million to 1.5  million barrels a day of the 4 million or so daily barrels lost to world  production under the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait, said Joseph Stanislaw, a  Paris-based international oil economist with Cambridge Energy Research  Associates.    It is not clear where prices may go from here. Traders normally seek clues from  weekly oil inventory statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, which  were released after the close of trading Wednesday.    But those figures provided no clear signals. Oil stocks in the week ended Oct.  5 fell strongly, by 4.2 million barrels from the previous week. But crude  stocks, which normally fall at this time of year as refiners turn large amounts  of it into heating oil, remain above year-ago levels, analysts said.    Similarly, the figures showed an 1.8-million-barrel buildup of gasoline stocks,  which is expected with the end of the vacation driving season. Stocks of  distillates, including home heating oil, fell 1.5 million barrels, again in  line with seasonal expectations.

The loan will fall in  a range of billions of yen and its disbursement is expected  after an international aid panel designates South Africa as an  eligible recipient this summer, they said.    The loan will be used for projects to be picked up at the  request of South Africa and will include construction of roads,  ports and power plants, the sources said.    Tokyo intends to include South Africa among nations eligible  for aid because it is moving toward democracy, they said.    Japan will also expand its grant-in-aid program, focusing on  education facilities, technical assistance, medical support and  agricultural development, they said.    In tandem with other industrial nations, Japan to date has  not extended full-scale economic assistance in protest of the  country's apartheid policy. But some 100 million yen has been  given as grant-in-aid to support blacks since the Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development's development  assistance committee allowed the assistance in 1990.    Japan and six other Group of Seven industrial nations agreed  earlier this month to coordinate their backing to South Africa  under its new government following the African National  Congress's victory in the first all-race elections.

Shi Guangsheng said: The Chinese Government has consistently  been abiding by the accords that it has signed with some  countries on textile exports. In recent years, however, we  found that a small number of enterprises have been violating the  relevant regulations in an attempt to disrupt market order  through cheating, illegal transshipment, and other means, thus  affecting the normal export of Chinese textiles. In this  connection, the Chinese Government is conducting conscientious  investigations and will take strong measures against such  activities.    Shi Guangsheng said: There are three possibilities regarding  illegal textile exports. First, some enterprises intentionally  violate the law; second, Chinese exporters collaborate with  foreign importers and intermediary agents; and third, some  enterprises simply know very little about the relevant policies,  laws, and ordinances. Shi stressed that comprehensive and  coordinated efforts should be organized to curb offenses in the  first two cases.    Shi Guangsheng revealed that the departments concerned had  called a meeting before the Spring Guangzhou Export Commodities  Fair this year to formulate measures in a campaign against  illegal activities related to the textile trade.

Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo said the  cooperation would focus mainly on research and studies of  tropical forests such as rattan, bamboos, and rubber. Malaysia  and Indonesia view the cooperation very important because they  share common problems in dealing with anti- tropical wood  campaigns by advanced countries, he said in Surabaya, East Java  last night. Jamaludin and his Malaysian counterpart, Datuk Sri  Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, attended a dinner hosted by East Java  Governor Basofi Sudirman in conjunction with the annual meeting  of 38 forest experts from the two countries which is due to last  [to] tomorrow. Jamaludin said both sides would intensify  information exchange on tropical forest development and  management system in efforts to confront anti-tropical wood  campaigns sponsored by industrialised countries. We share a  common political will with Malaysia to counter those who accuse  developing nations of uncontrolled exploitation of tropical  woods, he said. Such accusations are unfounded, he said, adding  that Indonesia has always maintained a strict policy on forest  preservation. Jamaludin said Indonesia with a large area of  tropical forests would be playing a key role among ASEAN  countries to counter such campaigns. The four-day meeting in  Surabaya is the sixth such annual gathering among experts of the  two countries.     "

The PvdA [Labor Party] minister says that the compartments  between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Development  Cooperation and Defense should be removed, because the world is  a global village crying out for an integral approach.    If Pronk is looking for an illustration to prove he is in  the  right, then he has to look no further than Netherlands policies  on the crisis in Bosnia. While the ""Sarajevo formula"" has  gained an almost magical ring to it at the Foreign Ministry,  thanks to the success of the NATO and UN ultimatum, it is in  fact reticence which is steadily gaining the upper hand at the  Defense Ministry under the influence of the deployment of the  reinforced airborne battalion in turbulent eastern Bosnia.    It is very understandable that Foreign Minister Kooijmans  wants to use the momentum from Sarajevo to progressively set  ultimatums in other parts of Bosnia which cannot easily escape  the stranglehold of the civil war. It is less understandable  that he should choose the town of Mostar as the next test case  for the determination of the international community. Unless  the aim is to keep up the pretense of impartiality and balance,  because Muslims and Croats are fighting in this town.    The understanding for Kooijmans' crusade in political  circles  in The Hague ends there. Mostar is not among the six areas  which were designated as safe havens for Muslims by the United  Nations last year. Therefore a new resolution would be  necessary to set a military ultimatum, which would virtually  certainly run up against a veto from Moscow. After the Russian  diplomatic success of last weekend, Russian Foreign Minister  Kozyrev has warned that Moscow has little enthusiasm for a  repeat of the Sarajevo formula.    It is a cast-iron law in international diplomacy that the  countries which shout the loudest must be prepared to put words  into deeds. In the case of Bosnia the Netherlands has nothing  to be ashamed of. In fact, in relative terms it makes the  biggest contribution to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force].    But Defense Minister Ter Beek repeatedly emphasizes that The  Hague, with its promises to the United Nations of some 3,000  troops, has reached its ceiling. As far as he is concerned  there can be no possibility of sending more Netherlanders to  Mostar.    Moreover Sarajevo has revealed the limited possibilities of  UNPROFOR. Even the ""soft"" UN option of 7,600 UN troops for the  six safe areas to be protected is a long way from having been  reached. For this reason, the commander of UN troops in Bosnia,  General Rose, was forced last week to call in reinforcements  from other parts of the former Yugoslavia to monitor the  withdrawal or disabling of Serbian tanks, artillery, mortars,  antiaircraft artillery, and multiple rocket launchers.    Because several hundred Russians were not able to carry out  this task alone, Jordanians came from Croatia and Malaysians  from Bihac. Dozens of observers were even used. But two British  companies from Vitez were also brought in. They were exactly  half the battalion of British infantrymen who are supposed to  offer protection to the humanitarian aid convoys of the  Belgian/Netherlands transport battalion in central Bosnia. This  is an area where there is strong fighting and the area where  some 440 lightly armed Netherlanders are operating.    Last but not least, another reason why the Defense Ministry  and Parliament have reacted sceptically to relief of the  Herzegovina capital is the position of the Croats.  Countermeasures from Zagreb are definitely not to be ruled out  if the international community were to turn against the Croatian  troops who are determined to make Mostar the capital of Bosnian  Croatia.    The hundreds of thousands of refugees are not the only Croat  ""trump card."" From the harbor of Split, they manage what could  be called the lifeline of the Netherlanders who are to be  stationed in central Bosnia (Lukavac) and eastern Bosnia  (Srebenica and Zepa) during March. The closure of the Dalmatian  coast would have disastrous consequences for the successful  running of the entire UNPROFOR operation in Bosnia.    Last March the United States decided to drop food over  eastern Bosnia using Hercules transport planes. The Foreign  Ministry felt the Netherlands really ought to participate as  well and that the Defense Ministry would just have to use F-27s  and Orions. From the humanitarian point of view everything  favored this; the only problem is that every royal airforce  Fokker or Orion crashes every time a door is opened when it is  airborne. A year later the lack of coordination between The  Hague's foreign and security policies is again taking its  revenge.     "

French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin had earlier said  on French radio that Bihozagara was expected in Paris on Tuesday  for talks with the Minister Delegate for Humanitarian Action  Lucette Michaux-Chevry.    France has launched major diplomatic efforts to try to  persuade the mainly Tutsi rebel front that its plan to send up  to 2,000 soldiers to Rwanda and lead a mission to protect  civilians there is purely ""humanitarian.""    But the RPF accuses Paris of arming its opponents in the  mainly Hutu government army, who in turn trained Hutu extremist  militias accused of the massacre of up to half a million Tutsis  and moderate Hutus.    Asked about reports of the RPF official's visit, French  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said the French  government was ""available"" to see him.    Bihozagara was named deputy prime minister in a  power-sharing  arrangement cut between the rebels and Rwandan authorities last  August after three years of civil war.    But the government never took shape and the central African  nation plunged back into bloodletting in April.     "

Silva, who signed the historic China-Portugal Joint  Declaration on the question of Macao during his first visit to  China seven years ago, arrived here by air this morning on a  week-long official visit to China at the invitation of Chinese  Premier Li Peng.    The sources described Silva's visit as ""a major event in the  history of Sino-Portuguese relations.""    China and Portugal are far apart geographically, but  friendship brings them closer. Since the two countries  established diplomatic ties 15 years ago, contacts between the  countries' high-ranking officials have been increasing  noticeably.    Foreign ministers of the two countries exchanged visits  while  Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Vice  President Rong Yiren paid visits to Portugal on separate  occasions.    This has not only promoted mutual understanding, but also  pushed forward bilateral ties in every field.    With concerted efforts and friendly consultations, the  question of Macao left behind by history is being properly  settled.    The two governments formally signed a joint declaration on  the question of Macao on April 13, 1987 after four rounds of  talks over nine months.    The two sides confirmed that China will resume its exercise  of sovereignty over Macao from December 20, 1999.    Since the Joint Declaration was signed, the two governments  have conducted good cooperation with fruitful results.    The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group has convened  nineteen  meetings at which the three major questions in the transitional  period of Macao, namely the localization of public servants, law  and official institution of the Chinese language, have been  discussed in depth.    The two foreign ministers reached a consensus in February  1991 that the Chinese and Portuguese languages share the same  status in Macao and that Portuguese will also be an official  language after 1999.    In December of 1991, the Portuguese side finished  legislative  procedure on the above-mentioned issue. Progress has also been  made in localization of public servants and laws.    Both China and Portugal have taken a sincere and friendly  cooperative attitude toward the question of Macao, which has  given rise to a good environment for Macao's social stability,  economic development and residents living and working in peace  and contentment.    Last year, the two countries successfully settled the issue  of financing the Macao International Airport and the model for  aviation agreement.    Now the Macao International Airport, with a total investment  of 7.3 billion patacas, is under construction. The principal  part of the airport lounge and runway have been built. It is  expected that the project will be completed in July next year.    In addition, the second largest bridge in Macao has been  erected and three advanced refuse burners with a total  investment of 600 million patacas newly built in the region.    The prime minister will take part in a ribbon-cutting  ceremony for the bridge in Macao after his visit to China.    Over the past few years, trade between the two countries has  risen by a big margin. Statistics show that the volume of trade  between the two countries last year amounted to 110 million U.S.  dollars, a 64.4 percent increase over 1992, hitting an all-time  high.    In March this year, the two sides signed a contract on the  joint investment of a winery with an annual output of 4,500 tons  in north China's Hebei Province. Seventy percent of the wine  will be exported.    In addition, the two countries also signed agreements on  economic, industrial and technical cooperation and on the  protection of investment.    In March last year, the Portuguese Minister of Trade and  Tourism Fernando Faria de Oliveira headed a delegation composed  of industrialists and businessmen to visit China. In September  of that year, the mixed Committee for Economic Cooperation and  Trade between the two countries held a meeting in Lisbon.    Today the Portuguese prime minister has brought nearly 60  industrialists and businessmen, including leaders of nearly 40  major Portuguese enterprises, to China.    During the visit, they will hold business talks with about  200 Chinese entrepreneurs, exploring new ways for further  expansion of bilateral cooperation.    All these demonstrate that Sino-Portuguese cooperation is  advancing healthily. The Chinese people hope that Silva will  make fresh contributions to the growth of bilateral ties  established on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.    They also feel that with the approaching of 1999, it is  imperative to accelerate the pace for the early settlement of  the three major issues concerning the transitional period of  Macao so as to create good conditions for the stable transition  and smooth transfer of power.

He added: The presence of these dear  ones in society and in various arenas of the Islamic revolution  act as an inspiration to the people and contribute toward  reconstruction. He went on: The esteemed families of the  martyrs, the devotees, and the war-disabled are regarded as a  vast network, which protect the Islamic revolution and its holy  and remarkable gains in society.    Speaking today on the third day of the auspicious occasion  of  the Ten Days of Dawn, which is named the day of devotion and  martyrdom, and addressing families who have donated more than  one martyr, the president went on: You have voluntarily given  your dearest assets -- that is, your sons -- to be martyred for  the path of God. You are, thus, the best examples of devotion  and self-sacrifice. You have proved that nothing is more dear  to you than the path of the Islamic revolution and the line of  his eminence the imam, may God be satisfied with his deeds.    He added: Thanks to the strength given to the Islamic  revolution by the martyrs, the devotees, and their families, the  Islamic Republic of Iran is stronger and more stable than any  other regime in the world, despite today's seditious world and  despite so much resentment and hostility against us. Since the  families of the martyrs are continuing the path pursued by their  dear ones, this system's stability will increase daily.    Referring to the fact that the Islamic revolution of Iran  has  its roots in the hearts of all the members of society and other  Muslim and deprived nations of the world, the president said:  This revolution is not dependent upon individuals. Those who  think that by eliminating certain individuals they can deliver  blows to the revolution are mistaken; in the same way that after  the passing of his eminence the imam, God's blessings be upon  him, which was a great loss for the nation, the esteemed leader,  Khamene'i, as a wise and aware leader took the reins of the  leadership of this divine nation and decisively and vigorously  continues the path and holy aspirations of the founder of the  Islamic Republic.    He added: As a servant, I always feel indebted to the  nobility, dignity, and the comprehensive participation of all  the members of the public in all the stages of the Islamic  revolution, especially the esteemed families of the martyrs,  those missing in action, and the disabled. I hope that in the  future I will be able to exert more efforts in helping these  people.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: God has provided the  leadership  of the revolution and the steadfastness and self-sacrifice of  the Iranian people as proofs and guiding lights for history and  for those who come after us, so that the people of the world may  see God's will with their own eyes and can use it as a model.    The president said: Negative propaganda and the expanding  nature of the animosity and hatred of world arrogance toward the  Islamic revolution have further strengthened and consolidated it  inside the country, have encouraged the onlookers outside to  make further studies of the amazing dimensions of this historic  phenomenon of the present age, and have forced them to review  their negative assessment of the Islamic revolution.    Praising the sublime status of the martyrs, those missing in  action, and the disabled, and the patience and dignity of the  members of their honorable families, the president said that by  keeping alive the memory of the epic deeds of those beloved ones  we will be able to awaken pure consciences. He said: Those  acts of self-sacrifice have ensured the future of the revolution  and the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The fruits of  their self- sacrifice have made it possible that, alongside the  efforts for reconstructing and strengthening the economic health  of the country, the spiritual foundations of the society will  also be further strengthened.    According to the Central News Unit report, at the beginning  of this meeting, which was also attended by the families of the  martyrs of the presidency [as heard], Hojjat ol-Eslam  val-Moslemin Rahimian, the representative of the vali-ye faqih  and the head of the Martyrs Foundation, made a short speech in  which he expressed his gratitude for God's grace and blessings  in removing the danger to the life of the president. Amidst the  crushing slogans of the families of martyrs condemning the  conspiracies of the enemies and prayers for the health and  well-being of the president, Rahimian said: The esteemed  members of the families of martyrs and the disabled, through  their dignity, piety, and detachment are trying to have an  active presence and participation during the period of the  reconstruction of the country, as they did during the period of  the holy defense, Iran-Iraq war.    In these ceremonies, some of the children of the martyrs  chanted revolutionary songs.     "

""Many nations have shed ideological confrontation to seek  reconciliation and cooperation, and at the same time adopted  pragmatism, placing their national economic interests as top  priority,"" Han said. ""An era of boundless competition and trade  wars opened with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. With the  hastening of internationalization, global problems such as  disarmament, human rights, environmental protection and the  fight against poverty are becoming important issues,"" he said.    International relations in the post-cold war world shifted  the focus from political and military affairs to economics and  trade problems, the minister said. Seoul also places its  emphasis on practical economic interests to join the world's  advanced economic powers.    He recalled an agreement at last month's South Korea-U.S.  summit for a ""thorough and broad"" approach to solving the North  Korean nuclear problem.    While promising to keep to this principle, Han said that an  international action such as by the United Nations Security  Council was inevitable if North Korea did not come forward  favorably in the dialogue efforts.    South Korea enhanced its ties with both Asia and the Pacific  at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in  Seattle in November and the new year will see more participation  by Seoul in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),  especially in regional security dialogue, Han said.

Ernesto Melendez, Cuban minister of Economic Cooperation and  Foreign Investment [title as received], and Apolonio Ruiz  Ligero, Spanish secretary of state for Commerce and Tourism,  signed the document and the records of the 4th Meeting of the  Mixed Cuban-Spanish Commission in the presence of Vice President  Carlos Lage and Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas.    Following speeches in which Melendez and Ruiz voiced great  satisfaction about the results of the negotiations, the Spanish  secretary of state told the press that Spain maintains a line of  credit granted to Cuba in the amount of $40 million.    Apolonio Ruiz said he trusts that trade with Cuba will  increase as a result of the agreements that have been signed and  the Cuban Government's measures that promote an increase in  internal demands through tourism and the people having an access  to convertible currency. He added that trade between the two  countries will also increase in the long run through an increase  in Cuban domestic production.    Bilateral exchange declined in 1993 to $290 million, but the  high-ranking Spanish official hopes it will increase this year.  The 5th Meeting of the Mixed Cuban-Spanish Commission will be  held in Madrid in 1995.     "

Nursultan Nazarbayev  told correspondents in New York yesterday: Unfortunately the  U.S. Administration's attitude toward the Iranian Government is  negative. But Kazakhstan oes not believe in isolating Iran,  which enjoys special importance in northern and central Asian  affairs. The Kazakh president pointed out that Almaty's  relations with Tehran are extremely good and constructive and  that despite all the bad propaganda by enemies, the two  countries are expanding their relations.    Nazarbayev rejected allegations of a threat from Islamic  fundamentalism in the Central Asian republics and stressed: We  are all Muslims and respect Islamic beliefs. After having lived  through the antireligious years in the former Soviet Union, the  people in the Central Asian republics are extremely interested  in returning to their religious beliefs. Nevertheless, he  added, in Kazakhstan religion and politics are kept separate.    The Kazakh president described the Economic Cooperation  Organization, ECO, as a good example of successful regional  cooperation for the world.    Referring to the agreements between Washington and Almaty,  he  said that the two countries have concluded agreements in the  political, economic, scientific, technological, and defense  fields as well as in the joint use of Kazakhstan's space center,  and that the United States has promised $300 million in aid to  Kazakhstan.

Andreatta was representing the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which he is  currently chairman. The talks were based around three main  points:    1. The crisis in Yugoslavia and the Serbian position with  regard to the new Croatian-Muslim federation. There was no  mention of Italian blue helmets possibly being sent to Bosnia.    2. In the Baltics -- Andreatta left Moscow for Estonia this  evening -- Italy wants the Russian minority's civil rights to be  respected.    3. The G-7. Italy is preparing a program for the  forthcoming Naples summit in July. Some members, especially  Japan, are perplexed about the idea of widening the group to  admit Russia, and Russia's bid to join the group of the most  industrialized countries will have to be taken one step at a  time. The Kremlin's foreign policy will no doubt be the subject  of political discussions, but in Naples only seven nations will  participate in economic talks. [end recording]     "

He said that Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati in his  visit to Dublin in mid January called for creation of a trade  balance between the two countries, and encouraged the Irish  Government to import Iranian oil and non-oil products.    According to a memorandum of understanding signed between  Iran and Ireland on Jan. 13, the Irish government expressed  readiness to facilitate holding of exclusive exhibitions for the  Iranian products in that country, he said.    The two countries also agreed to cooperate in seismology,  housing, and urban development areas, and to organize short-term  courses on urban development.    Cooperation in agriculture, livestock, forests and pasture  sectors as well as joint investments in fisheries, food  industries, aviation, communications, transport, and exchange of  university students and instructors, are among the other topics  agreed between the two countries.    Velayati in his two-day visit to Ireland met with President  Mary Robinson, Premier Albert Reynolds and ministers of foreign  affairs, agriculture and food, defence, the marine, trade and  marketing and chairman of foreign affairs committee, Brian  Lennihan.

It must be ensured that borders do not come down for  criminals while they remain in place for the prosecuting  authorities, says a program of action drafted by Federal  Interior Minister Manfred Kanther for the period of the German  EU presidency in the second half of 1994.    WELT AM SONNTAG adds that according to Kanther, cross-border  crime, which is increasingly being organized on an international  basis, must be combated more effectively, and illegal  immigration in the European region -- and especially in Germany  -- must be halted. The interior minister told the paper that he  wants to ensure ""an improvement in cooperation between all the  security authorities."" The German Government also wants to step  up the expansion of ""Europol"" in The Hague and ensure that the  European police organization is ""fully operational"" by October  1994.    According to information from the news agency DDP/ADN, the  Europol organization will take up work officially on 16  February. Narcotics agents from the 12 EU states based in The  Hague will then cooperate in order to better organize the  combating of internationally active drug gangs and other serious  cross-border international crime. [passage omitted]    Cooperation between the German and Polish border police will  also be the focus of talks tomorrow between Kanther and his  Polish counterpart Andrzej Milczanowski. The talks in Warsaw  will also center on police cooperation, the Federal Interior  Ministry announced in Bonn today.     "

At the meeting, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Adamishin,  said: Russia seeks to use its good relations with Iran to  resolve regional crises, including the Tajik crisis, because we  do not see any need for a military solution in Tajikistan.  Therefore Iran and Russia are able, through using their  influence, to establish peace and tranquillity in the region.  He added: Iran and Russia have strategic interests in  Tajikistan.    Mr. Velayati, while describing today's meeting of the Tajik  opposition leaders and Russian officials in Tehran as important,  considered it to be a turning point in resolving the Tajik  crisis and said: The Islamic Republic of Iran supports any  solution which will maintain the national interests of the Tajik  people.    He added: The resolution of the Tajik crisis through  military  means is impossible. Therefore the only way to establish a fair  and honorable peace is by peaceful means.    At the meeting, the issue of increasing regional cooperation  -- especially the Organization for the Cooperation of the  Caspian Sea Littoral States -- was discussed and the Russian  deputy foreign minister declared his country's readiness for the  earliest possible convening of a meeting of the Organization's  senior experts.

Mr Perry pointed out that Russia would declare its joining  NATO's Partnership for Peace programme at the end of March.  ""This will be a major event in NATO"", because its programme will  be virtually realised, he said, adding that ""Russia is a great  nuclear power and it will play a very special role in the  Partnership for Peace"".    The supply of technology to Russia for the manufacture of  prefabricated houses for servicemen and for the elimination of  chemical weapons was also discussed during the talks with the  U.S. defence secretary, Chernomyrdin said. ""We have approached  closely the problem of eliminating biological weapons as well,""  the premier noted.    Chernomyrdin called for more active cooperation between the  two countries under the auspices of the Russian-U.S. Economic,  Scientific and Technical Cooperation Commission which is  co-chaired by the Russian premier and U.S. Vice-President Albert  Gore.

THE RIFT HAS SHAKEN THE  ORGANIZATION LED BY AHMED JIBRIL, PRIME SUSPECT IN THE BOMBING OF PAN AM FLIGHT  103.      By NICK B. WILLIAMS Jr. and ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      DAMASCUS, Syria      Palestinian guerrilla leader Ahmed Jibril, a prime suspect in the 1988 bombing  of Pan American Flight 103, has been hobbled by twisting loyalties that  threaten full control of his radical organization, diplomatic and intelligence  officials say.    Reports of dissension in the top circles of Jibril's Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command have been circulating for weeks in  Syria, where the group has been based since its formation in 1968.    The trouble revolves around the group's growing reliance on Iranian sources to  fund its military operations, according to intelligence analysts in Damascus  and in Washington. Meanwhile, the organization is under close watch by its  Syrian hosts, who have been stung by association with the December, 1988,  terrorist bombing that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland,  killing 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.    Investigation into the bombing continues, and no charges have been made in the  British courts. However, a trail of evidence has been traced to known  operatives of Jibril's group. According to American officials, the Damascus  government has pledged not to tolerate any acts of terrorism by Syrian-based  guerrilla groups and to ""punish"" anyone who is accused on convincing evidence.    So far, there has been no direct Syrian move against Jibril, who is also known  as Abu Jihad, and his estimated 500 guerrillas.    ""Absolutely not,"" said a Damascus-based diplomat of reports that the  Palestinian radical has moved his base of operations from the outskirts of the  Syrian capital to Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley.    Syria has been Jibril's main sponsor since he founded his guerrilla command.  The Jaffa-born Palestinian was trained in the Syrian army and helped lead the  Syrian-backed Palestinian radical revolt against Yasser Arafat's mainline Fatah  guerrillas in Lebanon in the mid-1980s.    But intelligence sources inside Syria and abroad say that Jibril's command of  his organization has been challenged over the issue of the divided sponsorships  of Syria and Iran.    ""Syria has less hold over Jibril than at any point since his 1983 split with  Arafat,"" a top American counterterrorism official said in Washington.    Jibril has denied published reports that his guerrillas masterminded and  carried out the Pan Am bombing and that he received money from Iranian sources  who wanted retaliation for the felling of an Iranian airliner over the Persian  Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War by a U.S. missile cruiser that mistakenly  targeted the airliner as an F-14 jet.    Nevertheless, sources in Damascus and Washington said Jibril is receiving money  from Iran, although conceding it is not clear which faction in the Tehran  government, or outside it, is providing the funds.    ""He's following the Iranian agenda,"" said a Damascus-based diplomat. ""He's the  man chosen to carry out Iran's dirty tricks.""    Jibril's funding formerly came from Syria and Libya, but both countries have  cut back on bankrolling outside radicals in the last two years.    ""His leaning toward Tehran appears to be mainly linked to the financial issue,""  said an American analyst. ""(Libyan leader Moammar) Kadafi has cut back  seriously on his funding.""    Meanwhile, Jibril poses a political and public relations problem for the  government of Syrian President Hafez Assad. Commenting on Jibril's reported  absences from Damascus, a State Department official in Washington speculated  that Assad is trying to squeeze Jibril from power ""to get rid of the albatross  of Pan Am 103.""    With Syria on notice that ever-increasing military support from the Soviet  Union is no longer available, and with its own economy staggering, Assad's  government has taken a more moderate line in recent months. It has  re-established relations with Egypt and put out economic feelers to the West,  including the United States. Jibril and his radical Iranian connections are  drags on the new image.    Within the group, according to Damascus sources, the contending power is Talal  Najy, an East Bloc-educated Palestinian with administrative skills and a firm  loyalty to Syria. In late February, according to Washington reports, a split of  the executive committee was averted only when Najy was given control of the  political apparatus of the guerrilla command, leaving Jibril to handle military  operations. Syrian sources confirmed an informal division of powers.    One Western diplomat said that Najy was reported considering the diversion of  the group's resources to Iranian objectives, as opposed to basic anti-Israeli  activities, a serious policy change.    The two men, however, are keeping their differences ""under the surface,"" said a  well-informed Syrian observer. Both appeared last week at the Yarmouk refugee  camp outside Damascus to mark the anniversary of the founding of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.

Yi used to belong to the Nuclear and Chemical Defense  Bureau within the Korean People's Armed Forces General Staff  (defense ministry). Explaining recent military and social  affairs in North Korea, he said: ""Money has begun to rule  society."" Yi is an unmarried ""middle-class officer,"" which is  equivalent to a noncommissioned officer. While he was posted to  the ""Antinuclear and Antiatom Analysis Institute"" [name as  published] in Pyongyang, he crossed the PRC-North Korean border  and entered South Korea via the PRC in March this year. The  following are questions and answers from the interview.    [Kuroda] Are there any recent changes in North Korean  society?    [Yi] The people have begun to think money is everything. In  the past, party members and university graduates were considered  as ideal partners for marriage. Now people care whether or not  he has money. If you have money, you can do everything. You  can get promoted and obtain a job. The people have begun to  have a keen interest in money. Everybody, including senior  party and government officials as well as farmers, hopes to  conduct black-marketeering. Black-marketeering is called ""yami""  in North Korea. It has been rumored that former Prime Minister  Yon Hyong-muk was dismissed from his post because his wife  committed irregularities when she exchanged old currencies for  new.    [Kuroda] How is the food and energy situation?    [Yi] Rice had been rationed in Pyongyang until 1990. Since  1991, there has been no rice rationing during the May-June  off-season. Another event shows the North's poverty. After  inspecting a front-line unit in October 1992, Vice Premier Kim  Pok-sin told President Kim Il-song that the guards in the unit  wore shoes made of tree bark; he appealed to the president with  tears in his eyes that the unit was in need of food.  Immediately after this, military shoes and rice were sent to  the unit.    Last July, Pyongyang celebrated the 40th anniversary of the  Korean war armistice, but without the usual large parade of  military vehicles such as tanks. This was due to the oil  shortage.    [Kuroda] Do you know anything about the DPRK's nuclear  development?    [Yi] Judging from the atmosphere within the military, I  firmly believe nuclear weapons have already been developed.  Encouraged by the fact that Iraq secretly promoted the  development of nuclear weapons while accepting nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency,  high-ranking officers in my unit said: ""We can also deceive the  international community.""    I also heard that, after a U.S. satellite spotted a nuclear  facility in Yongbyon around the autumn of 1992, the facility was  covered with trees.    [Kuroda] What about the ""combat readiness"" assumed by North  Korea after it declared its withdrawal from the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty last March?    [Yi] At that time, the military held a large rally with  President Kim (supreme commander of the Korean People's Army)  attending. During the rally they sang ""There Will Be No  Homeland Without You"" and ""The People Will Continue To Believe  in General Kim Chong-il Even If the World Changes 100 Times""  while shedding tears. They said they could believe neither  Russia nor China.    The general opinion is that ""waging a war may not be a bad  idea"" to pull the nation out of poverty. But I often heard  military officers questioning ""if we really can win a war.""  Nobody believes the government's propaganda about South Korea,  which Pyongyang says is prepared to wage an aggressive war  against the North.    [Kuroda] It is said the Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau  was engaged in research on chemical (poison-gas) weapons.    [Yi] The bureau is engaged in research and production of  almost all kinds of poison gas, including yperite. It can load  poison gas on shells, bombs, and missiles.    [Kuroda] Do you know anything about these missiles?    [Yi] We call them ""SKUD's (he meant SCUD's)."" Those SKUD's  exported during the Iran-Iraq war caused trouble because of the  missile's low probability of hitting targets. There are missile  bases at Hamchun and Hwadae in North Hamgyong Province on the  east coast, and at Chongchu in North Pyongan Province on the  west coast. It is said the missiles from these bases can reach  Okinawa and even Guam. I heard the missiles at a base in  Chagang Province, which is located along the China-North Korea  border, are targeted on China.    [Kuroda] Is there a possibility the structure of the DPRK  will change?    [Yi] North Koreans know China has become affluent. Thus,  many have voiced their strong hope that Pyongyang will adopt an  open-door policy like China. Nevertheless, President Kim and  his son will not open up the country because they give priority  to maintaining the current structure. In view of the close and  constant watch system in the North, I believe the current  structure will be maintained for at least another three years.     "

A  10-point paper published today by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn  calls on all those states which have not yet signed the nuclear  nonproliferation treaty or conventions on biological and  chemical weapons to do so without delay. In addition, the  treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons should be  extended indefinitely from 1995.    The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe should  be augmented to become a model for the regional nonproliferation  of nuclear weapons which could also serve as a model for other  regions. In addition, the German initiative envisages  international cooperation in the area of export controls. The  Foreign Ministry also urges greater support, including financial  aid, for disarmament programs in the CIS.    Plutonium coming into circulation as a consequence of  disarmament should in the future be monitored by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United Nations  should compile a nuclear weapons register to create a better  overview of the number of nuclear weapons in existence. The  German Government also reaffirmed its call for a worldwide and  comprehensive agreement against nuclear testing.    The Foreign Ministry paper also points out that in a basic  resolution the UN Security Council described the proliferation  of weapons of mass destruction as a threat to international  security and peace. This gives the Security Council scope to  impose the appropriate coercive measures.     "

In the structure of export to the USA the main commodity  groups consist of precious metals and articles from these  metals, rare earth and nonferrous metals, chemical goods, oil  products, foodstuffs and agricultural raw materials.    Import is mainly represented by food products (wheat, maize,  barley, butter, soy beans, etc.), machines, equipment and  transport facilities.    Russian-American trade is traditionally characterized by a  considerable deficit of the balance of trade. In 1992, for  instance, import exceeded export 4.2 times. The volume and  structure of Russia's export, especially that of finished  articles, has been adversely affected by the long absence (from  1951 to 1992) of the most-favoured-nation treatment. For a whole  number of goods likely to be exported the duties imposed on us  were two to ten times higher than the level of customs duties  for countries enjoying this treatment. Among other reasons  mention can be made of low competitive capacity, the barriers  kept alive in the USA for the import into the country of  high-technology goods, and antidumping legislation. As a result,  the possibilities of exporting uranium products to the USA were  considerably limited in the past, and an antidumping duty was  imposed on ferrosilicium from Russia. Until recently there has  been a threat of antidumping proceedings being instituted in  relation to the sale of chlorinated potassium, aluminium and  steel.    As in the past, last year goods turnover was mainly  determined by our import of grain. A favourable balance of trade  in the first half-year arose partly in virtue of the fact that  due to the unsettled problem of debt Russia could still not use  credits for the purchase of grain. However, four new agreements  were concluded in June in the framework of the Food for Progress  programme, shipments of which commenced in September. In this  way Russia's import in October exceeded export, the latter  growing at a higher rate than in 1992.    Treaty rights and legal status    The key document is the Agreement on Trade on Trade  Relations  signed between the USSR and the USA in 1990. In relation to  Russia it was put in force on June 17, 1992, during the summit  meeting in Washington.    The document makes provision for measures aimed at  encouraging commercial contacts and boosting the mutual  deliveries of goods and services, and assists in expanding trade  in equipment and technologies. The agreement regulates the  financial aspect of trade between the two countries, the  questions of protecting intellectual property, and formalizes  cooperation in the spheres of statistics and standards.  Provision is made for facilitating the transit of goods across  the territories of our countries. Agreements have been reached  on measures for the eventuality of the ""market being violated""  (damage being inflicted on national industry by import), and on  the settlement of disputes through arbitration.    In June 1992 there was an exchange of notes on giving effect  to the Agreement on Assisting Investments signed on April 3,  1992. It envisages the possibility for American investors to use  the services of the U.S. Government's specialized insurance  agency known at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation  (OPIC).    The Treaty on the Encouragement and Mutual Protection of  Investments (not yet ratified by the Russian side) and the  Treaty on Avoiding Dual Taxation (the exchange of ratification  instruments took place in December 1993) have also been signed  with a view to attracting investments.    Organizational basis    In previous decades the Joint Soviet-American Commission on  Trade (in 1980-1985 its activities were unilaterally frozen by  the USA in connection with the war in Afghanistan) had a  considerable part to play in promoting economic contacts.    In 1992, on the American side's initiative, the US-Russian  Business Council was instituted in Washington as a lobbyist  organization speaking for the interests of the U.S. business  circles. On the part of the CIS there is the Council for Trade  Cooperation Between the Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the CIS  and the USA.    An Intergovernmental Russian-American Committee for the  Development of Business Cooperation was instituted in 1992 for  the purpose of promoting cooperation in the economy at a  governmental level.    Last April, at the summit meeting in Vancouver, it was  decided to set up an Intergovernmental Commission on Economic  and Technological Cooperation. The range of its interests  comprises joint activities in areas such as science, energy,  space, conversion and environmental protection. The commission  has held two sittings: in Washington (September) and in Moscow  (December). It is headed by the Chairman of the RF Government  and the Vice-President of the USA.    Trade and political situation    In the late 1980s, after a partial embargo on the export of  agricultural products to the USSR, the US administration took a  number of positive steps. Since 1987 the United States had been  granting us subsidies for the purchase of wheat.    In April 1992 the US Congress eliminated one of the key  obstacles to Russian-American trade and economic relations--the  Byrd-Stevenson amendments fixing a ceiling of 300 million  dollars on the total volume of credits to Russia on the part of  the US Eximbank and 40 million on credits for energy projects.    As a result of the Agreement on Trade Relations Between the  USSR and the USA being brought into force (June 1992) Russia has  been granted the most-favoured-nation treatment in trade with  the United States. Incidentally, contrary to the provisions of  the Agreement's Article 1 on the unconditional provision of such  treatment, the USA extended it on the basis of an annual  waiver--temporary suspension of the Jackson-Vanik amendment  (this suspension can be unilaterally cancelled at any moment).    The Act on Support for Freedom in Russia and Nascent  Euro-Asian Democracies and Support for Open Markets, better  known as the Freedom Support Act, came into force in October  1992. It envisages the repeal of a number of legislative  restrictions of the Cold War times, but does not affect Section  IV of the 1974 US Trade Act (Jackson-Vanik amendment).    Thanks to the Vancouver accords between the two presidents  two agreements were signed in June of last year on the free  supplies of food products and two intergovernmental credit  agreements under the Food for Progress programme. The total cost  of supplies is 500 million dollars, including 71.5 million on an  unrepayable basis. Another 200 million dollars will be used to  compensate transport expenses. The term of the credit is 15  years. The interest rate is 3 percent in the course of easy-term  seven years and 4 percent in subsequent years.    In July 1993 a framework agreement was signed with the US  Eximbank on the provision of credits and credit guarantees for  the Russian oil and gas industry to the tune of more than two  billion dollars.    Last August President Clinton signed a bill on the budget  and  taxation, which also speaks about the need to extend to Russia  the benefits of the General System of Preferences.    In December 1993, on the administration's initiative, the US  Congress passed a Law on Assisting the Reform in New Democratic  Countries and on Rendering Aid and Support with a View to  Improving Partnership with Russia, Ukraine and Other  Newly-Independent States, whereby more than 70 legislative  restrictions have been lifted. This number does not include the  Jackson-Vanik amendment.    Prospects    The creation of a treaty rights basis, the establishment of  the most-favoured-nation treatment in trade between the two  countries, the extension to Russia of the US General System of  Preferences and, lastly, the new programmes of economic aid  provide real prerequisites for increasing mutual trade.  Cooperation in investments has a special part to play. US firms  already take the lead among Western investors in the creation of  joint ventures in Russia (as many as 1,400 JVs have been set up  with their participation). American investments in our country  total c.400 million dollars. More than 300 firms have opened  their representation missions.    Work is also underway to implement a whole number of  projects  aimed at the creation of companies on US territory with the  participation of Russian capital, including those on the basis  of our advanced technology.

The Russian position is the main -- but to be sure not the only  one -- reason why NATO flinches at the thought of admitting  Central and East European states to the bloc. Another major  reason is the organization's unwillingness or perhaps even  inability for serious change. It seems that chances for the  admission of Poland and other states from this region to NATO  will not be realistic until these two problems are solved. For  the time being, we must be happy with the ""Partnership for  Peace.""    After President's Clinton declaration about the lack of  agreement among NATO countries on the admission of ""new  democracies,"" it is highly unlikely that the situation can  change with only a few hours left before the ""16"" summit. While  any decision of the North Atlantic bloc can be approved by  consensus, only four states -- Germany, the Netherlands,  Belgium, and Norway -- accept the possibility of NATO's  expansion.    Even if the bloc declares that Poland might become a NATO  member in the future, this would be a nonbinding declaration.  It will contain nothing that would allow Poland and other  Central European states to count on NATO's helping hand in the  event our security is jeopardized.    However, lack of ""written"" guarantees on the part of the  only  military and political organization in Europe should not be  demonized. If the West thought that defending Poland was in its  interests, it very well might extend us some kind of military  support. Otherwise, Poland and other states of the region would  have to have to expect the support -- rather hypothetically --  of the United Nations and CSCE. Several months ago, NATO  spurned a Hungarian request for security guarantees -- prompted  by the Balkan crisis -- saying that country could count on aid  from the United Nations if its security were threatened.    Bad Russia    According to a widely held belief, the main reason why NATO  flinches at the thought of its expansion into Central and East  Europe is the Russian position. Using an entire range of  diplomatic and political means, Russia managed to force the West  into respecting its interests and accepting its drive to  influence the area west of its state borders. While the West  says it denies Russia the right to veto NATO's expansion, at the  same time it explains its reluctance to have new members by  citing an unwillingness to create new divisions in Europe.    NATO gave Russia the time it needed to realize its  significance. The West has probably committed a new sin with  regard to that country by trusting that the Russian political  establishment will change its perception of the Russian place in  Europe and the world. After all, we all laughed at Andrey  Kozyrev's ""joke"" at the CSCE conference in Stockholm last year,  when he warned of expansionist policies if the Yeltsin team lost  power in Russia.    In the Background    Such Western policies have created the impression that  Central Europe is being pushed to the background. European  relations increasingly depend on the triangle connecting  Washington, Bonn, and Moscow. Germany, which has been most  vocal about the need to grant Poland and other countries  admission into NATO, gives priority to relations with Moscow,  and the United States proposes its ""strategic partnership.""  This goes very well with Russia's efforts that Central European  states be given security guarantees. According to this policy,  our countries are left in a gray zone securing a kind of  geopolitical balance in Europe. This would mainly apply to  Poland as a country in a significant strategic location.    The West also seems to attach great importance to the  ""order-maintaining role"" of Moscow in the CIS. This was proved  at the CSCE conference in Rome which sanctioned Russian  peacekeeping missions on territory of the former Soviet Union.  The Russian Army can guarantee relative stability in that  region and will always be able to head off any worst-case  scenario.    Should the Russian position continue to influence U.S. and  NATO policies so much, we can be waiting for NATO admission for  a very long time. No one is sure how long it will take for  Russian diplomacy to fully accept the sovereignty of countries  which used to be its satellites.    NATO's relations with our country have little to do with the  scenario that is currently developing in Moscow. No matter what  happens -- whether the situation takes a dramatic turn (coup or  Zhirinovskiy-style eruption of nationalism) or democracy  prevails with Yeltsin agreeing to Poland's membership in NATO --  this would have little effect on Western policy concerning us.  This raises the following question: Does the Russian  reluctance to see Poland in NATO give the West a good excuse, a  smokescreen?    Behind the Smokescreen    The fact that the West participates in Moscow's game cannot  be explained only by the fear of Russia or a reluctance to raise  new barriers in Europe. NATO does not want any new members also  because the expansion of a respected and wealthy group of 16  states would change the organization itself. Organizationally  and financially, it is not prepared for rebuilding its  structure, deploying troops according to new principles,  reforming systems of command, and allowing the East open access  to modern military equipment.    Notably, at its Brussels summit, the bloc is not planning to  alter the strategy it adopted at the end of 1991, despite  numerous promises that it will adapt it to meet conditions in  the changing world. The only new element will be a decision  about creating the so-called combined operational forces which  could engage in UN- or CSCE-sponsored actions (also in  cooperation with the East). Also, experts prepared a 900-page  report on NATO's participation in peaceful operations which,  given the bloc's refusal to get directly involved in the  Yugoslav conflict, will only be good for recycling.    In addition, France is increasingly perceived as moving  closer to NATO structures. From now on, the French defense  minister could participate in its meetings. No French minister  has attended a NATO defense meeting since 1966, when France  withdrew from the bloc's military structures.    NATO politicians and diplomats emphasize that the bloc's  purpose should be to ""organize"" a security system. NATO could  become the cornerstone of a common European system in the future  which would consist of cooperation in the framework of NATO, the  European Union, the CSCE, and the United Nations. However, this  task might not be fulfilled either, if the North Atlantic bloc  turns into an elite company, keeping ""new democracies"" outside.    ""Partnership for Peace""    The concept of the ""Partnership for Peace,"" as it is  presented by its American authors, can be summed up in four  basic points.    1. Becoming a NATO member is a process.    2. The ""Partnership"" is an initial step toward possible  membership; at first, all of the 22 post-communist states and  NATO's partners from the North Atlantic Cooperation Council will  have equal chances. This, however, does not mean that some  country will automatically gain NATO membership.    3. The ""Partnership"" will not be a substitute for the  membership for states which have a chance of becoming NATO  members.    4. Besides the above conditions, NATO will not define in the  immediate future any specific conditions allowing, if met,  candidates to count on membership or any timetable for admission.    According to the ""Partnership for Peace,"" consultations with  NATO are possible when some East European state feels that its  security, territorial integrity, or independence are threatened.  From the West's point of view, the following provisions are  supposed to be very important:    1. Defense and budget planning;    2. Democratic (political, civilian) control over the  military;    3. Cooperation in peace missions conducted under the  auspices of the United Nations and CSCE;    4. Specification by each ""partner"" of troops which  could participate in joint operations;    5. Joint training, exercises, and maneuvers;    6. Search and rescue missions;    7. Establishment of representation bureaus at NATO  headquarters in Brussels and the military headquarters (SHAPE)  [Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe] in Mons; a teamwork  of officers;    The ""Partnership"" program will also be open for neutral  states which, in contrast to Central and East European  countries, never belonged to the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council.

0,FT934-8450 ,"FT934-8450 _AN-DKPCNAA0FT 931116   FT  16 NOV 93 / Cocom: a brute turned super sleuth - Plans to abandon a web of controls      By DAVID DODWELL   COCOM'S historic role of economic attrition against the Soviet Union and its allies, and of blocking their access to military technology, will be formally swept aside this week. In The Hague today, the 17 members of the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls are expected to unveil their plans for a more flexible successor institution. Former targets of the Cocom regime, notably Russia and China, are likely to be invited to join the new body, with its focus now turning to countries such as North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Libya. The dramatic emergence of Iraq as a global security threat with a potential nuclear capability, during and after the Gulf war, was as important in forcing change as the dismantling of the Berlin Wall. As one UK-based academic noted, this brought into sharp focus the fact that Cocom and its sister bodies dealing with nuclear proliferation, chemical weapons, and missile technology had - in their obsessive concern with the Soviet block - allowed a number of militarily threatening third world countries to slip through the net. They were shaken by the use of chemical weapons by Iraq in its war with Iran, and by the scale on which they threw ballistic missiles at each other: over 1,000 were fired during the Iran-Iraq war. They were also shocked to learn - on the defection of an Iraqi engineer after the apparently successful Operation Desert Storm - of the extent of Iraq's nuclear weapons programme, and the capacity which remained intact at the end of the war. Such discoveries have led to calls for new ways of identifying threatening activity, and of detecting potential mis-use of dual-technology goods. In prospect is a lighter set of nationally-enforced arrangements which will lift regulation from a large number of products on the existing Cocom lists of restricted exports. They will reduce the paper work and delay in obtaining licences where they remain necessary. But they will improve information-sharing arrangements, alerting governments more quickly to the emergence of suspicious buying activity. At the heart of the new regime against proliferation will be demands for comprehensive export control arrangements, and effective enforcement. 'In France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US, revelations about illegal or indiscreet exports to threatening states brought public debate that led to a reconsideration and tightening of export controls,' said Mr Gary Bertsch and Mr Richard Cupitt from the University of Georgia in a wide-ranging paper on non-proliferation in the Washington Quarterly. They call for a 'new typology' to deal with the more-fluid post-Cold war alliances. This would distinguish between co-ordinating states, collaborating states, sensitive states, threatening states and peripheral states. They note that while Russia is currently a collaborating state, 'one can easily imagine developments that might move it into the category of sensitive or threatening states'. New arrangements will need to cope with this 'extreme flux'. One of the greatest challenges of the new regime will be to marshal proliferation through former Soviet republics such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. 'Most of these states are racked by internal and external conflict, and are not in a position to put export controls in place even if they intend to,' the Georgia academics note. Given the pressure on them to earn hard currency by exporting arms, and their 'porous' borders with Russia, preventing leakage of sensitive technologies through this region presents the new Cocom with formidable challenges. 'Export controls are only likely to delay the acquisition of critical dual-use technologies if a state is determined to acquire them,' the academics note. 'Unless the US and its co-ordinating allies address the demand for weapons of mass destruction and dual-use technologies, and pressures to supply those demands, non-proliferation policy will be incomplete.' Cocom officials are pressing for improved channels of information to identify at least four facts: the end use of any exported commodity; the location of the end user; possible sensitive applications; and possible re-exports. 'We will be looking for a matrix of suspicious information,' one London-based official said. In place of Cocom, 'a brutal thing that brutally succeeded', she predicted that 'the new regime will be more gentle - an education process, pooling information and trying to discern patterns and trends to detect an emergent threat'. For those exporters who for decades have been frustrated by cumbersome and time-consuming Cocom licencing rules, such changes should be welcome. 'We will be controlling hardly anything anymore,' said the Cocom official, predicting that licences will in future be needed on just 5 per cent of those products currently on the Cocom list.

Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    The protest was circulated as an official U.N. document on  Thursday [23 June].    The document, which was presented by Yugoslav Ambassador to  the U.N. Dragomir Djokic, said that members of the Serb and  Montenegrin peoples, whose native country is Yugoslavia, are  being forcibly moved from the Albania-Yugoslavia border area.  Such actions by the Albanian authorities are a gross violation  of human and civil rights -- the right to physical integrity,  choice of place of residence and the inviolablity of personal  and private property, said the protest.    The Yugoslav ministry assesssed that this is a deliberately  conceived policy aimed at breaking up the ethnic compactness of  Serbs and Montenegrins in Albania, especially in territories  towards the Yugoslav-Albanian border. Such actions by [word  indistinct] contrary to its obligations stemming from its  membership in tha U.N. and the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), said the protest.

Since my visit to your country about a year  ago, we have been able to make good progress in fleshing out the  agreements we achieved at that time. Today, at the beginning of  our talks, we discussed further initiatives, which we want to  shape intensively over the next 12 months.    Over the past years Asia has increasingly developed to an  international economic and political focal area. As a turntable  in the Southeast Asian region, your country, Mr. Prime Minister,  is playing a special role in this respect.    Therefore I welcome the fact that today we are able to  continue our dialogue about the deepening of our relations in  the political, economic, technological, and cultural field.    During my visit to your country we discussed for the first  time the idea of even closer cooperation between German and  Singapore companies on the growing markets of the Asian region.  I cite the PRC in this connection. I could also cite India or,  for instance, aspiring Vietnam. There our companies can achieve  great advantages if they proceed together.    I would like to especially express my pleasure, Mr. Prime  Minister, that your predecessor, current Senior Minister Lee  Kuan Yew, will visit us in a few days and that this also shows  the strength of our relations.    In our talks we have always agreed on the particular  importance that we attribute to the relations of our two  countries in the economic and technological fields. The  economic associations of our two countries -- and I would like  to stress this gratefully here -- also decided in favor of this  involvement right from the start.    Therefore today we can sign the founding document of the  German-Singapore Economic Forum under the patronage of the  Asia-Pacific Committee of German Industry.    However, I also want to stress that relations with your  country and with Asia in general are of great importance not  only for economic reasons but also with a view to cultural and  political cooperation.    Germany must be and remain a country open to the world. This  also includes that we cultivate friendship with many countries  in the world. I am happy that the friendly cooperation with  your country, Mr. Prime Minister, has developed so well.    In particular, I am happy that with the establishment of the  German-Singapore Economic Forum we have managed to take another  concrete step toward implementing the Federal Government's Asia  concept. It is our response to the great and constantly  increasing importance of the Asian region in the international  economy. The task of the forum is to bring together companies  from Germany and Singapore with similar interests in a direct  and pragmatic way and to make good use of joint opportunities.    I note with pleasure that two projects have been signed  today. The German laender are also open toward our idea of  cooperation, in particular with regard to the PRC. Only  recently did a delegation of entrepreneurs, headed by the  Bavarian economics minister and accompanied by an official  representative of Singapore, visit a Chinese partner province.  A delegation from Baden-Wuerttemberg will soon visit two  industrial parks in China, which have been planned by Singapore.    In this connection I would also like to mention that we  expect Chinese Premier Li Peng to visit in a few weeks. It is  our intention to contribute to having the important role of this  important country in the Asian region meet with more attention  and understanding both in the fields of economy and trade and in  international politics in general.    Today I expect the visit of the mayor of Shanghai and in a  few days the mayor or the representative of Guangzhou. I  consider these intensive talks and contacts very important to  gradually deepen political cooperation.    Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister, your country is enjoying an  excellent reputation as a dynamic economic center in the Asian  region. German companies have long valued this fact. Nowhere  else in the aspiring markets in Southeast Asia are there more  subsidiaries and representations of German companies than in  Singapore. In many cases, they already fulfill supraregional  business tasks. This is also a good basis for success in the  work of the German-Singapore Economic Forum.    Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to express once again my  pleasure at your visit. From our friendly personal relationship  I derive the certainty that we will continue this good  cooperation in the future. If a problem were to arise at some  time, or some matter were not to proceed as intended, we have  agreed, Mr. Prime Minister, not to wait long but to contribute  toward a quick solution in a personal talk.

It is customary that such a  conference is held in the country that at the moment chairs the  G-7; however, this time the conference will be held in Poland.  It will be the first conference of the economic ministers of  the ""seven"" and states implementing reforms in a postsocialist  country. [passage omitted]    [Kujawska] Last year's balance of foreign trade ended up in  a deficit. What is your evaluation of this phenomenon?    [Podkanski] I believe that, at this point, we should  separate two issues: foreign trade and the evaluation of its  results, and the broadly understood transformations and social  costs related to them. As far as Poland is concerned, 1993 was  very unfavorable to the balance of foreign trade, which amounted  to $2.3 billion. There were many reasons for this, both  internal and external. The latter are related to the recession  in the world.    Right now, our economy needs capital and supply investments.    There is also the problem of fiscal instruments that would  regulate the economy in 1993. Until August 1993, the  exchange-rate policy favored imports rather than exports because  the rate of devaluation of the zloty was clearly slower than the  devaluation rate of the U.S. dollar or the German mark, and even  than the scale of inflation in Poland. Apart from all this,  there were various external issues, linked to the difficult  situation of most medium-sized and small companies and difficult  access to commercial and operating credits. Adding to these  problems was the issue of the so-called infrastructure of  exports--guarantees, guarantees of insurances, promotion. I  believe it is necessary to create a uniform, coherent, and clear  system of promotion, which we strive to establish.    These are also experiences we want to share with our  partners  of G-7 and E-10.    [Kujawska] What are the relations between Poland and its  southern neighbors, who are participants in this conference?    [Podkanski] I would like to stress strongly that, even  though the signature of the agreement on free trade within the  Visegrad Group last year did not yield any spectacular results  in the form of an increase in the trade volume, we can still  state with satisfaction that this agreement curbed the rate of  decrease in cooperation, including a commercial exchange, which  has been observed since 1991. This goes for both the exchange  of commodities and the disappearance of so-called investment and  cooperation links, which was a natural reaction at the moment of  passing to free-market settlements. I believe that today all of  the states will agree to pass to the free-market system, and  that the rules of the game of the free market should go hand in  hand with the ability to take advantage of the technical,  technological, and production potentials that are possessed.  They should also go hand in hand with the presentation of a  commodity offer that would take into account the balance of the  possibilities and needs of the markets of our neighbors. The  commodity exchange with our neighbors is favorable--for example,  because of lower transportation costs. This supports the  argument that we should first seek contact with our neighbors,  and only then across the ocean.    There is no doubt, however, that there are areas and  industry  branches that may find partners across the ocean as well--in  South America, in Brazil, for instance. Recently, in talks with  a delegation of this state, we found many very interesting  undertakings that may be very important to both states in the  future; one of them is the proposal made by Brazilian investors  concerning Polish transshipment ports--for example, for  Brazilian iron ore, which might be shipped from Polish ports to  the Visegrad Group states. Thus, in this way, we are trying to  facilitate the implementation of goals that G-7 and E-10 are  also trying to achieve.    [Kujawska] The conference is to serve all its participants  who, in practice, are partners with each other. What would you,  as the Polish foreign economic cooperation minister, like to  achieve during this meeting?    [Podkanski] I would like to achieve three goals. The first  one concerns full and genuine knowledge about the desires and  capabilities of our foreign partners as far as investing in  Poland is concerned. On the other hand, we would like to present  Poland, taking into account its geographic location, as a state  in which it is advisable and in which it pays to invest money.  I would also like our potential investors to see their chance  to participate in ownership transformations that are going on in  our country. Also, I would like them to see their chance in  linking their interests to Polish investors--for example, in the  privatization process. I also believe that the conference in  Warsaw will help the other E-10 states attain the same goals.    I also want to make our partners realize that the aim of  Polish privatization is changing not the owner but the economic  situation, reconstruction, and the modernization of Polish  industry. This is important because of the fact that the road to  membership in the European Union will be long and winding.  However, these are all inevitable processes.    A separate issue is a thorough and solid evaluation of trade  development prospects in Europe and the world, as well as  Poland's participation in the international division of labor  and in the trade turnover of the E-10 states; the evaluation  should also take into account the rules of the game laid out in  the Final Act of the Uruguay Round and the recently established  World Trade Organization. It is a matter of shaping new  principles and new rules, as well as a new system of world  trade. Such a meeting right now supplies the answer to any  doubts and questions concerning Poland's activeness in this  process and our joining the international structures. I would  like to be certain after this meeting that there is a joint  desire, a desire to cooperate, as well as to know where the  common interests are concentrated; I would also like to know  what the possibilities of providing systematic solutions to the  various problems are, through appropriate legal, organizational,  and financial solutions. There is no doubt that there are great  differences in the scale of development that has been  accomplished in individual states.    [Kujawska] The Warsaw conference is the third one. At each  of them, certain decisions were made. Have they been  implemented, and how have the interested states benefited from  them?    [Podkanski] It will be the third meeting. However, it cannot  be compared to any of the other meetings because each of them  was very special; each of them had different values and  contents, and, mainly, the range of problems was different. The  present conference is the richest as far as its form and  contents are concerned.    At the request of the Polish party, a meeting of the  presidents of foreign investment agencies of the E-10 states was  organized; it was held during the deputy ministerial session in  March of this year.    There will also be an East-West business forum and a  traditional ""roundtable"" for the ministers and business  representatives of each state. The earlier meetings were some  kind of inspiration and a proposal; the list of members and  participants is still being extended. At the Tokyo meeting, it  was decided that small and medium-size business in the E-10  states must be supported. After the meeting, the Japanese  Government allocated some money for the model restructurization  of one of the Polish state-run enterprises of the  machine-building industry. This is supposed to help work out a  model of proceedings that can be used in other countries. As I  see it, this is most valuable because it serves to shape the  awareness of those who are in power. Also, a model of  cooperation between countries as well as principles of providing  aid should be worked out. The Japanese Government is already  prepared to consider the possibility of granting interesting  credits to Poland--this is the information I received when Sejm  Speaker Jozef Oleksy returned from Japan. This would be, then,  a result of the previous visit. [passage omitted]     "

Yeltsin for the Russian Federation and by  J.-L. Dehaene for the Kingdom of Belgium]    [Text] The Russian Federation and the Kingdom of Belgium  henceforth referred to as the contracting parties,    relying on the bond of friendship and cooperation between  their peoples, the mutual trust and adherence to the common  values of freedom, democracy, justice and solidarity,    assuming that the Russian Federation is the successor state  of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,    believing that the historical changes taking place in Europe  have opened prospects for creation of a fair and strong order on  the European continent, based on a respect for international  law, the United Nations Organization Charter, human rights and  basic freedoms in accordance with the Helsinki Concluding Act,  the Paris Charter for a New Europe, the Helsinki document of  1992, ""Challenge of the Time of Change,"" and other documents of  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),    emphasizing the need for ensuring security and stability in  building a new Europe and striving to aid in this effort,    have come to agreement on the following:    Article 1    The contracting parties have decided to give their bilateral  relations a new quality of accord and partnership.    The contracting parties shall develop their relations as  friendly states on the basis of equal rights, respect for  sovereignty and political independence of both states, mutual  adherence to the principles of freedom, democracy, supremacy of  law and human rights, as well as the adherence to the letter and  the spirit of the Paris Charter for a New Europe, the Helsinki  document of 1992, ""Challenge of the Time of Change,"" and other  CSCE documents.    This new quality of accord and partnership, based on the  decisiveness of the contracting parties to overcome the  consequences of the division of Europe into opposing blocks,  will find its expression in all spheres of bilateral relations.    Article 2    The contracting parties shall use all the means at their  disposal to promote a strengthening of the authority, role and  effectiveness of the United Nations organization, as well as the  full respect of the UN Charter by all member states.    The contracting parties affirm their unconditional adherence  to the principles of peaceful regulation of disputes contained  in the UN Charter.    The contracting parties shall actively aid in the  realization  of effective actions in the sphere of preventive diplomacy.    Article 3    The contracting parties affirm the decisive role which the  CSCE may play in the cause of strengthening stability and  security in Europe, and emphasize the principle importance of  the statutes of the Helsinki Concluding Act, the Paris Charter  for a New Europe, the Helsinki document of 1992, ""Challenge of  the Time of Change,"" as well as other CSCE documents.    The contracting parties shall facilitate the strengthening  of  the CSCE for purposes of ensuring the guarantees of human  rights, democracy and the legal state, and preventing and  regulating disputes by peaceful means.    The contracting parties ascribe particular importance to  strengthening the capacity of the CSCE for actions in the  spheres of preventive diplomacy and regulation of conflicts.    Article 4    The contracting parties concur in the fact that security and  stability must be based on dialogue, partnership and  cooperation, as well as on the practical realization of the  principle of defense adequacy. They believe that a peaceful  order in Europe presupposes, on the basis of adherence to the  concluded treaties, a full implementation of the Treaty on OVSE  [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe], a continuation of efforts  toward reduction and control of arms and armed forces, a  development of measures of trust aimed at guaranteeing security  and stability on the continent, as well as the nonproliferation  of mass destruction weapons.    The contracting parties affirm their adherence to the 1968  Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the directives  coordinated by the group of countries who are suppliers of  nuclear materials, and the 1993 Convention on Banning the  Development, Production, Stockpiling and Application of Chemical  Weapons and Their Destruction, and will take necessary measures  toward excluding the transfer of materials, technologies or  equipment of nuclear weapons or other types of mass destruction  weapons in these countries to other countries.    Article 5    The contracting parties acknowledge the important role of  the  European Union, as well as the significant contribution of  international economic and financial organizations in the  balanced development of the world economy and in the political  and economic development of Europe.    The contracting parties believe that the success of reforms,  the transition to a market economy and the integration of Russia  into the world economy are facilitated by its rapprochement with  the European Union, specifically by means of conclusion of the  appropriate treaties between them, such as the treaty on  partnership and cooperation.    The contracting parties support efforts on cooperation  within  the framework of the Council of Europe. They acknowledge, in  particular, the importance of programs aimed at the development  of law and the strengthening of democratic institutions.    Article 6    The contracting parties are stepping up bilateral meetings  at  the appropriate level--political as well as  expert-technical--along with regular contacts in the course of  various meetings on a multilateral level and within the  framework of the European Union. All the questions which are of  mutual interest will be discussed at these meetings.    The contracting parties shall promote the implementation of  regular consultations on current questions at the level of the  Ministries of Foreign Affairs.    Article 7    The contracting parties believe it is important to develop  contacts and exchanges of information in the military sphere. In  this context, they provide for visits of military delegations at  various levels and exchanges of opinions.    For this purpose, they are compiling bilateral programs of  military contacts.    Article 8    The contracting parties shall cooperate in the humanitarian  sphere, giving first priority importance to maintaining  generally accepted standards of democracy and human rights,  specifically for the purpose of promoting the activity of  charitable organizations. If necessary, they will reach  administrative agreements with local authorities in order to  facilitate actions in extraordinary circumstances.    The contracting parties shall cooperate in clarifying the  fates of their citizens who, in connection with various  circumstances, find themselves on the territory of the other  contracting party, or who are missing there. Within this  framework, they conclude agreements for the purpose of allowing  the investigators of the other party access to archives which  might contain information on the above-mentioned citizens.    The contracting parties shall cooperate in the sphere of  return of archives.    Article 9    The contracting parties believe that such fields as culture,  education, professional training, public health and scientific  research are one of the important spheres of their cooperation.    With these spheres, which are within the competency of the  Communities and Regions of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Russian  Federation is ready to conclude the appropriate treaties and  agreements with the above-mentioned communities and regions,  according to the constitutional and legislative directives which  are in effect in both countries.    Article 10    The contracting parties stress the importance of better  mutual familiarization with each other's legal systems.    The contracting parties shall promote cooperation between  the  institutions of justice and the law enforcement agencies of both  states, including mutual legal assistance in civil and criminal  cases and cooperation in the struggle against crime, unlawful  circulation of narcotics and psychotropic substances, terrorist  acts of an international character and contraband, including the  unlawful transport of cultural valuables over the border.    The Belgian side will have a favorable attitude toward the  Russian Federation and will render it assistance in joining in  treaties on cooperation in the sphere of the struggle against  crime concluded by the Council of Europe member states.    Article 11    Without infringing upon the competencies of the subjects of  the Russian Federation and the Communities and Regions of the  Kingdom of Belgium in the sphere of international cooperation,  the contracting parties shall facilitate the enhancement of  mutual cooperation in the sphere of economics, energetics,  transport, communications, finance and agriculture, ascribing  particular importance to development of programs for advanced  training of workers at enterprises and financial organizations.    As necessary, the competent authorities of the contracting  parties shall develop new programs of cooperation, primarily in  such spheres as the agroindustrial complex, privatization,  financial services and banking, the trade network,  communications, informatics, transport, energetics, application  of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and specifically nuclear  safety and the processing of military fissionable materials for  their application for civilian purposes.    In this context, the contracting parties believe that the  activity of the Mixed Commission on Economic Cooperation Between  Russia and the Belgium-Luxemburg Economic Union (BLEU) must be  adapted to the new situation which is being formed in connection  with the transition of the Russian Federation to the market  economy.    The contracting parties shall aid in the creation of  favorable conditions for establishing direct relations and  activity of enterprises and other legal persons, encouraging and  protecting capital investments, and developing exchanges of  economic information.    They shall renew the existing legal documents, increase  their  effectiveness and develop new ones which will be adapted to the  new economic and juridical situation in the Russian Federation.    Article 12    The competent authorities of the contracting parties shall  aid in expanding and enhancing cooperation in the spheres of  science, technology, space research and environmental protection  for the purposes of using the achievements of modern science and  technologies for peaceful purposes. They encourage scientific  exchanges and the implementation of joint projects.    Article 13    The contracting parties promise to hold consultations on  disputed questions, which may be raised by each of the  contracting parties in regard to the financial and material  aspects of the property and interests of individuals and legal  persons of both countries.    Article 14    The contracting parties shall ensure, on the basis of  reciprocity, conditions for the normal activity of diplomatic  and consular institutions, as well as other official  representations of the other party.    For purposes of specifying responsibilities within the  framework of the CSCE regarding the freedom of movement and  transit for all citizens of the contracting parties on their  territories, they will take into consideration these obligations  for concluding the necessary bilateral agreements in accordance  with international treaties already concluded by each of the  parties in this sphere.    Article 15    The present treaty in no way alters the obligations which  bind the contracting parties in accordance with other treaties  in which they are participants. They in no way affect the  obligations of the contracting parties in regard to third  countries and are not directed against any of them.    Article 16    Each of the contracting parties shall notify the other party  upon completion of procedures provided by its legislation for  implementation of the present treaty. The present treaty shall  become effective 30 days after receipt of such notification.    The present treaty is concluded for a term of 5 years. Upon  tacit approval, its effect shall be extended for each subsequent  period of two years, provided neither of the parties gives  written notification to the other 6 months prior to expiration  of the appropriate term of effectiveness, stating its decision  to denounce the treaty.

The symposium, sponsored by the Pacific Economic Cooperation  Council (PECK), closed here Friday [18 March] in Beijing.    During the two-day meeting, Chinese energy officials  introduced the state plans to develop the country's energy and  minerals industries.    They noted that the demand for energy and minerals will soar  by the end of the century.    They said the government encourages domestic enterprises to  tap foreign funds, technology and management to ease current and  predicted shortages.    In China, the annual demand for coal in 1995 is estimated to  reach 1.23 billion tons and hit 1.4 billion tons by the year  2000.    To meet the burgeoning demand, China will pump 200 billion  yuan in the coming years to build 20 energy bases and 15 key  mines, said Fan Weitang, vice minister of coal industry.    About 19 major projects, including 14 mine-mouth power  plants  and three coal mines, are being offered for development with  foreign investment.    The ministry also is considering the construction of a  300-km  pipeline for transporting coal from Yuxian County in Shanxi  Province to Weifang, Shandong Province.    Some U.S. firms have shown interest in investing in this  project.    Also, China is planning to produce 100 to 120 million tons  of  steel by the turn of the century.     "

At a conference in Vientiane yesterday, senior members of  the  Lao government spelt out a range of incentives to attract  foreign investment. They include foreign investment laws;  customs and taxation; flexible rules and regulations; and a  number of bilateral Lao-Thai economic and investment agreements,  such as agreements on trade and on investment promotion and  protection, as a basic guarantor to Thai investors.    While they expressed a strong desire to develop the  country's  natural resources to improve its ailing economy, they repeatedly  stressed that Laos' arts and culture, ecology and environment  will remain intact and well preserved.    The calls were made yesterday during a conference in  Vientiane on ""The Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge: Economic and  Investment Prospects in the Lao PDR"" which was organized by THE  NATION ahead of the official opening of the Mittraphap bridge  early next month. Lao PM's Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon  inaugurated the conference while Thai Deputy Prime Minister  Amnuai Wirawan gave a keynote speech on prospects for Lao-Thai  economic cooperation.    Phao said his country of 4.4 million people is full of  natural resources, and has stable political and social systems,  which are conducive for foreign investment. He called on Thai  business people to probe Laos' economic potential, especially in  the fields of agriculture and forestry, industry and services  for local and external needs. Laos' new market-oriented economic  policy, he said, has received full support from the private and  government sectors of friendly nations, especially Thailand  which ""has warmly extended its assistance and cooperation"" to  Laos.    Amnuai warned Thai businessmen and investors not to exploit  the resources in Laos or other neighboring countries for  short-term gains. He said traders and investors should always  bear in mind the ""philosophy of cooperation,"" which purports  ""mutual benefits"" and ""fairness in profit sharing"" with host  countries. He said the cooperation should provide ""sufficient  economic returns"" to host countries including the transfer of  technology and management know-how so that they will eventually  stand on their own feet.    Lao-Thai cooperation will contribute and lead to broader  sub-regional and regional economic cooperation, which is  developing under the structure of the four northern Mekong-rim  countries in the Quadrangle Economic Cooperation and the  Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Amnuai said.    He said he believed the opening of the Lao-Thai Friendship  Bridge across the Mekong River by His Majesty the King on April  8 will set a new era of bilateral relations and cooperation.    About 250 people attended the conference yesterday at the  Lan  Xang Hotel, including 140 Thai businessmen and investors, about  30 representatives of the Lao private sector and officials from  various key Laos economic ministries.    Among the Lao delegates were six deputy ministers from key  economic ministries and offices who gave a broader perspective  of Laos' economic and investment potential and outlined national  foreign investment laws, incentives, rules and regulations.    Somphong Mongkhonvilai, vice president of the National  Committee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC), discussed Laos'  economic development plan towards the year 2000, while another  CPC vice president Leuan Sombounkhan talked about national  foreign investment policies.    Somphong said the new eight-year economic development plan  was implemented in February 1993 with the objective of boosting  the country's financial capital by developing its own natural  resources in the fields of minerals, hydropower, tourism,  agriculture and forestry, husbandry and human resources.    Rural development has been the government's priority in  order  to bridge the economic disparity and to distribute wealth to  provide better living conditions and standards around the  country, he said. Vientiane has set an economic growth target of  7-8 per cent annually.    Leuan said Laos is open to investors from around the world,  but that Thailand has an advantage due to its territorial  proximity and racial and cultural similarities.    He acknowledged several shortcomings that have hindered  economic growth, such as a shortage of capital markets,  manpower, lack of economic expertise and technology, and poor  management systems.    He described in detail an 11-point incentive program, which  Vientiane has introduced to attract prospective investors. They  include opening investment in all economic fields including  human resources in the fields of academia, education and  culture; protecting against nationalization; three different  forms of investment, from contract agreements to joint ventures,  or 100 percent foreign investment; full repatriation of personal  and corporate assets; freedom from government intervention in  investments; recruitment of foreign labor and human resources;  repatriation of profits; and a certain period of relaxation of  income and profit taxes and the establishment of a ""one-stop  service"" to facilitate investments.    Four other Lao ministers gave a good perspective of  investment in Laos. They stressed that Vientiane has pursued an  economic policy of sustainable development for mutual benefits  with the aim of protecting its culture, social structure,  environment and ecology.     "

Why?    [Ciller] We have a problem of internal terrorism, and I will  neither permit nor tolerate its continuing. We are the only  secular democratic state in the Muslim world. We have invested  more than 50 years in securing these achievements, and I do not  plan to allow those who murder women and children to spoil  things for us.    [Peri] You have already pointed to the common enemy:  Hizballah.    [Ciller] Definitely. Hizballah not only threatens Israel's  security but also that of Turkey. It is a real problem. I am  opposed to terrorism in the name of fundamentalism, and  Hizballah operates under that slogan.    [Peri] As the prime minister of a Muslim state, did you not  have reservations about announcing publicly that you are  interested in intelligence, security, and strategic cooperation  with Israel? Your neighboring states follow your every word.    [Ciller] I do not care. I am very interested in any form of  cooperation between us to uproot terrorism by Hizballah and  others. I am against anybody who tries to harm stability and  quiet. I do not care if they know that Israel and Turkey are  cooperating against Hizballah.    [Peri] What kind of strategic cooperation are you  considering?    [Ciller] In intelligence and security, and in any other  field in which there can be cooperation between professional and  experienced institutions and organizations.    [Peri] With your permission, let us try to analyze President  al-Asad's possible reaction to your remarks. Israel complains  about Syria's aid to Hizballah, and you are now in fact  proposing Israeli-Turkish cooperation against Syria.    [Ciller] I definitely support the peace process and good  relations with Israel. We are interested in assisting in the  process. In my view, Syria is a key state in the process. The  key to progress in the negotiations lies with al-Asad. That is  why we must find a way to make it attractive to him and convince  him that real peace pays.    The Syrians, however, abet terror in Turkey, and they also  bother you. We, for our part, are willing to do anything to  encourage Syria to take the path of peace. I get the impression  that Israel does not need to be encouraged in this.    I suggest bilateral strategic cooperation. With your  experience and expertise, it pays us to look for common points  and pool our resources.    [Peri] I am sure that Tehran is also interested in the plans  for Israeli-Turkish intelligence cooperation. You have a large  Iranian Embassy here. Have you tried to send out feelers about  a dialogue with Israel?    [Ciller] I do not believe I or my government should act as  an intermediary between Israel and Iran, unless both sides ask  for it.    [Peri] Do you actually conduct a dialogue with the Iranians  in Ankara? Do they not have reservations about the fact that a  woman is prime minister?    [Ciller] The main thing is that they do not interfere with  us. We have 24 ethnic groups in Turkey, and the terrorists  murder my citizens in cold blood. I am not prepared to accept  such despicable murders.    I will tell you something: Before each action, the  terrorists make sure they rid the area of journalists so that  there will be no witnesses or proof of their deeds. That was  the case in southeast Anatolia. They want to take over by force  and chip away chunks of Turkey for themselves, and they threaten  to murder the women and children of those who hinder them.    [Peri] And if you are prevented from selling water to  Israel?    [Ciller] I tell you: I will do whatever I decide with our  water. We have the water sources, and we will sell water to  whomever we like. Nobody will decide for me or dictate to me to  whom to sell our water. I am not prepared to accept threats.    We will sell water to Israel, and we are also prepared for  activity with Israeli antiterror experts.    [Peri] You are most likely following the reservations our  decisionmakers are having about President al-Asad. Israel does  not know what he really meant when he said ""peace."" Do you  understand us?    [Ciller] Definitely. I believe Syria could have helped in  the struggle against terrorism, but it prefers not to. What I  have just said is an understatement. I know that you complain  about precisely the same thing. The solution will be found when  we manage to convince al-Asad that he will be better off without  terrorism and that he will lose if he does not cooperate.  [passage omitted]     "

This document is the second step in  the development of relations between the two republics.    President of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaymiyev signed an  agreement  on trade and economic cooperation during his visit to the Crimea  last summer. Tataria had made commitments to supply oil, oil  products, petrochemicals, and in exchange, the Crimea -- to  provide wines, fruits and vegetables, and accommodation in its  sanatoriums.    During the Kazan meetings issues concerning the fulfilment  of  the 1993 agreement were discussed, and possibilities of the  further development of economic, scientific and technical,  cultural and humanitarian cooperation between state, public,  national and scientific establishments were spelled out, the  communique stated. According to the document, bilateral  relations will be built on principles of equal rights, respect  for human rights and partnership. It is planned to set up trade  and economic and cultural centres in Kazan and Simferopol.    The political significance of the treaty and a package of  inter- governmental agreements between the Russian Federation  and Tataria was noted at the meetings. The two sides emphasised  that all disputed and knotty issues of state construction must  be resolved through negotiations.    The visit to Tataria by a Crimean delegation headed by  President Yuriy Meshkov is going on. The Crimeans are  familiarizing themselves with the capital of Tataria and its  outskirts.     "

However, the former dean of the Komensky University  Law School and later minister of foreign affairs in Meciar's  government is a level-headed person and untruths, as is evident,  do not upset him.    [Rajecky] Mr. Prime Minister, although only a few weeks have  gone by since you assumed your position as prime minister, can  you tell us how you would evaluate the activity of the present  government thus far, and what are, in your opinion, its greatest  difficulties?    [Moravcik] Little more than one month is really a very short  time to evaluate successes and failures. However, we created  such conditions that will enable us to be successful and realize  our announced governmental program. As an example, I could  mention our successful negotiations with the IMF. A very  favorable international climate has been created which the  Slovak government could utilize for Slovakia's benefit. We are  pleased that it is clear from the reaction of many citizens that  at last a calm atmosphere reigns in our country. And what things  did not work out? First of all, so far we have not succeeded in  coming to an agreement on the funding of social programs. We are  now looking for ways to make a correction in the budget, so that  we do not keep increasing the deficit, but at the same time can  free up a sufficient amount of money that would enable us to  save primarily health care and education from collapse.    [Rajecky] The opposition accuses you, among other things,  that by giving too many concessions to the Czech partner you are  ruining everything that the previous government fought for and  gained for Slovakia. According to some, it is even quite  possible that you are endeavoring to restore the federation....    [Moravcik] That is a very fallacious view on the part of the  opposition. As far as relations with the Czech Republic are  concerned, we have ideas on many issues about possible  compromises that could give the impression that we are too  accommodating. But matters must be judged from the viewpoint of  their long-term impact and final results. Therefore, in this  respect I consider the course of action the present government  has taken prudent, consistently ensuring the realization of our  goals. And as to the notion that we are endeavoring to establish  a new federation--I believe that neither side takes the renewal  of the federation into consideration. The creation of some kind  of union would not bring the desired results either. But I would  like to emphasize that I consider that idea an historically  wasted opportunity. When the state was being split up, we could  have, in my opinion, created a union and the disintegration of  the federation did not have to happen.    [Rajecky] At present there is quite a lot of talk about the  unresolved questions of the borders, division of former federal  property, gold, and, most recently, certificates. Don't you  think that some decisions of the Slovak Government, for example,  precisely about certificates, could have an adverse effect on  mutual relations?    [Moravcik] All the difficulties you mentioned have their  specific, individual character. We could divide them into two  groups--problems which remain from the time of the federation,  and those which concern our future relations. I do not think  that it is necessary to give a lot of attention to the first  group. The second group is of more importance to us, especially  as far as the certificates and the customs union are concerned,  where, by the way, very close connections exist, because that  cooperation also has its political aspects, even though the  economic ones are dominant. What is important is that both sides  have a political interest in maintaining mutual cooperation and  mutual linkages minimally at the present level. But I do not  rule out the possibility that we could have a situation where  one side comes to the conclusion that cooperation in its present  form is not to its advantage. Then we would have to look for  other solutions. But I would not consider it a tragedy in any  case, and for less a possibility that it would lead to a  worsening of our mutual relations.    [Rajecky] There is a lot of work to do, and you do not have  much time in which to realize your goals. Nevertheless--are you  not planning a meeting with your Czech counterpart, Vaclav  Klaus, in the near future?    [Moravcik] It is incumbent on politicians to meet with their  foreign partners whenever it is useful. But I have to say that a  meeting with Prime Minister Klaus is not being planned for the  immediate future.    [Rajecky] You are said to be a reasonable, thoughtful, and  hard-working person. Are you not upset, therefore, by some of  the accusations leveled at you, for example, that while prime  minister you became chairman of a new political party, which  broke the coalition agreements, as the chairman of the Party of  Democratic Left [SDL], Peter Weiss, asserted?    [Moravcik] If criticism is based on truthful arguments, it  cannot upset me. But I admit that not even unsubstantiated  criticism upsets me, although in Slovakia there is more of it  than of the justified kind. It demonstrates the fact that  political culture here is not always of the optimal level. As  far as my chairmanship of the Slovak Democratic Union [DEUS] is  concerned, Petr Weiss and I have already cleared the entire  matter up between us. He appreciated the fact that it says in  our bylaws that if the chairman of DEUS is named to a government  position his function is perfomed by a statutory deputy.    [Rajecky] The opposition also criticizes you for the fact  that although the main task of your government was to lead the  country to early parliamentary elections, your plans extend well  beyond the pre-election period. Do you expect, then, that your  government will be here even after the fall elections?    [Moravcik] The measures that are adopted always must be of a  long-term character. After all, not even laws are passed for  just six months, but for four years, even decades. From this  viewpoint, it would be very wrong if we were to concentrate only  on the period before the early elections. And as to the duration  of our mandate? That, after all, will not be decided by the  opposition. We have a constitutional mandate and responsibility  for executive power. We are not responsible to the opposition  but to all the citizens of Slovakia.    [Rajecky] Let's go back to the international issues. There  has been a lot of talk lately about the possibility that you  will meet with the Hungarian prime minister, but you are said to  have laid down conditions that are unacceptable to the  Hungarians. At the same time, the solution of the ""Hungarian""  issue is vitally important for SR....    [Moravcik] ...both sides insist that they are ready to talk,  but so far a meeting has not taken place. But the truth is that  only an unofficial meeting is under consideration, because  official contacts should always produce some concrete result,  some concrete document. I admit--such is not ready. But in any  case, even an unofficial meeting has its value, because at the  very least it provides opportunity for an exchange views and  mutual consultations. At this time we are interested in an  informal meeting with the Hungarian side.    [Rajecky] Isn't it something of a speculation on your part,  that since there will be elections in Hungary before long, you  would rather wait to negotiate with the new government?    [Moravcik] No, there is no speculation on our part. When it  comes to the solving of serious problems, the question of  elections really stays in the background. Hungary and Slovakia  have formulated the basic features of their foreign policy  concepts, and those do not change.    [Rajecky] In conclusion a question concerning your deputy  prime minister and party colleague, Roman Kovac. The opposition,  specifically the HZDS deputies' club in the SR National Council,  demands his removal. What do you think about the reasons they  give?    [Moravcik] They do not have concrete arguments, they use  only  general accusations. As I know the authors of these slanders,  they are capable of making up most anything.""     "

The decision to open liaison offices in the  respective capitals of Vietnam and the U.S. has been welcomed by  foreign business circle working in Hanoi. Mr. (?David Drinkerd),  an American businessman of the Digital Company, considered it a  correct and initial step for the normalization of the bilateral  relations. He said the establishment of representation offices  or embassies enables businessmen to have more information and  more convenient conditions to run a business. For his part, Mr.  (?John Lindon), director of an electronic company of Sweden in  Hanoi, held that the new development in Vietnamese-U.S.  relations created more favorable conditions for his company. He  also predicted that there would be more U.S. companies coming to  Vietnam, creating more market for his company's products.    Since the lifting of the embargo, Vietnam and the U.S. have  taken many concrete steps. According to the Vietnamese Foreign  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, bilateral talks so far have been  fruitful. By March 1994, 31 American companies were licensed to  set up representative offices in Vietnam, 21 in Hanoi and 10 in  Ho Chi Minh City.     "

The condition of the Soviet-type facilities is  alarming, Pierer said at the RWE [Rheinisch-Westfaelisches  Elektrizitaetswerk] ""Energy"" Workshop in Braunlage. The safety  standard is low and, in addition, the importance of safety is  judged differently than in Western Europe. In some places,  reactors are kept on line even though safety problems would  require a shutdown. In addition, spare parts are missing and  the operating crews are often unmotivated. Due to the  geographic closeness, the European neighbors must be interested  in improving the power plants, Pierer said.    A German-French alliance could form the core of a European  initiative -- for instance, together with the Swedes and the  Finnish -- in order to provide financial and technical ""help for  self-help"" to the CIS. Some nuclear power plants must be closed  down for good and, therefore, replacements must be established.  Pierer said that in this connection, he is primarily thinking  of the new construction of conventional gas power plants. In  Central and Eastern Europe, there are still 58 Soviet-type  nuclear power plants in operation at the moment, 15 of them are  of the Chernobyl type. The Siemens director estimates the costs  for reequipment at 12-14 billion German marks. However,  equipment for only 4 billion marks would have to be imported;  the large remaining part could come from CIS production.  [passage omitted]     "

0,FT931-15344 ,"FT931-15344 _AN-DAMCCAEJFT 930113   FT  13 JAN 93 / The world tries to end horror of poison gas: More than 100 nations have agreed to sign, but the ban on chemical weapons could go further      By DAVID WHITE   MORE THAN 90 years of efforts to eradicate poison gases as instruments of war culminate in a treaty being signed in Paris over the next three days. The first signatures will be put this afternoon to a convention outlawing the use, manufacture, storage and transfer of chemical arms. Under the Chemical Weapons Convention stockpiles and production facilities will be destroyed, and procedures set up to verify compliance and monitor production of chemicals that could potentially be used for weapons. By Friday it is expected that foreign ministers or their representatives from well over 100 countries will have signed. But the high profile given to the occasion cannot disguise the treaty's compromise nature. Officials in the UK, which sought tougher policing of the ban, admitted it would not provide a final answer to proliferation of chemical weapons. 'There are no final answers in this business,' they added. It will be at least 10 years before the world gets rid of stockpiles reckoned to include about 5m chemical munitions, and the convention will leave important gaps, at least initially. Most Arab governments are expected to boycott the Paris ceremony. Egypt, hosting an Arab League meeting on Monday, said there was a unanimous decision not to sign. It and other Arab nations have made their assent conditional on Israel's joining the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty; chemical weapons are seen as providing a counterweight to Israeli nuclear weapons. The US and other western governments hope Arab countries will eventually join. But this may have to await the outcome of the Middle East peace process. North Korea, another suspected possessor of chemical arms, is also expected to stay out of the treaty. The watering-down of verification rules is seen as another weakness. In 1984, then US Vice-President George Bush proposed a draft treaty subject to inspection 'any time, anywhere'. But in the later stages of negotiation the US took a very different stance, worried that the treaty might be used to pry into other secret military installations. The final text allows a country up to five days to negotiate terms before opening a site to inspectors. The treaty will not take effect until early 1995, assuming that at least 65 countries have ratified it by the middle of next year. However, western officials believe it will create a significant impediment to would-be proliferators. It will reinforce the controls which industrialised countries in the so-called Australia Group have been exercising over chemical exports, and provides for the destruction of all declared production facilities - including, most importantly, Russia's. The US and the then Soviet Union agreed in 1990 to stop making chemical weapons and scrap most of their holdings. The US is now discussing assistance to help Russia with the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) cost of destroying its 40,000-tonne stockpile. A number of countries alleged to possess chemical weapons are expected to join the treaty. These include Iran, Israel, China, India and Pakistan. The treaty caps 24 years of negotiation on a global ban, undertaken for the last 12 of those years in an ad hoc committee of the UN's 39-nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The impetus for concluding this notoriously tedious process came from the ending of the cold war, the flagrant use of chemicals during the Iran-Iraq war and the threatened use by Iraq in the 1991 Gulf conflict. Although Iraq will not be a signatory, destruction and inspection of its extensive facilities is being undertaken separately under UN resolutions. Early last year the talks appeared in danger of losing momentum if not completed quickly. Working from an Australian draft, negotiations were declared closed in August. A subsequent resolution supporting the treaty at the UN General Assembly was co-sponsored by 144 nations. It has taken the international community 67 years to extend the ban on the use of chemical weapons - the Geneva Protocol - to outlawing the weapons themselves. The only precedent for an outright ban of this kind is the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, but that failed to provide for verification. Verification, including challenge inspections without right of refusal, brought up the greatest problems in the talks, and occupies much of the 192-page document. Mr Ronald Lehman, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, argues that it is 'the most intrusive inspection regime ever established in an arms control agreement'. UK officials say that despite the compromises it should deter 'all but the most determined evaders'. An Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is to be set up in The Hague to oversee compliance. Each signatory will also have to set up an authority to deal with chemical producers and incoming inspections. Dr Tamar Posner, an expert at the UK Chemical Industries Association, estimates that preparation and training for inspections could cost producers Pounds 90,000 per inspection.

Tens of thousands have been killed, wounded,  or displaced in Yemen, north and south. U.S. political  pressure, aided and abetted by Arab regimes, is slowly but  surely wrecking Yemen's national sovereignty and wrenching its  land apart.    Keeping particular countries weak, in disgrace, and  dependent  upon foreign assistance is the hallmark of the policy the United  States has been vigorously pursuing in the region since the oil  [Gulf] war, a policy pursued even more adamantly in the southern  Gulf states.    The United States recently imposed humiliating terms on the  shaykhs of southern Gulf states, forcing their governments, not  particularly known for a firm political will, to end the  political and economic embargo of the Zionist,  Jerusalem-usurping entity.    Stripping Arab states in the southern Gulf region of  dignity,  integrity, and political will has become a trademark of U.S.  policy in that area. The corrupt regimes in Riyad and Cairo  support this policy, dragging along, willy nilly, Arab League  and Gulf Cooperation Council countries.    Seen from this angle, the U.S. position on the Yemeni crisis  is easily explained. The United States wants Yemen weak, poor,  divided, and, in both its parts, dependent upon foreign  assistance. This is the subservient state in which the United  States likes to keep most of the agent governments that do its  gambling in the Middle East.     "

It quoted him as saying Thursday, ""I'm grateful to hear of  Japan's commitment.""    In its Wednesday edition, a leading Japanese daily, the  ASAHI  SHIMBUN, quoted unidentified government officials as saying that  Japan has decided to ""commit itself"" to the regional forum after  the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect  on January 1.    Japan had been guarded in its support for EAEC, proposed by  Malaysia, because the United States, its major trading partner,  was against the idea, fearing it would be excluded.    Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed stayed away from  an informal summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum in Seattle in November.    Alatas said a ministerial meeting in Singapore last year of  the Association of Southeast [Asian] Nations (ASEAN) agreed to  include the EAEC in the APEC framework. ""So, the EAEC is not a  threat to the APEC,"" he said.    ASEAN had accepted the caucus as an economic consultative  forum, Alatas said, adding that APEC ""more or less"" agreed to  the East Asian forum.    Potential members of EAEC are the six ASEAN countries --  Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and  Thailand -- and China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.    APEC comprises these countries plus Australia, Canada,  Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the U.S.     "

By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      LONDON      When the leaders of the 34 nations of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) convene next Monday around a pale, oval-shaped  table in Kleber Center in Paris, it will mark the official end of the Cold War.    The summit meeting will also signal the start of the construction of a New  Europe -- with the heads of government playing a role not unlike their  predecessors at the 1815 Congress of Vienna, which reorganized the Continent  after the Napoleonic Wars.    The national boundaries redrawn at that historic, 19th-Century conference  basically stood for 40 years. And while next week's CSCE meeting has no such  sweeping brief, it does bring together in a harmonious mood former bitter  antagonists.    A centerpiece of the three-day summit will be the signing of an unprecedented  treaty sharply reducing conventional arms deployed in Europe by East and West  -- a goal believed hopelessly visionary not long ago.    And after the ceiling lights dim and the television crews pack up, a small new  CSCE Secretariat, probably based in Prague, will address itself to the  nitty-gritty implementation of the lofty goals that will be enunciated in  Paris.    These will include what some call a new Magna Carta, named for the 775-year-old  agreement between the English king and his subjects which served as the  foundation for democratic government.    ""We will be taking concrete steps afterward for the broad ideas the summit will  espouse,"" said U.S. Ambassador John J. Maresca, representative to the CSCE  Summit Preparatory Committee, which has been laboring in Vienna.    ""These involve a document stating a commitment to human rights as a basis for  government, free elections, and establishing a market system as the best way  toward economic prosperity.""    Toward that end -- in addition to the small CSCE secretariat of about 10  staffers -- officials will be manning a Conflict Prevention Center to stave off  regional quarrels (probably to be set up in Vienna); establishing a CSCE  mechanism to monitor national elections (probably in Warsaw); and setting up  regular consultations of the 34 foreign ministers, probably twice a year, as  well as summit meetings of the heads of government every other year.    The meeting is also expected to appoint a semi-permanent CSCE parliamentary  body, probably consisting of representatives from member nations' legislatures.    And in Vienna immediately afterward, a new round of CFE talks will begin, which  will attempt to reduce in a binding treaty the number of troops allowed in  Central Europe.    The CSCE is not without its critics: Some officials fear a premature push for a  CSCE that would take over military security responsibilities in Europe. Others  warn that a permanent CSCE organization runs the risk of becoming an impotent  ""talking shop,"" which will be unable to make fast and firm decisions.    The CSCE began life in Helsinki in 1972 when it was set up to deal with three  main areas or ""baskets"" of issues: military security, economic cooperation, and  human rights. There were 35 CSCE members then -- all the European states except  Albania, along with the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada. This year,  the number dropped to 34 with the unification of Germany.    The first CSCE agreement was the Helsinki Final Act signed in 1975 -- which  established so-called ""confidence-building measures"" between East and West, set  standards for human rights, and endorsed existing European boundaries. There  have been follow-up CSCE meetings, in Belgrade (1977-78), Madrid (1980-83), and  Stockholm (1984-86), but the Paris summit promises to be dramatically different  from all the others.

""We feel relieved and appreciate the efforts of the  Philippine Government, the Indonesia-Philippine Association and  all parties concerned to have the conference barred,"" Irawan  Abidin, information director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  said.    News agency reports from Manila had said the Quezon City  court Friday issued an order putting a 20-day hold on the  conference after receiving a petition from the  Indonesia-Philippine Association that described the conference  as a violation of a treaty binding member countries of ASEAN  (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).    The friendship association, which is headed by Jose Laurel,  member of a Philippine political group, charged that the holding  of the conference was a dangerous threat to the Philippines'  national security and interests.    It also said the planned conference could harm the friendly  relations among and The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations signed by the  Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand in 1976.    Under the Quezon City court order the rector of the  University of the Philippines where the conference was to take  place, will have to disallow the holding of the conference on  university premises for 20 days.    The conference was to open on May 31.    Abidin said the Indonesia-Philippine Association would  possibly make further efforts for the complete cancellation of  the conference or its relocation to another country.     "
0,FT933-2276 ,"FT933-2276 _AN-DITBZABXFT 930920   FT  20 SEP 93 / Former ministers face Iraq arms probe      By JIMMY BURNS   The arms-for-Iraq inquiry enters its most overtly political phase today when Mr Timothy Renton, former Foreign Office minister and chief government whip, becomes the first in a line of senior ministers to give evidence in public. He will be followed during the week by Mr David Mellor, who resigned from the cabinet last autumn in the midst of a row over his personal life, and by Mr William Waldegrave, who remains a serving minister. Lord Justice Scott and his abrasive counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale QC are likely to subject the ministers to a detailed grilling. Jimmy Burns looks at the evidence given so far and poses the questions that the politicians may face from the inquiry. Timothy Renton, Foreign Office minister from October 1985 to June 1987 Why did Sir Geoffrey Howe, the foreign secretary, take nearly a year to announce guidelines restricting arms exports to Iraq? Mr Renton's predecessor Sir Richard Luce told the inquiry he wanted the guidelines, which had been agreed secretly by ministers in November 1984, to be announced to the Commons. He had to accept the majority government view that the guidelines 'trickle out' before being announced in October 1985 when Mr Renton was in the post. What did you know about the Pounds 270m defence package Britain signed with Jordan in September 1985? Evidence to the inquiry suggests the government agreed to the package in spite of knowing that Jordan was being used as a route for military exports to Iraq. What was said at meetings in London held on December 4 1985 between government ministers - including the prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher - and Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister? Officially all Mr Aziz wanted, and apparently got, was an asurance that the UK would remain neutral in the Iran-Iraq war and sell no arms to Iran. But the Foreign Office was under pressure from other government departments to approve pending contracts with Iraq including one for a missile complex arranged by IMS, a defence company wholly owned by the Ministry of Defence. How did you apply the guidelines that the UK should not export defence equipment which would enhance the capability of either side to exacerbate the conflict? Mr Paul Channon, former trade secretary, said the MoD and the Foreign Office 'changed the rules as they went along'. William Waldegrave, Foreign Office minister from July 1988 to November 1990, currently minister for open government What did you know about the export of British machine tools to Iraq by companies such as Matrix-Churchill? In February 1989 Mr Waldegrave, together with other ministers, approved the export to Iraq by Matrix-Churchill of sophisticated lathe equipment which Whitehall knew could be used in the development of nuclear weapons. The Whitehall line was that intelligence on Iraq provided by Matrix-Churchill outweighed the potential nuclear threat, an argument that Mr Waldegrave seemed at one point to have shared. Last week Mr David Gore-Booth, a former senior Foreign Office official, suggested that the trade and defence ministries may have withheld intelligence information from Mr Waldgrave. When and how did you learn about the UK involvement in Iraq's supergun project? According to Mr Paul Henderson, a Matrix-Churchill executive, detailed intelligence about the project was sent to the Cabinet in October 1989. Yet six months later Mr Nicholas Ridley, the trade and industry secretary, told the House of Commons that the government had only recently become aware 'in general terms' of the project. David Mellor, Foreign Office minister from June 1987 to July 1988 What did you know about the export of British machine-tools to Iraq by companies such as Matrix-Churchill? During 1987 and 1988, Whitehall officials recommended the export of British machine-tools even though intelligence information suggested that the Iraqi factories for which they were destined were involved in making munitions, both nuclear and chemical. In January 1988 a Foreign Office official working under Mr Mellor recommended that because of the threatened UN arms embargo, British manufacturers 'should be warned of the falling guillotine and urged to produce as fast as they can'. At issue is whether the minister acquiesced in the apparent breach of the government's guidelines. What did you tell Iraqi president Saddam Hussein when you visited Baghdad on February 23 1988? Two days later the Iraqi government released Mr John Smith, a British businessman jailed on suspicion of spying. This was followed by a Foreign office announcement of a campaign for a world ban on arms sales to Iran. From Baghdad, Mr Mellor went to Jordan. What was ministerial policy towards countries suspected of being used as a conduit for arms to Iraq? In documents which were made available to the Scott inquiry Saudi Arabia is identified as a country 'known or suspected' of diverting sensitive defence-related equipment in 1987 and 1988.

[Correspondent] Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg  Petersen  said today at the news conference of the Nordic foreign  ministers' meeting in snow-covered Haga Castle that the EU is  now seriously discussing its relations with Croatia. The reason  is the alliance Croatia has formed with Serbia. There are UN  sanctions against Serbia, while Croatia has so far been treated  more or less uncritically in the international community.  [passage omitted]    Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas repeated the  threat which exists against the Croatian Government.    [Begin af Ugglas recording] There is permanently a latent  threat against Croatia, much depends on Croatia's conduct, to  tell the truth, to what extent the Croatian regular units are  active in Bosnia, to what extent new massacres can be  discovered; and I am of the opinion that it was useful that the  Danish foreign minister pointed out that the European Union  itself has possibilities because Croatia is very dependent on  trade opportunities and so on. And that shows that what we in  Sweden hope for, a stronger European cooperation, also gives  direct forcible means against aggressive warlords. [end  recording]    [Correspondent] With closer links with the EU, Sweden would  have better possibilities to act against Croatia, that seemed to  be Margaretha af Ugglas' conclusion. The good relations Germany  has with the Croatian government work against any talk about a  harder attitude toward Croatia.     "

The decision was made at the  agency's governing board meeting held in Kyoto with  representatives from 22 countries of the 24 member nations of  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  attending.    Russia has asked for IEA assistance in the field of energy  since last year.    Meeting participants agreed that the agency should draw up a  concrete program together with Russia in the form of a document,  although the paper will have no legal binding force.    The assistance will include providing energy conservation  technology, research and statistics methods regarding energy  supply and demand, and technology for developing alternative  energy sources, the sources said.    In addition, the participants discussed how IEA member  nations will share the financial burden of helping Russia with  nuclear power plant operations, which Russia has also requested,  the sources said.    They also agreed that the IEA and the OECD will continue to  cooperate in the area of technology development for global  environmental protection.    The IEA meeting is the first in 16 years Japan has hosted.  On Thursday, the Japanese Government and IEA will hold a  seminar to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the IEA's  inauguration.

0,FT934-2060 ,"FT934-2060 _AN-DLPC5AGTFT 931215   FT  15 DEC 93 / New deal to balance calls on aid      By DAVID BUCHAN      PARIS   Richer governments responsible for most of the flow of official aid to poorer countries yesterday came out with a new formula to balance traditional needs of the third world and newer aid demands from eastern Europe. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's development assistance committee said it was putting eight of the poorest Caucasian and central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union on its designated list of countries receiving official development aid. This would count towards the OECD governments' pledge to try to raise their aid budgets to 0.7 per cent of their national output. By contrast, the committee has decided to put central European countries, the Baltic states, Russia, and some relatively richer ex-Soviet republics such as Belarus and Ukraine on a separate list with some Gulf oil states which no longer count formally as official-aid recipients. Assistance to these countries would not count towards meeting the UN-approved 0.7 per cent target for OECD members' aid budgets. This compromise is a response to the worries of third world clients that aid flows will now be diverted to eastern Europe. So far, OECD officials said, there has been no diversion. Concessional official aid to the former Soviet bloc has been running at Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.3bn) a year since 1991, while soft-term official aid to the third world has stayed at around Dollars 60bn. Nor are central Europe, Russia, or western ex-Soviet republics likely to be penalised by the new categorisation, officials claimed.

THATCHER FACES HER TEST TODAY.      By RONE TEMPEST and WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      PARIS      French Prime Minister Michel Rocard, whose minority government faced loss of a  censure vote in the National Assembly that would have forced him to resign, won  last-minute support from moderate right-wing parties late Monday night to  survive the most serious challenge of his two years in office.    Rocard was the first of two key European heads of government threatened with  the embarrassing prospect of losing their jobs while a 34-nation summit of  world leaders, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, meets here  in Paris.    Today, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will be tested when  Conservative Party members of Parliament vote on a challenge to her party  leadership from former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine. If Thatcher loses,  she would have to step down from the prime minister's post she has held for  more than 11 years.    The last British leader to lose his post during an international meeting was  Prime Minister Winston Churchill during the Potsdam conference in 1945. Despite  the pressure, Thatcher was the picture of poise and confidence Monday morning  as she met with reporters at the British Embassy in Paris.    ""I most earnestly believe I shall be at No. 10 Downing at the end of this  week,"" she said, referring to the prime minister's official residence in  London.    Meanwhile, the short, combative French leader Rocard was being credited by  supporters with ""Churchillian"" courage as his minority Socialist Party  leadership overcame its ninth censure vote since it was installed after  parliamentary elections in 1988.    This time the challenge was based on opposition to a 1.1% income tax Rocard has  proposed as part of a reform of funding for Social Security programs.    Since the Socialists do not have an absolute majority in the 577-member  National Assembly, Rocard needed 17 votes or abstentions from other parties to  survive the censure vote. In the past, the Socialists had always been able to  count on the 26 Communist Party deputies in the Assembly to back them in  censure votes, the French equivalent of a parliamentary vote of confidence.    However, this time the Communists decided to vote for censure, forcing the  Socialists to find the needed votes among independents and members of center  and center-right parties. In the end, the Socialists survived the vote by  persuading six right-wing deputies, mostly from the French overseas  territories, to break ranks with their parties. The opposition mustered 284  votes, five short of the absolute majority needed.    Rocard, 60, never gave signs of losing confidence. ""I approach this vote with  serenity,"" he said. However, he gave a deep sigh of relief when National  Assembly Speaker Laurent Fabius read the vote results before the packed  Parliament.    If Rocard had lost the vote, French President Francois Mitterrand would have  had to appoint a new prime minister or call for new elections. Mitterrand has  been criticized for not giving longtime Socialist Party rival Rocard enough  support during the censure vote debate.    But the French president, 73, whose seven-year term will not expire until 1995,  is also known to dread the possibility of elections leading to a right-wing  opposition majority in Parliament, forcing him to install another so-called  cohabitation government like the one he shared with Gaullist Prime Minister  Jacques Chirac in 1986-1988.    Because he has been forced to govern without a majority, Rocard has been under  constant challenge since his appointment by Mitterrand two years ago.    Thatcher, however, is the longest-serving national leader among the 34 CSCE  member countries meeting in Paris. She became party leader when she deposed  Edward Heath in 1975, when the Conservatives were in opposition, and became  prime minister in 1979.    Unlike the opposition Labor Party, the Tory party rules provide for annual  elections to determine the party leader. And whoever is voted leader  traditionally becomes prime minister if the party is in power.    British public opinion polls published Sunday and Monday show Thatcher trailing  Heseltine -- among voters -- by a considerable margin.    However, Tuesday's balloting is restricted to the 372 Tory members of the House  of Commons.    In interviews Monday, the prime minister accused Heseltine of holding political  views indistinguishable from those of the Labor Party.    For his part, Heseltine contends that Thatcher is only lukewarm in supporting a  strong role for Britain within the European Community.    Asked at a press conference at the British Embassy here Monday if she would be  returning home to a new address, the prime minister said she expects to stay in  office.    Why is she so confident?    ""I have a marvelous team working with me,"" she replied. ""We are all confident.""    Is she under a strain?    ""Not in any way. I've been attending conferences like these for 11 1/2 years.

There is no one in  Iran who would want to or could take back that prescription.""      Criticism Expected    Rafsanjani's uncompromising response seems certain -- like Khomeini's original  condemnation -- to bring strong Western criticism of Tehran, and with it the  new Iranian leader appeared to signal that Iran has no immediate intentions of  repairing its relations with the West as it now has with the Soviet Union.    ""The West does not understand this question,"" Rafsanjani said, implicitly  contrasting the outrage in the West with the broad official silence of the  Soviet Union and most of its allies on the Rushdie affair. ""What Iran said was  according to the Sharia (Islamic law) . . . and not a personal opinion.    ""The entire Islamic world, in spite of some differences, is united in one voice  in approving that prescription.""    Most Muslims consider the novel to be blasphemous and object particularly to  its implication that the Koran is not the word of God but the creation of the  prophet Mohammed. Rushdie, who was born to Muslim parents in Bombay, India, but  now lives in Britain and no longer practices religion, is also accused of  apostasy for forsaking and attacking Islam.    Khomeini, in a statement issued in February as Muslims around the world  protested against the novel, declared: ""The author of the book 'Satanic  Verses,' which is against Islam, the Prophet and the Koran, and all those  involved in its publication who were aware of its content are sentenced to  death.""    Iranian clerics then offered a $5.2-million reward for Rushdie's execution, and  he has been in hiding ever since.    The sole candidate in the presidential election next month, Rafsanjani is  widely expected to emerge as Iran's top political leader, and his press  conference was one of his first opportunities since Khomeini's death June 3 to  lay out his views in an international forum.    Rafsanjani, asked about prospects for improved relations with the United  States, chronicled Washington's past ""offenses against the Iranian people"" over  the years, ending with the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which he described as the  latest of the U.S. ""plots and conspiracies"" against Iran.    ""For all these reasons, the Americans saw their position (in Iran) damaged,"" he  said, suggesting there would be no earlier improvement despite Khomeini's  death.      Praises Soviet Ties    In contrast, he praised the recent blossoming of the Soviet Union's relations  with Iran after a decade marked by severe strains, and he said his talks here  with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have justified Tehran's hope for a further  improvement.    ""New horizons are opening up,"" he said, speaking in Persian with his comments  translated into Russian by an official interpreter. ""We have almost reached all  of our goals for this visit, and we have taken some major steps in expanding  our bilateral ties.""    In addition to a series of agreements on economic and technical cooperation  that call for an expansion of trade and Soviet participation in Iran's  development program over the next decade, the two countries issued a broad  declaration Thursday pledging political and diplomatic cooperation and greater  cultural and religious contacts.    The Soviet Union also declared its readiness to help Iran ""strengthen its  defense capacity,"" and Rafsanjani indicated that Tehran's preference was mostly  for ""technological assistance"" that would build up the Iranian munitions  industry so that it could produce its own aircraft, missiles and electronic  equipment as well as artillery and armored vehicles.    Moscow was the principal arms supplier to Iraq during the war with Iran, and  its agreement to help rebuild the Iranian military marks an important shift in  the alliances of the region.    The welcome Rafsanjani received here was one that the Kremlin usually reserves  for the most respected heads of state, and it was clearly meant to celebrate  the dramatic improvement in Soviet-Iranian relations.    He invited Gorbachev to pay a visit to Iran, and the Soviet leader, thanking  him, said that Moscow looks forward to extensive contacts with Tehran at all  levels as their relations develop.      Afghanistan War Discussed    Rafsanjani said he and Gorbachev discussed the continuing war in Afghanistan,  which had been a major issue between the Soviet Union and Iran over the past  decade. With the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country last February, he  said, ""it is now up to the Afghan people themselves to settle things.    ""We, Pakistan, the Soviet Union and China must as neighboring countries help  the Afghan people to decide this Afghan problem,"" he added. Iran, he continued,  is discussing the situation with the Muslim rebels, the moujahedeen, some of  whom have been based in Iran, in the hope of promoting a political settlement.

At a time when  the coexistence of Czechs and Slovaks could have finally, after  decades of totalitarian government, reached its logical  outcome--a democratic arrangement of relationships between the  republics, but mostly among citizens--the coexistence came to an  end. At a time when the importance of borders in all of Europe  is diminishing and the integration of the countries of the  European Union is progressing ever further, a new border was  created along the Morava River.    A border, which no one needed. A border which, apart from a  handful of ambitious politicians and an evident minority of  nationalists, no one wanted. And despite the efforts of  individuals on both sides, the separation continued to be more  and more transformed into an alienation. Whereas elsewhere  borders are being changed into purely formal lines, for us this  border is becoming more and more of a barrier. An artificial and  nonsensical barrier which no one wants anymore and no one needs  and which no one is able to espouse.    On the contrary, more and more people are realizing the need  to overcome this artificial barrier or, better still, not to  permit it to grow to greater dimensions, as is unavoidably  necessary. Simple citizens engaged in travel, people from the  new near-border communities and regions, entrepreneurs, people  with relationships to the culture of the second nation,  television viewers and radio listeners, students, patients  undergoing therapy in the health facilities of the other  republic, people who live permanently on the territory of the  other republic, mixed marriages, etc.... All of these people  were not only surprised and saddened by the division of the  common state, but are experiencing specific practical problems.    Even though we cannot now eliminate the very essence and  main  cause of these problems, we should at least try to effect the  maximum mitigation of their consequences. Although many people  speak of overcoming artificial barriers, only a few are sincere  about it and even more rarely does someone actually do anything  about it. I am not now speaking of citizens and their efforts  and longings of small, but at the same time great attempts at  maintaining the Czecho-Slovak relationship. I have in mind those  who primarily brought the problem about--in other words,  politicians.    Seeing the unhappy situation and the lack of interest in  resolving it, the Democratic Party decided to act. In view of  its traditions, its membership, its basic values, it is  generally understandable that it is precisely this party as the  first among the Slovak political forces, which has come out with  a specific program of Czecho-Slovak cooperation, with specific  proposals to effect rapprochement between the Czech Republic and  the Slovak Republic.    We are proposing to effect an economic and social  transformation, utilizing all of the experiences of the Czech  Republic. We are proposing that membership in European  integrational structures be coordinated, that new legislation be  created, taking into account the legislation of the European  Union, as well as that progress be made in the fight against  international criminality. We desire for the republics to grant  citizens equal political rights (with the exception of elections  to parliament), an equal opportunity to study, equal medical  care, and, in the case of permanent residents, even equal social  security benefits, equal to those of the republic's own  citizens. We want to make available to citizens of the Czech  Republic who are longer-term residents in Slovakia the right to  participate in community elections. We propose supporting joint  cultural projects, the creation of a joint radio broadcast and a  joint television program or, at least, joint news broadcasts,  prepared by a joint news staff.    We are convinced that the alienation has now lasted  sufficiently long and that the time has come for a reciprocal  rapprochement. To that end, the Democratic Party is proposing a  specific way. It will not be an easy road and one without  problems. We shall not avoid being attacked and accused. But,  even so, it is worth it. History cannot be fooled. The  relationship between Czechs and Slovaks will never be a  relationship such as exists between two adjoining nations.    The impulse for the division originated with the Slovak  political representation. That is why the moves toward  rapprochement should originate with the Slovak side; at least we  should show good will. The best example of our interest in  drawing closer to the Czech Republic would be the showing of  appropriate respect for the day on which the first Czechoslovak  Republic came into being and proclaiming 28 October a holiday  for the Slovak Republic. If for no other reason than at least  because it is our duty toward our history and particularly  toward ourselves. Decent people become accustomed to fulfilling  their duties. Even we shall prove that we belong among decent  people. It will be of great significance for any future  rapprochement.     "

Hadas, who has the rank but not the  recognition of ambassador, is the first Israeli diplomat  accredited to the Holy See and his appointment is the result of  the agreement last December 30 for mutual recognition, but not  yet full official, diplomatic relations.    The visit by the Israeli diplomat, observers pointed out,  was  one of courtesy given that he has yet to present letters of  accreditation. This, they added, explained why there were not  official addresses and official Vatican sources did not comment  on the event.    Born in Argentina of Polish parents, in 1931, Shmuel Hadas  is  married with two children. He emigrated to Israel in 1954 and  has held diplomatic posts in Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia and  Spain. He has also represented Israel at several international  forums, included the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE).    In related developments today, the official Vatican  spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, voiced satisfaction for the latest  positive developments in the negotiations between Israel and the  Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).    It is the position of the Holy See, he recalled, to favor,  in  the Middle East as elsewhere else in the world, negotiations  which lead to solutions which respect the rights of men and  peoples, including Israel's right to security and the right of  Palestinians for a state.

The mainland imported 25 million metric tons of iron and  steel in 1993, ranking first in the world in terms of iron and  steel imports; whereas Taiwan imported 15 million metric tons of  iron and steel last year, ranking third in world, Kuo Chin-mao  said, adding that the two sides' iron and steel imports  accounted for more than one-third of the world's iron and steel  trade last year; for this reason, it is necessary for the two  sides to strengthen exchange of information on iron and steel,  as this will benefit iron and steel businessmen on both sides.    In addition, Kuo Chin-mao said: In recent years, more and  more Taiwan bicycle and hand tool investors are investing on the  mainland; if people in the steel industry still remain  conservative and do not have a good idea of the mainland's  market trends, their business will be affected. Although the  government is energetically introducing a ""southward-bound  policy"" to reduce industrialists' fever in investing on the  mainland, the federation will still lead iron and steel  manufacturers and businessmen to the mainland to seek  cooperation, out of consideration of practical needs.

The  purpose of the documents is to strengthen and broaden bilateral  contacts between Mexico and Russia on a new legal-treaty basis.    The initialling, that is the coordination of a common  concept  of the two documents, enables the state institutions of Russia  and Mexico to launch practical preparations for exchanges of  performing groups, museum exhibitions and delegations of partner  cities, Yuriy Korchagin, representative of the Russian Foreign  Ministry, who attended the commission's session, told ITAR-TASS.    The programme for specific bilateral measures in these areas  of cooperation also provides for financial and technical  assistance in the establishment of direct contacts between  higher learning establishments, cultural, sports and other  organisations of Mexico and Russia.    Nikolay Bespalov, charge d'affaires ad interim of the  Russian  Federation to this Latin American country, is of the opinion  that Mexico shows greate interest in the development of mutually  beneficial cooperation with Russia in culture, education and  sports, cooperation which has somewhat slowed down since the  break-up of the Soviet Union.    The lack of a new legal basis for the stimulation of such  contacts led to a paradoxical situation. At a time when many  prominent Russian groups and performers began to frequent Mexico  for guest tours on a commercial basis, Russia was not actually  represented in recent years at big international art festivals  here, such as, for example, the world-famed Servantino, Bespalov  said.

Mr Churin  said he will discuss the issue with the Vietnamese Government  during his short visit to Vietnam early next month. He said he  has asked the Intellectual Property Department to draw up a  structure of operations for Thailand, Vietnam, China, Laos,  Cambodia and Burma.    Cooperation between countries of the region is needed  because  trade between them will expand, and the problems of violation of  patents, copyrights and trademarks need to be tackled.    As a first step, Thailand is expected to cooperate with each  country bilaterally before expanding operations across the  region. Thailand can help Vietnam in patent registration  procedures, in which the Thai side is more experienced. The  other countries will have the same or different cooperation  agreements depending on their respective economies.    Concerning local protection of copyright works, Mr Churin  said the Government may apply the Price Fixing and Anti-Monopoly  Act of 1979, which requests that tapes, compact discs and  videotape producers submit costs of production to the Internal  Trade Department for use as a basis for considering whether  producers have taken advantage of consumers.    Mr Churin said the Economic Crime Investigation Division has  reported that the crackdown on infringement of copyright works  in February increased 27 percent from January, and 21,043 pieces  of illegal copyright works were seized.    The Singapore-based representative of the Motion Picture  Exports Association of America, who recently visited Thailand,  reported that violations of copyright laws were fewer in the  first two months of the year.

The protocol on cooperation in peaceful use of and research  into space was signed by visiting Deputy Director of the China  National Space Administration Wang Liheng and director of the  Russian Space Administration U. Koptev.    Wang told a press conference after the signing ceremony that  a joint working committee with seven people from each side will  be set up to work out the details of cooperation projects.    Noting the good cooperation the two countries have enjoyed  in  the past, Wang said the document is a frame agreement to lay a  basis for extensive Sino-Russian space cooperation.    Koptev pointed out that under the protocol, Russia and China  will cooperate in virtually all fields of space science,  including communication satellite, satellite television  broadcast and space technology application.    He said that although both countries have collaborated in  space science for years, the potential for such cooperation are  far from being fully tapped.    Sino-Russian space cooperation is faced with difficulties in  terms of law, finance and economy, Koptev said, but normal  cooperation will not be affected.    On Russia's plan to build a new space rocket launching  center  in the Far East, which is only 100 kilometers away from the  Chinese border, Koptev said this will create more favorable  conditions for close Russian-Chinese cooperation in this field.    Wang, who led a delegation of China National Space  Administration, arrived here on Monday [21 March] for a  week-long visit.     "

The United States is due to rule on renewing China's MFN in  June.    ""The MFN status is a reciprocal and mutual beneficial  arrangement between China and the USA and should not be linked  to any issue irrelevant to it,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry  spokesman Wu Jianmin said in response to a question about  sending Wang to the United States.    ""Because of the sickness of prisoner Wang Juntao, Chinese  judicial departments in accordance with Chinese law, permitted  him to receive medical treatment,"" he said.    U.S. President Bill Clinton had asked for significant  progress on human rights issues in China before renewing MFN,  which allows Chinese products easier access to US markets. The  dissident, one of the primary leaders of the crushed democracy  movement of 1989, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1991.  During detention, he contracted hepatitis and his health in  general deteriorated in recent years.    Wu refused to say whether Wang would be allowed to return to  China after recovering, saying it was up to judicial  authorities. He also said a recent visit to the United States by  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi was a  ""success and will help enhance the mutual understanding between  the two countries and promote the bilateral trade and economic  ties.""

Although our  cooperation has been gradually acquiring an international  character, the Czech Republic remained our most important  partner. The tendency to standardize our mutual relations and  gradually eliminate the specific features is gaining in strength  particularly on the Czech side. Certain international  appearances, however, of the Czech Republic in support of the  Slovak Republic can be classified as signs of good cooperation.    The volume of mutual trade indicates a halt in the original  decline that followed the partition of the federation. A better  and broader utilization of the customs union could favorably  affect the speed and quality of the incorporation into the  Western integration structures. The Treaty on a Temporary  License To Conduct Business for Natural and Legal Persons Who  Conduct Business on the Territory of the Other Republic of the  Former Federation After 31 December 1993 was added at the end of  the year to the complex of the treaties signed with the Czech  Republic so far. On the whole, the division of the property of  the former federation (98 percent completed) can also be rated  favorably, although the most recent problems are not getting  solved as fast as desired.    The talks on an umbrella agreement regarding the border  regime between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic have  progressed slowly because of the difference in approach to this  issue by the two parties. The problem of setting the amount of  administrative fees has been solved, however, for the  applications by citizens for permanent or long-term residence on  the territory of the other republic.    To designate the common border, a Slovak-Czech demarcation  commission has been established, which managed to define  successfully the international border between the Slovak  Republic and the Czech Republic. The last four questionable  instances in this area are currently being solved.    The mutual cultural ties are very close; albeit, the  reduction of the information flow and the mutual communication  threatens their firmness. Because Slovakia wishes to continue  presenting its culture to the citizens of the Czech Republic and  reinforce the spiritual identity of the expatriate community,  fundamental steps were taken to initiate the work of a Slovak  Cultural Center in Prague beginning on 1 January 1994.    During the year, several working meetings of representatives  of the two states at all levels took place, including three  meetings of the presidents.    Despite all endeavors and conciliatory measures by the  Slovak  Republic, the mutual mistrust and tense atmosphere in relations  with the Hungarian Republic could not be overcome. This is  indicated especially by the approach taken by the Hungarian  side, which was clearly dictated by the effort to challenge the  credibility of Slovakia at international forums, the emphasis  put on the problem of the rights of the Hungarian ethnic  minority by the unnecessary dramatization of some less  considerate unpremeditated steps by the Slovak side (the removal  of signs, for instance), and the fueling of the irredentist  tendencies of some representatives of the Hungarian parties in  Slovakia. Hungarian diplomacy used international forums to  complicate the starting position of Slovakia (CSCE, Council of  Europe, Central European Initiative), and this stand adversely  marked the entire development of mutual relations.    The decidedly negative interpretation of the construction of  the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project was successfully vanquished,  however, and depoliticized by submitting the conflict for  decision by the International Court of Justice at The Hague.  The reliability of the arguments by the Hungarian Republic has  diminished recently as regards the need for the reinforcement of  the defense and the status of the Hungarian ethnic minorities in  the neighboring countries--that is, also in Slovakia.    Because of the aforementioned tension in mutual relations,  no  official highest-level meetings have taken place this year,  except for some brief meetings of the prime ministers and  foreign ministers at multilateral forums and the participation  of our supreme representatives at the funeral of the deceased  Hungarian Prime Minister J. Antall.    The basis for mutual relations with the Polish Republic is a  good neighborhood without any open problems and joint efforts to  integrate into the West European structures. Nonetheless, not  all activities have been conducted according to the expectations  of both parties, as the Polish partners reckon with a more  active part on our side. The volume of trade declined, which is  a result of the restructuring of both economies and also the  absence of treaties in the economic sphere. A recovery in this  area should be helped by the opening of new border crossings  according to the schedule approved by the government in October.    A certain revival in our relations can be expected in the  near future because treaties are ready on cross-border  cooperation, the small border contact, and we are preparing the  opening of a Slovak institute in Warsaw. The activity in other  sectors leaves something to be desired.    Of the Polish officials, President Walesa visited Slovakia  with the Polish foreign minister on the occasion of the  inauguration of the president. Deputy Prime Minister R. Kovac  visited Poland.    The development of relations with Austria continued its  favorable trend. Contacts have been vitalized at all levels and  in all areas because, from the very beginning, the Slovak  diplomacy has been aware of the specific character of  cooperation with this country, which is our only neighbor with a  developed market economy and democratioc traditions, and a  future member of the European Union. The foreign political  importance of Austria increased also by many countries  accrediting their ambassadors to the Slovak Republic in Vienna  because many foreign observers and journalists also operate from  there. Moreover, Vienna is the seat of numerous international  organizations.    The official visits by the Slovak prime minister to Austria  and the Austrian federal president and the foreign minister to  the Slovak Republic helped in the quest for possibilities of  cooperation, as did the participation of Slovak officials at the  international undertakings in Vienna (UN Human Rights  Conference, Council of Europe Summit, and so forth).  International ties have also developed briskly, and this was  reflected in the signing of numerous treaties on cooperation.    Austria has become the largest foreign investor in Slovakia  and the third-largest business partner, but Slovakia has not  managed to eliminate the mutual trade deficit. The interchange  between the infrastructures of the two countries has also  progressed at a slow pace. The feeling of an environmental  threat to Austria on the part of Slovakia, to which some  ambiguous statements from our side contributed, remains an open  question. The problems with filling the post of Slovak  ambassador to Austria also had an adverse effect on our mutual  relations.    The specific feature of our relations with Ukraine lies in  the fact that ties were established between two new states with  a similar state-forming process and political and economic  problems. In the course of 1993, practically all spheres of  political, economic, and cultural life became active as the  appropriate treaties were drafted. The Treaty on Good  Neighborliness, Friendly Relations, and Cooperation merits  special mention, as do the treaties on problems concerning the  state border, including the readmission treaty, and several  ministerial treaties.    We have managed neither to settle the matter of permeability  of the state border with Ukraine nor to process a concept of new  border crossings. The border problems have been further  complicated by the disaster on the Uh River.    The Slovak president visited Kiev, and numerous meetings  took  place between Cabinet members and their Ukrainian partners.    2.2 Relations With the European Union    Another priority of foreign policy of the Slovak Republic  has  been and remains the integration into the West European  political, economic, and security structures. We have advanced  on the road to this objective by signing the European  (Association) Treaty on the association of the Slovak Republic  with the European Union in October 1993. For this reason, we  have paid extraordinary attention also to the establishment of  good bilateral relations with individual countries of the  European Twelve.    The relations with our former neighbor, the FRG, maintained  their somewhat privileged nature.    A material framework of the bilateral relations is formed by  the Treaty on Good Neighborliness and Cooperation Between the  Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the FRG, on the basis of  which an actualization--that is, signing of additional  treaties--is being discussed.    The most significant contact actions have probably been the  visit by the Slovak president to the FRG, the meeting between  the foreign ministers, and numerous meetings and talks between  other ministers. Closer ties have also been formed between the  parliaments of the two countries.    The ties between the Slovak Republic and the individual  Bundeslaender have been developing well, particularly with  Bavaria, where the cooperation of individual sectors is further  advanced within the framework of the Slovak-Bavarian working  team. The visit by Slovak Prime Minister Meciar to Munich,  where he also met with Bavarian Prime Minister E. Stoiber,  confirmed the solid basis for such cooperation. Recently, we  have registered an increased interest in the Slovak Republic on  the part of other FRG laender as demonstrated by the visits of  delegations from Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia  to Bratislava.    In the second half of the year, the interest of the FRG in  cooperation with the Slovak Republic in the economic sphere  appreciably increased. This is also corroborated by the  establishment of a German economic mission in Bratislava and a  branch office of the Kreditny ustav pre obnovu a rozvoj [Credit  Institute for Reconstruction and Development] at the FRG Embassy  in Bratislava. In October 1993, the FRG assumed second place in  the volume of investment in the Slovak economy and is the  second-largest trade partner of the Slovak Republic. There was  very active communication on the level of the business sphere.    The compensation to Slovak citizens, former  concentration-camp prisoners, remains an open question. The  German side holds a relatively reserved stand and points out the  complex internal political economic situation. Similarly, the  question of employment of Slovak citizens working on contract in  the FRG must be resolved, while an increase to numbers  comparable with other Visegrad Four countries could not be  attained so far.    During the short time of the existence of an independent  representation office of the Slovak Republic, we have succeeded  in building an efficient representation and a wide network of  contacts. Nonetheless, the appointment of a Slovak ambassador to  the FRG has not yet been resolved. This state of affairs is  perceived adversely by the German side, and, to a certain  degree, it refutes the attained results.    The level of mutual relations with France rose after the  emergence of the Slovak Republic on 1 January 1993. That is  testified to by the extensive contact activity by members of the  Slovak Government. The fundamental objective of Slovak foreign  policy concerning France in 1993 was the use of the potential of  the declared French political support for the endeavors of  Slovakia to integrate into the European integration structures  in the admission into the Council of Europe, the signing of the  European Treaty on Association of the Slovak Republic with the  European Union, and the development of high-level bilateral  contacts.    France does not see any difference in the readiness of the  Visegrad Four countries to join NATO and the Western European  Union, but for now it will not support their membership in these  structures.    Regarding the Slovak Republic, France points out the  uncertain political and economic situation, ambiguities in  legislation, obfuscated privatization, and unsolved problems in  the sphere of minority policy.    In this context, it must be pointed out that the French  partners are not quite clear about the ""rules of the game""; the  cooperation rules have not been defined, and they feel that they  are not treated as equals. Following the official visits by  then Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Minister Delegate for  European Affairs Alain Lamassoure to the Slovak Republic, and  the official visit by the Slovak foreign minister to France in  1993, the Slovak Foreign Ministry plans for 1994 a meeting of  presidents and prime ministers of the two countries.    Parliamentary cooperation has developed between individual  sectors--interior, defense, education (Treaty on Cooperation in  the Area of Youth, Physical Education, and Sport was signed on 1  November 1993), and others.    Despite the cutback in the sphere of technical assistance,  several projects have been realized in the Slovak Republic in  1993, particularly in the spheres of education, culture,  environmental protection, agriculture, and public administration.    There are no unsolved issues in the sphere of bilateral  relations between Great Britain and Slovakia. A significant  stimulus for the development of the relationship was the visit  by the prime minister to London on 8 March 1993. He met with  British Prime Minister John Major; Michael Heseltine, British  president of the Board of Trade; EBRD [European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development] President Jacques Attali; and  representatives of the Confederation of British Industry. Other  significant contacts include the visit by Archibald Hamilton,  minister of state for armed forces, to the Slovak Republic, and  several meetings between other ministers.    From the political point of view, Great Britain is an  important partner as a member of the European structures the  Slovak Republic is interested in joining (European Union, NATO,  Western European Union). The interests of Britain differ in  certain instances from those of other members of these groupings  and often coincide with the interests of the Slovak Republic  (for example, expansion of the European Union membership,  liberalization of trade).    The assistance provided by Great Britain through the  Know-How  fund in many spheres of public administration is considerable.    The image of Slovakia in the UK has somewhat improved during  the year. Although the not-very-good economic situation is  still pointed out, and the domestic political situation is not  characterized as stable, the membership of Slovakia in  international organizations, to which the country was admitted  during 1993, has been emphasized all the time more frequently.    The significant official visits by our top-ranking  representatives to Belgium confirmed our endeavors to integrate  into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. There was the  visit by the Slovak president on the occasion of the funeral of  King Baudouin I and the meetings during his visit to NATO, the  meeting between the Slovak prime minister and his Belgian  counterpart, and the talks between the Slovak foreign minister  and his Belgian counterpart. There were ties established also  between individual ministers.    Relations between the two countries can be described as  problem-free.    The development of relations with Luxembourg took a similar  course. Although the intensity of contacts was not very high, a  visit by the heir to the throne, Prince Henri, to the Slovak  Republic took place, and a working visit to Luxembourg by the  Slovak prime minister. Various important economic and business  contacts were established on these occasions.    After 1 January 1993, contacts with the Netherlands  generally  amplified, as witnessed by the official visit by Dutch Foreign  Minister Kooijmans to the Slovak Republic, which created the  framework for further development of mutual cooperation.  Certain favorable shifts in Dutch public opinion regarding the  Slovak Republic were registered. The Slovak Republic used  within the framework of the PSO [expansion unknown] bilateral  noninvestment aid in the amount of 3 million Dutch guilders.    The activities of the Foreign Ministry were aimed in the  relationship with Greece at forming prerequisites for an actual  support for Slovak endeavors to integrate quickly into the  European structures with respect to the Greek chairmanship of  the European Union beginning on 1 January 1994. These questions  and bilateral relations were on the agenda of the meeting of  foreign ministers of the two countries in Athens in June.    In the course of 1993, fundamental ties were established to  Spain. Except for the meeting between foreign ministers at the  48th UN General Assembly, however, no significant contacts took  place, and the present level of mutual relations is not  satisfactory. Cooperation in the economic sphere is  characterized by passivity on both sides and negligible interest  in developing actual contacts, while such an intensification  could be interesting for us because of the experience of Spain  with a transformation of the economy. Contractual relations are  also stagnating. A certain improvement could be detected in the  contacts between the Ministries of the Economy, Education and  Science, and Culture.    Our relations with Portugal can be characterized in a  similar  manner, despite a certain promise of an improvement by  occasional highest-level meetings at multilateral forums: a  meeting between the presidents in Washington, the prime  ministers in Vienna, and the foreign ministers at the UN in New  York. A favorable impulse was the visit by the Portuguese state  secretary of trade to the Slovak Republic. He reported an  interest of Portuguese enterprises in privatization.    Bilateral relations with Ireland have not developed.    2.3 Relations With Other States in Europe, North America,  and the Commonwealth of Independent States    In relations with other countries in Europe, Slovak  diplomacy  supported the endeavors for furthering possibilities of contacts  in both political and economic spheres. In some countries, we  wanted to create the appropriate framework for launching a  dialogue and creating opportunities for the expansion of  contacts in the future. Thus, cooperation was launched with  Turkey, Cyprus, Croatia, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM], the Baltic states, and the Scandinavian  countries. In some instances, high-level meetings have already  taken place.    In relations with our traditional partners, we have tried  to maintain the position of the Slovak Republic, and, if  possible, use it for mutual support on the international scene.  All aspects of contacts have been developed with Slovenia, with  which we are tied by considerable common political and economic  interests, and with Romania, where a significant progress was  recorded in our mutual relations, including highest-level  meetings. As a result of the domestic political situation, our  contacts with Bulgaria somewhat stagnated.    Our relations with the Holy See have improved after our  president's official visit to the Vatican, and the meeting  between the Slovak prime minister with the state secretary of  the Holy See, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. We have also established  diplomatic ties with the Sovereign Order of Knights of Malta and  the Republic of San Marino.    The contacts with Switzerland are developing similarly well.  We have established contacts in the economic sphere,  parliamentary cooperation, and cooperation on the level of towns  and communities. The representatives of the Slovak Republic and  Switzerland met unofficially during the World Economic Forum in  Davos, and the Economic Forum in Crans Montana, attended by the  Slovak prime minister and several ministers. Slovak Prime  Minister Meciar met on this occasion with Swiss President Ogli.    Regarding the position of both North American states in the  world political, economic, and security relations, we have  considered the relations with them a priority. Foreign policy  of the Slovak Republic toward the United States of America was  built on the fact that although Slovakia is one of the successor  states to the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, it is perceived  as a new entity that must establish itself on the international  political, security, and economic scene. The second factor  affecting contacts with the United States was the influence of  the United States on the present arrangement of the world and  its decisive position within the framework of numerous  international organizations and institutions, which the Slovak  Republic wants to join, or whose support it would like to gain  (United Nations, NATO, IMF, World Bank, etc.). This corresponds  to the frequency of visits by World Bank representatives in the  course of the year. The Slovak president visited the United  States on the occasion of the opening of the Holocaust Museum,  the Slovak prime minister visited there, and so did the National  Council of the Slovak Republic chairman (three times), the  Slovak foreign minister on the occasion of the admission of  Slovakia to the United Nations and at the 48th UN General  Assembly, and four other ministerial visits.    The interest of the U.S. side focused on the sphere of  economic assistance and cooperation with the Slovak Republic.  The most important visits from the United States can be  considered the mixed delegation of the Department of Defense and  the Department of State headed by Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense Slocombe, whose members were able to acquaint themselves  with the orientation of the Slovak Republic in the sphere of  security policy and the orientation of the Army of the Slovak  Republic towards a compatibility of the army systems with the  NATO structures, and the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral  Export and the IMF expert team missions.    The relations with the United States are regulated by some  30  treaties, of which 11 have been signed since November 1989.    Because of the position of the Slovak Republic as a new  entity, in addition to the economic indicators, the United  States is also interested in the protection of human rights  here, freedom of speech, and minority rights. Despite positive  signals from the U.S. representatives towards the Slovak  Republic, in the political sphere, the exceptions in the  assessment of the sphere of the protection of human rights and  minorities, media policy, and the privatization process could  not be completely eliminated (see the CSCE Commission report to  the U.S. Congress).    There are also great reserves in the sphere of cooperation  with individual states of the United States, where only the  framework treaty with Maryland facilitates a broader economic  cooperation than the current one.    A problem of the Slovak Republic from this point of view  is, in particular, the lack of coordination of information flows  abroad. The latent apprehensions about the development of  democracy in the Slovak Republic are contributed to also by some  statements and measures by the highest representatives of the  Slovak Republic in the sphere of human rights and media policy.    Despite the status of Canada in the world, the Slovak  Republic's relations with this country at the highest level, as  well as relations with the Canadian representative mission,  which is based in Prague, have been only sporadic. That was  due, in particular, to the perception of the Slovak Republic as  the destroyer of the common state and to the drawing of  parallels with the efforts of Quebec to gain independence within  the framework of the Canadian federation.    The Slovak Republic is perceived in Canada as a politically  integral part of the group of Visegrad Four, though one that is  economically weaker, and one responds with understanding to the  efforts of the Slovak Republic to become integrated into West  European structures.    In May 1993 the Economic Development Corporation (EDC), the  most important Canadian economic organization guaranteeing  Canadian exporters' credits, included the Slovak Republic among  high-risk countries and refused to provide guarantees, thereby  virtually halting trade exchange. This suspension [of export  credit guarantees] has jeopardized the implementation of many  projects. This EDC attitude changed only at the beginning of  November, following the September 1993 visit by a delegation of  Slovak bankers headed by the governor of the Slovak National  Bank. In 1994 it is therefore possible to expect a revival of  economic relations and the provision of credits by Canadian  banks.    Cooperation at the level of government departments should be  based on a clear definition of the Slovak Republic's priorities  not only vis-a-vis Canada as a whole, but also vis-a-vis  Canadian provinces, many of which assume a more active approach  than federal bodies.    The following contacts took place in the course of 1993: the  Slovak Republic was visited by Otto Jelinek, minister of  national revenue, and several government ministers and Ivan  Gasparovic, chairman of the National Council of the Slovak  Republic, paid a visit to Canada.    In view of the political and economic situation of the  countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS],  Slovak foreign policy approached relations with them  pragmatically, with emphasis on the development of mutually  advantageous economic and trade relations and the effort to  recover some of our claims in these countries.    Proceeding from the new conditions in the two countries, the  Slovak Republic was building relations with the Russian  Federation on the basis of equal partnership. On the whole, we  have succeeded in following up on the positive aspects in  historical relations between the two nations.    The fundamental aim in building new relations with the  Russian Federation was to secure, above all, economic and trade  relations, which had been greatly disrupted in the preceding  period. Meeting this target was immensely difficult, due to the  exceedingly complicated domestic political, economic, and  socioeconomic situation in Russia. In spite of this, we have  succeeded in activating mutual relations and raising their  quality so that these relations can be characterized as good  partnership in all areas. Economic relations, in particular,  have been raised to a good level.    A number of contacts was realized in the course of 1993.  President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Bratislava, in particular,  was an event that should become an important factor for the  further development of mutual relations. The Treaty of Friendly  Relations and Cooperation was signed during the visit.    Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar paid important visits to  Moscow in March and in August 1993, which were devoted mainly to  questions of economic cooperation. The Agreement on Economic and  Scientific-Technical Cooperation between the Governments of the  Slovak Republic and the Russian Federation and the Memorandum on  Questions of Slovak-Russian Trade and Economic Cooperation were  signed in 1993. Following up on Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's  visits, First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation O.  Lobov and Deputy Prime Minister Y. Yarov paid visits to the  Slovak Republic.    Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic Jozef  Moravcik paid a visit to the Russian Federation in March 1993,  as a member of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's delegation, and  this visit was reciprocated by the visit of Andrey Kozyrev,  minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation, to  Bratislava.    Mutual working visits by other ministers of the two  countries  were important.    With regard to relations with other CIS republics, no  activities were developed at the highest level and at  ministerial level and no visits at these levels were carried  out. In 1994 it is necessary to reckon with the development of  activities with, in particular, Belarus, Tajikistan, and  Kazakhstan.     "

Q.: Minister, which are Bulgaria's foreign policy priorities  now, in view of the changes which have taken place in this  country?    A.: Bulgaria pursues a sovereign foreign policy, proceeding  from its national interests and based on the universal standards  of international law. Our efforts are directed towards the  attainment of two strategic objectives: identifying an optimum  national security framework and creating foreign political  conditions for this country's transition to a market economy and  mitigation of any adverse external factors in this field.    These strategic objectives determine Bulgaria's specific  priorities, and above all the integration into the European  political, economic and military organizations and the  Euro-Atlantic security structures. The entry into force of  Bulgaria's Europe agreement will bring us considerably closer to  the European Union. At the same time, we will persist in our  efforts to promote economic contacts with the EFTA countries.  Bulgaria joined NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative and  will take an active part in it; will probably be granted special  status within the framework of the Western European Union.  Bulgaria will be the first postcommunist state to preside over  the Council of Europe.    Other priorities include promoting dialogue and updating the  contractual and legal framework of Bulgaria's relations with the  industrialized nations. At the same time, Bulgaria will also  seek to maintain active cooperation with the countries of  Eastern Europe, with Russia, Ukraine and the other countries of  the former Soviet Union.    It is our task to assist the creation of an external  environment that would guarantee our national security and  economic development. And this task is closely related to  Bulgaria's activities in the Balkans. Bulgaria will continue to  pursue balanced contacts with its next-door neighbours.    Q.: What are the objectives of Bulgarian diplomacy in Black  Sea Economic Cooperation?    A.: Bulgaria has supported the idea for Black Sea Economic  Cooperation from the very beginning and has substantially  contributed to the drafting and adoption of the documents on its  establishment. Bulgaria believes that Black Sea Economic  Cooperation need not turn into a closed integration community  but should rather continue developing as an open form of  regional economic cooperation, allowing its members to integrate  into the European structures.    Bulgarian diplomacy is also seeking to expedite work on  specific projects and on the achievement of concrete results  mainly in transport, communications, trade, power engineering,  environmental protection, science and technology, agriculture  and tourism.    Q.: How does Bulgarian diplomacy intend to help Bulgaria  regain and expand its market positions in the former Soviet  Union?    A.: Bulgarian-Russian relations are gradually entering the  stage of practical solution of outstanding problems, especially  in the trade and economic field. Our principal aim is clear:  To restore and strengthen the positions which Bulgaria has lost  in this boundless market. The Bulgarian-Russian Mixed  Commission will hold its second session in March to discuss  mainly economic issues such as debt settlement, payments system,  facilitating Bulgarian imports, and transport connections,  including the idea of a ferry service between Varna and  Novorossiysk. Bulgaria believes that trilateral talks should be  held with Russia and Ukraine to make efficient use of the  existing transport infrastructure.    The foundations of trade and economic cooperation with  states  of Central Asia and the Caucasus are being laid on the  initiative of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry. This is a  difficult and slow process, but concrete results have already  been achieved. A protocol on the establishment of a joint  Balkan Credit Bank was signed with Kazakhstan in 1993.    Trade, financial and transport agreements are expected to be  signed this year with Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and  Uzbekistan.    Q.: To what extent are the priorities of Bulgarian diplomacy  determined by this country's economic interests?    A.: Bulgarian diplomacy still attaches primary importance to  seeking solutions and assisting various international  institutions and advanced countries for compensation of  Bulgaria's embargo- related losses and alleviating their burden  on its economy.    I believe there is broad political consensus in this country  on the invariability of the policy line towards Bulgaria's full  integration into the European economic area. You have witnessed  Bulgarian diplomatic activity over the past few years which  resulted in the signing of a Europe Agreement and an Interim  Trade Agreement between Bulgaria and the European Union. An  free trade agreement with the EFTA countries has already entered  into force. We intend to make still more active use of the  European Union's cooperation programmes and maximize the funds  provided within the framework of the PHARE [Economic  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] programme.  Bulgaria's full integration into the European Union is a  long-term target of this country's foreign policy.    I would like to stress the special importance we attach to  our relations with GATT. The negotiations have reached a  decisive stage. Bulgaria's accession to that organization would  guarantee this country equal participation in world economy and  trade, upgrade its international prestige and encourage foreign  investment.    Q.: Minister, thank you for this interview.     "

This agreement was signed  on 31 January by Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez  Boettner and his Peruvian counterpart, Efrain Goldenberg  Schreiber.    The agreement's purpose is to promote cooperation between  the  governments of Paraguay and Peru in order to prevent and combat  with greater efficiency the illegal trafficking and abuse of  drugs and psychotropic substances by harmonizing their policies  and developing coordinated actions and programs.    In order to fulfill the agreement's objectives, the two  countries' pertinent services will exchange information about  preventive measures against drug abuse in their respective  territories.    They also will prepare joint strategies to prevent drug  abuse, the illegal production of drugs, and to repress drug  trafficking. They also will exchange information about illegal  trafficking and the use of precursors and basic chemicals,  illegal trafficking routes, and the modus operandi of drug  traffickers.    The two countries' foreign ministers have likewise signed  another agreement for the reciprocal protection and promotion of  investments, wishing to intensify economic cooperation to the  two countries' benefit. The document states that each country  will guarantee the investments and free transfer of payments  connected with these investments, especially profits, loan  mortgages, and others made by the other country.    Ramirez Boettner and Goldenberg Schreiber also signed a  cooperation agreement between the Diplomatic and Consular  Academies of Asuncion and Lima. In turn, Presidents Wasmosy and  Fujimori signed a joint declaration in which they reasserted the  friendship between the governments and peoples of Paraguay and  Peru.     "

Grachev told reporters in Moscow Friday that 2,500 Russian  troops will remain in Estonia until the problem of Russian  military retirees is solved. The minister also declared Russia  may bring additional troops into the Baltic country to defend  its military facilities there.    In Malk's opinion, Grachev's statement clearly conflicts  with  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the  United Nations documents about the withdrawal of Russian troops  from the Baltic states.    ""Grachev's statement is a direct challenge to the authority  of international requirements. By threatening Estonia with  stopping the troop pullout and bringing in more military, the  Russian defense minister verified Moscow's strengthening  attempts to force its will on other states and international  organizations,"" Malk told BNS.    Malk attached great importance to Grachev's timing of his  remarks to coincide with the 19th round of Estonian-Russian  troop withdrawal talks.    ""It can be regarded as an attempt on Russia's part to  pressurize Estonia to make concessions. On the other hand, the  statement of the Russian defense minister can be considered as  giving up ironing out problems through negotiation,"" Malk said.    The Foreign Ministry deputy chancellor expressed the opinion  that the states, which observe without protest the growth of  power policy tendencies in Russia, assume a ""heavy  responsibility.""

Yesterday evening he had  dinner with President Lennart Meri and this morning met with  Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik. The following has been  transcribed and translated by Juri Arusoo and Mari-Ann Rikken of  the Press and Information Department of the Estonian Foreign  Ministry.    Raul Malk (in Estonian): Over the course of two days we have  had good talks. There is nothing concrete to announce at this  stage. We have just agreed that we will continue as soon as  possible. And now I hope you hear about the same. Meaning from  Mr. Churkin.    Vitaliy Churkin (in Russian): This is my first press  conference where I can't understand my colleague's language, but  it is not a problem because I'll say about the same. First of  all we are very satisfied with the atmosphere and character of  the discussions which took place in Tallinn and which began a  few days ago in Genevea. We are grateful to the Estonian side,  and Mr. Malk. I had an opportunity as well to have a  substantive discussion with the foreign minister and yesterday  an informal, but long, interesting, and substantive meeting with  President Meri. We are thankful to the Estonian side for  providing such good conditions, for creating such an atmosphere  of goodwill for these negotiations. It seems to me that we can  say that we didn't talk only in a spirit of goodwill, but with a  sincere attempt on both sides to solve as quickly as possible  those questions which still remain, in order that we can turn  the page, perhaps even finish an entire chapter in the history  of our relations. To begin to write a new chapter starting with  a new page, having solved completely those complicated problems  which we have spent the last few months discussing. Now,  however we have reached, as we hope, the final stage as concerns  the understandings and agreements which were achieved by Russian  Minister Kozyrev during his recent stay in Tallinn.    ITAR-TASS (in Russian): What were the concrete problems  which  were discussed?    Churkin (in Russian): The same which has been under  discussion by the Estonian-Russian state delegations over a long  period of time. First of all, the problems of the completion of  the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the  Republic of Estonia and here primarily the issues which are not  yet agreed upon. The issue connected with military pensioners.  Also the issue of dismantling the installation at Paldiski.  Well, and we also touched on other questions -- general  political questions which concern Estonian- Russian relations.    Rhohtuleht, Ille Gruen-Ots (in Russian): What do you think,  is the deadline August 31 realistic?    Churkin (in Russian): I believe there is nothing unrealistic  about it. But there must be a firm basis, there have to be  agreements. And then we can energetically do that which is  necessary to complete withdrawal.    ITAR-TASS (in Russian): The Estonian side does not rule out  use of force if the withdrawal is not completed by August 31.  How do you react to this?    Churkin (in Russian): I do not think it is so. Regarding  Estonian positions, then we analyze and draw conclusions based  upon statements by responsible individuals, Estonian state  officials. And we do not have the slightest suspicion that the  Estonian position consists of the need to solve problems  politically, via negotiations. I want to emphasize that the  official position of the Russian leadership position is exactly  the same. These questions must be solved via dialogue, not in  any other way.    Q (in Russian): Did you discuss a possible meeting between  Presidents Yeltsin and Meri?    Churkin (In Russian): Concretely this was not discussed.    Rhohtuleht (in Russian): When will you meet again?    Churkin (in Russian): Yes, we invited Mr. Malk and his  colleagues -- thank you for asking this question -- to Moscow in  the near future, as soon as this can be arranged. We believe  that such a meeting may take place already next week.    Baltic Independent, Tarmu Tammerk (in English): What kinds  of  agreements should there be on military pensioners between  Estonia and Russia?    Churkin (in English): I'd rather not go into details of our  discussions because these are -- this is -- an on-going issue  between us. We hope that this will -uh- be a realistic  agreement which will remove any possibility of tensions in our  relations and - uh- would also be up to the count very high  international standards of human rights.    Lisa Trei (in English): Can you be specific about what you  mean by realistic agreement?    Churkin (in English): No, I cannot. (Laughter)    Tammerk (in English): Will it be the point of the pull-out  agreement?    Churkin (in English): I'd rather not be specific at this  time. Thank you very much. In Russian: Thank you.

It is expected that the focus of  attention will be on two major issues: How to resolve problems  of international peace, and what to do about a request made by a  number of Central and Eastern European states for inclusion into  the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance. In essence, the discussions  will boil down to the future of this Alliance in the  contemporary world.    On this eve of the NATO summit meeting, it would be  advantageous to examine the question of the relationship  existing between Russia and NATO. However, before we attempt to  find an answer to this question, it seems to me that certain  remarks are in order.    A truly paradoxical situation has come about. Virtually  everyone in the West is of the opinion that the NATO Alliance  has emerged from the Cold War as the victor. At the same time,  in no time in the past has the Alliance faced problems that are  so pressing and difficult of resolution as it does now. It is  also said that NATO is undergoing its own crisis.    This statement of the bloc's crisis situation is all the  more  surprising, since it came directly on the heels of the explosion  of euphoria which in the West was accompanied by the fall of the  Berlin Wall, self-dissolution of the Warsaw Pact Organization,  and disintegration of the Soviet Union. Leaders of states and  governments of Alliance countries in a London meeting held in  the summer of 1990 were triumphant in their welcoming the  changes occurring in Europe, even calling them historical. Then  suddenly the crisis. What went wrong?    The fact is that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in  the form which it was at the end of the 1940's, has virtually  ceased to exist. The ""threat from the East"" has disappeared. So  has the enemy. The point here is that they were essential to the  bloc's organizers not only to set a course of ""containment and  repulsion"" of communism, but more importantly to consolidate the  leading role played by the USA in the post-war world. Serving as  an instrument of Washington's politics and pulling into this  political channel other Western countries was for many years the  major function of the bloc.    And something else. NATO, after having rid itself of real or  imaginary fears concerning a ""massed assault from the East,""  came to face new and this time real dangers. These were the  unstable situation in Russia (let us recall how much someone in  the West suffered over the parliamentary election results in our  country) and in other states which sprang up on the territory of  the former USSR; the possibility of uncontrolled proliferation  of weapons of mass destruction; and, finally, the inter-ethnic  and ethnic conflicts occurring on the periphery of the bloc that  turned into fierce armed conflicts, such as those in Yugoslavia,  Moldova, and the Caucasus. How to react to all these dangers?  What could and should NATO do under these conditions?    The above questions should be answered at the NATO summit.    All of the above bears a direct relationship to Russia. All  the more since this raises full-force the question of expansion  of NATO's limits by virtue of including a number of Eastern  European countries into the organization. One cannot fail to  respect the sovereign right of every state of selecting those  forms and means of insuring the security it deems most suitable.  However, NATO's leading circles are aware of Moscow's negative  attitude toward possible forced expansion of the Alliance. This  could lead to new problems rather than to the resolution of  existing ones. For example, this could disrupt the legally  formalized system existing on our continent, primarily the  Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Instead of  strengthening of trust and stability, this would sow new seeds  of distrust, which undoubtedly would lead to destabilization of  the entire situation.    Expansion of NATO's zone of responsibility would directly  impinge upon the interests of Russia in the geopolitical,  military, and home policy areas. Expansion of the Alliance of  the world's largest military bloc would push out its boundaries,  which would then be located close to the Russian borders. This  would necessitate a fundamental rethinking of all our defensive  concepts, restructuring of the Armed Forces, reviewing of the  operational configuration of the theater of military operations,  developing an additional infrastructure, relocation of large  military contingents, and changing of operational plans and the  nature of combat training.    One can easily imagine that the expansion of NATO's circle  of  members would be perceived by both the leadership and public of  Russia as attempts to set up isolation, creating a ""sanitary  cordon"" at our western borders. One would not be out of line if  he were to point out that that could lead to xenophobia in our  society and an intensification of the influence of radical-right  nationalistic parties and organizations.    Incidentally, the above opinion is not solely that of  Russians. It is no accident that the influential German  newspaper WELT recently wrote that the driving force behind all  of NATO's attempts to expand eastward is an intent of erecting  another ""Iron Curtain"" that would constitute a barrier against  an unstable neighbor: Russia.    NATO's leading circles do understand the nuances of this  situation. It appears that the latter are in no hurry to accept  new members, in spite of insistent requests made by Poland,  Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Baltic states, and a  number of other Eastern European countries. As an alternative,  the US President has presented an idea that has come to be known  as the ""Partnership for Peace."" It seems to me that Russia could  support this idea, to the extent that it incorporates the  security interests of all states without exception. Of course,  this partnership should be based on the drafting of universal  standards of security applicable to the entire North Atlantic  area. A genuine partnership would include priority development  of political dialogue, constant consultations, agreement on  positions, and, in the future, coordinated actions.    Ministers of foreign affairs and defense of NATO countries  in  their sessions held in the beginning of December affirmed their  support of the ""Partnership for Peace"" plan advanced by  Washington. However, the nature of the plan and the methods of  its implementation are not yet clear. These problems will  obviously be objects of close examination at the forthcoming  session of the NATO Council, and it would be very desirable if  the participants would take into consideration the Russian point  of view relative to the given problem. Of course, the decisions  made in Brussels will be discussed by the Presidents of Russia  and the United States during their meeting to take place in the  next few days.    All of the above does not mean that Russia and NATO are  separated by an unbridgeable gulf. This was evidenced at the  recent meeting of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and NATO  Secretary-General Manfred Woerner. On that occasion, it was  pointed out that an objective evaluation of Russia's role  relative to the assurance of international security and  stability requires that Russia's relationships with the NATO  Alliance be accorded priority, with respect to rate of progress,  scope, and depth, over relations between the latter and  countries of Central and Eastern Europe.    Noteworthy in this regard is that there already exists  compatibility in a number of fundamental views in military and  political concepts held by Russia and NATO member countries.  This is a beneficial result of the de-ideologization of  international relations on the one hand, and a coincidence of  views held by both sides relative to basic problems of security  assurance on the other.    In this regard, both sides accord political methods a  position of priority. The use of military force is looked upon  as an exceptional measure, one permissible only in the interests  of self-defense and in peacekeeping operations. Both the ""new  strategic NATO concept"" adopted in 1991 and the recently  approved ""Basic Military Doctrine Principles of the Russian  Federation"" contain extremely important provisions asserting  that neither the North Atlantic Alliance nor Russia will  consider any state or coalition to be an enemy. Both documents  acknowledge that the limitation and reduction of armaments are  in agreement with the national interests of all states and  promote strengthening of general security. It may be said that  this opens up a real possibility of eliminating the remaining  elements of military confrontation in Europe.    And the above kind of elements do still exist. Russia is  carrying out a deep restructuring of her Armed Forces, has  already effected considerable manpower reduction, and intends to  proceed in this direction, while the NATO countries are slow in  abating their military activity. In a recent session of the  bloc's Military Planning Committee, it was pointed out that the  last few years have seen a mere 15 reduction in manpower  of  member countries, while military expenditures still amount to  3.2 of the gross national product. And this in the  absence of  a real enemy!    But this raises another question. If Russia considers  expansion of the NATO structure disadvantageous, so to speak,  and if the details of the ""Partnership for Peace"" are still  unclear, can there be a solution to the existing situation? It  appears that there can be, and, possibly, more than one. For  example, one can point to further improvement in the role and  significant activity of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  (NACC). Even now it unites 38 states, being NATO members on the  one hand, and former members of the WPO (Warsaw Pact  Organization), including of course the Russian Federation, on  the other. Russia participates actively in sessions of the NACC  at the level of ministers of foreign affairs, while  representatives of her Ministry of Defense take part in the work  of various commissions, seminars, and courses, within the  framework of this organization.    However, the above framework is still limited. The time has  obviously come to effect a considerable expansion in this area.  There are real possibilities for transforming the NACC into a  collective security organization in Europe. This would be  associated with diminishing the role of the CSCE (Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe), but due to the fact that  the work of the CSCE involves a much smaller number of states  compared with the NACC, it would be easier to arrive at  mutually-acceptable solutions and render the latter more  effective and responsive to pressing tasks and requirements  related to the situation.    One would not be out of line here to point out that the  above  is understood by all NACC members. Issued at a recent meeting of  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council was a statement  discussing the measures advanced for improving  interrelationships within the framework of this organization.  The latter has identified for itself the task of continuing and  activating consultations related to political problems and  problems associated with security assurance and to the  development of cooperation in the military area. For example,  this served as the purpose for approving a new working plan of  dialogue, partnership, and cooperation for 1994.    Why the selection of organizations such as North Atlantic  Cooperation Council? Why not charge NATO with the function of  assuring regional security? The answer is that the NATO Alliance  was set up as a specific organization of leading Western  countries under definite conditions to accomplish definite  goals. But the conditions have changed radically.    There can be no doubt that any attempts made to transform  NATO will effect virtually no change in its nature. The NATO  Alliance is an organization of the past. Occupying its agenda  should be not its modernization, but instead a move away from  bloc thinking and toward an efficient and effective system of  European and international security. The time has obviously come  to infuse with vitality the fruitful idea of creating a security  system stretching ""from Vancouver to Vladivostok,"" to prepare  and implement the necessary machinery.    The above are the considerations I would like to share on  the  eve of the NATO summit relative to a problem as serious as  relations between Russia and the NATO Alliance.     "

In the area of atomic energy,  Japan and Russia will cooperate in research on the peaceful use  of the excess plutonium generated with the dismantling of  nuclear weapons, a security measure system, etc. In space  science and technology, the aim is to set up new joint research  projects using large-scale test facilities and the excellent  data that Russia has accumulated from global observations and  manned space activities. The idea is to further advance science  and technology cooperation between Japan and Russia that makes  the best use of Japan's technological strength and knowledge.    In the field of atomic energy, Japan and Russia signed an  agreement relating to the abolition of nuclear weapons. It is a  plan for cooperation in four areas: 1) research on the storage  and peaceful use of the nuclear substances resulting from the  dismantling of nuclear weapons; 2) assistance in the application  of IAEA security measures to former Soviet-bloc nations without  nuclear weapons; 3) countermeasures against environmental  pollution, such as the disposal of radioactive wastes in the  ocean; and 4) countermeasures against missile liquid fuel  dumping.    The other agreement on space cooperation included  cooperation  such as 1) researcher and engineer exchange, 2) information  exchange, and 3) joint research in the area of space probing and  utilization for peaceful purposes.    Only the space cooperation agreement has a time limit; it is  valid for five years.     "

At consultations held before the  signing, the sides found that political relations are making  very good progress, especially after President Zhelyu Zhelev  visited Warsaw last year to sign a bilateral treaty of  friendship and cooperation. The Polish guest said that the  Bulgarian minister of foreign affairs, Stanislav Daskalov is  expected to meet in Warsaw shortly with his Polish counterpart  Andrzej Olechowski. Mr. Byczewski described this as the second  very important stage in bilateral relations.    During the consultations the sides expressed their  dissatisfaction with the progress of economic contacts, agreeing  that both governments can help an expansion of trade and  economic cooperation.    Cultural relations were also on the agenda, as well as the  premises of the Polish Cultural Centre in Sofia. Mr. Byczewski  stressed that Mr. Daskalov had assured him that the Bulgarian  Foreign Ministry will do everything within its powers to solve  the problem. ""I think this is particularly important because  both the Bulgarian Cultural Centre in Warsaw and the Polish  Cultural Centre in Sofia have fine relations and it would be  wrong to break them,"" the Polish deputy foreign minister said.  The building which now houses the Polish Cultural Institute in  Sofia was recently restituted to its former owners.    Integration into Europe's economic and Euro-Atlantic  structures, joining the U.S. Partnership for Peace initiative  and the situation in the Balkans were discussed at a meeting  between Mr. Byczewski and Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov.  Mr. Byczewski said Bulgaria and Poland have no fundamental  differences on these matters.     "

""I urge you to join me in committing our governments not only to prevent the  use of chemical weapons in armed conflict but also to prevent the spread of  chemical weapons to terrorist groups,"" Shultz said in the keynote speech to an  international conference on gas warfare.    Shultz did not repeat U.S. charges that Libya -- a nation Washington has long  accused of supporting international terrorism -- is building a massive poison  gas plant in the desert near Tripoli. But there was no doubt that his words  were directed at Col. Moammar Kadafi's regime.      Washington-Bonn Tension    Shortly before his speech, Shultz met with West German Foreign Minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher in an effort to defuse a growing Washington-Bonn dispute  over American charges that a West German industrial firm, Imhausen-Chemie,  provided technical assistance to the Libyan project.    Standing side by side after their talks, Shultz and Genscher announced that  technical experts from the two countries will meet in Washington next week for  a thorough review of U.S. intelligence concerning the Libyan project.    ""We will be trying to provide as much information as we can,"" a senior U.S.  official said later. ""If it's new information, we will (supply it); if it's  more detailed reports of things we have already provided, we will do that.""    Genscher said that the United States and West Germany are both determined ""to  prevent this further proliferation of chemical weapons.""

The West German firm denies any association with the Libyan project, and Kohl's  government has protested U.S. handling of the allegations against the company.  Kadafi insists that the plant at Rabta, about 40 miles southwest of Tripoli, is  intended to produce pharmaceuticals.    In his speech to the conference, which attracted 145 nations, well over the 130  originally expected, Shultz said that the world must act at once to stop the  production and spread of poison gas because ""ever more lethal and insidious  chemical weapons are being developed -- weapons which defeat defenses and are  devastating in their effects.""      Shultz Treads Carefully    Shultz's speech was crafted to avoid giving offense. He decried the use of  chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq War without naming either country. The United  Nations has accused Iraq of extensive use of chemical weapons in that conflict.  Iran has been accused of far more limited use of poison gas.    Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who followed Shultz to the podium,  was far more blunt. He accused the international community of ignoring Iraqi  use of chemical weapons, suggesting that there was little outrage because the  victims were not Europeans.    He demanded to know ""why did not anybody think of holding such a conference""  seven years ago when, he said, Iraq first used gas weapons.    He asserted that the conference would have been held much sooner if the victims  had been French, Belgians, British or other Europeans. The present Paris  meeting was called to reaffirm a ban on the use of chemical weapons that was  drafted at a conference in 1925, seven years after the end of World War I, when  the victims were mostly from Europe. That war is the conflict in which the use  of gas was the most extensive and the most deadly.      Neither Iraq Nor Libya    Neither Iraq nor Libya was among the first day's speakers.

About 80 foreign ministers attended the opening of the conference although  some, like Shultz, plan to leave before it ends. Shultz is scheduled to return  to Washington today after a private meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard  A. Shevardnadze, who has been sharply critical of the United States for its  confrontation with Libya.    In his speech, Shultz said the 1925 protocol against the use of chemical  weapons ""had effect for six decades. . . . Yet in recent years, the  international norms against chemical weapons use have begun to erode in  practice -- first in the Middle East and, most recently, in regional conflicts  from Southeast Asia, to Afghanistan, to the Persian Gulf.

""There are no  insurmountable technical obstacles that would prevent terrorist groups from  using chemical weapons.""

This also applies to the recent irritation between Germany and  France that was cleared up after some discussion. Those who  were involved in Paris and Bonn are being reminded of the  importance of cooperation that proved its worth in the past  three decades. Yet, the two partners are also becoming aware of  the difference in interests.    Trying to analyze the ill feelings that have been revealed  by  the controversial statements of the French ambassador in Bonn  brings back to mind former concerns in connection with German  unification and the emergence of a larger Germany that could be  heard from the political class in France after the fall of the  wall. It was the old fear of the ""German uncertainties"" and a  special German course toward the East.    Those who are looking for confirmation for this latent fear  in France will have no trouble finding it. Foreign Minister  Genscher's pressing for international recognition of the  constituent republics of the disintegrating Yugoslavia was seen  as German efforts to acquire a status of supremacy in the  Balkans. Similarly, one could challenge the federal  chancellor's efforts to facilitate the Central and East European  countries' move to get closer to the West: Where Germany pleads  for cooperation on behalf of European stability, it might be  trying to protect its own ""lebensraum"" on the basis of  institutions. The discussion on enlargement and/or deepening of  the European Union [EU], which is also being conducted between  Bonn and Paris, is more than splitting hairs. It indicates  differences in the dynamism.    After the shock caused by unification, the terrified French  found solace in the fact that the cost of it had a greater  impact on Germany's economic strength than they had envisaged,  and that they were hence left with fewer means for  economic-political expansion. Those who looked further ahead  realized very soon that such a consolation would become less  significant as the years went by, and that what started out as a  handicap would be transformed into a competitive advantage  before long. Even now, trade with the East accounts for 6-7  percent of German foreign trade, while in the case of France, it  is only 2.5 percent. The hesitation of the French oil concern,  Elf Aquitaine, to tackle the reconstruction of the Leuna  refinery, the biggest foreign investment in the new laender, is  only one example of the difficulties on the new markets. France  lacks the economic possibilities of restimulating the ""Little  Entente,"" the French sphere of influence between the German  Reich and the Soviet Union in the era between the two wars.  Independent of historic experiences and sympathies, governments  and enterprises in the former East bloc are principally banking  on the Germans.    In this unusual situation after the end of the bipartition  of  Europe, the German Government has only one chance of weakening  latent distrust, which exists not only in France: the readiness  for close cooperation with the partners, especially with our  neighbor France. Foreign Minister Kinkel emphasized this  readiness in a programmatic speech in Paris and rejected ""solo  actions and special paths"" and ""thinking in terms of spheres of  influence."" The four-year-old offer for Franco-German  coordination in the sphere of ostpolitik, which has not been  sufficiently used so far, was extended by the German foreign  minister to the EU: a rewarding task for the desired identity of  united Europe, which is to go beyond the level of trade.    What has been defined as the horizon by the German planners  in careful agreement with Paris is not limited to the Central  European reformist states and the Baltic Republics but, taking  economic facts into account, also includes Russia and Ukraine.  Time is short. The year in which Germany and then France will  have the presidency in the Union provides the timeframe. With  some exaggeration, one could conclude that de Gaulle's vision of  a Europe ""from the Atlantic to the Urals"" is being taken more  seriously today in Bonn than in Paris. Still, the German side  is trying to avoid the impression of being fixed too much on  ostpolitik. The federal foreign minister has, therefore, called  for an active European policy in the Mediterranean, which was  the declared objective of President Mitterrand when he first  took office. The Islamic danger in Algeria shows that this  cause is most urgent but also very risky.    It is one of the good sides in the Franco-German  relationship  that the worries about the effects of German ostpolitik, which  date back to the era of Bismarck, also have a positive effect  for France: the understanding that Germany may pursue interests  of its own in the East without bad intentions. Out of ""reason  of state"" and a sense for ""realpolitik,"" French politicians,  based on their own experience, do show understanding, even with  a slight connotation of resignation. The fact that the German  view has changed since the dissolution of the East bloc is a  matter of course for the French and has been accepted. In the  view of the French, joint action has become very important,  particularly because new possibilities have emerged for the  Germans.     "

In his first visit to Cuba, Osman reaffirmed the UNDP's  desire to help Cuba enter the international market. The third  training course for Cuban experts offered by the UNDP has been  scheduled for this year.    Osman will be in Havana until Friday [14 January]. During  his visit he will meet with top Cuban Government officials.    Osman was born in Maputo, Mozambique, where he occupied  several ministries from 1975 to 1991, including the Ministries  of Finance and Mineral Resources; he also served as secretary of  state for coal and oil resources.    Meanwhile, Joachim von Braunmuhl, UNDP representative in  Cuba, told PRENSA LATINA that the training courses are aimed at  introducing local experts to more modern international business  and financial operations.    Toward that end, he added, the first training course was  held  in Cuba in 1991 and a second one in 1992 with the participation  of 280 economists from various parts of the country at a cost of  $200,000.

The step is meant to counter the effects  of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on the economies of these  countries.    An official Jordanian source has asserted that Jordan  welcomes other Arab parties to join this integration, especially  the PLO, if it chooses to link the economy of the autonomous  area with the Arab states instead of Israel.    The initial reaction of the Palestinians to this plan is one  of PLO concern to maintain and develop good economic ties with  Jordan. However, a Palestinian source said what is proposed now  is a three-way Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese coordination. He  feared that the Palestinians could be pushed further into the  lap of Israel.    The plan of economic integration will be at the heart of the  Jordanian-Syrian talks at the level of prime ministers next  Monday in Amman. This issue was also raised on the bilateral  level between Jordan and Lebanon during the visit of Lebanese  Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz to Amman this week.    On another level, a summit meeting will be held between  Jordan's King Husayn and U.S. President Bill Clinton in  Washington in mid-June to discuss the developments in the peace  process. Also, the tripartite Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli committee  that was formed nine months ago will meet next Monday in  Washington to discuss projects in the Jordan Valley.    Amman insists on resolving the border question with Israel  before setting up any economic projects with the Jewish state.     "

Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Friday [27  May]: ""Russia's wish to put the CSCE above other European  security institutions is not shared by us."" He said that  although the CSCE is of great importance, ""there cannot be"" a  ranking, with the CSCE coming first, the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council second, followed by NATO in third place.  Moscow cannot be granted a right of veto either. Kinkel said:  ""Security in Europe cannot dispense with NATO as a defense  alliance in the foreseeable future."" This is also in the  interest of the Central and East Europe states, Kinkel said.    However, Kinkel welcomed Russia's willingness to accept  NATO's offer to join the Partnership for Peace program. It is  important that Russia wants to join the program as an equal  partner. The partnership opens up the opportunity for  comprehensive military cooperation to secure peace and stability  in Europe. Like the other partners, Russia can itself decide on  the extent and quality of its contributions. Kinkel said: ""I  expect Russia to sign the Partnership for Peace framework  document as soon as possible."" In addition, talks and  cooperation between NATO and Russia are desirable: ""NATO and  nuclear power Russia have to enter into a strategic dialogue,  such as the one that the United States and Russia have had for  years.""

The equipment, bought through international public bidding,  includes bulldozers, graders, loading machines, hydraulic rigs,  cranes and excavators.    These machines will be provided by U.S. Caterpillar China  Limited, Ingersoll Rand Limited, Mannesman Demag, Fried Krupp  AG, and Sweden Atlas Copco China Limited. The five companies  are all well-known machinery manufacturers.    The time limit for the general Three Gorges Project is 17  years. According to an official from the China Three Gorges  Project Development Corporation Three Gorges Equipment Company,  the construction equipment necessary for the whole project will  be worth billions of U.S. dollars.    He said that the contacts signed today will introduce the  first batch of construction machinery. Other machines for the  project will be imported later.    Construction on the Three Gorges Project will start this  year. Plans are for 20 million cubic meters of earth and stone  to be excavated.    The first set of construction equipment will be delivered  before the end of June, he said.    The international public bidding activity was conducted by  China National Machinery Import and Export Cooperation and China  National Technical Import and Export Cooperation, entrusted by  the China Three Gorges Project Development Corporation Three  Gorges Equipment Company.    According to the organizers, the international public  bidding  was the first one for the Three Gorges Project. During the  first five days of bidding beginning on December 23 last year,  13 domestic and foreign companies bought bidding documents.    Contracts with the five companies who won the bidding were  settled after nearly one month of assessment and negotiations.     "

She said that to strike a rough balance between exports and  imports is China's basic principle in foreign trade and economic  co- operation, and it intends to realize the balance through  expanding exports rather than reducing imports.    Wu told a press conference sponsored by the Press Office  under the State Council that China's foreign trade and economic  cooperation continued to maintain a strong growth momentum last  year on the basis of its rapid development over the past few  years.    The foreign trade volume last year reached 195.72 billion  U.S. dollars-worth, an increase of 18.2 million U.S. dollars  over 1992.    Exports were worth 91.77 billion U.S. dollars and imports  were worth 103.95 billion U.S. dollars. Thus the increase of  imports was 21 percent higher than that of exports, leaving a  deficit of 12.18 billion U.S. dollars.    Wu attributed the slow growth of exports to the high-speed  growth of the domestic economy, large scaled investment, robust  demand, price increases and lack of supply of some commodities,  especially primary products.    Meanwhile, she said, imports of raw materials, energy and  equipment needed for economic development increased rapidly.    Statistics show that last year imported commodities, whose  import volume exceeding one billion U.S. dollars include  aircraft, automobiles, rolled steel, crude oil, finished oil,  fertilizers, industrial chemicals and complete sets of equipment.    Wu said that this indicates once again that China is a large  market with great potential.     "

He said each country had to set its own priorities when  confronted with a multitude of challenges and opportunities.    Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said that as the  economy  was becoming increasingly globalised and confronted with the  reality of multiculturalism, its growth was inextricably linked  to factors beyond economics.    Anwar told this to Finance Ministers of the Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) which met here yesterday. He was  speaking on Malaysia's economic growth strategies.    Anwar, however, told the meeting: ""Trade must not infringe  on the rights of peoples and nations towards their own values  and cultures. If we want the pursuit of growth to be a vehicle  to spread out prosperity, rather than becoming an agent for  domination, it has to be conducted with the full cognizance of  the diversity of our world.    ""The quest for stability is not an excuse for suppression  and  injustices.""    Anwar said the implementation and the continuity of  pro-growth policies and market-friendly institutional reforms  were only possible within a stable political environment.    He pointed out that diligence, discipline, and a hardworking  labour force -- qualities which had contributed to East Asia's  prosperity and improved living standards -- had earned the  contempt of some in the West, especially among labour unions.    ""Some have gone as far as to conjure the absurd nightmare of  Western civilisation being threatened by low wage economies. I  must say that no Government with a modicum of sense and  responsibility would like to see its own people languishing in  sweatshops,"" Anwar said.    He added that for a country with full employment like  Malaysia, no measures to suppress wages would be successful.  The challenge was to remain competitive and to ensure that wage  increases did not outstrip gains in productivity.    ""For us in Asia, growth through productivity and  competitiveness is the only path to achieve prosperity. It has  liberated millions from the scourge of poverty and destitution.  It will liberate millions more in future,"" he added.    In Malaysia's case, the high growth had resulted in the  incidence of poverty declining from nearly 50 percent in 1970 to  14 percent today and per capita incomes increased significantly  from a mere U.S.$250 in 1957 to more than U.S.$3,000 by 1993.    He told the other 17 Finance Ministers that economic growth  had enabled the people in East Asia to enjoy freedom and decent  living conditions -- an indigenously-generated vision of  opportunity and betterment that compared favourably with the  promised idylls of the divergent package deals offered by  various political persuasions.    Malaysia's view, Anwar said, was that growth could not and  must not be separated from the overall societal objectives.  ""However widely crafted and market-friendly these policies may  be, consideration of the issues of distributive justice and  fairness will, eventually, play their part in contributing to  growth.""    Malaysia's success in economic development, with six  consecutive years of growth exceeding eight percent, underscored  the importance of political stability, sound macro-economic  management and an open, market-based economy that was largely  private sector driven.    Anwar explained that the Government's multi-year structural  adjustment programme in the 1980s down-sized the role of the  public sector and promoted private initiative as the main engine  of growth.    On Malaysia's economic performance in 1994, he said  indications were that the economy would strengthen further with  growth exceeding eight percent ""making this the most buoyant and  longest economic expansion in Malaysia's history.""    Both the Government's financial and balance of payments  position were looking very healthy. Inflation was low and price  stability was expected to continue, he said.    Prospects for the medium term were equally good and the  growth target of eight percent for the Sixth Malaysia Plan  (1991-1995) would most probably be surpassed. Nevertheless,  there was a need to continuously focus on relieving  infrastructural bottlenecks and shortage of skilled labour to  enhance competitiveness.    Even though East Asia had been insulated from the recession  in the industrialised countries, it was not oblivious to the  fact that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) countries were and would remain a major  contributor to the global economy.    Developing countries would benefit from a ""rejuvenation of  growth in older industralised economies.    ""If we can free ourselves of protectionism and reverse the  movement towards the formation of new trading blocs, we can  develop a new partnership, one which can operate to disperse  growth and prosperity around the globe.    ""There is no miracle agent or quick-fix for growth, it is  the  outcome of hard work and diligence, continuous investment in  human and physical capital and policies that promote  entrepreneurship.""    Anwar said this had been Malaysia's experience and that  there  was a need to be ""wary of the residual mentality of the Cold War  era and outlook that seeks to exaggerate security issues and  provoke tensions, thus once again diverting our energies from  development.""    He told the Ministers that ASEAN's experience had taught  that  regional stability and productive relations must be earned  through good neighbourliness and mutual trust.     "

Koo, chairman of the Taiwan-Japan Economic  and Trade Development Foundation, and Economic Affairs Minister  P.K. Chiang, the center aims to push for trade and technological  cooperation between the two countries, they noted.    The center will coordinate domestic efforts to seek  technology transfers from Japan, which could be achieved through  strategic business alliances, they pointed out.    Currently, domestic organizations responsible for promoting  trade ties with Japan include the Republic of China [ROC]  Committee of the East Asian Businessmen Conference, the  Taiwan-Japan Business Cooperation Conference, and Taiwan's  Japan-oriented Exporters Association.    The officials stressed that the combined business forces of  the two countries in capital, technology, and marketing will  certainly help promote the upgrading of the industrial base in  Taiwan.    The goal could be achieved by beginning with the  establishment of joint ventures to produce key parts and  components in Taiwan, they said.    In goodwill response to Taiwan's new move, a group of  Japan's  senior business executives including Shoichiro Toyota, the  newly- elected president of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), will visit Taiwan in early July.    The Japanese side is planning to organize the largest-ever  technology transfer group with a view to promoting the transfer  of high-tech know-how to Taiwan, the officials said.    Taiwan has been plagued by a huge trade deficit with Japan.  The trade imbalance, which totaled US$14.22 billion in 1993, is  expected to top US$16 billion this year.     "

He said the Iraqi people will  always recall with fondness and appreciation the Jordanian  people's support during their calamities, both in the Iraq-Iran  war against the racist hostile current and in the Mother of  Battles when forces of evil and aggression massed and more than  30 barbaric, treacherous states assembled to strike at Iraq.    In an interview with the AKHBAR AL-USBU' editor in chief,  Hammadi said the reopening of Umm Qasr port in the Gulf will not  affect the transportation of Iraqi imports and continued  commercial activity via al-Aqabah Port. He said Umm Qasr port  was operational during the Iran-Iraq war but this did not affect  the flow of goods to Iraq via al-'Aqabah port in Jordan.    The Iraqi information minister said: The reopening of Umm  Qasr port confirms Iraq's right to make the appropriate  decisions and repair everything destroyed by war. It also  confirms Iraq's determination to break the chains of the  blockade imposed against it. The decision to allow imports via  Iraqi ports will also encourage major shipping companies to ship  directly to Iraq to unload the goods that are allowed to be  imported.    Hammadi underlined Iraq's strong desire to continue to  receive its imports via al-'Aqabah port, particularly the  imports shipped by big vessels with a load capacity of over  30,000 tonnes. He said even after repairing and expanding the  port, and overcoming the silt problem, Umm Qasr port can only  receive vessels with a load capacity between 20,000 and 30,000  tonnes, particularly those arriving from Pakistan and India.  The distance from these countries to Umm Qasr port, he said, is  shorter than that to al-'Aqabah.    The information minister said certain shipping companies are  worried about sending their vessels to Umm Qasr because they  think the area between al-Bakr harbor and Umm Qasr port is  dotted with mines and because of higher insurance costs.    Hammadi also talked about the Iraqi Government's positive  attitude toward former British Prime Minister Edward Heath and  other European figures who visited Iraq recently to secure the  release of prisoners. He said: These people who wagered on  the collapse of Iraq and who thought that its capitulation was  only a matter of time have come back to show repentance and  admit that the regime is strong and so is Iraq.    He added: We cannot turn back those people, who, we think,  have begun to understand the suffering of and injustice  inflicted on Iraq and the effect the blockade is having on its  people. We responded favorably to them on humanitarian grounds  and we hope they will make their voices heard to their  governments and to the officials and people in their countries  in the hope that awareness may move to end the injustice and  repression against Iraq.    The Iraqi information minister praised the good relations  between the Iraqi and Turkish peoples. He said: We sensed from  the brothers in Turkey -- including party, professional, and  trade union leaders and parliamentarians -- only sincere  feelings toward us. We have trade links with Turkey. We expect  an increase in trade links between the two countries through the  thousands of trucks that enter Iraq with foodstuffs. They  barter these goods for gasoline and kerosene, which they take to  sell in Turkey. We hope these convoys will continue to supply  particularly foodstuffs and medicine, to help lessen the burden  on the Iraqi people that is caused by the blockade,    Hammadi adds: Some 50,000 people live in the Diyarbakir  area. Cafes, restaurants, hotels, and resorts can be built on a  120-km stretch of road to serve drivers and truck convoys. It  is expected that between 17,000 and 20,000 trucks loaded with  goods, particularly rice and legumes, will enter Iraq daily.  Trade links with the Diyarbakir area date back more than 50  years and Iraq used to import legumes, particularly good quality  peas, from that area.    Asked about his expectations on the resumption of Iraqi oil  exports via Turkey, Hammadi said: Al-Bakr harbor, which extends  25 km into the sea, is ready to receive tankers and export oil.  The harbor was repaired and made ready for work two years ago.  As for exports via Turkey, Turkey alone can answer this  question and determine the date.    Asked about lifting the unjust blockade and Iraq's  compliance  with the UN resolutions, and whether there were still any  requests which Iraq has to fulfill, the information minister  said Iraq has implemented all UN Security Council resolutions.  He said it is time now to lift the blockade imposed on Iraq  and we expect matters to become clear in February.    Asked about recent U.S. moves to secure a UN Security  Council  resolution calling on Iraq to recognize Kuwait and stop action  against the opposition, Hammadi said: We understood from UN  envoy Ekeus that there are no appendices or new conditions to  the UN Security Council resolutions, which introduced and  maintained the sanctions against Iraq. We will have to wait and  see what they say in the next meeting which, as I have said,  will be held in February. The blockade will, God wiling, erode;  this is only a matter of time.    At the conclusion of the interview, Hammadi said he is proud  of the position of Jordan--king, government, and people. He  asked us to convey his greetings to the Jordanians, whose blood  was mixed with the blood of the Iraqis.     "

Dubinskaya, ``Name Obliges'']    [Text] One of the methods of improving the well-being of  Moscow's 120 self-financed hospitals is affiliation with  commercial structures. Compared to medical service fees abroad  (75,000 dollars or higher), 500,000 rubles for two weeks in a  boarding house, an examination by one of the medical  luminaries--ophthalmologist Academician Arkadiy Nesterov--and  treatment or bloodless liver operation using Western practices  is a negligible amount. Yet it is still out of reach for  80% of  Russian citizens.    To improve free service to indigent patients in the  hospital's self-financing wards, Clinical Hospital No. 15 in  Vykhino found a reliable source of ``off-budget'' financing--the  ``Avicenna'' Russian-Syrian joint venture (SP). In 1988, the  hospital became its principal stockholder after acquiring  69%  of the shares. Here, top-notch service and treatment are offered  to the well-off, while the resulting resources ``work'' for the  entire hospital complex.    The positive impact from such interaction is indisputable.  Deputy Director of Moscow's Chief Medical Administration  Aleksandr Lukashev commented thus on the outlook for cooperation  with commercial structures:    ``No obvious disaster with medical service can be foreseen  at  the capital's hospitals since budget allocations with a 2.5-fold  ``padding'' for inflation on a quarter-to-quarter basis amounted  to 65 billion rubles during the summer (it was 15 billion at the  start of the year--A.D.). Yet despite future centralized  shipments of powerful antibiotics, anti-cancer preparations, and  equipment to the clinics under direct contracts with various  companies, there is still a shortage of anesthetic drugs and  ultrasonic and endoscopic equipment. Consequently, we are  supporting any form of property in public health--sole  proprietorship or joint-stock companies--which provide medical  assistance at a proper level and advance Moscow's health  services.''

The report suggests there will be an increased  demand for services via ""intelligent satellites"" capable of  high-level communication functions as a result of rapid  expansion in the use of multimedia and cellular telephones. It  recommendsefforts toward developing essential technology under  an international cooperative effort between Japan, the United  States, and Europe.    The report predicts that the early 21st century will witness  fixed stations on earth that are linked by high-volume  communication optical fiber cable networks, and a much higher  level of importance for communication satellites because of a  rapid expansion of demand for cellular telephones, personal  communication systems and multimedia. It also suggests the need  to develop multifunctional satellites capable of handling image  transmissions for multimedia and cellular phone services.    The report analyzes that the key to development of  ""intelligent satellites"" with such capabilities will involve 1)  Technology to operate repeaters at a low voltage; 2) Technology  to transmit and process image signals efficiently, and 3)  Standardization and mass production of parts. The report also  covers the importance of launching many low-orbiting satellites  to build a network. The report also stresses the need for  international coordination among advanced nations to promote  standardization and the effective use of satellites, although  that Japan, the United States, and Europe currently are  developing next-generation communication satellites  independently.

He went on to say that the liberation movements, following  the elimination of colonialism and racism have become states and  the enemies of yesterday which are forgetting their unholy  alliance with colonialism and racism, try to woo these states  and offer assistance to them while trying to forget that the  blockade imposed on the great socialist People's Libyan Arab  Jamahiriyah was caused by its support and assistance for the  African liberation movements.

The secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign  Liaison and International Cooperation appeal to the sisterly  states, friendly countries, the conscience of the world, the  intellectuals and jurists in the world to tackle and confront  this flagrant violation for the international law and the United  Nations Charter so that the Security Council may not be  transformed [word indistinct] council against smaller countries.

The  joint venture is between the Vietnamese Ministry of Transport  and Communications and the Port and Gas Consortium of the  Netherlands.    The Netherlands is one of the largest investors in Vietnam.  At present, it has nine projects with total capitalization of  $227 million, ranking it eighth among 42 countries in investment  capital. It follows Taiwan, Hong Kong, France, Australia, South  Korea, Japan, and Britain.    Most of the Dutch investment is in oil and gas, light  industry, and tourism.    Speaking to the media in Hanoi on October 12, Dutch  Transport  Minister Maij-Weggen said that under the agreement on air  services signed with Vietnam Airlines, KLM will operate two  flights weekly from Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh City and expand  services to Hanoi.    Maij-Weggen said: Developments in Vietnam are taking place  rapidly. In the next few years, it will be faced with difficult  choices with which we, in Holland, are all too familiar,  especially in your densely populated coastal areas. The  available water is used in many different ways. In densely  populated areas, for drinking water, for industry, and for  fishing. On the other hand, water forms an invaluable transport  artery. [Word indistinct] water management is therefore  essential in order to allow all of these typical activities.  Without being immodest, I think I can say that Holland has  something to offer here.    Vietnam is striving to draw more investment capital for  infrastructure construction, primarily for transportation and  postal services.    By October 1993, the State Committee for Cooperation and  Investment has granted licenses to 22 transportation and postal  services projects with total capitalization of $432 million.     "

With German  aid, five local organizations for water supply and sewage plants  will be set up. In addition, a project to improve waste disposal  in the Gaza Strip is being prepared. By the end of 1992, the  territories occupied by Israel were granted development aid  totaling 173 million German marks [DM]. In addition, there is  Germany's share of DM185 million in aid granted by the European  Community. Last year, the Federal Ministry of Economic  Cooperation and Development made a new pledge of DM36.2 million.  Of this sum, DM15 million will go to drinking water supply  projects in Nablus and Ramallah. The UN Relief and Works Agency  for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) received DM14.5  million from Bonn. The current projects include a vocational  school in Beit Hania, a polytechnical school in Hebron, and a  waste disposal project in Bethlehem. Projects of church and  private organizations and of political foundations are also  promoted. Development cooperation has in the past been faced  with the problem that, because there is no state as a partner,  communities must be won over for individual projects. The Bonn  Development Aid Ministry says, however, that this has restricted  the volume of possible aid.

More than 3,000 overseas business people from over 50  countries and regions are expected to take part in the fair  where a vast range of export commodities will be on display.    Jointly sponsored by eight north-eastern provinces and  cities, including Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and  the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the fair will be the  biggest of the sort staged so far in China, according to an  official leading the Liaoning trade delegation.    The three provinces in northeast China and the Inner  Mongolia  have jointly staged seven such fairs since 1987, with a total  trade volume of about 3.3 billion U.S. dollars and cooperative  projects signed worth about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.    Commodities to be on show include products of grain and  edible oil, hardware, minerals, garments, textiles, special  local products, arts and crafts, machinery, electronics, autos,  medical and health equipment, and non-metal products.    Products from many foreign-funded joint ventures will also  be  on display.    A large number of projects in energy resources, transport  and  traffic, telecommunications, real estate, business, finance and  banking, tourism and joint development of industrial parks, will  be ready for cooperation with overseas investors.    The '94 Liaoning Trade Fair for Foreign Economic and  Technological Cooperation will be held at the same time.    According to a Taiwan affairs official of Liaoning  provincial  government, the local government will give preferential  treatment to business people from Taiwan since they have shown  special interests in investment in northeast China in the past  few years.

General  Assembly circulated as its official document a statement by the  Russian Foreign Ministry in connection with the adoption by the  Latvian Parliament of a law on elections to the bodies of local  self-government.    The statement said that despite the inside and outside  criticism, the Latvian Parliament has adopted the second reading  of the draft law on the elections to the bodies of local  self-government. The draft deprives non-residents of Latvia of  not only their passive but also active franchise, introduces  language restrictions for non-ethnic Latvians (the right to run  public elections will be granted only to the candidates who pass  examinations in the Latvian language) and creates barriers (by  nationality) for the nomination of candidates in Riga and other  big cities with a large percentage of non-ethnic residents.    The statement also pointed out that Latvian lawmakers  continue to ignore recommendations by experts of the Council of  Europe and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  (CSCE), including CSCE Supreme Commissioner for Ethnic  Minorities Max van der Stoel who consider as inadmissible the  removal of non-residents who account for a considerable part of  the country's population (several hundred thousand people) from  participation in local self- government.    Because Russia's position at the bilateral talks has  received  no response from its partners, the Russian Foreign Ministry has  to draw the attention of the world community and human rights  organisations to the growing discriminatory policy in Latvia  aimed against non-ethnic residents, primarily Russians. Before  it is too late, it is necessary to do everything possible to  prevent aggressive nationalism from thriving in the Baltics.  This will pose a threat to Europe of which Russia has  repeatedly warned, the statement said.     "

The World  Bank has thus made this problem, along with issues of population  growth, the focus of its annual spring meeting, which ended in  Washington on Tuesday [26 April]. [passage omitted]    Federal Economic Cooperation Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger,  who represented the Federal Government in Washington, pointed  out that all measures suggested by the World Bank have to be  accompanied by programs for the promotion of economic  development because only then could one tackle the economic  reasons of population growth and migratory movements. [passage  omitted]    Spranger pleaded for close cooperation between  industrialized  and development countries with the objective to ""contain  international refugee and migratory movements and make them  controllable."" In regions with a large population, drain  projects must be supported financially that diminish the reasons  for exodus and migration in the countries of origin. Support  for the reintegration of people who return to their home country  is also of preeminent importance.    Apart from the population problem, much time was spent  discussing the situation of world trade after the conclusion of  the Uruguay Round. The World Bank expects the new GATT  agreement to lead to $200-300 billion in annual income growths  worldwide. With full implementation of the agreement, one-third  of that amount would go to the developing countries. However,  it is to be expected that not all countries will participate  equally. Minister Spranger stated that this is why he strongly  suggested that the World Bank and the IMF provide particular  support to those countries that benefit only marginally from the  GATT round.

Seoul and Washington have agreed to  hold a working-level body to improve U.S. procedures on  investigation of anti-dumping practices of Korean exporters, a  ministry official said.    The agreement was reached at the close of three days of  Korea-U.S. talks at the Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC)  in Washington Thursday. The two sides also reached an agreement  to conclude a pact on exemption of social security tax on  businessmen working in the United States.    The official said that the United States accepted the  request  by Korea it improve unfair U.S. investigation procedures in  connection with alleged anti-dumping practices by Korean  commodity exporters. Korean companies have suffered from  frequent anti-dumping probes.    The two sides also decided to launch working-level  negotiations to work out an agreement on exemption of social  security tax. Korean businessmen have complained that they are  forced to pay security tax on their income in the United States.    The United States has agreed to arrange a dialogue channel  between U.S. and Korean constructors to solve the difficulties  Koreans experience, such as non-recognition of Korean  constructors' performance in third countries and obligatory  deposits of excessive amount of money for construction work in  the United States. The two sides also agreed to strengthen  cooperation between tax administration bodies to prevent  unreasonable imposition of taxes on Korean firms.    A final report on discussion of bilateral economic issues  will be reported to a meeting of the Korea-U.S. economic  consultative council slated for June in Washington, the official  said.     "

He said an Australian energy mission will visit Manila in  May  to coincide with the first meeting of the proposed joint working  group on energy.    ""We expect it (mission) to find a lot of trade opportunities  for Australia... and provide opportunities for the Philippines  to take initiatives to resolve its energy situation,"" McMullan  told reporters at the airport before leaving Manila on Saturday  [19 March].    The trade official arrived on Thursday as part of a tour of  member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  and is to visit Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.    Australia had been helping the Philippines in the oil  exploration field.    Only recently, the Australian Government financed the survey  work on several prospective oil-bearing structures in the  Philippines .    The first report on the results of the survey was released  last month and pointed to the areas where oil reserves could  have accumulated over the years.    The drilling season is set to start next month and several  local and foreign oil exploration companies will be searching  for oil in offshore Palawan, Mindoro, and the Sulu Sea.    The Philippines depends on imported crude. Recent oil  discoveries have helped cut these imports. One of the country's  biggest oil strikes, the Linapacan oil field off Palawan,  initially produced at least 15,000 barrels a day until water  started to seep into the pipe.    Two foreign firms -- Shell Exploration and Occidental  Petroleum -- are working on the development of a much bigger oil  structure called the Malampaya field. This structure contains a  sizable amount of natural gas and crude oil.     "
0,FT932-17152 ,"FT932-17152 _AN-DDBB7AAYFT 930402   FT  02 APR 93 / Kurds enjoy taste of freedom under dual embargo: But at times it is bitter      By GARETH SMYTH      NORTHERN IRAQ   UNDER the protection of Allied air cover, the 3.5m Kurds of northern Iraq have built a functioning system of parliamentary government over a large swathe of Iraqi territory. But after two winters of dual embargo from both the United Nations and the Iraqi regime, they continue to face severe economic problems. Yellow and white narcissi, the symbol of spring, adorn tents, shacks and houses. The Moslem festival of Eid was celebrated with traditional dancing, song and open-air picnics in the bright sunshine. But the Kurds are deeply apprehensive about the future. Around a million live under Iraqi government control and a continuing stream of refugees from government-held areas around Mosul and Kirkuk bring tales of continuing harassment, arrests and beatings by Saddam's security forces. Two weeks after Arab Lahib tribesmen and, survivors allege, Iraqi soldiers massacred 15 Kurdish civilians on March 12 at the village of Awina - 20km south west of Arbil and just outside the Kurdish-held zone - spent Kalashnikov cartridges littered the ground outside deserted shelters, where dried blood remained splattered on the walls. The situation in the Kurdish-held cities of Arbil and Sulaymaniyah is tense. Kurdish television clumsily paraded four captured terrorists last weekend in an attempt to restore public confidence after a spate of bombings. With an automatic rifle available on the black market for only 7,000 dinas (Pounds 250) and a hand-grenade for only 30 dinas, a sizeable profit is possible for anyone willing to accept substantial payment from Iraqi agents to carry out terror missions against Kurdish civilians, UN staff or aid workers. In a move designed to place a stronger figure in charge of day-to-day administration, former guerrilla commander Abdullah 'Koosrat' Rasoul will soon replace the veteran Fua'd Ma'soum as the Kurds' 'prime minister' in the cross-party government. Mr Rasoul said: 'It is a change of faces, not of policy,' but admitted that 'everyone has his own style'. Mr Rasoul will head a cabinet of 15 ministers responsible to a Kurdish 'parliament' elected in May 1992 and dominated by the two major parties - Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party, each of whom has 50 of the 105 seats. The parliament acts as a legislative body for the 50,000sq km of northern Iraq from which Iraqi president Saddam Hussein withdrew all administration in November 1991 in response to the Allied creation of a 'security zone' to protect the Kurdish population from attacks by Iraqi troops. Iraqi laws passed before November 1991 continue in force, but those judged by the Kurdish parliament to be 'against Kurdish interests' have been frozen, and laws passed by since are not recognised. Clan and party loyalties remain strong, but there is a general culture of free debate and discussion. The parliament meets - in the former Arbil seat of the Ba'athist regional legislative council - on alternate weeks, so enabling representatives to spend half their time in the localities. A number of Kurdish TV stations offer news, views and western cartoons, and a wide range of newspapers, including the pro-Saddam Al-Iraq Al-Thaura, are on sale. Mr Rasoul identifies security as his top priority. Although a regular police force has been established, the authorities have been only partly successful in merging the guerrilla forces of the various Kurdish parties under a single military command. Control of the borders with neighbouring states is patchy, and a spate of bombings and attacks on UN staff are blamed on Iraqi government agents. Fully three quarters of government revenue is from 'customs levies', mainly from trade passing through Kurdish-held territory between Turkey and the Iraqi-controlled city of Mosul. The deficit on the 1993 budget is expected to be between 25 and 30 per cent of total revenue. The rebuilding of the 4,000 villages destroyed in Mr Saddam's 'Anfal' operation or in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war is painfully slow. The Kurdish leadership has exhorted the population to return to their farms and so ease the dependence on western aid. While more land is under cultivation than last spring - and more sheep and goats graze on the hillside - productivity is diminished by a shortage of fertiliser. Inflation is around 35 per cent and the Iraqi dina has halved its value against the dollar in one year. All spare parts are scarce. Power cuts occur daily. Few people are gainfully employed and most factories are closed. While bus services function between the bigger cities, only local telephone calls are possible. Some Kurdish leaders admit privately their fear of social unrest. But although many ordinary Kurds raise complaints about unequal distribution of aid and government benefits, they retain a belief that the Kurdish government is 'doing its best'. There is no appetite for accepting Mr Saddam's offer first made in November 1992 to lift the economic embargo in return for renewed negotiations over Kurdish 'autonomy' from Baghdad.

The dispatch is in line with a request from U.N. Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali made late February to send Japanese  personnel to monitor the March 20 presidential and parliamentary  elections, the officials said.    A peace agreement was signed in January 1992 after a  decade-long ""proxy war"" in El Salvador between the right-wing  government, backed by the United States, and leftist guerrillas,  supported by the former Soviet Union.    In a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo  last November, El Salvador's President Alfredo Felix Christiani  asked Japan to send voting monitors for the elections.    The 15-member Japanese team, comprising three from the  Foreign Ministry, one from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and  11 from the private sector, will join a 900-member U.N. unit to  oversee the polls in the Central American country.    All the Japanese members are proficient in speaking Spanish,  the officials said.    The Japanese team is scheduled to work in El Salvador until  March 31, but its stay may be extended until May 10 if no  candidate wins a majority of votes to become president and vice  president and a reelection is called to pick the two top leaders  of the nation.    El Salvador will be the third country to which Japan sends  election observers in accordance with the U.N. Peacekeeping  Cooperation Law, following Angola and Cambodia.    The 1992 law stipulates that to send election monitors  overseas the government must confirm three necessary conditions  -- a declared cease-fire, agreements by parties concerned to  accept such personnel and assured neutrality in the country.

In a statement published by London-based AL-WASAT magazine,  carried yesterday by the UAE's news agency, UAE's Minister of  state for foreign affairs Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan said his  country, along with the other GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council]  member states, would remain keen on establishing good relations  with Iran.    But it will never accept the policy of threats and  occupation, he said.    As the UAE will never give up even one span of its  territories, then the problem of the three islands will  constitute an obstacle before normalizing relations with Iran,  he said.    If the Iranians have the historical documents which prove  their ownership of the three islands, then they should present  them before the international justice court, he said and added  'we will accept the verdict issued by the international court'.    Al Nuhayyan pointed out that refusal of Iran to arbitration  would mean that it has no sovereignty on the three islands.    On the problem of Yemen, Al Nuhayyan said his country does  not support any of the conflicting parties in Yemen.    He noted that the UAE had mediated to settle the Yemeni  dispute before the break-out of the war between Sanaa and Aden.    We have shown our keenness on Yemeni unity, but we believe  that this unity should not come by means of force, he said  highlighting the assistance extended by the UAE to Yemen before  the announcement of the unity.    Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the president of the  UAE, has made it clear to the Yemeni leaders that unity cannot  be imposed by force, he said.     "

It is  said that the United States has a special foundation for  cooperation with different countries in this field.    Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs George Andrejevs and  Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis took part in the meeting,  where the NATO cooperation program ""Partnership for Peace"" was  also discussed. G. Andrejevs confirmed Latvia's readiness to  participate in this program; there is already a group of  specialists prepared to begin work on this program. U.S.  representatives have expressed the view that the ""Partnership  for Peace"" program might stimulate mutual cooperation among the  Baltic States in the field of security, and have advised Latvia  to participate in joint military maneuvers in 1994 in the  framework of this program.    Both Latvian ministers acquainted their guests with the main  points of the Latvian security concept. A. Andrejevs expressed  anxiety concerning Latvia's security during the Skrunda radar  station activities, which could cause various misunderstandings  and incidents. The U.S. side responded that in the event of  danger Latvia can consult NATO, taking advantage of ""Partnership  for Peace."" The head of the U.S. delegation explained that  America understands Latvia's anxiety in regard to its safety,  and therefore contacts for mutual cooperation are being  established. In addition, the United States is interested in  long term cooperation with Latvia.    V. Pavlovskis spoke about financial problems in the defense  forces. The U.S. delegation said that limited financial support  can also be expected from NATO. This organization could, in the  future, support the Latvian mission and cover expenses of joint  military maneuvers.     "

PLO relations with Riyadh and with the other  members of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] deteriorated as a  result of the PLO's support for Iraq's attack on Kuwait and its  occupation of Kuwait; and this has had a detrimental impact on  the PLO.    The GCC member states stopped their financial assistance to  the PLO because of its stance in the oil war. Some 600,000  Palestinians living in the Persian Gulf shaykhdoms were placed  under severe pressure and about half of them had to return to  Jordan. The voluntary tax, based on an agreement among the  countries in the Arab League and levied on the Palestinians and  deposited in the PLO's bank account, has been blocked. PLO  officials allege that all these problems have led to a financial  crisis for the PLO. Six months ago the PLO started warning of a  financial crisis and stopped paying benefits to the families of  Palestinian martyrs and the salaries of part of its military  forces in Lebanon.    According to a PLO-Saudi Arabian agreement, during his visit  to Riyadh 'Arafat will meet Saudi King Fahd. This meeting will  probably be the prologue to an improvement in Saudi-PLO  relations. Since 'Arafat approached Israel and the United States  four months ago with the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord, PLO  relations with GCC members have started to improve gradually and  PLO embassies have been set up in all the GCC member states  except Kuwait.    'Arafat's current trip to Riyadh will probably pave the way  for similar visits to other GCC member states.     "

Speaking after a meeting with Acting Foreign Minister of  Moldova Ion Botnaru, he said the expansion of NATO to include  new members would be a simplistic solution. Kozyrev did not  contest the right of other countries to join the alliance but  ""this could lead to the creation of new barriers in Europe if  implemented.""    In his words, Russia's voice was heeded by NATO, Eastern and  Central Europe. This is a case illustrating that a short cut is  not always optimal, leading nowhere and to wrong decisions,  Kozyrev said. By contrast, he added, a longer road can lead to  the right destination.    The minister said the Partnership for Peace proposal had  been  discussed by Yeltsin and Clinton on Thursday and that both of  them were satisfied it implied partnership rather than  membership.    Kozyrev spoke of having discussed the problem with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier in the day. ""It  is too early yet to say how the period of partnership will end,""  the minister said. ""One option is to expand NATO by accepting  new members, including Russia, something we do not rule out,"" he  said. Other options are also possible, he said, including the  creation of broader security systems and the consolidation of  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. The minister called for  efforts to be taken in parallel in all those directions but all  of these must end up in greater stability and cooperation in  Europe.    For his part, Botnaru spoke of seeing his talks with the  Russian foreign minister as a step on the road to implementing  the Partnership for Peace plan.     "

""If the ban on the import of tropical wood products is  effective, these forest products might give no economic  advantage to countries which have tropical forests, and that  they will find it difficult to conserve their forests,"" Spranger  told the press at the Sukarno-Hatta airport a moment before he  left for home.    Environmentalists in the United States and Europe have  proposed that their governments impose a ban on the import of  tropical wood products from developing countries.    Spranger said he had seen for himself Indonesia's  well-planned efforts to conserve its forests without necessarily  sacrificing the ecosystem.    It was natural for Indonesia which had huge tropical forests  to utilize its natural resources, including tropical forests, he  said.    Earlier, Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo briefed  the German minister on the management of Indonesian tropical  forests. Spranger also visited tropical forests in East  Kalimantan during his stay.    According to Spranger, the Indonesian Government was  determined to conserve its tropical forests while exploiting  part of them to gain foreign exchange earnings.    He said he was in support of Indonesia's efforts to  disseminate objective information on the management of tropical  forests in developing countries.    In 1993, Indonesia exported an estimated nine million cubic  meters of tropical wood worth U.S.$6.5 billion. Japan was the  biggest market for Indonesian tropical wood, followed by the  United States and European countries.    Spranger said Germany was prepared to provide the Indonesian  Government with technical assistance to manage its tropical  forests.     "

Noting in his letter that the amir ""always has concern for  the higher interests of the country and the national interests  of the Arab and Islamic nation,"" Shaykh Al Thani says: ""With his  reckless statements and irresponsible acts that demonstrate  great vanity and arrogance, the foreign minister has destroyed  Qatar's foreign policy and been a dismal failure, for which he  deserves questioning and dismissal."" The letter also accuses  the minister of destroying the domestic economy as he worked ""to  serve his personal interests, disregarding the nation's economic  interests.""    The report goes on to say the letter, ""which reveals a  serious split in the royal family"" is the second of its kind  since the beginning of the year. It was distributed among some  circles in Qatar and the other Gulf Cooperation Council  countries when the country was hosting the multilateral talks on  Middle East disarmament on 2-3 May, in which Israel  participated. It says the first letter, in which Shaykh Al  Thani ""condemned the foreign minister's meetings with Israeli  ministers and officials at the United Nations and in London,""  was sent to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and to Arab and  foreign embassies in Doha.

Next year the country will get 30  million guilders in financial aid, twice the amount from last  year. The priority for the aid will be the democratization  process, education, ""marginalized"" youth and employment.    This was stated in a document sent to Parliament yesterday  by  Foreign Minister Kooijmans, Development Cooperation Minister  Pronk, and Economic Affairs State Secretary Van Rooy. The  Netherlands will normalize its relations with South Africa when  a new government has been formed on the basis of the  parliamentary elections of 26, 27, and 28 April.    The ministers' document covers political relations, economic  relations, development cooperation, and cultural relations with  South Africa. The ministers stressed that the precise form  would depend above all on developments in the near future. They  have full confidence that a normal relation could be built up  with the country because the Netherlands ""has historical and  cultural links [with South Africa] and has built up good  contacts with future leaders by its active attitude in the fight  against apartheid.""    The Netherlands will also enter a development relationship  with South Africa. To date, aid was passed only through private  organizations. The cabinet said that it would be necessary  before the end of the year to consult the new South African  Government about the policies. South Africa is classed as a  country in transition, and consequently will receive no  large-scale or long-term aid.    Netherlands companies will be encouraged to invest in the  ""South African economy, which in principle is very promising.""  Among the options are the exchange of trade and investment  delegations and -- ""when the time is ripe"" -- more flexible  policies on export credit insurance.     "
0,FT942-2950 ,"FT942-2950 _AN-EFQDGAAWFT 940617   FT  17 JUN 94 / 'Play along' with money laundering, OECD says      By DAVID BUCHAN   Banks should 'play along' with money-launderers, in co-operation with police, to maximise the chances of catching them and seizing their assets, officials of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday. The officials were commenting on the latest annual report by the OECD's Financial Action Task Force on money laundering. This is the practice of legitimising ill-gotten gains from drug-trafficking and other forms of crime by investing them in legitimate assets or businesses, and concealing the money's origin by shifting it through several institutions. The FATF's chairman, Mr John Gieve, a senior UK Treasury official, said some progress had been made in the past year in the fight against money-laundering. A key recommendation of the task force is that banks report suspicions, either to the police or to specialist bodies in some countries, such as the Tracfin unit in the French Finance Ministry. 'We obviously can't force a financial institution to accept a transaction that involves suspect money,' said an official of the FATF. 'But law enforcement authorities now realise the benefits of letting money-launderers deposit their money and tracking them and it. 'The problem with turning the money away is that this alerts the money-launderers that they have been detected, and they are capable of learning from their mistakes.' At a separate conference organised yesterday by the Paris Criminology Institute, Mr Andre Levy-Lang, president of the Paribas investment bank said his bank had co-operated with Tracfin 'in several cases'. 'When we alert Tracfin, they sometimes tell us to accept the money and then help us run the case,' Mr Levy-Lang said. Banque Nationale de Paris said that it had recently co-operated with authorities on 'sting' operations.   Countries:-  QMZ  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

""Unfortunately we were informed that some mistake had  occurred during the operation of the Turkish fighters in  northern Iraq last Friday, and resulted in losses in man and  material on Iran. We are deeply sorry for the incident,"" Cetin  told IRNA in an interview here.    He said relations between the two countries are so strong  and  friendly which can settle all the difficulties. No issue can  affect the two countries' relations, he added, stressing ""there  was no intention behind the incident.""    Peoples of Iran and Turkey have been living together without  any unpleasant problems for centuries, besides, expansion of  Tehran-Ankara cooperation not only would serve the interests of  the two nations, but would have very positive impacts on the  regional developments, Cetin said.    Turkish warplanes attacked bases of the opposition  guerrillas  110 kms. deep inside Iraq last Friday, during which rural areas  in Sardasht border region were also bombed, and 28 Iranians were  killed and wounded.    In addition to the two countries cooperation within the  Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), Cetin said  implementation of the gas transfer projects from Central Asia to  Turkey and Europe via Iran, as well as transfer of the Iranian  gas to the world markets via Turkey would play a major role in  the expansion of ties and cooperation between the two countries.    Iranian Ambassador to Turkey Mohammad Reza Baqeri met with  Cetin earlier in the day and conveyed a message from Iranian  Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati on the issue.    Velayati in his message stressed that Iran really expects  the  Turkish Government to compensate for the losses in addition to  making a formal apology over the incident.     "

Naturally in the  first place this will concern Rwandan refugees, but Tanzania,  which has the largest refugee camp on its territory, can also  count on aid.    The aid has already been approved in principle, but will now  be paid out in practice. Four organizations (Doctors Without  Frontiers, Caritas, the Red Cross, and Oxfam-Belgium) will  assign the funds. Since they have already incurred considerable  expenses before the money has reached their bank accounts, the  government is also promising to reimburse any bank interest  charges.    In addition to the large amount of BFr100 million in direct  aid, it has also been decided to release BFr14 million in order  to rebuild Tanzania's food stocks. These strategic stocks have  recently fallen very sharply. The aim is to supply the  equivalent of some 4,000 tonnes of grain which will be used for  both the Tanzanian population and Rwandan refugees.    A similar amount will be spent to dig water wells in the  regions where the refugees are located. By sending aid to the  local population and the refugees, the organizations hope to  avoid tension between the two groups.    The State Secretariat for Development Cooperation has  announced that further emergency aid will be approved as soon as  new project proposals have been received. The money will be  taken out of the existing emergency aid fund (which increased to  BFr500 million in 1994) and the structural aid fund to Rwanda.  The State Secretariat believes that this trend toward increased  emergency aid spending is regrettable, but that it can not be  avoided at this moment.     "

Ghaffari: ""PRC-Iran:  Strategic Cooperation in the Future""]    [15 Mar 94 p 4]    [Excerpts] Qian Qichen, deputy prime minister of the PRC,  who is also the foreign minister, made a regional trip and  visited Bangladesh, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and the  Islamic Republic of Iran. His trip to Iran was the most  significant of all and it elicited much attention from political  circles. Within the context of the PRC foreign minister's visit  to Iran, we can look at the long-standing relations between the  two countries and the trend toward broadening political and  economic relations, as the PRC Government has always had  friendly relations with Iran, even in the distant past.  [passage omitted]    Even though in recent years, cooperation between the PRC and  Iran has increased remarkably, it appears that there is greater  scope for joint economic cooperation. There is evidence of the  two countries' eagerness to expand these relations and the PRC  has focused its attention on the Islamic Republic of Iran  because it is a large and important country in the Persian Gulf,  southwest Asia and the Middle East, which can play an important  role in regional developments as a political balance.    Reciprocally, as regards its foreign policy calculations,  Iran considers the PRC a major country that is undergoing the  greatest economic prosperity of the century and one that enjoys  immense scope for maneuvering in the political arena of today.    The turmoil in the world prior to the Cold War and the  elimination of tensions generated by the end to the Cold War;  the U.S. domination in the world by a minority [as published];  and the new world order as propounded by the United States are  the various phenomena that have heightened the sensitivity of  Iran and the PRC so that the two countries have attained  unanimity through greater historical understanding and political  acumen with regard to the political developments in the region.  [passage omitted]    As regards the use of nuclear energy in Iran, the United  States has fomented tension in the region, implying that the PRC  has initiated measures to transfer technology to Iran which is  not for economic advantages but for military and political  objectives. However, regardless of the tumultuous uproar in the  world spearheaded by the United States regarding Iran's program  of peaceful and amicable utilization of nuclear energy , the PRC  continues its cooperation with Iran. What has been termed  PRC-Iranian nuclear cooperation has generated much concern on  the part of the Pentagon.    The U.S. apprehension can be viewed in the context of two  perceptions: first, remarks by Iranian officials have raised  questions about Iran's commitment to the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty and second, the Middle East and the  Persian Gulf are regions in which the use of nuclear weapons  would be extremely destabilizing. However, the United States,  with its usual erroneous appraisals in foreign policy and for  reasons of security and intelligence, is not inclined to  elaborate on the nuclear issue in relation to Iran, Pakistan,  DPRK, and India.    Perhaps, according to the perceptions of the Pentagon  echelons, the presence of nuclear weapons in the Middle East can  be a useful lever and a pretext to exert pressure on these  countries at sensitive junctures. However, the vigilant nations  that have thrown off the shackles of colonialism and  exploitation are well aware that the usurpist Jerusalem regime  is the sole nuclear power in the Middle East and it even opposes  inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. No  Western or American government has ever protested against this  regime. However, the United States audaciously declares that  Iran's acquisition of nuclear capability may not be imminent but  the United States has its own assessment upon which it is not  willing to elaborate. It also has no reason to believe that  there is no cooperation between Iran and the PRC as regards a  military-nuclear program.    Simultaneously, the U.S. mass media launched a coordinated  propaganda program with similar reports that Iran is seeking to  gain a nuclear capability and has the benefit of the PRC's  cooperation and collaboration! The United States has constantly  used the lever of pressure on various countries so that it can  impede their paths of broadening cooperation with Iran. The  PRC, which wishes to have deep and principled relations with  Iran and in numerous cases pursues an independent policy on the  international scene, has constantly been the target of U.S.  blackmail. The United States has admitted to exerting pressure  on various countries to prevent their cooperation with Iran in  the field of nuclear technology and this is only the tip of the  iceberg.    [16 Mar 94 p 4]    After the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the United States  directed most of its efforts toward destroying relations between  the Islamic Republic of Iran and other countries and isolating  Iran in the international arena. This can be considered an  unchangeable characteristic of U.S. policies.    Political circles have described Iran's gaining nuclear  capability as an extremely destabilizing factor in the Middle  East, adding that the report of nuclear cooperation between Iran  and the PRC is being disseminated just when those who  participated in the Madrid peace conference have been sentenced  to death! [as published] In the same vein, a U.S. nuclear  expert stated that Iran and Pakistan have crossed the line  toward the acquisition of nuclear weapons and Iraq has done a  lot of research in the nuclear field. Had it not been for the  Persian Gulf war, Iraq would have succeeded in manufacturing a  nuclear bomb.    U.S. intelligence officials have apparently reached the  conclusion that Iran is seriously and actively seeking to  produce nuclear weapons and the PRC is assisting it in this  regard. In conjunction with this clamor, THE NEW YORK TIMES  commented under the title of ""Hot Oil"" saying: Most of the  leaders of the Islamic Revolution are in favor of gaining access  to nuclear weapons and a cautious assessment on the part of the  intelligence sources indicates that Iran's nuclear program is  currently noncohesive and in its rudimentary stages. The PRC  has considerable capability in nuclear technology and the  Beijing authorities have officially admitted to the sale of this  technology to Iraq, Algeria, and Pakistan.    The same newspaper described Beijing-Tehran relations as  extremely cordial, adding that in the past 10-12 years, the PRC  has sold large quantities of weapons to Iran. Tokyo and Moscow  did not wish to lag behind in being affected by this rumor and  expressed concern over PRC-Iran cooperation in the nuclear  field! They stated that if the above were true they would be  forced to take appropriate measures!    It is worth mentioning that regarding social and cultural  relations as well as in its political balances, the PRC keeps  the necessary considerations in mind. This is borne out by the  fact that on the controversial issue of exporting nuclear  technology to Iran, the PRC stressed that in its exports it  firmly ensures adherence to the principles of the IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency], including the peaceful  utilization of nuclear technology and non-transfer to a third  country.    From this viewpoint, the PRC and Iran, within the framework  of mutual relations, have given priority to issues that are far  removed from the tension, blackmail, and instability in the  region. When the United States realizes that it is not able to  mar relations between Iran and the PRC, it will certainly seek  other chimerical pretexts for creating obstructions and damaging  relations between the two countries. In order to isolate Iran  and the PRC on the political and international level, the United  States accuses them of violation of human rights. The PRC is  charged with maltreatment of the Muslims in its northern  province of Sinkiang and of exporting nuclear technology to the  countries of southwest Asia.    Similarly, Iran is declared an opponent of the Middle East  peace trend and is accused of government-sponsored terrorism and  similar issues. Despite all this, the PRC and Iran have  displayed a high degree of restraint and openmindedness in their  foreign policy, which can be considered a principled course in  reciprocal relations.    The PRC foreign minister attended the 48th UN General  Assembly session, at which he described the old order as based  on unequal relations and explained that such an order was  anachronistic. He added that the world of the future should not  merely be geared to the interests and privileges of the greater  powers and international affairs should not be the monopoly of  the larger and stronger countries. Even though the United  States and the former Soviet Union had concurred on the  reduction of nuclear arms, the presence of a vast arsenal of  non-conventional weapons gives a different message. The policy  of force still prevails in the world and the greater countries  still exert economic pressure on all countries, thus seeking to  increase the chasm between the countries of the north and the  south.    The PRC believes that conditions should be created for the  development of the Third World countries to establish peace and  security in the world. Equality among governments in mutual  relations and non-intervention in their internal affairs is a  principle which--from the PRC perspective--should be applied to  all countries without exception. In this regard, the PRC  believes that a survey of the human rights situation should not  be permitted to tarnish the sovereignty of countries as human  rights and basic freedom of human beings should be applied  equally to all.

Colin Lawrence a Zululand yachtsman killed in a ""robbery"" in  Maputo, Mozambique, last week, may have been executed by  elements within the South African security establishment because  he knew too much about third force weapons smuggling between  Natal and Mozambique. Security forces told the TRIBUNE last  week that Lawrence (45) was a former special forces operator.  An investigation by the paper alleges he was also recently  involved in ivory and weapon smuggling.    A former Military Intelligence [MI] operative told the  TRIBUNE that ""you should look into the death of Lawrence.  You'll find it's just like Eugene Riley."" Riley was a former  member of the notorious CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau] and MI  and was a member of the secret Badger unit. He died  mysteriously in January. Initial reports were suicide.  However, post-mortem reports have placed doubt on the  pronouncement.    Lawrence and a friend, Ron Mitchell, were accosted in Maputo  by a group of men while walking back to their yacht from a  nightclub. The robbers allegedly demanded money but shot  Lawrence as he was reaching for his wallet. Allegations of  Lawrence's involvement in shady activities surfaced last year at  the trial of former Howick yacht owner Mark Cronje, who was  charged with fraud for deliberately sinking his boat. In  September, Cronje phoned the TRIBUNE, saying he was still being  threatened and he wanted to leave the country. He said he had  information about arms deals and a covert military training base  in Southern Natal. Afterwards, he disappeared and all efforts  to find him failed. This week Cronje's parents said he and his  family left for the United States in November.     "

""If the ban on the import of tropical wood products is  effective, these forest products might give no economic  advantage to countries which have tropical forests, and that  they will find it difficult to conserve their forests,"" Spranger  told the press at the Sukarno-Hatta airport a moment before he  left for home.    Environmentalists in the United States and Europe have  proposed that their governments impose a ban on the import of  tropical wood products from developing countries.    Spranger said he had seen for himself Indonesia's  well-planned efforts to conserve its forests without necessarily  sacrificing the ecosystem.    It was natural for Indonesia which had huge tropical forests  to utilize its natural resources, including tropical forests, he  said.    Earlier, Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo briefed  the German minister on the management of Indonesian tropical  forests. Spranger also visited tropical forests in East  Kalimantan during his stay.    According to Spranger, the Indonesian Government was  determined to conserve its tropical forests while exploiting  part of them to gain foreign exchange earnings.    He said he was in support of Indonesia's efforts to  disseminate objective information on the management of tropical  forests in developing countries.    In 1993, Indonesia exported an estimated nine million cubic  meters of tropical wood worth U.S.$6.5 billion. Japan was the  biggest market for Indonesian tropical wood, followed by the  United States and European countries.    Spranger said Germany was prepared to provide the Indonesian  Government with technical assistance to manage its tropical  forests.     "

BUT CHINA, TAIWAN AND HONG KONG AREN'T INCLUDED.      By NORMAN KEMPSTER and SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      CANBERRA, Australia      Leaders of 12 Pacific Rim nations, unanimously proclaiming their support for  free trade, agreed Tuesday to take a coordinated approach to the current round  of international trade talks and scheduled two more annual ministerial  conferences.    At the conclusion of a three-day meeting in the Australian capital, foreign and  economic ministers of the 12 nations agreed to meet again next year in  Singapore in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of that country's  independence and in 1991 in South Korea. But they put off a decision on  establishing a permanent Asia-Pacific structure.    They also deferred a decision on inviting China, Taiwan and Hong Kong -- all  conspicuously absent from this first government-level attempt to promote  Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's minister of  trade and industry, said invitations to any of the three increasingly  influential Chinese economies to next summer's meeting were ""very much in  doubt.""    A U.S. official said later that it would be awkward to include China so soon  after the suppression of the pro-democracy movement last June, and that Hong  Kong and Taiwan could not be invited without China.    The results, although extremely modest, were all that U.S. officials had  expected before the conference began. Secretary of State James A. Baker III  declared the meeting a success.    ""I don't know whether I would use the term historic yet, but I think this has  the potential to qualify for that type of description,"" Baker said at a news  conference attended by 21 ministers from the 12 countries.    ""We made substantial progress, real results. We have agreed upon a process. It  is quite clear that we haven't completed all of the decisions that hopefully we  will ultimately take in order to improve economic cooperation in the Pacific.  But this is, in my view at least, a very clear and substantial step forward  toward the improvement of international economic relations, in general, and it  should be welcomed worldwide.""    Referring to a commitment to liberalize trade and fight protectionism that the  12 enunciated in a communique, Baker said the new grouping ""can deal with  (American) trade imbalances that have existed and continue to exist"" with Japan  as well as with others in the group.    The 12 also pledged to reduce impediments to trade among themselves.    Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, said the inaugural session of what  is being called APEC (for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) had produced ""not  just rhetorical feathers but lots of meat as well.""    The most specific commitment for cooperation called for trade ministers of the  12 countries to meet in September, 1990, and again in early December to work  together to remove any last-minute obstacles to a successful conclusion of the  Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations that must be concluded by the  end of next year.    These two meetings, along with the annual ministerial meeting next summer of  the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Singapore APEC conference,  guarantee that top officials of the 12 countries will meet at least four times  next year.    ASEAN, composed of the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and  Malaysia, holds annual consultations with ministers from the United States,  Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand following its own regular meeting.  Starting next year, South Korea will attend the post-ASEAN consultations.    All 12 of those nations were represented at the Canberra meeting, which  Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke called in an effort to set up what might  become an Asian equivalent of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development.    On a lower level, the 12 nations agreed to assign officials to begin work on  two technical projects and study a host of proposals for more than a dozen  other cooperative ventures. U.S. officials said this process, intended to  remove impediments to international business, may be the most important outcome  of the meeting.    Throughout the conference, the United States and Japan went out of their way to  avoid offending the ASEAN nations, who had feared that their regional  cooperation might be swallowed up by a new and bigger grouping. A compromise  was struck by refraining from setting up any new fixed organization to carry on  APEC projects and, instead, assigning officials from each country to work with  the ASEAN secretariat to draw up plans for next summer's ministerial meeting in  Singapore.    A senior U.S. official said Washington came to the meeting with five modest  objectives and achieved them all. He said they were to move the ""fragile  process"" forward, to develop a mechanism to plan future meetings, to ""lock in""  agreement to hold at least two more meetings, to develop a program of specific  projects and to ""get some specific focus on the Uruguay Round.""    In the communique, the leaders said none of them ""believes that Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation should be directed to the formation of a trading bloc""  like the European Communities.    Participants said repeatedly that their organization will be open to the rest  of the world and will not try to establish any barriers that might give an  advantage to members in their dealings with other nations.    In these circumstances, however, it is not clear what reason a nation might  have for joining the new grouping. U.S. officials said different countries will  have different reasons for participating but that the main incentive will be to  help formulate proposals to break down impediments to economic growth.

Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's minister of  trade and industry, said invitations to any of the three increasingly  influential Chinese economies to next summer's meeting were ""very much in  doubt.""    A U.S. official said later that it would be awkward to include China so soon  after the suppression of the pro-democracy movement last June, and that Hong  Kong and Taiwan could not be invited without China.    The results, although extremely modest, were all that U.S. officials had  expected before the conference began. Secretary of State James A. Baker III  declared the meeting a success.    ""I don't know whether I would use the term historic yet, but I think this has  the potential to qualify for that type of description,"" Baker said at a news  conference attended by 21 ministers from the 12 countries.    ""We made substantial progress, real results. We have agreed upon a process. It  is quite clear that we haven't completed all of the decisions that hopefully we  will ultimately take in order to improve economic cooperation in the Pacific.  But this is, in my view at least, a very clear and substantial step forward  toward the improvement of international economic relations, in general, and it  should be welcomed worldwide.""    Referring to a commitment to liberalize trade and fight protectionism that the  12 enunciated in a communique, Baker said the new grouping ""can deal with  (American) trade imbalances that have existed and continue to exist"" with Japan  as well as with others in the group.    The 12 also pledged to reduce impediments to trade among themselves.    Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, said the inaugural session of what  is being called APEC (for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) had produced ""not  just rhetorical feathers but lots of meat as well.""    The most specific commitment for cooperation called for trade ministers of the  12 countries to meet in September, 1990, and again in early December to work  together to remove any last-minute obstacles to a successful conclusion of the  Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations that must be concluded by the  end of next year.    These two meetings, along with the annual ministerial meeting next summer of  the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Singapore APEC conference,  guarantee that top officials of the 12 countries will meet at least four times  next year.    ASEAN, composed of the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and  Malaysia, holds annual consultations with ministers from the United States,  Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand following its own regular meeting.  Starting next year, South Korea will attend the post-ASEAN consultations.    All 12 of those nations were represented at the Canberra meeting, which  Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke called in an effort to set up what might  become an Asian equivalent of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development.    On a lower level, the 12 nations agreed to assign officials to begin work on  two technical projects and study a host of proposals for more than a dozen  other cooperative ventures. U.S. officials said this process, intended to  remove impediments to international business, may be the most important outcome  of the meeting.    Throughout the conference, the United States and Japan went out of their way to  avoid offending the ASEAN nations, who had feared that their regional  cooperation might be swallowed up by a new and bigger grouping. A compromise  was struck by refraining from setting up any new fixed organization to carry on  APEC projects and, instead, assigning officials from each country to work with  the ASEAN secretariat to draw up plans for next summer's ministerial meeting in  Singapore.    A senior U.S. official said Washington came to the meeting with five modest  objectives and achieved them all. He said they were to move the ""fragile  process"" forward, to develop a mechanism to plan future meetings, to ""lock in""  agreement to hold at least two more meetings, to develop a program of specific  projects and to ""get some specific focus on the Uruguay Round.""    In the communique, the leaders said none of them ""believes that Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation should be directed to the formation of a trading bloc""  like the European Communities.    Participants said repeatedly that their organization will be open to the rest  of the world and will not try to establish any barriers that might give an  advantage to members in their dealings with other nations.    In these circumstances, however, it is not clear what reason a nation might  have for joining the new grouping. U.S. officials said different countries will  have different reasons for participating but that the main incentive will be to  help formulate proposals to break down impediments to economic growth.

According to diplomatic sources, during a meeting with  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, the Vietnamese minister  expressed optimism for Cuba's economic renovation process and  emphasized that his country understood the importance of  complying with the commercial agreement agreed for the current  year.    Robaina also met with Nguyen Cong Tan, the minister of  agriculture and food industry. Both officials expressed their  satisfaction with the increasing climate of cooperation between  their countries to further mutually advantageous goals.    Cong Tan, who is also the president of the Joint  Vietnam-Cuba  Intergovernment Commission, said he endorsed the boosting of  cooperation not only in agriculture, but also in the fields of  construction, health, education, science, biotechnology, and  marine transportation, among others.    On the second day of his official visit to Vietnam, the  Cuban  foreign minister attended a meeting with Nguyen Mai, the vice  president of the State Cooperation and Investment Committee.    Mai agreed with Robaina on the need to consolidate programs  to establish joint ventures between their countries in the  construction and other areas prior to exploring other sectors.  [sentence as received]    On the last leg of his tour to South and Southeastern Asia,  the Cuban foreign minister was received by Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet yesterday and held official talks with his colleague Nguyen  Manh Cam.    Robaina, who is to meet with Do Muoi, the secretary general  of the Vietnamese Communist Party, will hold a news conference  tomorrow to summarize his Asian tour which also included  Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Burma, Cambodia, India, and Malaysia.

MATICHON's 800-word, page 2 editorial is entitled: ""The  Arrest of C-4 Bomb Suspects."" It urges the police to prove that  the three arrested suspects are real terrorists and not just  scapegoats. ""Since the suspects are foreigners listed as members  of international terrorist groups, the government should, in  order to give more weight to the arrest, seek cooperation from  the Malaysian Government for more information on the suspects as  it was found that they once lived in Malaysia.

""Iran is another  country which should be able to supply Thailand with information  about the suspects who hold Iranian passports,"" says the  editorial. It adds: ""Anyway, we cannot expect much from Iran  since it is natural that Iran would rather be cautious and try  to demonstrate that it has nothing to do with activities by  international terrorist groups.""    The paper stresses it cannot accept the fact that terrorists  have chosen to carry out their operations in Thailand. ""The  Thai Government must make it clear to the parties fighting in  this century-old war of genocide that they cannot carry out  sabotage in this country thus exposing the Thai people to  danger.

Then, Secretary General Hsu, who is  also former representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural  Representative Office in Japan, called on Japan for its  cooperation in supporting Taiwan's UN admission.    On the issue of reunification with China, Hsu pointed out:  ""While China's democratization is an indispensable factor, the  economic disparity is still too big."" ""However,"" he added,  ""exchanges at the private level have been proceeding smoothly  but in a cautious way."" Thus, he disclosed Taiwan's intention  to upgrade the level of dialogue to promote reunification.    Hsu also touched on Taiwan's achievements in the diplomatic  field. For example, President Li Teng-hui paid unofficial  visits to three ASEAN member nations last month with good  results.

Rexrodt on Thursday [18 March] discussed the issue  of closer economic cooperation with the ambassadors of ASEAN  [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries Brunei,  Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.    In the spheres of infrastructure, energy supply,  telecommunications, and environment, in particular, Rexrodt sees  opportunities to appear in Third World countries of the  Asian-Pacific area hand in hand with the ASEAN countries. These  potentials have so far been only insufficiently used, the  minister emphasized.    He briefed the ambassadors on the provision of FRG Hermes  export guarantees and the federal capital investment guarantees  for the support of direct investments. Further focal points in  the talks were the extension of information and consulting  facilities and the participation in foreign trade fairs.    In the federal economic minister's view, the ASEAN countries  determine to a large degree the economic situation in the  Asian-Pacific area. Between 1987 and 1992, German foreign trade  with the six countries doubled to 25.7 billion German marks  [DM]. According to preliminary figures, exports to the ASEAN  countries increased 7-9 percent, which is consistent with the  average annual economic growth achieved by these nations.    In late April, the minister is scheduled to visit Malaysia,  Thailand, and Taiwan. In Bangkok, he will take part in the  Asia-Pacific Conference. Rexrodt expects important impulses from  this conference for extending economic relations with the  Asian-Pacific countries.    In Germany, Rexrodt is due to meet the prime minister of  Singapore and government members from Brunei and the  Philippines. Indonesia will be the partner country at the 1995  Hannover Fair. An Asia-Pacific Forum at the fair is intended to  serve as a meeting place for business people from Asia and  German business representatives.     "

The BIS said the record issue volume in January meant that overall financing in the first quarter remained high. However, turbulence in financial markets had an impact on the composition of issues, with straight fixed-rate financing declining to its lowest quarterly level since the fourth quarter of 1992 while floating-rate issues reached their highest level ever. Equity-related issues increased by the largest amount since the second quarter of 1989. Most of the increase took place in convertible issues for borrowers from France, Japan, the Cayman Islands and the UK. French issuers accounted for almost all of the large increase in issues denominated in French francs, which rose from Dollars 200m in the fourth quarter last year to Dollars 3.3bn in the first quarter this year. The widespread increase in borrowing by OECD entities more than offset reduced borrowing by developing countries and international organisations. However, in spite of the less favourable issuing conditions created by Mexico's domestic political situation, borrowing by Mexican entities continued at a strong pace, displacing Argentina as the most important LDC borrower. In the syndicated loan market, total financing was relatively steady with Dollars 52bn of new facilities, compared with Dollars 55bn in the previous quarter. The lower volume of facilities for OECD borrowers was partially offset by higher volume for LDC borrowers, in particular large facilities arranged for Indonesian borrowers. The decline in margins on new facilities began to extend from prime names in the OECD area to other groups of borrowers, particularly Asia.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.     JPZ  Japan, Asia.

The decision was reached during the second meeting of  parties  to the Basel convention on control of transboundary movement of  hazardous wastes and disposal concluded in Geneva four days ago,  after five days of intensive debate.    A Foreign Ministry statement said here Tuesday that the  meeting also decided that the export of hazardous waste from  OECD countries, destined for recovery or recycling in non-OECD  countries, should also cease on 31 December 1997, at the latest.    The consensus was reached after long and difficult  negotiations between the Group of 77, a grouping of developing  nations and China, and leading opponent OECD countries led by  Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States, it added.    Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding,  who led the Malaysian delegation to the meeting, and his Danish  counterpart played a key role in steering the political  direction and decision in arriving at the landmark agreement, it  said.    In his address at the meeting, Law labelled the export of  hazardous waste to developing countries as environmental crime,  the statement said.    He called on the OECD countries to uphold environmental  justice and assist devaloping countries in environmental  capacity building, it said.    Law also informed the meeting about the illegal dumping of  toxic tanker sludge in Malaysian waters and the attempt to seek  exclusion of control under the Basel Convention.    He said stern enforcement action would continue to be taken  against any ship or tankers engaging in such activities in  accordance with Malaysia's interpretation of the convention.    Law warned that such ships would be detained and auctioned  under Malaysian laws.     "

""Iraq is implementing (UN Security Council) Resolution 687  and no longer has any weapons of mass destruction or the  capacity to manufacture them,"" al-Sahhaf said in an interview  shown on Qatari state television Friday.    The resolution set the terms for ending the 1991 Gulf war,  in  particular the elimination of all Baghdad's programmes for  nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.    UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four  days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990.    Al-Sahhaf accused certain members of the Security Council,  ""notably the United States,"" of prolonging the political and  economic embargo ""for political reasons totally unrelated to the  (Gulf) crisis.""    He reiterated Iraq's refusal to export some of its oil under  UN supervision, in accordance with Resolution 706.    ""This resolution cannot be applied because it has changed  from being a humanitarian resolution to a colonialist one.""    It was the second time a senior Iraqi official had appeared  on Qatari television since the Gulf crisis.    Last Saturday the television screened a report on Iraq's  economic problems under the UN embargo, and invited Iraqi  Commerce Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih to speak on the programme.    Apart from Oman, Qatar is the only member of the six-nation  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to have renewed contacts with  Baghdad since the Gulf war.    The other GCC members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United  Arab Emirates and Bahrain.    On Thursday al-Sahhaf told the UN Human Rights Commission in  Geneva ""the lifting of the iniquitous blockade and the injustice  done to the Iraqi people is a humanitarian responsibility.""    He urged that the ""use of the weapon of economic sanctions  and the policy of starvation"" be abandoned.     "

""I cannot get over the fact that the  United States of America is doing nothing and other Arab nations are doing  nothing to help Kuwait.""    Sbaita said he has been unable to contact his two brothers and a sister in the  suburbs of Kuwait City.    Relatives in Jordan, including Sbaita's parents who were on vacation from their  homeland, have gotten word from a cousin who has been stranded in her bank  office in downtown Kuwait because of the invading troops.

Sbaita, who was born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents, was one of a number of  Arabs living in Orange County who nervously watched developments in the  oil-rich Persian Gulf nation.    At a meeting Thursday night of the Arab-American Republican Party of Orange  County, members expressed concern and alarm about the volatile situation in the  Middle East.    ""Something has got to be done to stop the killing,"" said George Hanna, 61, of  Santa Ana, whose parents are from Syria.    Most members of the Arab-American organization, a political action committee,  generally indicated they did not favor American intervention in the conflict  unless U.S. interests become threatened.    Elias Bordcosh, 43, of Fountain Valley, a Palestinian who grew up in Lebanon,  said he believes ""not one American life"" should be expended in trying to quell  the Iraqi invasion.    Another club member, Kamal Shublak, 43, of Westminster, also a Palestinian,  said he also opposes American intervention ""for any political reasons,"" but he  said the United States may have to act in the conflict for economic reasons.    ""I am very worried about another oil shortage like we had in 1973,"" said  Shublak. He added that if an oil shortage threatens the American economy, the  United States should become involved to protect its interests.    ""I think this is something that the Arab League should deal with in a peaceful  manner,"" said Mounzer Chaarani, 48, of North Tustin. Chaarani, a native of  Lebanon, said he did not think the United States should become embroiled in the  conflict. ""Non-Arab countries should be very careful about this situation,"" he  said.    Many of the several hundred Iraqis in Orange County expressed dismay that  Iraq's president, military strongman Saddam Hussein, decided to unleash tanks,  military aircraft and ground troops on its smaller neighbor.    ""I'm very saddened by it, it's terrible,"" said one Iraqi living in Orange  County who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals against relatives  in Iraq and Kuwait. ""I thought they would settle the dispute through  negotiation instead of using force.""    He predicted that Kuwait would be only the first step in the Iraqi president's  march to bolster his own troubled economy after the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.    ""First you go to Kuwait, then you go to Bahrain,"" he said of another oil-rich  Persian Gulf kingdom without a strong military force to defend itself against  invaders. ""If Hussein takes Kuwait, it means millions (of dollars) a day in oil  revenue that would be Iraqi money. . . . It's the money, the oil and the  dollar, that's why Iraq and Iran went to war. And that's why Iraq invaded  Kuwait. It's the same story.""    Tareef Nashashibi, 32, of Anaheim said he managed to get a telephone line at  1:30 a.m. Thursday to his brother-in-law, who lives near the Sha'ab Palace,  ministry building in the Kuwaiti capital that was reported in flames later in  the day.    ""They have heard gunshots and planes, and my brother-in-law had to evacuate his  apartment at one point,"" said Nashashibi, a general contractor who has been  living in Orange County since 1988.    He said he also got a telephone call through to a cousin in Salwa, a suburb of  the capital, who said there were reports of fighting in the streets and the  sound of planes overhead.    ""It's very sketchy right now, we're not sure what is going on,"" Nashashibi  said. ""They can hear shooting, and they can hear some bombs, but nobody knows  exactly what the situation is.    ""A lot of people in Kuwait didn't know about (the invasion) until they got  telephone calls from the U.S.""    For now, Nashashibi said he was relieved that relatives appear to be unharmed  but was warily monitoring news reports and keeping in touch with a network of  friends and relatives throughout the Middle East, Europe and the United States.    ""Since everybody's OK, it has calmed us down a little bit. But you get worried.  . . . It's a very volatile situation. Kuwait does not have a lot of guns and  ammunition,"" he said.    Several natives of Kuwait described Hussein as a madman, yet they said they  bear no ill will toward the Iraqi people.    ""We cannot stereotype (the people) because of some political maneuvers on the  part of the government,"" Sbaita said.    But Nashashibi echoed the weariness of many Arabs at the relentless conflicts  in the Middle East.    ""We have had enough bloodshed in the region,"" he said.

He predicted that Kuwait would be only the first step in the Iraqi president's  march to bolster his own troubled economy after the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.    ""First you go to Kuwait, then you go to Bahrain,"" he said of another oil-rich  Persian Gulf kingdom without a strong military force to defend itself against  invaders. ""If Hussein takes Kuwait, it means millions (of dollars) a day in oil  revenue that would be Iraqi money. . . . It's the money, the oil and the  dollar, that's why Iraq and Iran went to war. And that's why Iraq invaded  Kuwait. It's the same story.""    Tareef Nashashibi, 32, of Anaheim said he managed to get a telephone line at  1:30 a.m. Thursday to his brother-in-law, who lives near the Sha'ab Palace,  ministry building in the Kuwaiti capital that was reported in flames later in  the day.    ""They have heard gunshots and planes, and my brother-in-law had to evacuate his  apartment at one point,"" said Nashashibi, a general contractor who has been  living in Orange County since 1988.    He said he also got a telephone call through to a cousin in Salwa, a suburb of  the capital, who said there were reports of fighting in the streets and the  sound of planes overhead.    ""It's very sketchy right now, we're not sure what is going on,"" Nashashibi  said. ""They can hear shooting, and they can hear some bombs, but nobody knows  exactly what the situation is.    ""A lot of people in Kuwait didn't know about (the invasion) until they got  telephone calls from the U.S.""    For now, Nashashibi said he was relieved that relatives appear to be unharmed  but was warily monitoring news reports and keeping in touch with a network of  friends and relatives throughout the Middle East, Europe and the United States.    ""Since everybody's OK, it has calmed us down a little bit. But you get worried.  . . . It's a very volatile situation. Kuwait does not have a lot of guns and  ammunition,"" he said.    Several natives of Kuwait described Hussein as a madman, yet they said they  bear no ill will toward the Iraqi people.    ""We cannot stereotype (the people) because of some political maneuvers on the  part of the government,"" Sbaita said.    But Nashashibi echoed the weariness of many Arabs at the relentless conflicts  in the Middle East.    ""We have had enough bloodshed in the region,"" he said. ""Enough of brother  shooting brother.""    Times correspondent Tom McQueeney contributed to this story.      Photo, Kuwaiti native Michael Sbaita fears for family's safety there.

The purpose of this cooperation is to transfer product and  material testing and inspection technology that is essential to  the growth of the plastics manufacturing industry. The  installation of testing and inspection equipment is near  completion, and increasing numbers of expert engineers are being  dispatched from Japan, so the transfer of technology has moved  into the implementation phase. MITI plans to implement the same  kind of technical cooperation in Asia, and Uruguay will be used  as a model program.    Technical cooperation between Japan and Uruguay has already  been implmented to improve the quality of pulp and paper, and  success in that area has expanded to plastics testing. Japan  signed an agreement for technical cooperation in March 1991 with  LATU, the Uruguay Technical Laboratory under the Ministry of  Industry, Energy, and Mining [literal]. A plastics research lab  was set up at LATU, and transfer of testing technology began.    The technology tranfer is being coordinated in Japan through  MITI and the Japan High Polymer Center. First about fifty types  of the necessary testing and inspection equipment were chosen,  and Japan began sending expert engineers to Uruguay as the  equipment was installed. Recently planning discussions were held  on site, and it was decided that Japan will increase the number  of short-term engineers in addition to those dispatched for  longer periods of time. The range of objects being tested is  also expanding as LATU will begin to provide testing services to  private businesses on consignment.    This technical cooperation will last for four years until  March 1995. Japan will continue to provide cooperation to  Uruguay to aid in its transition from an agricultural to an  industrial nation. Japan considers the plastics manufacturing  industry one cornerstone for this transition.     "

This was disclosed yesterday by Colombian Foreign Minister  Noemi Sanin de Rubio after she signed the Guyana/Colombia  anti-drug joint agreement at the Foreign Ministry here.    The agreement, proposed during her November 1993 visit to  Guyana, provides for cooperation, assistance and exchange of  information between the law enforcement agencies and judicial  systems of the two countries.    It also provides for the establishment of a Mixed Commission  which will be responsible for the elaboration of programmes and  plans to deal with the drug menace. Mixed Commission meetings  are to be held alternately in the two countries annually.    January 15 was the deadline fixed by the two countries for  the signing of the joint agreement.    Noting that drug use and trafficking are two of humanity's  greatest problems, the visiting Foreign Minister said it is on  this basis that the two states have agreed to combat the scourge.    She added that Colombia expects President Cheddi Jagan and  Foreign Minister Mr Clement Rohee to visit soon and hopes a ""lot  can be achieved"" from that encounter in the area of drug  eradication.    And Foreign Minister Rohee said the signing of the agreement  signals another milestone in the relations between the two  countries.    ""It heralds a new thrust in the fight against drugs and  commitment to this international scourge,"" he said.    He has also pledged this country's support to collaborating  ""in all forms"" to end the illicit trade and use of drugs.    Guyana has entered into similar agreements with Venezuela,  Cuba and Brazil.    Minister Sanin de Rubio, who flew in yesterday morning to  sign the agreement, also called on President Jagan and held  talks with officials at the CARICOM Secretariat before leaving  for Suriname in the afternoon.

She is the  author of Persian Cooking (University Press of Virginia).      In the decade since the overthrow of the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi  and the start of the Iranian revolution, a virulent strain of Islamic  fundamentalism has spread throughout the Muslim world, espousing a social order  that appears to promote medieval attitudes, to restrict individual freedoms and  to foster misogynist beliefs. Yet, women in one Muslim country after another,  many of them educated in the West, have flocked to its banner, repudiating  Western clothing and value systems and declaring themselves willing to fight  and die for their beliefs.    Those early Western-inspired feminist movements in such countries as Egypt,  Iran, Lebanon and even Turkey, which sought to improve the lot of women through  legislation limiting polygamy and restricting men's freewheeling divorce and  custody rights, appear to be dead. In their place have emerged widespread  demands to return to Islamic roots, to rescind foreign-inspired legislation, to  reintroduce Islamic sharia law, to re-segregate educational systems. And  everywhere, women appear in the forefront of a movement to return to a  seemingly outmoded way of life, one that restricts their activities and limits  their choices.    Minou Reeves seeks to explore the reasons for the resurgence of Islam in the  late 20th Century, to explain the baffling paradox of women who freely  sacrifice their lives in war, bravely engage in guerrilla attacks, actively  take part in combat, yet voluntarily return to the veil, historically a symbol  of their exclusion from public life.    In seeking to uncover the sources of a phenomenon that has baffled and even  frightened many world leaders, the author links the resurgence of Islamic  traditions to anti-Western attitudes, whose roots lie in centuries of  confrontation between the West and the Islamic world, and more recently in  ""anti-colonialist"" and ""anti-imperialist"" sentiments born of post-World War II  experiences with foreign powers.    She outlines the historical development of repressive customs and attitudes  toward women in Muslim societies, in spite of Islam's originally liberating and  progressive tenets. She delineates the absorption into Islam of such  pre-existing local customs and practices as veiling and polygamy, showing how  obscurantist exegetes reinforced the misogynistic attitudes of patriarchal  societies.    She follows the emergence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries of Muslim  reformers in Egypt and Tunisia who objected to misogynistic interpretations of  the Koran and the hadith (the sayings of the prophet Muhammad). She touches  upon early 20th-Century reforms in such countries as Tunisia, Iran and Turkey,  which resulted from attempts at modernization inspired by Western models. She  sees feminism within the broader framework of nationalist and socialist  tendencies of the time.    The major contribution of this book lies in the author's sketching of the  larger historical and political framework for today's Islamic revival and in  making it clear that the resurgence of Islam cannot be understood outside of  the nationalist revival. The author has tackled a large and complex subject and  has managed to weave together many strands into a comprehensible and valuable  whole.    A narrower focus, however -- on Iran alone -- might have made this an even more  valuable book. The author has spread herself thin by attempting to cover too  much. Although she singles out Iran as the major moving force behind the  Islamic revival, in touching on events in a number of other Muslim countries  she neither does justice to them, nor to Iran. Had she concentrated exclusively  on the Iranian revolution, the author might have succeeded in exploring the  resurgence of Islam in far greater depth.    She might, for example, have examined in more detail -- and with actual  anecdotal accounts -- the difficulties that a tradition-bound and  underdeveloped country such as Iran faced when trying to compress several  hundred years of modernization into one or two decades. She might have  explained what cultural aspects of Western culture have been so offensive to  Muslim sensibilities as to have provoked violent rejection.    She might have recounted, through the testimony of those who lived through the  revolution, what it was like to have experienced the trauma and the chaos of  those times. She might have studied, through the words of Iranian religious  leaders (many of whom are at odds with one another), the unresolved conflicts  over national goals, philosophy, and identity that continue to plague Iran and  that, at a deeper level, were to some degree responsible for the force of the  explosion that rocked this ancient land.    Furthermore, by limiting her sources to published documents, the author, in the  end, does not succeed in leading the reader across the cultural barriers to see  events as an insider.    Despite these shortcomings, however, this book is a much-needed corrective to  the paucity of objective information available to Western readers on the  subject of Muslim women.

Finally, writing as she was at the height of Iran's xenophobic anti-Westernism,  the author could not have foreseen the current trend in Iran toward moderation  and pragmatism, as exemplified by the ending of the Iran-Iraq war.

The text of the treaty has already  been coordinated, and it has been signed by Lithuanian National  Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. Lamassoure said that he  would take this treaty to French Defense Francois Leotard, who  intends to visit Lithuania this year.    The purpose of the current official visit by Lamassoure is  to  establish economic and political contacts between France and  Lithuania. According to Lamassoure, his visit has been speeded  up by the parliamentary elections in Russia, because France has  always supported the struggle of the Baltic countries for  freedom, and it feels its responsibility regarding the situation  here.    France thinks that North and Central European countries  should have associated membership in the West European Union, a  defense organization uniting nine West European states,  Lamassoure said. France also has other initiatives concerning  Lithuania. Negotiations on a trade agreement between Lithuania  and the states of the European Union are taking place.  Lamassoure said that this involves not only economic but also  political agreement, which may decide Lithuania's admission to  the European Union, if this Lithuania's wish.    Yet another proposal by France is the so-called Balladur  plan-- submitted by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur--which  concerns countries having problems with their neighbors or with  national minorities. This is a kind of peace conference where  the countries of the European Union would be mediators. It is  planned to convene such a conference in Paris next April.    Lamassoure met on Friday the chairman of the Seimas,  Ceslovas  Jursenas, members of the Seimas Foreign Affairs Committee,  representatives of all political forces, Foreign Minister  Povilas Gylys, Defense Minister Linkevicius, and the leader of  the opposition, Vytautas Landsbergis. He is meeting Prime  Minister Adolfas Slezevicius today.    Lamassoure will go from Vilnius to Latvia.     "

As before it remains a powerful state, a  great power which is only passing through a difficult stage,  apparently, just as other East European countries, Romania's  Defence Minister Lieutenant-General Niculae Spiroiu emphasised  in an interview with ITAR-TASS. According to him, it concerns  the selection of a new social, political and economic system by  the people of Russia, and it does not at all mean that Russia  has lost some kind of battle.    As far as ensuring security is concerned, after the  disintegration of the Warsaw Treaty Organization its member  states were left in a vacuum. That why it was natural for them  to strive to improve their state of affairs. A kind of  competition started to join NATO, the minister said. I presume  that at the NATO summit in Brussels a decision will be adopted  within the American initiative network of ""partnership in the  name of peace"" and provide these states certain support in the  sphere of security, Spiroiu noted. This initiative will be a  step ahead, according to him.    Russia's apprehensions in connection with the widening of  NATO are very well understood by us, the head of the Romanian  defence department indicated. That is the reason why we  consider that Russia should participate in programmes of  cooperation with NATO. If Russia is not included in the new  structures of security, then they will not get the needed trust  in them and will not become sufficiently effective. The Russian  Federation cannot be excluded from this process. There is a  need to create a system of equal security for all in which  Russia will acquire its place and role corresponding to its  importance. Any kind of discrimination would only lead to  suspicion, tension and potential hot spots of instability, the  Romanian defence minister said.     "

It seems NATO membership of new states could be the most  simple and quick solution to the problem, this is naturally  their sovereign right. However, swift implementation of this  right would result in new barriers in Europe, said the minister.    ""NATO has listened to us, Central and East European nations,  it listened to Russia, Boris Yeltsin who said in Poland it is  the right of each state to decide whether or not to join NATO;  but there are realities that require a more well-considered  approach,"" he noted.    The Brussels decision provides for a long period of  partnership which will help concentrate efforts and determine  the fate of Europe. The problem has been discussed with the  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the Moscow summit.  The U.S. and Russian presidents exchanged their opinions on the  issue and expressed satisfaction with the program of Partnership  for Peace, said Kozyrev.    It is too early to say what the period will end with. It may  be so that many states, possibly, Russia (it is not excluded)  will join NATO. But the period will not obligatory be a  preparatory one. Other options are possible as well.    Broader security systems may be created and the Council of  North Atlantic Cooperation may be consolidated. The more so, in  the opinion of the Russian side, all areas should be developed  parallelly. It is a new quality of partnership and not new  membership in NATO that matters. Kozyrev said they should  concentrate on partnership, fill it with specific content and  see the final result. The most important is stability and  cooperation in Europe.     "

He will exchange opinions with leaders of the  six countries on the international situation, African affairs,  bilateral relations, and other issues of common interest.    The Chinese foreign minister has been faithfully and  creatively performing his duties and carrying out intense  diplomatic activities. Last year, he not only received foreign  counterparts at home, but also made 10 visits to foreign  countries to attend international conferences. In particular,  he accompanied PRC President Jiang Zemin when he attended the  informal Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization summit  meeting, and held an official meeting with U.S. President  Clinton in Seattle, then he accompanied Jiang Zemin on his visit  to Cuba, Brazil, and Portugal.    Strengthening and developing unity and cooperation with  Third  World countries is a basic foothold of China's independent and  peace-oriented foreign policy. At the beginning of the new  year, Qian Qichen's visit to the six African countries  demonstrates this.    Qian Qichen has mentioned many times that China attaches  importance to friendly cooperation with the African countries,  and always respects and supports their decisions to select their  own political systems and develop paths according to their own  national conditions. On the eve of his visit to African  countries in early 1993, he particularly stressed that it is not  good to neglect Africa or try to impose one's own ideas on  Africa. People should care about Africa, and respect the  choices made by the African nations and their people.    It was learned that before Qian Qichen became China's  seventh  foreign minister in 1988, he had already visited 21 of the 53  African countries.     "

In the first  four months of this year, the volume of border trade exceeded  $17 million, an increase of 93 percent over the same period last  year.    Dandong City is located in the northern end of the mainland  coastline of China, and faces the DPRK's Sinuiju City across the  Yalu Jiang. It is one of the largest border cities in China.  In 1988, Dandong City was named as one of China's open cities,  and in 1992, the State Council approved the establishment of the  Dandong Border Economic Cooperation Zone. After that, Dandong  City made use of its favorable geographical position of being  adjacent to Korea and the doubly favorable policies for coastal  and border areas and has increased border trade with the DPRK  year after year. In 1993, the volume of Dandong's border trade  with the DPRK exceeded $52 million.    In Dandong's border trade with the DPRK, Dandong mainly  exports grain, pork, beef, textiles, chemical raw materials,  household electric appliances, and light industrial goods to the  Korean side, and mainly imports steel products, timber, aquatic  products, minerals, and silkworm cocoons from the Korean side.    As Dandong's opening up to the outside world continues its  expansion, the structure of trade with the DPRK has also  expanded from the previous sole pattern of barter trade to  plural forms of cash-based trade, processing trade, entrepot  trade, and the tourist trade. At present, there are more than  170 business companies engaged in trade with the DPRK. Trade  partners on the Korean side extend from Sinuiju to such interior  cities as Pyongyang and Wonsan. There is economic and trade  cooperation with an increasing number of the DPRK's large,  state-level commercial institutions.     "

Rong was speaking to Arpad Bogsch, WIPO director-general, at  the Great Hall of the People here today.    Calling Bogsch a friend of the Chinese people, Rong said he  was delighted to meet the WIPO chief, who is here on his 15th  visit to China since 1979.    Rong told Bogsch that China has in the past few years  promulgated the major laws dealing with intellectual property,  citing the Trade Mark Law, Patent Law, and Copyright Law.    In the drafting and revision of these laws, China received  much advice from WIPO, Rong said, adding that the institution  has been providing training courses for relevant Chinese  personnel, for which he expressed appreciation.    Bogsch is leaving here this afternoon to attend a symposium  on Asian copyright protection and its economic and cultural  development, which is to be held in Kunming, capital of  south-western Yunnan Province.    The symposium will help develop copyright systems in the  region, Rong said, wishing it success.    Although the copyright system has been set up in China,  there  is still much room for the enhancement of the nation's awareness  of its significance, Rong said.    A comprehensive copyright protection system falls in line  with the country's efforts of advancing its science and culture,  developing a market-oriented economy and opening up, Rong noted.    Bogsch said that China perfecting and implementing  intellectual property legislation will bring benefits to its  economic as well as cultural exchanges with other countries.    He noted that China has achieved a lot in implementing its  Trade Mark Law and Patent Law and that WIPO intends to continue  its help to China in the copyright system and other areas.

This was stated in an  interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent by Mikhail Kokeyev,  head of the Russian delegation, and deputy head of the  Directorate of International Scientific and Technical  Cooperation of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry.    He said that at the consultations agreement had been reached  in principle that Japan will provide emergency assistance to  take measures aimed at averting the need for the Pacific Fleet  to carry out new marine discharges of low-level radioactive  waste. For this purpose, it is planned, in particular, to  provide Russia with a special tanker to store waste. The two  tankers that the Pacific Fleet has at its disposal for this  purpose are already full. ""Some other emergency measures are  also possible that Japan intends to take to render us  assistance,"" Mikhail Kokeyev noted. He let it be understood  that it was a matter of really emergency measures which could be  carried out within ""the next few days or weeks."" The head of  the Russian delegation stressed, that apart from emergency  measures, Tokyo will also give Russia assistance in implementing  long-term programs intended to avert the discharge by the  Russian Navy of low-level radioactive liquid wastes into the  waters of the world's oceans.    Mikhail Kokeyev noted that the reaction displayed by Tokyo  to  the discharge by Russia of low-level waste into the Sea of Japan  in mid- October had been constructive.

Alimov, attending a ministerial meeting of the 10-member  Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Tehran, told AFP he  appreciated an Iranian offer to help end the civil war in  Tajikistan, where government forces have been fighting Muslim  fundamentalists for more than a year.    However, Tajikistan ""prefers the crisis to be resolved  through wider efforts undertaken by the United Nations,"" he  added.    Alimov said the government intended to hold general  elections  in July and called on Tajiks inside and outside the country to  take part.    Last week Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister 'Abbas Maleki said  Iran had launched mediation efforts to end the conflict,  following a request from four other Muslim central Asian states  -- Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.    He said Iran was determined to use its influence to restore  security to Tajikistan, and had already held talks with Tajik  opposition leaders.    Pro-communist forces seized power in the Tajik capital  Dushanbe in December 1992, toppling the ruling coalition of  democratic and Islamic forces.    Iran has so far adopted a low profile toward the conflict to  avoid antagonising the newly-independent central Asian states,  with which it has been trying to boost economic and cultural  ties.    Iranian President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani opened the  fourth session of the ECO Council of Ministers in Tehran on  Tuesday with a call for an end to conflicts in central Asia and  the Caucasus.    Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati told AFP the crisis in  Tajikistan may be discussed during the two-day meeting.    The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan and  expanded in 1991 to include Afghanistan as well as the former  Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan,  Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

0,FT942-13123 ,"FT942-13123 _AN-EDZEDAHBFT 940426   FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (25): Users link up with groupware - Workgroups      By MICHAEL DEMPSEY   Workgroups have rocketed to prominence in technology circles through the rise of groupware. Groupware is software that ties together a scattered band of users working on one project. Every amendment to a document is instantly reflected in the overall picture, with the object of recreating electronically the sensation of everyone working in the same room. Lotus has dominated the groupware scene with its phenomenally successful Notes program. However, the idea of using information technology to link up disparate teams of people predates Notes. Any network of computers creates a workgroup. Observers point out Notes merely takes an existing capability and markets it in a fresh sense. This is a little unkind, as Notes links constellations of users across a PC network at an affordable price. And it has notched up 750,000 users worldwide, so there is a real demand for groupware. But workgroup facilities have been around for years through networking. The key to current workgroup thinking is the need to disperse information across a corporate body. Commercial survival, according to the management mantra is dependent on sharing every scrap of information the company possesses. Keep your people communicating and create a corporate knowledge base that has the edge over competitors. The rush into 'flat structures' has involved wholesale massacres of the workforce so the diminished payroll needs to pool its experience and sharpen its wits. Workgroups are a potential route to productivity among white collar staff. Pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo employs Cooperation, a workgroup software suite from ATT's NCR arm, to manage assorted computer applications. Cooperation sits on top of desktop systems at Glaxo's headquarters at Ware in Hertfordshire. The company uses it to control existing programs, known in the trade as legacy systems. 'Our primary use of Cooperation is as a tool to hide the legacy systems,' says Peter Swinburne, head of IT at Glaxo. The 100 users in manufacturing, planning, new product development and customer services get a standard computer procedure through the groupware shell. This is groupware promoting productivity, and with a total investment of Pounds 300,000. Swinburne regards it as 'an integral part of our IT strategy'. It is estimated the market in workgroup products will reach Pounds 3.5bn by 1998, which includes consultancy and installation as well as software sales for US corporations. The business implications are profound enough for a UK consortium to launch a joint project with the DTI. Computer Supported Cooperative Work is a Pounds 13m scheme intended to promote workgroup practices in the restructured company of the 1990s. ACT Business Systems is managing one of the CSCW projects, the imaginatively named Business Flight Simulator. This is a best-selling computer game that resides on PCs across the world as an entertaining alternative to work. BFS is a Pounds 530,000 venture that gathers up current and imminent groupware products to create an infrastructure to encourage their use. The Post Office and Cheshire County Council are trialling these programs, tied together in a local area network BFS is not about technological innovation. 'We aim to use standard products', says Paul Ballard, senior consultant at ACT. Instead, its objective is to test the principles of decision-making in groups linked by IT. Action support is one of the key BFS motifs. This means decisions are not left hanging but are communicated to those people responsible for following through. Management should be able to monitor what actually happens after a brainstorming session via the PC and its groupware. Despite CSCW's high-powered image, it ran straight into a traditional brick wall. 'We recognise that giving senior managers the technology and expecting them to use it is a problem,' says Ballard. The difficulty - diplomatically couched as 'humanistic' - is that senior staff still know a lot less about IT than their secretaries. The BFS will only really take off when participants are truly at ease with a keyboard and screen. Naming the system after a popular computer game may be one way of breaking down resistance. British Aerospace is another participant in the CSCW movement. Designers as Users of Co-operative Knowledge ('Duck') aims to allow engineers to work as if sharing a single office. The vehicle for Duck is simultaneous multiple access to a project log, relying on a computer network. Distributed engineering teams are common to BAe, and anything that streamlines their working practices stands to save money. Workgroups will thrive. They've been around long enough. The immortal image of the Battle of Britain's operations room, where people shoved symbols across a map of the South Coast with billiard cues, was an example of a workgroup in action. If 1940s technology could successfully co-ordinate the expertise of an entire air force, CSCW should be able to enlist managers in the battle for business.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Operation Bahamas Turks and Caicos Islands (OPBAT), a  cooperative effort involving the three territories, was started  in April 1992 to stamp out the drug trade.    And already, 18 months later, Butler says cocaine  trafficking through the islands has dropped.    The public safety minister added that the 1993 total for  cocaine seizure, though not yet official, was expected to be  just about 700 kilos.    ""This is an 86 per cent decline from the 4.85 metric tons  seized in 1992 and it is the lowest annual seizure total since  late 1970,"" he said.    The minister explained that another first for the Bahamas in  1993, was that there was not a single interception of cocaine at  an airstrip in the Bahamas.    ""The fact that only two airdrops were intercepted in  Bahamian territorial waters compared to six in international  waters show great respect for the OPBAT and an obvious decline  in the traffic.""    Butler noted that for the 18 months OPBAT has been in  operation--from April, 1992, through December 31, 1993--only  1.59 metric tons of cocaine was seized in Bahamas.    And 1.85 metric tons were seized in international waters,  much of it close to the north coast of Cuba.    ""I think we can conclude that our remarkable joint OPBAT  programme has brought the traffic of cocaine from Colombia to  South Florida through the Bahamas down to irreducible minimum  during this 18 month period.""    The public safety minister also reported a fall by more than  half, in the number of cocaine addicts seeking treatment, as a  direct result of the anti-drug programme.    This, he said, indicated that the drug problem was  ""receding"" or ""stable.""     "

This was  reported by Linas Linkevicius, minister of national defense,  after a meeting with Valdis Birkavs and Mart Laar in the Latvian  Embassy in Stockholm yesterday afternoon. According to Linas  Linkevicius, it has been agreed to coordinate at top  governmental level the issues of airspace and border control of  the Baltic states.    The minister of national defense also pointed out that the  Lithuanian delegation bound themselves at the meeting to prepare  a draft treaty of the states on the peace-keeping battalion.    During the meeting negotiations were held by the leaders of  the three governments on the development of the Lithuanian,  Latvian, and Estonian power engineering system. In this  respect, according to Linas Linkevicius, his conversation with  Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen yesterday was worth  mentioning. They talked about the possibility of the Baltic  states tapping into the gas supply system of the Nordic states.    According to the leader of the Lithuanian delegation, the  Danish prime minister would regard positively the possibility of  supplying gas to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia from Denmark.    Much attention at the meeting was given to the problem of  speeding up the negotiations between Russia and Latvia and  Estonia. Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar told Lithuanian Radio  that his country feels strong support from Lithuania on issues  concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops. Mart Laar believes  that in the future, when the Russian troops have been withdrawn  from Latvia and Estonia, one of the greatest problems for the  security of the Baltic states may be the large concentration of  Russian troops deployed in the Kaliningrad region and the  question of their transit.    At the moment the delegations from the governments of the  Baltic states are taking part in debates currently under way at  the session of the Council of Ministers of the Nordic States.     "

At a press conference given by the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), China National  Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation and China  National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export  Corporation (CNCOFIEC) were listed in second and third place  among the top 20 enterprises.    China National Technical Import and Export Corporation,  which  was No. 6 in 1992, last year rose to No. 4 with an import and  export volume of 2.72 billion U.S. dollars, which is only 40  million U.S. dollars less than that of CNCOFIEC.    This was the fifth MOFTEC ranking of the top 500  enterprises.  A spokesman for the ministry said that with the approval of the  State Council, the MOFTEC will henceforth announce a list of top  enterprises, according to their import and export volumes, so as  to strengthen their international image and reinforce their  reputation.    Last year, the total import and export volume of the 500  enterprises was 106.384 billion U.S. dollars, occupying 54.4 per  cent of the country's total volume, which was 195.7 billion U.S.  dollars.    According to the list, there are 14 enterprises whose import  and export volume surpassed 1 billion U.S. dollars, with four  more squeezing onto the list since 1992. And there are 248  enterprises whose trade volume was more than 100 million U.S.  dollars.    The No. 500 enterprise had an import and export volume of  44.6 million U.S. dollars, 5.78 million U.S. dollars more than  the same place in 1992.    Also announced today was a list of the top 200 enterprises  with the biggest export volumes. The first three were CNCIEC,  the CNCIEC Liaoning Company and CNCOFIEC.     "

Saying he was happy to receive a personal letter from Korean  President Kim Yong-sam, Clinton stressed the importance of  inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation between Seoul and  Washington in resolving the North Korean nuclear problem,  according to Korean envoy on nuclear affairs Kim Sam-hun.    The U.S. President said he looked forward to meeting  President Kim at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  summit slated for Jakarta, Indonesia, in November.    Han, delivering a verbal message from Kim, said Seoul  welcomed Pyongyang's acceptance of International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) inspections, but noted it was just the first step  toward a resolution and Seoul thus wished to continue close  cooperation with Washington.    Kim was quoted as saying that because of Pyongyang's  unpredictability given past experience with the communist  regime, South Korea and the United States should tread  cautiously in dealing with North Korea. Kim also stressed that  Seoul and Washington will abide by the principles --  implementation of IAEA inspections and exchange of presidential  envoys between South and North Korea -- that are prerequisites  to a third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks as agreed  at a summit last November in Washington.    Clinton reportedly responded to Kim's personal letter  delivered last week by reaffirming the initial Seoul-Washington  agreement on thorough and broad settlement of the North Korean  nuclear problem.    Han tried to schedule a meeting with Clinton during his Feb.  10- 11 stay in Washington before visiting Canada to personally  deliver Kim's letter, but failed due to the Washington-Tokyo  summit.    The foreign minister made a second stop in Washington to  coordinate further efforts on the nuclear problem following  North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections. He headed for  Seoul after his meeting with Clinton.     "

""The council repeats its demands that the Iraqi leadership should respect  international charters and norms and the agreements it signed with the state of  Kuwait, and resort to peace . . . and not to endanger the lives and waste the  potentialities of Iraq's people in a confrontation that would not realize  anything other than loss and devastation,"" the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar,  Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman said in their final  communique.    During a four-day summit in the Qatari capital, their first since Iraq's Aug. 2  invasion of Kuwait, the gulf leaders resolved to improve relations with  non-Arab Iran, boost future regional defenses and strengthen their ties in  order to avoid the mistakes of the past.    ""We should recognize that the Arab system has failed to confront the disaster  and has made little contribution to tackle the problem,"" Saudi Arabia's King  Fahd said in an unusually frank statement issued near the conclusion of the  summit. ""We should revise the order of the gulf house so as to emerge from this  crisis stronger.""    Part of the revised order will undoubtedly include improved relations with Iran  -- the very country whose threats from the other side of the Persian Gulf  throughout the 1980s first led to the creation of the gulf alliance.    On the opening day of the summit, Qatar's foreign minister, Mubarak ibn Ali al  Khatar, announced that talks are under way to include Iran in any new security  arrangements that are drafted for the gulf region. ""We have historic ties with  Iran . . . and it is entering in the security arrangement by right of its  geographic significance,"" he told reporters here.    The council's final communique lauded efforts by other ""brotherly and friendly  countries"" to try to achieve a peaceful settlement of the crisis but fell far  short of reported attempts by some delegates, led by Oman, to dispatch an envoy  to Baghdad in an attempt to determine what it would take to persuade the Iraqi  leader to withdraw his forces.    Discussions became nearly quagmired at one point when Oman's Sultan Kaboos ibn  Said reportedly threatened to hold off any support for a military attack  against Iraq unless peaceful options were explored further, summit sources  said.    Other gulf leaders insisted on maintaining a united international front, and  King Fahd issued one of his strongest statements since the beginning of the  crisis, declaring that there is still room for a peaceful resolution but that  the gulf is also prepared for war.    ""We have not decided either a decision for war or peace, but we have taken a  decision for the return of Kuwait, peacefully if possible or by war when war  becomes inevitable,"" the Saudi monarch said.    ""We don't want to close the doors of hope: Up to now, the person who we thought  one day was our friend can avert (for) himself and his nation the horrors of  war. When he chose confrontation, we have shown him that we are capable of  confrontation. When he decides to choose concord, we are also capable of opting  for concord. The decision of peace has proved to be more brave than the  decision of war.""    Most analysts say the gulf leaders are probably powerless to shape the outcome  of a crisis that has become balanced between Washington and Baghdad. Yet the  Iraqi leader has made overtures to the gulf, dispatching his foreign minister,  Tarik Aziz, for talks in Oman and, according to the Iraqi ambassador in Doha,  submitting a proposal that the six GCC countries help develop an ""Arabian""  solution to the crisis centered on the gulf nations of the Arabian peninsula.    Moreover, the Gulf Cooperation Council nations stand to have leverage over both  Iraq and Kuwait because it may be largely from their coffers that both  countries are revitalized once the crisis is over, said John Duke Anthony of  the National Council on U.S. Arab Relations, who attended the summit.    ""They have all sorts of lines of communications out -- probing, testing,  evaluating what would be the appropriate mix for the region,"" now and in the  future, Anthony said. ""These countries are Iraq's neighbors. The U.S. isn't.  And, yes, they will have to find an arrangement to live as neighbors in the  future.""    Conference sources said the GCC had strongly urged the United States to send a  senior envoy to Baghdad before President Bush's proposal to exchange visits  between Secretary of State James A.

However, a Saudi newspaper editor said by the conclusion of this week's summit:  ""The drums of war are beating. . . . In any case, it's out of their hands. It's  between Washington and Baghdad.""

He made the remarks to the press after he met with Deng Nan,  vice chairman of the Chinese State Science and Technology  Commission at his office here today.    ""As both of us, China and Malaysia, are developing  countries,  we have many areas in which we could learn from each other,"" Law  said.    He said cooperation can cover many fields as ""China is a big  country and has a lot of scientists"" and Malaysia is trying to  ""draw a balance between agriculture and industry"" during the  transition from the past agriculture-based economy.    He said he and Deng had ""useful and interesting discussions""  which will be followed by the first joint committee meeting on  science and technology on Monday.    ""We have worked out a long agenda"", said Law, outlining  cooperation areas proposed by both sides.    By the Malaysian side, he said, they include computer  integrated manufacturing system, advanced materials,  micro-electronics, computers and information technology, nuclear  energy, remote sensing and meteorology.    While by the Chinese side, they cover meteorology, standards  and quality control systems, medicine, medical equipment and  pharmaceutical development, conservation, management and  exploitation of marine resources, remote sensing and geological  information.    The meeting is the follow-up of the Memorandum of  Understanding on Science and Technology Cooperation the two  governments signed in 1992.    Law said Deng expressed China's willingness to take part in  the international floating science exhibition, a Malaysian  proposal to be further discussed at the ASEAN science and  technology ministers' meeting in Manila next month.    The six-member delegation led by Deng arrived here last  night  on a week-long visit during which they will tour Malacca, Penang  and Sarawak, and some research institutions such as the  Standards and Industrial Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM).

By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      BAGHDAD, Iraq      On the heels of its first tenuous diplomatic success in the Persian Gulf  crisis, Iraq on Thursday followed the call of its old enemy, Iran, and renewed  its attack on the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.    Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz, responding to President Bush's address to Congress  on Tuesday night, insisted that Iraq has no intention to invade Saudi Arabia or  any other gulf state.    ""We challenge the U.S. President to present tangible proof of his allegations,""  Aziz said in remarks published Thursday. ""Bush had better withdraw his forces  and reduce American expenditure on war.""    The silver-haired foreign minister was fresh from a trip to Tehran, a visit  that resulted in the renewal of diplomatic relations between the two countries.  On Wednesday, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Iranian spiritual leader, harshly  attacked the American troop buildup in the gulf and called for a holy war on  the United States.    And Iraq warned Thursday of possible terrorist attacks against U.S. forces,  sounding the theme of Arab feelings wounded by the presence of non-Muslim  soldiers massed in the holy lands of Saudi Arabia, wire services reported.    Iraq's warning came in a memorandum to the U.S. charge d'affaires in Baghdad,  according to the Iraqi News Agency. The service said Iraq was responding to a  U.S. claim that Iraq-based terrorists were preparing to attack U.S. targets.    The United States is creating a ""pretext"" for aggression, the memorandum was  quoted as saying, and ""Iraq reserves its legitimate right to self-defense, to  reciprocate and to retaliate firmly against these parties if it becomes a  target,"" the news agency added.    Meanwhile, Syria was reported to be sending an armored brigade, involving up to  10,000 troops and 300 tanks, to Saudi Arabia in a signal of its new role in the  Middle East. Western diplomats told Reuters news service that the Saudi  government had asked Damascus to send the division to supplement the 3,000  Syrian troops already there. About 1,000 Syrian troops are in the United Arab  Emirates.    According to the Western diplomats, the number of Syrian troops expected to be  deployed in the crisis may reach 14,000.    Since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Baghdad has worked hard to win support  from Iran, with which it engaged in a bloody, eight-year war that ended in  1988. Iran, with its long land border, could make or break a trade embargo  imposed on Iraq by the United Nations.    Last month, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a lightning diplomatic move,  pulled his troops out of land that Iraq had occupied during the war and gave in  on all the border issues that were at stake in the conflict. The countries  agreed to exchange prisoners of war and, following Aziz's visit, to take steps  to normalize diplomatic and trade relations.    On Thursday, the Tehran Times newspaper, which often reflects the views of the  Iranian government, denied that Iran would exchange food and cash for Iraqi  oil. It quoted an ""informed source"" in Tehran as saying the government had not  yet decided whether to allow shipments into Iraq.    But Iran's enmity toward the United States, dating from the 1979 Shiite Muslim  revolution, could tempt Tehran to play a spoiler's role in the gulf crisis: The  mullahs who rule Iran might undermine the sanctions enough to keep Iraq afloat  -- and force the United States to choose between remaining bogged down in Saudi  Arabia or opening fire on Iraq.    ""Iran can sit back and watch its enemies struggle over this one,"" said one  Western European diplomat, noting that it was a reverse of the situation during  the Iran-Iraq war, when much of the world stood by and watched the warring  neighbors fight it out.    Iraq's counteroffensive against the U.N. trade sanctions continues to center on  the needs of tens of thousands of Asian refugees stranded in both Iraq and  Kuwait. The refugees are forbidden to buy food in Iraq, and supplies are  reportedly running short in Kuwait. Baghdad is demanding that Asian  governments, particularly India and the Philippines, send food to their  citizens.    Western governments want any food deliveries to the Asians handled by the  International Red Cross or some other foreign relief agency. One U.S. diplomat  has accused Iraq of ""cynical manipulation"" of the refugees' suffering.    Iraq counters that the shortages are the fault of the blockade and that  shipments should enter the country like regular imports.    On Thursday, the Red Cross and its Islamic counterpart, the Red Crescent,  reached an agreement to supply medicines to civilians.    Meanwhile, in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  Gen. Colin L. Powell, visited with U.S. forces and said the American troops  ""are deterring (Iraq) now, and with each passing day, our defensive capability  gets better and better.""

They are good for the long haul,"" Powell said.    Staff writer Melissa Healy, in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, contributed to this  report.      Photo, Gen.

Gylys to the U.S. Secretary of State""]    [Text] Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania Povilas  Gylys has sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher.    Lithuania, reads the letter, is particularly interested in  close cooperation and assistance from the United States in the  area of national security and defense and the reinforcement of  economic reforms and democratic institutions.    Despite the fact that the last Russian soldier has left  Lithuania, we still find ourselves in a security vacuum, the  letter reads. The presence of the army of a foreign state in  Latvia and Estonia is a factor of instability in the entire  region. The large Russian Army concentration in Kaliningrad  Oblast gives rise to particular concern. Lithuania would like to  invite the attention of the international community to the need  to demilitarize this region.    The letter notes that the Russian notion of ""neighboring  foreign countries"" is unacceptable to Lithuania. The fact that  Russia's foreign policy may become more nationalistic and  aggressive with regard to the Baltic states following the  parliamentary elections also causes concern.    The minister noted that Lithuania, in its striving to blend  into Western political, economic, and security structures,  considers NATO its future security guarantor. Lithuania, in  which there is no foreign army and no problem of ethnic  minorities, strives to reinforce cooperation with NATO. We  welcome the ""partnership,"" hoping that this will become a  stimulus for cooperation ""from partnership to membership.""    Foreign investment is an important factor in the development  of the economy of our country. U.S. investment is extremely  important to Lithuania in this context. Our country intends to  sign several treaties with the United States, including the  treaty ""On Incentives and Protection for Investment.""    Toward the end of the letter, the minister offered W.  Christopher and his family holiday wishes.     "

At its final meeting, the commission noted that as late as 1986, there were 36  armed conflicts around the globe, virtually all in developing regions. Because  these wars occurred primarily in areas already debilitated by poverty and  underdevelopment, the human suffering was extraordinary. An estimated 3 million  to 5 million people died as a direct result of war; millions more have fled the  fighting, seeking food, shelter, health care and escape from political  persecution.

U.N. forces will play a role in ensuring the peace in many of these situations,  as they do already in the Middle East and several other regions. There are  10,000 soldiers from 23 countries now serving in the ""blue-helmet"" force. They  carry out two kinds of operations: U.N. peacekeepers impose themselves between  contending forces to avert incidents that could flare into war, while unarmed  U.N. observers monitor, report and mediate between local commanders in the  field. At present, there are eight operations of each type under way, and the  prospect of several more in the near future.    The development of a more stable and peaceful international system requires  greater attention to U.N. peacekeeping. Changes in U.N. procedures --  particularly a strengthening of the secretary-general's authority to monitor,  report on and recommend actions concerning international conflicts -- could  enable peacekeeping missions to be mounted in a more timely manner and carried  out more effectively. Moreover, both the roles envisioned for these  international military forces, and the resources available for them, could  usefully be expanded.    Traditionally, U.N. peacekeepers have been used to oversee cease-fires and  other temporary means of ending armed conflicts. In the more peaceful climate  that now exists, more wide-ranging functions can be envisioned:     -- U.N. forces could be used to oversee elections in situations such as  Namibia's.     -- Maritime peacekeeping forces could be established to ensure free passage  through vital international waterways, like the Strait of Hormuz, in situations  such as the recent hostilities in the Persian Gulf, and to maintain security in  waters troubled by pirates, as in Southeast Asia.     -- In certain other types of situations, U.N. peacekeeping forces could be  used to respond to international terrorists, as well as to protect mini-states  from mercenaries and other external threats to their security.     -- U.N. experts and logistical capabilities could even be used to help contain  the effects of ecological catastrophes that threaten neighboring states,  particularly in nations that lack the resources or expertise to deal with such  problems alone.    Such an expansion of peacekeeping functions could not take place unless greater  resources were made available to the U.N. organization. Indeed, resources  limitations have already curbed peacekeeping operations. Because of fiscal  constraints, for example, the size of the U.N. Transition Assistance Group in  Namibia was reduced by nearly half and its start delayed. It does not require  imagination to understand that problems currently threatening the peace  arrangements in southern Africa are related to this ragged start.    Military units in national armed forces, including the armed forces of the  permanent members of the Security Council, that might be made available for  peacekeeping should be earmarked now, before they are needed, along with the  air- and sea-lift units that could move them to trouble spots in a timely  fashion. Specialized equipment should be stockpiled, particularly seismic and  acoustic sensors, communications gear and mobile radars, all of which could be  helpful in monitoring disengagement zones. Industrialized nations might help  developing states to train and equip their military forces for peacekeeping.    Financing peacekeeping operations has always been a problem, with various  states at times refusing to pay their assessed contributions. At its last  meeting, the Palme Commission proposed that a special peacekeeping fund be  established and built up to a total of $2 billion over a few years. The fund  would be financed on the basis of a general formula assessing U.N. members,  with no one member expected to pay an excessive share.

It has already included  the creation of the ""International Environment Advisor System""  in its initial request for the FY94 budget, which is under  negotiations with the Ministry of Finance. MITI will also expand  on-going cooperation projects for desulphurization technologies  in China. The International Environment Advisor System certifies  and registers ""Environment Advisors"" among ""Managers in Charge  of Pollution Control,"" designated specialists with knowledge and  technical backgrounds, in the private sector based on their  experience in developing nations and language ability. They will  be sent to developing nations to organize seminars for pollution  prevention and to provide assistance and advice based on  requests from such nations.    Cooperation with developing nations through the dispatch of  experts in environmental issues, such as pollution prevention,  has already been implemented as part of private enterprise's  social contribution. The International Environment Advisor  System is intended to expand such efforts and establish a  governmental system for human cooperation.    The technological cooperation for desulphurization in China  is intended to establish several simplified desulphurization  testing facilities for low- quality coal with a high level of  sulfur to prevent air pollution by coal- burning thermal power  plants. The construction of the first such facility began in May  in Qingdao, Shandong, with the Chinese side recently agreeing to  a second facility to be established in Taiyuan, Shanxi. The  project is expected to be completed by the year 2000, with a  total budget of 7.3 billion.

Thoughts Inspired by the Results of the  `Lima-93' International Naval and Aerospace Exhibition""]    [Text] Dozens of arms exhibitions are held in the world  every year. It is symbolic that the largest of them (the Abu  Dhabi exhibition of arms and military hardware) was held at the  beginning of 1993, while the second most important one (the  ""Lima-93"" international naval and aerospace exhibition on the  Malaysian island of Langkawi) marked the end of the year.    For Russian defense industry workers both exhibitions were  landmarks and were even unprecedented, above all because  practically all our leading enterprises, scientific research  institutes, and design bureaus engaged in designing and  producing weapons were represented there for the first time,  along with their latest products, including those stemming from  conversion. It was these exhibitions that gave specialists an  opportunity to judge the place that Russia holds on the world  arms market and how successful our attempts have been to counter  such arms suppliers as the United States, Britain, and France in  a very fierce competitive struggle.    In recent years Russia, in the grip of political  confrontation, has lost many of its priorities, including those  in the sphere of arms production and the arms trade. Since 1990  we have seen an almost fivefold reduction in arms exports.  Market laws are particularly severe in this specific sphere of  trade: Russia has reduced arms sales, and other countries have  sharply increased production and at once filled the vacuum. The  United States today controls more than 50 percent of world arms  exports. So under these conditions the Russians' decision to  participate so extensively in exhibitions was justified  politically and economically, although to a considerable degree  it was also risky. Russian defense industry workers -- above  all, the organizers of our exhibit -- felt the tough pressure  from competitors back during preparations for the exhibitions.    Tribute must be paid to the specialists of the  ""Oboroneksport"" Russian State Foreign Economic Association for  Exports of Military Products and Services who, working in close  contact with representatives of the Ministry of Defense, made a  thorough study of the regions where exhibitions are held and of  the interests of potential buyers. The best of what we have was  shown both in the Emirates and in Malaysia. The S-300PMU-1 and  S-300V, Igla, and Tor-M1 antiaircraft missile complexes and  systems, the Piranya and Triton small and miniature [malyy i  sverkhmalyy] submarines, and the Ka-50 combat helicopter were  the real sensation of the exhibitions.    The aviation section of the Malaysian exhibition was  probably  the most interesting. Some 300 major aviation companies  presented their products -- everything that holds leading  positions in the aviation world. The Russian exhibit appeared  highly impressive against this background.    Whereas our country demonstrated just one Ruslan and one  MiG-29 fighter at the previous exhibition in Malaysia, we took  four MiG-29's, two Su-27's, and also the MiG-31 long-range  fighter-interceptor to ""Lima-93."" At the same time all the  aircraft and airmen arrived straight from the ranks, as it were  -- from combat air units -- and had not made any special  preparation for the exhibition. Under a blazing sun (up to 40  degrees in the shade) our military engineers and technicians  prepared the MiG's in just two days, exceeding all existing  norms.    The demonstration flights began right after the official  opening of the exhibition, and our military airmen participated  in each of them: Colonels Aleksandr Kutuzov and Vladimir  Bazhenov, Lieutenant Colonels Boris Grigoryev, Vladimir Gryzlov,  and Aleksandr Lichkun, and Majors Aleksey Sherstnev, Andrey  Makarenko, and Aleksandr Katashinskiy, displaying brilliant  skill in very complex aerobatics figures and eliciting the  admiration of onlookers and specialists and the envy of foreign  colleagues. ""Selfless work by airmen with excellent hardware.""  This is not my assessment -- this was what the foreign press  wrote about our airmen.    Among the conversion output of defense enterprises  specialists and businessmen showed special interest in the  passenger surface-effect vehicles developed by the Central  Design Bureau for Hydrofoils (Nizhniy Novgorod), in the  underwater excursion craft created by St. Petersburg's ""Rubin""  Central Design Bureau for Marine Equipment, and in helicopters  and launches which can be used for sea patrols, rescue  operations, and services to island resorts. It is only to be  regretted that for purely economic reasons these exhibits were  shown in the form of models and photographs and not in real  life. Incidentally, all the recreational vessels were sold out  at the previous ""Lima-91"" exhibition before it ended.    Journalists expect sensations from exhibitions. The  Emirates' purchase of a large consignment of French Leclerc  tanks was named as the sensation at ""IDEX-93 in the United Arab  Emirates, and at the ""Lima-93"" exhibition it was the contract to  supply Malaysia with eight F/A-18 fighters, whereas the contract  with Russia, which has long been in preparation, to supply the  Malaysians with 18 MiG-29's was not signed. In my view the  reasons for this are not commercial but purely political. This  is particularly obvious in the context of the results of the  conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  Organization held in Seattle before the exhibition itself. We  know that the ASEAN countries are the fourth largest source of  imports to the United States and stand in sixth place among  America's export markets. In 1992 the volume of U.S. trade with  them amounted to $60 billion, while U.S. investments in these  states topped $16 billion. The Americans held the conference  with great pomp, making it their main aim to turn APEC into a  disciplined organization capable of ensuring the expansion of  trade and investments in the Asia-Pacific region. The first  major obstacle to face them on this path was the refusal by  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed to participate in the  Seattle meeting. The main reason for the boycott was the  reluctance to turn APEC into a means of U.S. domination over the  countries of Southeast Asia. In the opinion of experts,  Malaysia's purchase of U.S. fighters is a kind of goodwill  gesture or an attempt at reconciliation with the United States.  According to other assessments, Malaysia deliberately acquires  military hardware from different countries, so ""limiting these  countries' opportunity for dictating terms and influencing  Malaysia's policy.""    The contract with Russia for MiG-29's is still at the  elaboration stage. ""There is only a small holdup,"" Prime  Minister Mahathir Mohamed assured journalists, ""and the  champagne can already be ordered."" I would like to hope that  the skill of the Russian military airmen and the quality of our  combat hardware demonstrated at the Malaysian exhibition will be  a weighty factor in the competitive struggle with Western  aircraft companies and a good argument in favor of signing the  contract. But its birth pangs demand a thorough analysis and  exacting assessments. The BROOKINGS REVIEW, published by the  Brookings Institution in Washington, carried an analysis of  Russian arms exports. It describes with heavy irony the history  of the preparation of the MiG-29 contract. It reports, in  particular, that representatives of 18 different intermediary  organizations, each of which claimed to have the right to sell  these aircraft, visited Malaysia within a short space of time.  The competition that developed among the Russians created chaos  and substantially undermined their positions in the negotiations.    Until recently ""Oboroneksport"" was the head organization  with  the right to sell Russian weapons. With offices in 40  countries, it supplied abroad almost 90 percent of all the  weapons exported by Russia. Recently the ""Spetsvneshtekhnika""  GVK [expansion unknown], the Main Administration for Cooperation  and Collaboration, and ""Promeksport"" have been trading in  weapons. Other organizations, including the manufacturing  plants, have also sought the right to sell weapons, frequently  competing but more frequently hindering each other in the  conclusion of contracts. Shortly before the opening of the  Malaysian exhibition the Russian Federation president signed an  edict setting up the ""Rosvooruzheniye"" State Company for Exports  and Imports of Arms and Military Hardware on the basis of  ""Oboroneksport,"" ""Spetsvneshtekhnika,"" and the Main  Administration for Cooperation and Collaboration. The ink on  the edict was not dry before a mighty wave of criticism crashed  down on it in the press in full accordance with our Russian  traditions. A group of very famous arms producers even proposed  suspending the president's edict.    Be that as it may, a desire to instill order in the arms  trade and to elaborate a state concept of military exports can  be seen behind the new presidential act. Only it is important  that all the innovations do not end in an elementary shakeup of  the former systems in order to satisfy somebody's ambitions, and  that the tremendous experience accumulated by ""Oboroneksport""  over the 40 years of its existence and the unique cadres it has  reared are fully employed when the new mechanism is created.    We have only just realized the importance to Russia of arms  exports and learned to ignore the preaching about the immorality  of the arms trade which only recently was issuing both from the  pages of the press and from parliamentary rostrums. I remember  how Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation minister of  defense who headed the Russian delegation at the Abu Dhabi  exhibition, was forced to explain to our own Russian journalists  that we do not seek to sell weapons to just anyone to be used in  combat operations of an offensive nature or in order to upset  the balance of forces in a region. We offer military output in  strict accordance with international laws for defensive  purposes. ""Commerce will not conflict with politics but will  ensure the achievement of Russia's political and economic ends.""    It is not only the destinies of millions of working people  in  the military-industrial complex and our economic revival that  depend on whether our country returns to the world arms market  and on how successful our arms business is -- the fate of Russia  itself also depends on this.

0,FT911-4884 ,"FT911-4884 _AN-BDQBPADWFT 910417   FT  17 APR 91 / US ignored alert on arms to Baghdad      By ALAN FRIEDMAN      WASHINGTON   THE White House allowed the shipment of military spare parts to Jordan until just before the outbreak of the air war against Iraq in January, according to past and present US government officials. The US shipments, which included diesel engine components for armoured vehicles and electronic testing equipment, continued in spite of intelligence advice that the kingdom was being used as an illegal conduit into neighbouring Iraq. There were additional concerns from the State Department and other government agencies that Iraq's other suppliers in the west were sending arms, spare parts and dual-use technology - which can have military as well as civilian applications - through Jordan as a way of evading the United Nations embargo against Iraq. Senior White House officials were given a written warning early last December that military shipments from US companies to Jordan were likely to be passed on to Iraq. It was delivered to Mr Robert Gates, the deputy national security adviser to President Bush. It was only several weeks later - after hostilities had begun in the Gulf - that the warning was acknowledged. In spite of these warnings, no changes were made to the way in which the export of military-related equipment to Jordan from the west was scrutinised. Yesterday, the White House said it had no comment on the issue of shipments to Iraq and Jordan. Up until the middle of January, the administration had denied persistent reports that Jordan was serving as a transhipment point, arguing that the UN embargo was virtually leak-proof. According to several administration officials, the White House had previously given its approval to the shipment of sensitive military equipment and technologies directly to Iraq as late as last June. The nature and scope of US weapons sales to Iraq in 1990 is part of an expanding Congressional inquiry into US support for Baghdad's armaments programmes over the past five years. This support included the sale of chemical weapons precursors, biological agents and dual-use technology applicable in missile development. The House Foreign Affairs sub-committee on international economic policy and trade is focusing on several high-level inter-agency meetings chaired last spring by Mr Gates, who was previously deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). These meetings, in April, May and June, were called to come up with a response to President Saddam Hussein, who had recently test-fired a ballistic missile in Mauritania and threatened to scorch half of Israel. In spite of detailed evidence known to have been available to US intelligence on Iraq's nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile projects, repeated sub-Cabinet meetings at the White House decided to take no action. A Commerce Department recommendation last May for economic sanctions against Baghdad was rejected. The view of some officials in the State Department, CIA, Defence Department and the White House was that it was still important not to isolate Iraq and to use diplomatic pressure to moderate Mr Saddam's behaviour - a view shared by moderate Arab states such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Mr Sam Gejdenson, Democratic chairman of the House subcommittee, said yesterday that the revelation of shipments to Jordan confirmed earlier Congressional testimony by Mr Dennis Kloske, a senior Commerce Department official. 'This is a continuation of a pattern in which the administration continued to do business with Iraq despite every indication that they had lost influence. I think it is clear the administration did not take action to prevent the shipments to Iraq,' Mr Gejdenson said. Democrats had criticised administration policy towards Iraq as a miscalculation bordering on appeasement. Their attacks largely evaporated after the allied victory in the Gulf war but a fresh head of steam may be gathering. New evidence is also emerging about the extent to which the US - along with France, Germany and other western countries - armed Iraq in the 1980s. Congressional committees have recently been told that the government approved 771 licences of high-technology items and biological agents to Iraq between 1985-90 worth Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 839m). The weapons flow was part of a pro-Baghdad tilt by Washington against Tehran which continued well after the end of the Iran-Iraq war in August, 1988. During the summer of 1990, the Commerce Department became alarmed at the stream of applications from US companies for export licences for dual-use technology. Mr Kloske told the committee last week that he ordered officials to tie up the licence applications in red tape - a rare and controversial admission since Congress constantly complains about unnecessary restrictions on US exports. Mr Kloske, who intends to leave the administration, was singled out for criticism by the White House which denied reports that he was sacked for talking to Congress.

Oudejans report: ""Netherlands Adopts Wait-And-See  Attitude Toward Mexico""]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Netherlands companies are also  showing increasing interest in Mexico, it emerged last week  during the three-day working visit to Mexico by Economics  Minister J.E. Andriessen. ""We see Mexico as a country in the  process of stabilization which offers ever greater growth  potential,"" the minister said there.    The ministry likes to visit Mexico, although the country is  number 40 in the list of the Netherlands's trading partners.  Andriessen's previous visit was in November 1991, while his  secretary of state, Yvonne van Rooy, led a trade mission to  Mexico only a year ago.    In his meetings last week with President Salinas and other  key figures in various ministries and large Mexican companies,  the minister had a long shopping list with him. To mention a  few things: Martinair wants to acquire landing rights, while  Van Ommeren has shown an interest in providing container  processing in the Mexican harbors which are to be privatized  this year.    Aircraft manufacturer Fokker is positive about potential  sales to Mexican airlines, but sees problems in financing  possible orders. Schiphol is involved in the plans to expand the  international airport in Mexico City, while there are also plans  to build a new airport just outside the city.    In turn, the Netherlands Government wants to provide  assistance in developing the harbor in the coastal town of  Veracruz. Cooperation on the governmental level is also being  sought in the field of medical technology and, in the spring, a  return visit by a delegation from the Mexican Energy Ministry is  expected to examine how coal gasification is conducted in the  Netherlands.    There are opportunities to spare, above all in the  infrastructure where large investments are expected in the  coming years in NAFTA's wake. Various Netherlands engineering  consulting firms have already become involved in this sector.  In addition Andriessen thinks there are opportunities for  Mexican industry to set up a European distribution center in the  Netherlands. [passage omitted]     "

""This is Salaam 2. All is well. What do you want?""    ""Salaam 2, overtake me, we are entering a road under Israeli  jurisdiction. According to regulations, you are supposed to  lead the joint patrol on this road.""    ""Salaam 1, thank you. Am overtaking, follow me. Over and  out.""    This conversation in Arabic was held over the ""peace""  network  in northern Jericho Tuesday [17 May] morning.    Salaam 2 -- an Israeli Border Police patrol jeep, and Salaam  2 -- a patrol jeep of the PLO's al-Aqsa Brigade -- jointly  patrolled road No. 90 from Jericho to al-'Awja'. The  conversation was received in the joint PLO-Israeli operations  room located on a military base in the Vered Yeriho junction,  and was duly logged by the Palestinian duty officer. The same  conversation was received in the al-Aqsa Brigade operations room  in Jericho and the Border Police company's operations room in  the Vered Yeriho junction.    The Salaam 2 jeep was commanded by a Border Police  subinspector. Three policemen occupied the back seat -- two from  the Border Police and one from Israel Police. They were  carrying M-16's and wearing bulletproof vests. An orange flag  -- the joint patrol's emblem -- was flying on the jeep's roof.    The Salaam 1 jeep -- a khaki-colored Palestinian Toyota --  was occupied by five solders and a lieutenant. Their appearance  was much less uniform. The driver wore light khakis, the  officer and three soldiers -- olive drabs. Each had different  shoes on. As for the fifth soldier, he wore camouflage and a  red beret. They were all cradling Kalashnikov rifles in their  arms. Just like the Israeli jeep roof, theirs had an orange  flag, but also a large Palestinian flag.    This week Jericho looked as if the messiah had already come.  Yesterday's enemies were now pals. A peaceful honeymoon seemed  to have followed the cross, grating wedding in Cairo three weeks  earlier. 'Arafat and Rabin are cross, but in Jericho,  Palestinian and Israeli soldiers -- perhaps still in shock at  the first encounter -- managed to cooperate this week. And  quite well, too.    Inspector Salah Khatib, a Galilee Druze Border Police  officer, is the Israeli commander of the joint operations room.  ""I never dreamed of such a situation. The same man, who could  have been at the other end of my gun a few days ago, is now  sitting next to me. We shake hands. We have coffee together.  We work in full cooperation. I am really enjoying every  moment. Although it has not been long, there is a feeling of  real friendship. We feel as if we have been working together  for a long time.""    Lieutenant Jum'a Marwan from the al-Aqsa Brigade is sitting  next to him. He, too, is beaming: ""Thank God, we are sitting  together after 40 years of enmity. It is a dream. Sitting  together in the same room with an Israeli officer, working on a  joint security task -- it's a dream. We spend many hours  together. We eat together. We talk. We cooperate like  brothers. I hope all the agreements signed by Brother  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] will materialize.""    So far, thank God, there have been no serious events to put  the cooperation to a test. This idyll (or nightmare for  pessimists) may evolve into a crisis soon enough. There are  enough friction points both in Jericho and Gaza. A stone thrown  at a Na'ama settler's car, hitting a child, or gunfire at a  Qatif Bloc settler's car are an example of real-life events.  Not to mention the formidable land mine created by the Shalom  'Al Yisra'el synagogue. By the way, the fuse of this Jericho  bomb may have been ignited this week.    The settlers came to the site carrying weapons. The  Palestinians fumed. ""They cannot bring weapons to prayer in a  synagogue,"" Jericho military commander, Isma'il al-Hajj,  grumbled. Faysal al-Husayni warned that the Hebron event is  liable to recur in the Jericho synagogue. Under the agreement,  an Israeli may carry licensed weapons when entering autonomy  territory. ""The agreement does not state that armed settlers  may enter a synagogue,"" al- Husayni told the U.S. secretary of  state, asking for his intervention.    But the settlers remained adamant. To their dismay, the  agreement limited their presence at the synagogue to the time  between 0900 and 1800, in a group not exceeding 30 worshipers.  This week they demonstratively ignored the Palestinian  soldiers. ""We will not obey their orders,"" they declared.    The security cooperation was the result of the need to imbue  complicated agreement clauses with content. The security  responsibility distribution between Israel -- which is in charge  of foreign security, settlement security, and the security of  Israelis -- and the Palestinian authority -- which is in charge  of internal security and public order enforcement in autonomy  territory -- requires close cooperation between field soldiers.    To enable that, the sides established the JSC [preceding  abbreviation in English], the Joint Coordination and Cooperation  Committee, in which officers exchange information and guide the  three DCO's [preceding abbreviation in English], the District  Coordination and Cooperation Offices, which have been set up in  Gaza, Khan Yunus, and Jericho.    The three coordination offices operate 24 hours a day as  joint commands. The offices guide the joint patrols and the  joint stationary patrols.    Patrols are carried out 24 hours every day along autonomy  roads used by Israelis and the length of the shore opposite the  Qatif Bloc. The joint patrol includes an Israeli jeep and a  Palestinian jeep. The patrol is led by an Israeli vehicle on  roads under Israeli jurisdiction and by a Palestinian one on  roads for which Palestinians are responsible.    In addition, six joint mobile units have been deployed in  the  Nisanit junction, Netzarim junction, Kfar Darom junction,  Sufa-Morag junction, Vered Yeriho junction, and in the vicinity  of the Elisha' Nahal Brigade presettlement in northern Jericho.  These units are the alert force.    The operations room of the Jericho regional coordination  office at the military base near the Vered Yeriho checkpoint was  inaugurated last Friday. ""Authorized Personnel Only,"" its door  says.    The trailer is partitioned into three sections: the Israeli  command room, the Palestinian command room, and the joint  operations room between these two. Two officers -- an Israeli  and a Palestinian -- sit behind a large desk. The table  accommodates a telephone, a radio, logs, and maps. The wall  features a large 1:200,000 map of the autonomous areas. The map  is in Hebrew and Arabic. The main traffic axes are prominently  marked in purple. Another wall features a chart of the joint  radio network in Hebrew and Arabic. ""Salaam"" (peace) is this  extensive network's code name. All the checkpoints around  Jericho, the Allenby Bridge, the joint patrols, and the troop  commanders are linked up to it.    A list of duty officers and aides hangs on another wall. On  the day we visited, the lists said: On the Israeli side, patrol  commander is Lt. Amir, on the Palestinian side -- Lt. Hisham.  Stationary force in Elisha': Israeli Lt. Bini and Palestinian  Lt. Ashraf; in Vered Yeriho, Palestinian Lt. Anis and Israeli  Lt. Dash.    Lt. Hani 'Iyad is sitting in the Palestinian operations  room.  He says his family are refugees from Zefat. He is quick with a  smile, plump and bespectacled. The East Jerusalem daily AL-QUDS  lies on his desk. Two soldiers sit on a bench in the corner  next to him. They hold Kalashnikov rifles. ""I have served in  the Palestinian army since my youth many years ago,"" he says,  then turns away to listen to a report on the radio network.    ""Where are you from?"" he asks. ""From YEDI'OT AHARONOT,"" we  reply, and he laughs. ""I am familiar with it, you know. I read  your newspaper. Even in Iraq, we used to get translations of  your newspaper.""    [Shaqed] How is the joint work with the Israelis going?    ['Iyad] Very well, thank God. There is no wall between us.  We eat together, drink together, sit together. How are the  Israelis? Ordinary people. They received us as a matter of  course. Our coordination is built on understanding. We have not  trained together yet, we are merely starting our cooperation.  Regarding joint training and exercises, you should ask the  command. I do not have the authority to answer that.    [Shaqed] What are your open-fire orders?    ['Iyad] The matter is clear to us. Any problem that arises  should be solved quietly and amicably. Like brothers. In the  Israeli areas, the solution of problems is up to the Israeli  jeep, while in the Palestinian areas it is up to our jeep. God  willing, there will be no problems. We have received orders to  solve problems quietly and amicably. [end 'Iyad]    The Palestinian soldiers working in the regional  coordination  office are still accorded the ""full board"" treatment, which  includes meals in the Israeli mess hall. The Palestinians have  somewhat of a problem in this respect. They have a dining room  in the administration building. Cooks, too. But they have no  food. Funds pledged to the policing force have not arrived yet.  In the meantime, Jericho residents are the suppliers of food  and meals. A 16-member committee representing various major  local families was established in the city to collect donations  for the al-Aqsa Brigade. During the first week, they received  free gasoline from a local gas station owner.    Colonel 'Ofer is the Israeli commander of the Jericho  regional coordination unit. The Palestinian side is represented  by Brig. Gen. Sa'di Naji, deputy commander of the al-Aqsa  Brigade. A civilian-clad Brig. Gen. Naji secretly arrived in  Jericho a week prior to the evacuation. He spent the nights at  the home of 'Abd- al-Karim Sidar, the Fatah chief in Jericho,  who briefed him about the city and its problems. He spent the  days with Col. 'Ofer and other senior officers. He studied the  roads, the various problems of the Jericho area, coordinated  various necessary issues, and prepared the patrol troops  induction. The preliminary preparations helped the joint force  to perform efficiently from its first hours.    Col. 'Ofer: ""There is a lot of goodwill on both sides, great  willingness to listen, hash things out -- a definitely positive  spirit. No social ties, though. We are two different sides,  and we are here to do a job. No joint training is scheduled and  none has been done so far.""    Brig. Gen. Sa'di Naji is wearing a red beret and commando  shoes. There are no decorations or emblems on his uniform, just  a small metal Palestinian flag on his chest. He has a small  two-way radio and a red attache case. He drives around Jericho  in a Mercedes 230 loaned by a city resident, who has volunteered  to chauffeur him around: ""The synagogue is the most sensitive  friction point we have in Jericho,"" he says as we drove to the  site. When we got there, about 30 settlers, including Knesset  Member Hanan Porat, were inside. The settlers ignored him  almost completely. It was Brig. Gen. Naji's first-ever  encounter with settlers. He, too, seemed to be experiencing a  kind of a first-encounter shock. He made an effort to focus on  security problems. ""They are here in accordance with the  agreement. I hope they are here to pray, not to stage a  provocation. I further hope the problems will be solved through  persuasion.""    Brig. Gen. Naji was astounded to see weapons on the  settlers' shoulders. Captain Muhammad Lutfi, the Palestinian  security officer at the synagogue, did not exactly know what the  instructions were. ""The settlers are armed. I must be given  instructions. Should they be allowed in with their arms or  not?"" he asked. A brief conversation with Col. 'Ofer solved the  problem. ""According to the agreement, they are allowed,"" he told  his PLO counterpart.    The first mini-friction occurred last Friday. A group of 10  Kakh members snuck into the synagogue after dark. The  Palestinian soldiers summoned the joint patrol which evacuated  the Kakh men from the area. Procedures worked. However, the  real tests still lie ahead.    The joint patrol makes its way along Route 90 on an average  of once every half an hour. The Palestinian vehicles  occasionally change. Their car pool is still small, and  consists of 10 Toyota and 8 Land Rover jeeps. The Land Rovers  were given them as a gift by King Husayn when he bid farewell to  the soldiers two hours before they entered Jericho. On the  first day of the joint patrols it was the Israeli jeep that had  problems. The Palestinian officer knew something about  mechanics and helped repair it.    Moshe, a blue-uniformed Israeli policemen, regularly takes  part in the patrols: ""I do my job according to instructions,  exactly by the book. The feeling is good. Personal relations  have not yet emerged but, in my opinion, personal relations are  not necessary in this job. They are serious in their attitude.  They know how to speak on the radio in order to conduct the  patrols properly. In this respect, they know their job.""    We met Wa'il Muhammad Subhi in the Palestinian jeep. He  comes from Kafr al-Labad near Tulkarm. He left the West Bank in  1967 and joined the Palestinian Liberation Army. As soon as he  gets his first leave he will visit his relatives in the village.  At the moment, his wife and four children are still in Jordan.  After three days of joint patrols Wa'il Muhammad manages to see  the half-full cup: ""We ate together, we smoked cigarettes  together. It is 70-80 percent all right. We talked. They  asked us about our past. We do not frighten them, and they do  not frighten us. If only it remains this way.""     "

Here is our colleague with a report on this.    [Unidentified correspondent, by telephone] It is reported  that fighter planes belonging to General Dostam and Ahmad Shah  Mas'ud appeared in the Kabul sky today and bombarded each  other's positions.    During the past two days air attacks by warring forces have  been very severe. While General Dostam's fighter planes have  bombed the presidential palace and the Baghram military airport  on several occasions, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's fighter planes have  attacked several of his opponents' positions, including  Charasyab, situated 25 km south of Kabul. According to reports  the presidential palace has been severely damaged. Furthermore,  yesterday's bombing of Charasyab caused great damage to the  Afghan prime minister's television center. The Afghan Hezb-e  Eslami [Islamic Party] has, however, once again declared its  neutrality concerning the current fighting in Kabul.    The secretary general of the Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic  Unity Party] said yesterday: The current war -- just like the  other conflicts in the past 21 months -- will not have a  decisive effect in resolving the Afghan political problems. He  added: The only way to resolve Afghan problems is to set up a  neutral government in which the principal participants would be  the four main political and military groups; that is, the Hezb-e  Eslami, Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], Hezb-e Wahdat-e  Eslami, and the Afghan National Islamic Movement. Abdolali  Mazari said: Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami cooperates with the other  members of the Afghan Supreme Cooperation Council solely from a  political point of view.    Meanwhile reports coming from Jalalabad indicate that  thousands of refugees from Kabul are stranded without any  shelter in cold mountain areas between Jalalabad and the  Pakistani border. Kabul hospital sources say that the fighting  in the past three weeks has left hundreds dead and more than  8,000 injured.     "

At  the conclusion of his two-day visit to Bonn, Syrian Foreign  Minister Faruq al-Shar' said that his country has a ""real will  for a lasting and comprehensive peace."" At the same time,  however, he rejected ""partial negotiations"" with Israel. After  the Hebron massacre, the international community now must exert  pressure on Israel, which, in Syria's view is not ""seriously""  interested in a ""just peace.""    He fears that, with its policy of two-sided negotiations  with  its neighbors, Israel just wants to divide the Arab camp,  al-Shar' said. ""Partial solutions"" would not bring about peace  but, perhaps, even worsen the situation. Thus, the agreement  between Israel and the PLO did not bring peace, but only  encouraged extremists. The bloodbath of Hebron was the  ""consequence of this agreement."" With this position al-Shar'  contradicted the view of his host, German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany), who had called the  agreement a first step toward a ""constructive prospect for a  lasting reconciliation.""    Despite his rejection of partial negotiations with Israel,  in  talking to journalists al-Shar' evaded the question of whether  and under which conditions Syria would be ready or resume direct  talks with Israel. He repeated the demand for a complete  withdrawal of the settlers and a complete return of the occupied  territories. Diplomatic circles in Bonn noted positively that  the Syrian minister accused ""extremists from both sides"" -- and  not just Israel alone -- of endangering the peace process.    Syria is interested in more intensive relations with the  European Union. Kinkel promised to advocate a meeting of the  European-Syrian Cooperation Council at the end of the year.  Reportedly, he urged his guest for an extradition agreement  with the FRG. According to intelligence service findings,  German terrorist and Carlos associate Weinrich has found refuge  in Syria. Syria's government denies this.     "

A Finance Ministry source said that US Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen is expected to repeat the call at his meeting with  Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin on January 19. The topic  will be on the agenda, which includes a double taxation  avoidance treaty, the bilateral Treaty of Amity, and the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.    Last year, U.S. officials urged their Thai counterparts to  introduce a law to prevent money laundering, following bilateral  talks on how to curb the narcotics trade. At that time,  Thailand informed the U.S. that it would consider the matter.    The source, however, noted that the Thai government is  unlikely to introduce such a law as it would burden local  financial institutions. Another source noted that it might be  difficult for the government to even pass the required bill in  the current political situation.    Moreover, Thailand currently has some laws related to money  laundering practices. The first source added that the  introduction of a new law might run counter to the country's  plan to move towards financial liberalization since it would  lead to restrictive regulations on the remittance of money.    At any rate, the Finance Ministry has set up a working  committee to study the pros and cons of such a law and whether  it's timely for the country to introduce a bill. Recently,  Finance Ministry officials also flew to Singapore to discuss  procedures in that country's money-laundering act.    Singapore is the only ASEAN country which has a  money-laundering act because, being a free-port nation, the  industrialized island sees a need for tight control of money  remittances.    The source said that Secretary Bentsen is likely to urge  Thailand to introduce a bill by citing the healthy growth of the  economy, Bangkok's current financial liberalization and its  ambition to become a regional financial centre.

Fujii repeated that the governing coalition has already  vowed  to enact in this Diet session a permanent tax overhaul that  shifts the tax burden away from direct taxes, such as those on  income, toward such indirect levies as the consumption tax.    Washington has called Japan's fiscal stimulus steps too  paltry to boost domestic demand to help curb Japan's trade  surplus. U.S. officials fault the one-year nature of the 6  trillion yen in income and resident's tax cuts decided on last  month.    Fujii refused to comment on reports that the fiscal 1994  budget might be delayed or that his ministry is preparing a  provisional budget as opposition lawmakers are blocking the  budget debate by wrangling over a questionable loan to Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The finance minister repeatedly stressed that the ministry  wants the budget debate and enactment to proceed as quickly as  possible but would not offer a time frame.    He said quick enactment would be ""a plus for real demand""  but  would not say whether delays would hurt the economy.    He repeated that Japan does not plan to offer any new trade  measures to the U.S. when Fujii meets U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen this weekend at a conference of Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum members.    Whether he will meet separately with Bentsen at the Hawaii  meeting has not been decided, Fujii said, repeating that the  APEC conference is for discussing regional economics and ""is not  a place for negotiating.""

But those forecasts were not  to be realized.    The regular meetings held between our countries' leaders are  the best indicator of the scale of bilateral relations in the  political sphere. Perhaps no other state leader in Europe  maintains such close contacts with the Russian Federation  president as Chancellor Kohl: There are reciprocal visits and a  constant exchange of opinions with Boris Yeltsin by telephone  and in the form of personal messages. Yesterday the Russian  president arrived in Germany on an official visit, and in August  he will take part in the send-off ceremony for the Russian  troops.    The cooperation between the two states rests on a  strengthening treaty and legal basis. Twenty five  intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements have been  signed in the recent period alone.    Germany is now one of Russia's main economic partners. It  accounts for 17 percent of our foreign trade turnover. Russia  is a very important partner for the FRG in the east. Fifty-five  production-sharing contracts, mainly in machine building, are  now in operation between the two countries' companies. More  than 100 companies in production, trade, transport and dispatch,  insurance, and other areas of cooperation have been set up in  Germany using Russian capital. A considerable amount of our  exports to the FRG go via them.    The German side is helping the process of privatization in  Russia. The spectrum is diverse, ranging from the formation of  the legal bases of private enterprise to joint research efforts  and specific projects. For example, a company promoting  economic reforms in the Moscow Oblast is operating with active  German government department support and oversight. The  Wintershall Erdgas Handelshaus joint venture is functioning  successfully.    Enterprises with German share capital on Russian Federation  territory number more than 1,700. Germany is entering into  cooperation with Russia in the implementation of international  space projects. It also intends to make its contribution to the  program of implementing projects of ours in chemical production,  power generation, capital construction, and aircraft  construction. Business relations are being set up between our  two states' regions.    Sessions of the Russian-German Cooperation Council for  Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation are held  regularly. A bureau for a representative [delegat] of the  German economy has been opened in St. Petersburg. Special  bursaries for Russian graduates of higher educational  institutions studying management, economics, and production  organization are being established in a number of German  concerns, for example, Daimler-Benz AG.    The FRG government intends to promote the involvement of  German private capital in Russian reforms. According to  experts' figures, German companies, with a total capital of $4.2  billion, make up 60 percent of foreign investors in Russia.    The FRG has helped in no small way the development of  relations between Russia and the EU. Moscow and Bonn are  stepping up their cooperation at the UN and CSCE level. It has  stated its readiness to support Russia's membership application  to the Council of Europe and is in favor of the creation of  strategic partnership relations between Russia and NATO.    Bonn has welcomed Russian diplomacy's efforts to unblock  the crisis situation over Sarajevo. The stances of Russia and  the FRG regarding the solution of the Yugoslav crisis coincide  to a large extent and there are no substantial disagreements.    All-around contacts are maintained in the military sphere.  Joint maritime exercises involving naval combined units will be  conducted this year. Troop exercises at the level of tactical  subunits are planned in the future. A center for training and  retraining our servicemen returning from Germany in civilian  specialisms was recently opened in the Russian capital with FRG  financial assistance. The sides are cooperating effectively in  the sphere of eliminating nuclear and chemical weapons.    A joint Russian-German commission for the reciprocal return  of cultural treasures removed during World War II has begun  work. Consultations on events to mark its 50th anniversary are  being held.    The problem of the ethnic Germans on Russian Federation  territory is a very important aspect of Russian-German  relations. A protocol was signed in July 1992 which envisages  cooperation in the phased restoration of the Russian Germans'  statehood and better provision of facilities in areas where they  represent a high proportion of the population. This year the  FRG will allocate 65 million German marks [DM] for these  purposes. For the first time Russia's draft budget earmarks 30  billion rubles likewise. Thanks to these measures, it has been  possible to check somewhat the growth of repatriation of Russian  Germans to Germany.    But our relations are not unclouded. Touching on problems in  the economic sphere, reciprocal trade turnover last year,  according to preliminary figures, was DM20.5 billion as against  DM21.8 billion in 1992. The worrying thing is that Moscow has  not to date been able to repay the debt of approximately DM40  billion accumulated since Soviet times. True, an  intergovernmental accord consolidating the foreign debts of  Russia and the former USSR was signed in September 1993. We  have been granted a 10-year deferment of payment on DM8  billions' worth of debt.    The question of German investments in the Russian economy is  critical. The amount of investment is substantially less than  in, say, a country like Hungary. This year new arrangements  regulating the cost of export credit guarantees have been  introduced through the well-known FRG company Hermes: We now  have to put 15 percent up-front in order to obtain credit  guarantees. This makes it less interesting for us to take them  up.    But these sore points can be treated. Boris Yeltsin's visit  to our friendly neighboring country will undoubtedly make a  substantial contribution to further deepening all-around  Russian-German parnership links.     "

The Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat issued a  communique announcing the creation of the subpanel. The  communique added that in his speech in Brussels, Herminio Blanco  Mendoza, under secretary for international trade negotiations,  assessed President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's economic and  social policy, which seeks to improve the distribution of income  and combat extreme poverty.    During this meeting, Blanco Mendoza stressed the need to  create jobs and raise the competitiveness of Mexico's productive  sector. He said the government's efforts in these areas have  gotten under way through the utilization of four complementary  strategies. These strategies are: achieving macroeconomic  stability; consolidating trade opening; deregulating various  sectors of the economy; and expanding bilateral, subregional,  and multilateral negotiations to open and reinforce markets.    Foreign Under Secretary Antonio de Icaza, in turn, noted  that  new circumstances were affecting Mexico and the world, and he  stressed that Mexico was undergoing a deep-rooted transformation  to adapt to the new situation. In this regard, it should be  stressed that Mexico, besides being a founder of the European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has joined the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and will soon join the  OECD. In addition, NAFTA will provide Mexico with the means to  consolidate structural changes and to achieve an efficient  incorporation into the world economy.    In discussing the nation's recent evolution, De Icaza  highlighted the national political agreement reached a short  time ago and the different electoral reforms and other pacts  that consolidate democracy and strengthen its institutions.    Juan Prat, general director in charge of North-South  relations, noted that greater emphasis on economic cooperation  constitutes a solution to the new situation in Latin America by  encouraging activities of mutual interest that will reinforce  regional reform.

Tsai]    [Text] Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA) -- The 1994 energy research    development and technology transfer seminar of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum opened at the Taipei  International Convention Center Wednesday [2 February].    More than 180 industry, academic, and government  representatives from 17 APEC member countries are taking part in  the two-day energy seminar.    Discussions focus on three main areas -- ""technology to  convert wastes into energy sources,"" ""efficient energy  utilization technology in urban areas,"" and ""the effective  utilization of energy for the creation of improved amenities.""    This is the first time that Taiwan has hosted an APEC  seminar  since it joined the regional organization in 1991. The energy  seminar is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and  Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    Addressing the opening ceremony on behalf of Economic  Affairs  Minister P.K. Chiang, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu  Ke-sheng expressed the hope that this seminar and other similar  gatherings will help strengthen cooperation among APEC members  on energy conservation and efficiency improvement.    The Asia-Pacific region, which had the world's fastest  economic growth over the past decade, still faces the challenge  of solving the ""3e"" problems of energy, economics, and  environment, Sheu said.    It is therefore most appropriate that ""new and efficient  energy technology to create a safe, clean, and comfortable  environment for the next decade"" has been chosen as the main  theme of the forum, he explained.    In Taiwan, he noted, the government is also plagued with  ""the  emerging problems in energy demand and their environmentally  unfriendly potential, both locally and internationally.""    In addition to increased domestic reserach in new energies,  waste management, and efficiency upgrading, Taiwan has also  initiated ""research programs, that take on a more universal  significance, in carbon dioxide omission control and alternative  refrigerants,"" he pointed out.    APEC, founded in 1989, groups Australia, Brunei, Canada,  Mainland China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New  Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,  Thailand, the United States, Papua New Guinea, and Mexico.

A Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation  (MIECE) source confirmed to PRENSA LATINA that Camilo Penalosa,  Colombian deputy minister of economic development, headed this  delegation.    The Colombian businessmen identified investment  opportunities  in the areas of tourism, the sugar and pharmaceutical  industries, biotechnology, agricultural sector, and basic  industry, among others.    The visitors initially received ample information during a  plenary session, which was offered by MIECE representatives, the  Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Chamber of Commerce of Cuba,  in which they discussed the ideas presented by the delegation on  possible joint ventures.    The delegation also learned about current legislation on  foreign investment in Cuba and about preparations for the future  approval of a law for mutual promotion and protection of this  kind of business resulting from the development of economic  links.    Members of this business group joined the Cuba '94 Tourism  Convention which is currently being held at the well-known  Varadero Beach, about 140 km from the capital, because this is  precisely the area where there already exist more immediate  possibilities for bilateral cooperation.    Among other activities, the delegation visited the Sugar  Industry and Finance Ministries and the facilities of the  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. There, they were  briefed on the country's production efforts and the use of their  installed capacities.    When consulted by PRENSA LATINA, Roberto Rivas, the MIECE  director for America, described the visit as another step in the  process of identifying possibilities for joint work and  expansion of existing links between the two Latin American  countries.    Deputy Minister Penalosa and other businessmen returned to  their country today, but those who are participating in the  tourist convention remain on the island.     "

Documents to this effect  were submitted on Thursday to the Japanese Government during  two-day consultations in Tokyo. The Russian side was  represented at the consultations by a delegation led by  academician Nikolay Laverov, vice-president of the Russian  Academy of Sciences.    When discussing possible disposal of liquid low-active waste  produced by nuclear-powered submarines of the Pacific Fleet, the  Russian delegation, which included representatives of the Navy,  suggested calculating how much it will cost to stop dumping  these wastes into the world ocean and to build facilities for  their complete recycling. Another proposal provides for the  construction not far from the Siberian city of Tomsk of a  storage for uranium and plutonium released in the process of  dismantling nuclear warheads.    Commenting on the Russian projects in an interview with  TASS,  Nikolay Yegorov, a member of the delegation and Russian deputy  minister for nuclear power engineering, stressed that in this  manner the Russian side displayed an initiative to promote  implementation of the agreements reached, specifically, during  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo this October.  Yegorov noted that Japan's participation in both projects would  not cost it more than 6 mln dollars out of the 100 mln dollars  of the earlier announced financial assistance to the former  Soviet Union's nuclear disarmament. In any case, Moscow is  ready to shoulder the lion's share of expenses.    The Japanese side, represented at the meeting by experts of  the Foreign Ministry, scientific and technical department and  the Ministry for Foreign Trade and Industry, showed a great  interest not only in Russia's proposals, but in the very  possibility of exchange of opinions between nuclear specialists.  An official of the scientific and technical department gave a  positive assessment to the consultations and stressed that Japan  favoured this initiative and was ready to go ahead with it.     "

At the opening ceremonies of the Sino-U.S. talks on trade  and  investment projects held today, this female Chinese minister  stressed that China hopes to resolve the MFN status  unconditionally. The MFN status is a pure trade issue; it is  unwise to link it to the ""human rights"" issue, nor does it  comply with strategic thinking.    The Chinese Government trade and economic relations  delegation headed by Wu Yi arrived in Los Angeles on 8 April and  will leave for Washington D.C. tomorrow to attend the Eighth  Session of the Sino- U.S. Joint Committee for Commerce and  Trade. During the four-day stay in Los Angeles, Wu Yi has  answered questions on the MFN status on several occasions put by  figures from various circles.    She said that the MFN status is the kernel clause in the  Sino- U.S. Agreement on Trade Relations signed in 1979. It is  not a favor bestowed by one country on another but an  arrangement of mutual benefit on an equal footing.    She believed that, should the United States cancel the MFN  status, China would suffer certain losses; however, the United  States would likewise suffer and its losses would be bigger than  those of China. The United States would lose the huge Chinese  market whereas more products, technology, and funds from other  countries would find their way into the Chinese market.    Today, Wu Yi repeatedly called on the United States to adopt  a practical attitude, weigh the pros and cons, and remove  manmade obstacles to enable Sino-U.S. ties in trade and economic  relations to develop healthily.

0,FT921-14461 ,"FT921-14461 _AN-CAPBMAAOFT 920116   FT  16 JAN 92 / Vengeful Saddam keeps Arab opponents on edge: The growing uncertainties afflicting the region      By TONY WALKER   THE surreal spectacle of a larger-than-life Saddam Hussein pinning 'mother of battles' anniversary medals on the chests of his military commanders would have brought little comfort to his jittery Arab opponents, preoccupied with developments in Algeria and their own domestic problems. While this week's television theatre in Baghdad, marked by the Iraqi president's claims of 'victory' in the Gulf war, might be dismissed as sheer bravado, the episode was nevertheless an uncomfortable reminder to his rivals that in spite of everything Mr Saddam lives on. An Arab proverb, repeated with some nervousness in Cairo these days, holds that a snake is not dead until its head is severed from the body. This melodramatic observation usually precedes criticism of the allies for not doing more to unseat the Iraqi leader when the opportunity presented itself. Now, a year after the US-led alliance began the assault which liberated Kuwait, the fruits of that victory in Arab eyes seem less appealing. True, Kuwait was saved and Mr Saddam was humbled, but divisions in the Arab world have scarcely been deeper and the future less certain. Not least, concern in the capitals of Washington's moderate Arab allies stems from the dramatic erosion in Mr Bush's domestic standing, with consequent fears that a weakened administration would be less steadfast in defence of its friends abroad, and thus less capable of imposing Middle East peace. Adding to these worries are the activities of the neo-isolationists on the Republican right-wing. Iraq's official media, reduced to a whisper by last January's bombing campaign, now spends its days gloating about Mr Bush's misfortunes. Iraqis are bombarded with negative images of recession-hit America, implying somehow that life in Iraq, in spite of everything, is preferable. 'As we celebrate, with our heads held high, the first anniversary of the tyrannical 30-state aggression against us, Bush. . . was touring Asian countries looking for a solution to the economic crisis the US is suffering from,' commented al Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Ba'ath party. While much Iraqi propaganda is ludicrous, recent visitors to Iraq have been struck by the regime's success in rebuilding the country's battered infrastructure, and restoring essential services. The authorities also appear to be making a reasonable fist of providing food rations for the needy, in spite of sanctions and the burden of rising prices; inflation of 30 per cent a month is reported. Predictions that defeat in Kuwait would foment a revolt against Mr Saddam among Iraq's office corps - the favoured scenario of the US and its Arab allies - have not come to fruition, and as the months pass hopes of this happening diminish. The Iraqi leadership appears to have regained some of its poise and is now more visible, although reports persist of dissension in the ranks, including within Mr Saddam's immediate coterie. The regime has also been obliged to deal with an incipient underground campaign, much like the one that was waged during the Iran-Iraq war by the outlawed al Dawaa Shia fundamentalists. At least one car-bombing - the trademark of the underground group - has been carried out in Baghdad in recent weeks. The military, shattered by its defeat in Kuwait and further run ragged by the Kurdish and Shia revolts following the war, has been reorganised and discipline tightened under new defence minister Ali Hassan al-Majid, a cousin of Mr Saddam. The Kurds in the north and the repressed Shia in the south would be drawing little comfort from this: Kurdish leaders have been warning for weeks that Mr Saddam will use the winter months to drive Kurdish fighters from towns south of the UN-declared safety zone. Recent reports suggest that Iraq has been seeking to replenish its depleted arsenal and UN experts, engaged in uncovering details of the Iraqi nuclear programme, suspect that work continues on efforts to acquire a nuclear capability. In the capitals of Arab states of the anti-Iraq alliance, officials have no doubt that a craving for revenge is never far from an isolated and weakened Mr Saddam. 'When the great confrontation took place,' the Iraqi president declared pointedly this week, 'God decreed that victory once again must go to the Iraqis because they follow the path of truth while their enemies follow the path of falsehood.'

However there are no plans  to sign the program during his visit. Interfax learned this  from Yuriy Ushakov, the chief of the European Cooperation  Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry.    According to him, the issue of Russia's joining the  Partnership For Peace program is still being considered. ""At  the moment it's hard to say what time interdepartmental  discussions will take. Neither has it been decided in what form  Russia will submit its considerations concerning its joining  NATO's Partnership For Peace program,"" he said.

When asked whether Moscow intends to receive guarantees that  upon signing the program Russia will not find itself in a  position of NATO's ""junior partner"", Ushakov said ""Yes"". ""We  want to discuss the entire format of our relations with NATO in  advance,"" he said.    As Interfax's interviewee said, Moscow is deciding ""when and  in what form it will submit to NATO its presentation document  which concretizes the possible directions of interaction between  Russia and NATO in the framework of the Partnership For Peace  program.""    When asked about NATO's reaction to the cancellation of  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to NATO's headquarters  in Brussels planned for April 21 because of the developments in  Bosnia, Ushakov said: ""NATO's program says that a potential  partner decides on its own when to sign the document and on what  level. For Russia it is not important whether it will be the  fifth, sixth, or fourteenth to join the Partnership program.  What is important to us is to make this partnership meaningful  in real terms.""     "

Exportkhleb President Aleksandr Belik told ITAR-TASS that  this credit was quite advantageous for Russia. It was granted  for a period of 15 years. Repayment by instalments is to begin  within 7 years from now.    All in all, Russia has purchased abroad, according to Belik,  about 10.5 million tonnes of grain. Although purchases were  made also in other Western countries, the United States has  remained Russia's main supplier, as in many previous years.    Does Russia's intention to cut grain imports signify its  desire to curtail cooperation with American agro-industrial  firms? Belik believes that the possible area of such  cooperation is sufficiently broad. He noted that Russia, no  matter what efforts it exerts, will not be able to satisfy all  its requirements in soya, maize, seeds, and fodder additives.  The purchases will not be as impressive as they had been, but  they are unavoidable. Therefore, Exportkhleb does not plan to  interrupt its contacts.    ""American grain farms are now experiencing some  difficulties,"" Belik said. ""The situation is better at farms  that have gone over in proper time to the processing of grain  into fodder, that have obtained a foothold in the food and  processing industry. Why shouldn't we cooperate with them in  the building of soya-processing complexes, combined fodder  factories, and port elevators in Russia? The summer sales of  ready goods is ending and we are trying to convince our American  partners that investment ventures will lay the foundation for  futue broad cooperation. As to Exportkhleb, it knows our  market, its requirements and possibilities, and is ready to  discuss various versions of cooperation, crediting, settlements  and other terms meeting the interests of all the partners  involved.""

She is optimistic about the possibility that  our country might become the beneficiary of significant  financial support.    Danish economic cooperation with our country was  discontinued  after [former Bolivian dictator Luis] Garcia Meza's coup in  1980. The cooperation agreement was not restored for over a  decade. Bolivia may now be a Latin American country chosen to  receive financial support from this Nordic country.    [Begin Degn recording in Danish with superimposed  translation  into Spanish, in progress] ...actually much interest, and eager  to visit the cooperation projects between Denmark and Bolivia.  [end recording]    Asked why the cooperation had been discontinued for such a  long time, the minister explained that Denmark had waited for  democracy to be solidly established in our country.    Bolivia is, however, not the only country hoping for this  financial assistance. [passage indistinct]    With the goal of convincing the Danish Government of our  country's various needs, Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas  will join Minister Degn in traveling to Beni Department and the  plateau region.    [Begin Cardenas recording] In our governmental agenda this  cooperation is required, especially in the fields of  agriculture, craftsmanship, the advancement of women,  educational reform, dairy products -- an area in which they have  already been supporting us in a significant manner -- and other  areas that our country may propose to Denmark.    I have discovered that she has an extremely positive  attitude  toward cooperation with our country. These three days will be  dedicated to talking with her in depth to convince her -- and  convince the Danish people -- of resuming and normalizing their  cooperation with our country.    I hope the rains will allow us to have an uneventful and  successful trip. [end recording]    The Danish minister was optimistic. She also visited  Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and Economic  Development Minister Fernando Romero.    Danish cooperation will be earmarked in particular for  social  programs. If positive results are achieved, it will involve $20  million.     "

Official sources said later that Albanian Foreign Minister  Alfred Serreqi voiced ""very deep concern"" over the threat,  urging a greater European commitment to the search for a  negotiated solution.    Both Muslim countries, Turkey and Albania are concerned for  the future of the Bosnian Muslims. Sources said Turkey, at  least, looks kindly on proposals now emerging for a Bosnian  truce next month, new proposals for the geographical division of  the disputed ex-Yugoslav territory, and heavier sanctions  against those who reject them.    The talks with Serreqi covered the whole arc of southern  Balkan Europe in which the Bosnian war has come to be seen as a  decisive threat.    One issue is Kossovo, the Serbian enclave where the ethnic  majority is Albanian; another, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia], whose recognition Greece is loth to  grant because of its fears of future territorial claims; and a  third, the Greek and Albanian ethnic minorities whose presence  in the two countries has led to a sharp rise in tensions  recently.    Speaking for one of a number of states on the edge of the  Balkans, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec urged that the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] of which  Italy holds the duty presidency should be given a peacekeeping  capability.    Zieleniec asked Martino to move in that direction before the  CSCE summit planned in Prague in December. Martino said he  agrees to giving the organisation more agile and effective  mechanisms.    The talks also covered bilateral ties.    Turkey's Ciller urged moves to right the trade balance, and  Serreqi described Albania's moves towards a market economy,  Martino offering words of encouragement.     "

Alarm over the clause, which would link trade and labour  standards, reflects deep suspicions by nearly all developing  countries that the West is seeking to levy additional duties on  the exports of countries which enjoy cheap labour advantages  when the new World Trading Organization (WTO) takes over from  Gatt to police global commerce.    Many Asean officials fear that such a link would turn out to  be a disguised form of protection against imports from economies  with lower labour costs. Asia-Pacific nations, whose economic  growth has been powered by their low-cost exports, are  particularly concerned and have vowed to fight the link.    At last week's 50th annual session of the Economic and  Social  Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap), executive secretary  general Rafiuddin Ahmad led a chorus of denunciations about  attempts by ""countries which might impose neo-protectionism.""    In a national speech on March 21, Indonesia's President  Suharto criticized unspecified world powers which sought to  impose their own views of human and labour rights as a condition  for economic cooperation.    He said that industrial nations were pushing developing  countries on such issues as raising the minimum wage because of  their troubled economies and declining competitiveness.    ""No country has the right to dictate their own concepts or  views to another country... Let alone to force their will as a  condition for international economic cooperation,"" he said.    Speaking at last week's Pacific Economic Cooperation Council  (PECC) conference, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai  Phanitchaphak acknowledged that the US efforts to include a  social clause in a global trade treaty were not new and go back  to 1987. But he cautioned that ""The proposal could lead to  market impediments for goods from less-developed countries.""    At the same forum Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed  charged that the West was trying to weaken developing nations by  imposing minimum wages.    Manila also declared it would resist attempts by the United  States to insert a social clause in any trade agreement,  particularly on issues affecting workers' rights.    Antonio Buencamino, director of the Philippine Bureau of  International Trade Relations, said ""the Philippines opposes any  attempt to include social clauses or workers rights in trade  talks.""    ""Our labour is cheap, but that does not mean it is  exploited,"" Buencamino said, noting that workers in the export  industry often earned much more than the mandated minimum wage.    Despite the uproar in Asia, chief US trade negotiator John  Schmidt, declared before leaving for Morocco that Washington  would not accept the Marrakech declaration or documents related  to the WTO preparatory committee ""without some language"" on  labour rights.    In a bid to quell the row before it erupts into a damaging  North-South split, Gatt chief Peter Sutherland called a meeting  of trade envoys yesterday to seek a compromise.    Observers said much would depend on how hard the United  States presses the issue.    The United States wants a ministerial declaration in  Marrakech to accept that the WTO would deal with the link  between trade and labour. Developing countries have refused to  consider any reference to the issue in the declaration.    Washington, is expected to get its strongest backing from  France which has been pressing the European Union to enact  regulations against ""social dumping"" -- selling goods produced  with cheap labour under poor working conditions.    US and French officials argue that the WTO, which will be a  more powerful watchdog than Gatt, should enforce a connection  between trade and labour conditions.    France wants the body to apply standards that will prevent  countries from exploiting children, prisoners and bonded workers  as a way of gaining trade advantages.    Gatt officials are further worried that the introduction of  the controversial social dimension would divert attention from  work that needs to be done to ensure that measures to liberalize  world trade contained in the Uruguay accords are sealed and  actually applied.    Washington, however, argues that it accepts the existence of  a ""natural comparative advantage"", including wage rate  differentials, linked to a country's degree of development.    The United States submitted at the beginning of the Uruguay  Round in 1987 a paper listing a set of five internationally  recognized standards it saw as trade-related.    The five points were freedom of association for workers,  freedom to organize and bargain collectively, freedom from  forced or compulsory labour, a minimum age for employment of  children, and ""minimum standard"" for working conditions,  including occupational health and safety hazards.    Many members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and  Development (OECD), including Switzerland and the Nordic  countries, concede that these problems will, sooner or later,  have to be faced.    But most feel it would be more timely to raise such issues  when the WTO preparatory committee gets down to work. Any  member would then be free to take up any topic.    Officials said the European Union was proposing a wording  stressing that the committee was free to tackle ""new issues"",  without any specific reference to labour rights.    More than 120 countries are to gather in Marrakech for the  signing of the new pact, which will encompass for the first time  services, intellectual property, agriculture and textiles.    The scale of the agreement, which once fully operative, will  bring an estimated additional worldwide growth of between $230  billion and $270 billion over a decade, helped build a momentum  that brought together Gatt members after seven years of marathon  negotiations.    This same pressure makes most observers confident an  agreement will be signed. Gatt officials, quoted in Marrakech,  said that while they were worried that the row triggered by the  United States might ""spoil the atmosphere"" of the meeting, they  were confident it would not sink the Uruguay Round.

A new  cooperation protocol was signed that updates the action protocol  signed between the two countries in 1992.    Daskalov was received this morning by Mustafa Kalemli,  deputy  speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly. President  Suleyman Demirel received Daskalov at the Cankaya Mansion.  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was also present at the meeting.    Cetin and Daskalov signed a new cooperation protocol that  updates the action protocol signed by the two countries in 1992.    Speaking at the signing ceremony, Cetin said the protocol  envisions the development of cooperation in the military field,  and in the fight against drug trafficking, organized crime, and  terrorism. He pointed out that the Turkish minority in Bulgaria  constitutes a bridge for the friendship between the two  countries. Bulgaria has been acting in an exemplary fashion  regarding this issue in recent years, Cetin said, adding:  Turkey and Bulgaria are two important countries in the Balkans.  The Balkans today are the hottest and most problematic region  in the world. What is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is  a shame for humanity. We have a common understanding to make  every effort to prevent the spreading of the tension and of the  conflict. We also discussed the issues of the Caucasus, the  Middle East, and Iraq. We assessed in detail the effect of the  embargo on Iraq on the economies of Turkey and Bulgaria.    The Bulgarian foreign minister pointed out that his visit  showed that the two countries have the political will to develop  their bilateral relations. Replying to a question, Daskalov  said his country has incurred a loss of about $1.5 billion as a  result of the embargo on Iraq. He stressed that Bulgaria wants  the embargoes on Iraq and on Bosnia-Herzegovina to be lifted.    Daskalov stressed that Bulgaria is not opposed to the  deployment of Turkish troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina within the  framework of the relevant UN resolution.     "

Speaking at a meeting with North Caucasian leaders in Moscow  on Monday on the eve of President Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Georgia, Kozyrev said that the visit will go beyond purely  Georgian-Russian relations as it will signify a serious step  towards carrying out a strategy based on the balance of national  and regional interests in the Caucasus.    The Russian foreign minister brushed off as groundless  suspicions of a ""military-political alliance"" between Russia and  Georgia against Abkhazia. Russia does not divide Caucasian  people into ""friendly"" and ""alien."" It seeks to push forward  the conflict settlement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and  confirm Russia's role as an active mediator in this process,  Kozyrev noted.    If no comprehensive political settlement is reached and no  documents are worked out and signed with the participation of  Russia and the United Nations, it would be complacency to hope  for peace and stability in that region, Kozyrev stressed. He  warned that in that case extreme nationalists will take over in  the region.    He stressed that reaching an agreement on peace-keeping  measures in Abkhazia is a top priority. Those should involve  international peace-keeping forces and observers. Russia has  vital interests in that region, Kozyrev recalled, and will have  to take part in the operation as well. Both Georgia and  Abkhazia request so, he added.    Kozyrev denounced ""mentorship or malevolence of outside  observers and speculations about the `Zhirinovskiy factor', both  in Russia and abroad. We need not lectures about the norms of  the United Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe (CSCE), but practical assistance to promote them in  the Caucasus and the entire post-Soviet space.""    During Yeltsin's visit to Georgia due to take place on  February 3-4, the Russian leader will raise the question of  conflict settlement in South Ossetia where peace has been  maintained by Russian peacekeepers and CSCE representatives.

The OECD has been reluctant to fuel the trade row between the UK and Malaysia by being drawn publicly into the Pergau controversy but domestic criticism of British aid policy towards Malaysia in recent weeks has been sympathetically viewed by OECD aid specialists. The OECD examiners have identified Pergau as a project that does not readily meet essential criteria for the granting of aid. A committee meeting last month, called to consider the British aid programme, discussed the Pergau controversy and reaffirmed that aid should be subjected to the full standards of normal assessment and procedures, and that aid quality should predominate in government decisions. Considerable credence is given in the OECD to last October's critical report of the Pergau project by Britain's National Aid Office. OECD examiners have taken evidence from British officials at the Overseas Development Administration, which is supposed to manage the UK aid programme. ODA civil servants objected to the Pergau project but were overruled by ministers. The OECD is expected to welcome the government's decision last year to change its aid and trade rules, so that a country as prosperous as Malaysia could no longer qualify for assistance. A recent memorandum submitted to the OECD by UK officials defines the aim of UK aid policy as promotion of sustainable economic development in order to 'improve the quality of life and reduce poverty, suffering, and deprivation'. The Pergau project predates this decision.   Countries:-  QMZ  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

During  last Wednesday's [29 December] exchanges in European markets,  the price of all varieties of crude oil fell to its lowest level  in the last five years. [passage omitted]    The West's double standard with regard to international  trade  is quite clear. On the one hand, the West has invariably called  for lifting tariffs and restrictions and has promoted the notion  of free trade; on the other hand, by imposing heavy tariffs on  fossil fuels, it has violated the most fundamental principle of  free trade.    Some economic analysts believe that at present, the  countries  of the Middle East region can bring their economies out of the  present vulnerability only by ending their reliance on income  generated by a single product and expanding their sources of  foreign exchange earnings.    The members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC],  together with Iran and Iraq, can form a powerful alliance in  connection with the oil issue. Due to their common cultural and  historical traits and their good understanding of production  capacities, and also in view of the fact that they hold control  over the most vital source of energy for the industrial  countries of the world, these states are able to deal with the  harmful policies of Europe and America with regards to gasoline.  They can, perhaps, impose heavy tariffs on European and  American products, thereby making amends for part of of the  losses incurred by the fall in oil prices.    In the same way that the Western world waged a devious  confrontation against the oil-producing countries in 1973, now  is the time for the OPEC member states to pave the way for real  growth without reliance on oil income. The OPEC member states  can achieve this growth by transforming their production  structures, lessening their reliance on income generated by oil,  and finally, by enhancing the rich culture of work and  contentment -- which are, after all, characteristics present in  Islamic countries.

During a meeting at  the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in St. Augustin near Bonn,  Kanther stressed today that the overall number of registered  criminal offenses rose to 6.7 million last year. In 1992, the  number was approximately 6.3 million. The citizens ""feel very  insecure and are very worried."" The citizens' feeling of  security is greatly impaired.    Kanther mentioned particularly street crime, burglaries, and  offenses involving cars. In addition, ""thefts are rising fast  and organized crime is spreading in a disquieting manner.""  Criminal organizations with rigid and hierarchical structures  that are based on the division of labor increasingly infiltrate  Germany's economic and social system. Because of the enormous  profits, this development takes place at an ""alarming speed,""  the minister pointed out.    Cross-border crime also plays an increasingly dangerous  role.  As a result of the collapse of communism in East Europe, the  international embezzlement of motor vehicles has risen  considerably. According to the findings of the investigating  authorities, around 40 percent of the cars registered as stolen  are never found. Cooperation with the police in the East  European states must be intensified. The protection of the  external borders and the fight against smuggling refugees is  assuming increasing significance, Kanther stressed. Last year,  over 54,000 foreigners were caught crossing the border illegally.    Europe's desired integration must not have the effect that  borders fall for the criminals but continue to exist for the  investigating authorities, the minister emphasized. Europe  needs a common asylum policy. By shifting personnel within the  Federal Border Police (BGS) and through flexible deployment  concepts, the BGS units should be used for the protection of the  borders to a greater extent than in the past, Kanther announced.  The 1994 law on the fight against crime will probably be  adopted by the Bundestag before the end of this week. The law  on the BGS and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation are  also designed to enhance internal security.     "

The Committee, a consultative  forum which meets every 18 months and involves essentially  economic experts from the Union and ASEAN, spent much of its  latest meeting hammering out ways of improving trade, industrial  cooperation and the possibilities of direct European investment,  technology transfer and financing.    The meeting agreed that market access should be widened in  areas such as intellectual property and services, a point on  which EU officials had voiced particular concern, as they did  over the lack of progress made by the members of ASEAN in  reducing their nontariff barriers despite the commitment the  latter made to do so during the Uruguay Round multilateral trade  negotiations. The Europeans are also keen to see a more  concerted ASEAN approach on tariff reductions, which vary widely  from one country to another.    On the ASEAN side, much was made of the difficulties of  access to the European market for products such as tinned tuna.  ""These concerns could be lessened by regular consultations  designed to clarify specific problems, coupled with assurances  from the EU that its market would remain open to ASEAN  products,"" declared the ASEAN spokeswoman, Delia Albert. Things  may not prove as straightforward as ASEAN would like, as one of  the main obstacles to market access for ASEAN products is EU  quality requirements, according to the European Commission's  Director-General for North-South Relations, Juan Prat. The EU,  which is ASEAN's third largest trade partner after Japan and the  United States (bilateral trade amounted to 54 billion dollars in  1993), nonetheless remains committed to supporting the 15-year  free trade programme just launched by the six members of the  Association (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Singapore and Thailand).

And the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader and spiritual guide,  will continue to press for the imposition of his religious views on the Muslim  world at a high-level Islamic meeting in Saudi Arabia this week, according to  specialists here.    In Tehran, the hard-line newspaper Kayhan International said Saturday that the  nation's move toward reconciliation with the West after last August's  cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq War was ""a very hasty and ill-planned strategy.""    The newspaper, which currently reflects the tough Khomeini views, declared that  rapprochement between Iran and the West was ""a doomed effort.""    Western government support for the free-speech rights of Rushdie, whose book  offended most followers of Islam and infuriated Muslim fundamentalists, showed  that the attempt to better relations with West has been a failure, Kayhan said.    ""Iran is painting itself into a difficult diplomatic corner,"" observed one  Middle Eastern specialist here. ""This anti-Western behavior may delay  indefinitely the country's economic recovery from the effects of the (Persian)  Gulf War.""      45-Nation Conference    Kayhan's negative view of Iranian ties with the West came on the eve of a  four-day, 45-nation meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in  Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian capital, which formally begins Monday.    Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati is expected to seek the meeting's  condemnation of the West for publishing the book as well as its support for  Khomeini's call that Rushdie be killed for having written it.    But the ayatollah's extremist views -- and his yearning to become the leader of  all Islam -- are expected to be resisted by Sunni Muslim leaders of nations  rejecting Iran's brand of ultraconservative Islam.    While other Islamic countries have condemned ""The Satanic Verses"" -- which  pokes fun at the Prophet Mohammed, his wives and the writing of the Koran, the  Muslim holy book -- they have not endorsed Khomeini's call for Rushdie's death.    Further, many Muslim countries believe that it would be nonsense to cut off  ties with major Western economic powers merely because of a privately written  book, no matter how offensive.    Iran broke diplomatic ties with Britain on March 7 because of London's refusal  to ban the novel by Rushdie, a British citizen who was born a Muslim in Bombay,  India.    Iran is also threatening to sever relations with West Germany, which is  Tehran's largest non-oil trading partner.    West German politicians have called for economic sanctions against Iran unless  Khomeini rescinds his clerics' offer of a $5.2-million ""bounty"" for anyone who  kills Rushdie.    Bonn has stopped talks on a $1.7-billion-$2.7-billion loan to Iran because of  Iran's actions over ""The Satanic Verses.""    ""It is absolutely stupid for Iran to impair relations with West Germany, with  which it had good relations,"" one analyst here said.    ""They are shooting themselves in the foot if they go through with this threat.  It is all simply to bolster the old ayatollah's dreams of Islamic glory and  leadership.""    Iran has threatened to break ties with the rest of the European Community, as  well as with Canada, Sweden and Norway, all of which withdrew their ambassadors  to Tehran after Khomeini's threat against Rushdie.    The Kayhan daily, Iran's largest newspaper, admitted Saturday that the  breakdown of relations with European countries will harm Iran. But it argued  that a rupture ""will also give our policy-makers a new opportunity to  re-evaluate and weigh their practical actions.""    ""Iran is determined to safeguard its Islamic values even if it means a new  round of political confrontation with anti-Islamic forces,"" the paper said.    ""With all these realities and the West's unlimited support for the Iraqi regime  in the (Iran-Iraq) war, the Islamic Republic is not in a position to afford the  luxury of friendly relations with the West.""    However, Middle East experts declared that the contrary is true: After its  defeat in the Persian Gulf War, Iran is in no position to scorn the benefits of  good ties with the West.    But Khomeini is determined not only to shore up his position inside Iran,  diplomatic analysts say, but to become the recognized leader of the entire  Islamic world -- and he sees the Rushdie affair as the opportunity to project  himself as such.    However, the Shiite branch of Islam, of which Khomeini is leader, makes up only  10% of the estimated 1 billion Muslims who are concentrated in a wide swath of  nations stretching from Morocco to Indonesia.    And many Muslim nations -- Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Turkey and Malaysia, among  others -- are far more secular in political outlook than the conservative  Persian Gulf nations, with their fundamentalist Sunni and Shiite populations.    So these countries are expected to resist Iran's demands at the Riyadh  conference to further politicize the Rushdie issue.    These leaders, diplomats say, believe that Khomeini wants to advance himself as  the leader of the Islamic world as a way of strengthening his position in Iran.    As Ahmed Abdel Ghani, managing editor of Bahrain's Akbar al Khaleej newspaper,  put it: ""Rushdie's book is rubbish. As such, the book does not justify the  cantankerous uproar in Tehran.    ""But the Iranians obviously are out for political auctioneering and  brinkmanship. The Iranians hope to become leaders of the world's Muslims and  force the West to back down on the Rushdie issue.""    In Iran on Saturday, another newspaper, the Tehran Times, urged the West to  consider a compromise proposal made Friday by Parliament Speaker Hashemi  Rafsanjani that the Rushdie crisis could ""be solved if Western nations burned  all copies of 'The Satanic Verses.'    ""The West and supporters of the book should consider Mr. Rafsanjani's words  carefully, coolly and objectively,"" said the paper.

Lippold: ""Taiwan Hoping for German  Activity""]    [Text] Berlin/Taipei -- In view of Germany's restrictive  arms export law, Taiwan has given up hope of a business deal in  the field of maritime arms technology that would be lucrative  for both sides. Taiwan will now build the needed warships  itself. On Monday [28 March], the second of eight frigates  carrying missiles of the Hsiung Geng-II type was put into  service.    Nevertheless, Taiwan wants to improve bilateral relations,  especially trade relations -- in spite of the Federal  Government's pro-Beijing policy. They feel encouraged in this  view by the fact that with the current German ambassador to Sri  Lanka and Bangladesh, Claus Franke, a diplomat will become the  new head of the German trade mission in Taipei. Posting the  62-year-old does not, however, mean that -- as has been reported  in Taiwan -- this office ""has for the first time been given to  an official representative of the Foreign Ministry."" NEUE ZEIT  has been told by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn that Franke will  be given leave to take on his future work for the Federation of  German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], which runs the  Taipei office.    But even without upgrading the German representation, April  might take a special place in the history of German-Taiwanese  relations. First, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt wants to  visit the republic before going to mainland China, and second, a  partnership agreement is to be signed by the districts of  Greifswald (Mecklenburg) and Nantou (Central Taiwan) in the  second week of April.    Closer Cooperation Between Local Authorities    The agreement, which is to be signed by Councillors Herbert  Kautz and Yuang-Lang Lin, is the second such agreement between  districts in the Republic of China and the new laender. In the  summer of 1993, Annaberg (Saxony) and Kaohsiung agreed on  cooperation. The visit to Halle in mid-April of Po-Rung Lin,  the mayor of Taichung, might bring about another agreement.  Several important representatives of industry are expected to  accompany the head of the third largest community in Taiwan.     "

When General Haegglund succeeds Admiral Klenberg as  commander  in chief of the Armed Forces this fall, he will be doing so in a  highly unusual phase of transition. Just as the exchange rate  floats among other European currencies, so the security policy  is bobbing up and down among the various overlapping and  concurrent European security policy elements.    No one knows how it will end.    Much depends on whether the EU's [European Union] Common  Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the Western European Union  (WEU), NATO, NATO's North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC)  with the former Warsaw Pact states, NATO's new Partnership for  Peace (PFP) network, and the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) can continue to seek their  respective main emphases and roles in the new arrangement under  peaceful conditions or whether, on the other hand, a new and  primarily political state of conflict will emerge in Europe.    But at least on the domestic level, Haegglund knows the  stand  Finland has taken on the EU. Even if Finland says no in a  referendum, we will not be back where we started before our  membership application in March 1992.    Not only have we expressed our readiness to determine  whether  we can join in the CFSP, but we have done so through a  negotiating process. Our foreign policy leadership has confirmed  this.    Unlike Denmark, we have pledged to remain loyal to a  possible  expansion of the EU's defense dimension beginning with the  government conference in 1996. Denmark's exemption means that  the Danes will not participate in making the decision. What have  we ourselves actually promised concerning 1996 on the basis of  our statements?    ""Free of alliances and with an independent defense"" is the  formula of the day in both Sweden and Finland. In Sweden there  is one report after another saying that Sweden was not neutral,  but the self-perception among large segments of the Swedish  electorate has nonetheless come to be one of neutrality. Among  the same groups that are most critical of the EU.    In Finland, the break with the old pattern set by the Treaty  of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance was so abrupt  that a large segment of the public is still disconcerted, while  leading politicians have been unwilling, and not without reason,  to speculate too much about future security policy models.    We do not know how Finland will fit into a West European  model of some kind or how that in turn may be integrated into an  all-European security arrangement.    The report on the effect that the EU will have on our  foreign  policy was leaked to SUOMEN KUVALEHTI. It talks about a new  intermediate step between ""alliance free"" and ""allied."" The  negotiations with the EU have already put us in the position of  being politically allied with a strong actor in the  international arena.    The same will apply if (as Haegglund outlined in his lecture  at Helsinki University) we become observers in but not members  of the WEU.    If the people say yes to the EU, we presumably ought to  become at least observers in the WEU. The WEU has become  increasingly linked to both the EU and NATO. It could not be  otherwise, since the central countries are the same in all three  cases, and all three organizations have a very strong political  dimension.    The WEU has been called a paper tiger, and people have joked  about the fact that it has only a little over 100 employees, but  a division of labor is currently taking shape in such a way that  NATO will be the defense alliance in case of a major military  conflict, while the WEU will take charge of more limited crises  and conflicts with the help of various European and NATO forces.    The ultimate consequence of this is that if we became  members, the WEU's full defense guarantee would have to be  fulfilled by NATO -- even though we would be members not of NATO  but of the CFSP, which would handle conflicts on behalf of the  EU in international top-level politics. How does one solve that  equation?    At the same time, we would have to be prepared to make  (volunteer) troops available for WEU operations. All too many of  us Finns believe that we would only be on the receiving end or  that we could join the PFP, the WEU, and even NATO with no  increase in our current defense spending. Actually, the result  would probably be a tripling of that spending.    That also says something about the concept of independent  defense in the prevailing doctrine.    An interesting link in the EU-WEU-NATO triangle is that the  WEU has a cooperation forum with the Baltic states, Poland, the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria for the  purpose of giving them ""a special relationship with the European  defense dimension.""    Considering the gap between the WEU's cooperation forum and  the PFP, in which Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine are to  participate, there is reason to wonder whether the sides of the  new European security triangle may develop so far out of step  with each other that the whole will be affected if and when the  WEU's role is in fact strengthened.    In Finland, a parliamentary commission is to ""revise"" our  foreign policy doctrine perhaps before the March elections. If  such central elements as the EU agreement are settled by then,  such a timetable may be more justified than if too many elements  remain unresolved.    The new commander in chief, if anyone, is going to have  experience with parliamentary defense commissions. In other  respects as well, Haegglund's background is unusually well  suited to the demands of the moment. That is what is needed,  since there are probably not many who have had so many open  European cards to play security policy solitaire with.     "

[passage  omitted]    Musa told reporters before he left Amman that he conveyed to  his majesty a message from President Husni Mubarak, and that he  had a long discussion with his majesty on the past, present, and  future of the peace process, in addition to bilateral ties.    He said he agreed with Jordanian officials to convene a  meeting of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Cooperation Committee.    Musa voiced hope that Arab relations could be reconciled,  and  called for speedy efforts to heal rifts among Arab states. Musa  said his country's mediation had not yet succeeded in breaking  the deadlock between Israel and the PLO over the implementation  of the Palestinian autonomy document.    He said he expected further delay before PLO and Israeli  negotiations could resume on ways to implement the self-rule  deal. He said the Taba talks will resume very soon despite the  stalemate which he described as not very serious.    He added that Egypt would not exercise any pressure on the  PLO.    [Begin recording] [Musa] There is no pressure on the PLO by  us. We listen to what the PLO leaders have to say. We try to  help when our help is needed, and when we are called upon to  help, but there is nothing at all that would pertain to, or be  construed as pressure on the PLO.    [Reporter] Isn't it true that in fact agreement was reached  in the last Cairo talks? What's your position on that?    [Musa] I believe there will be a meeting of the Gaza-Jericho  committee, the liaison committee in Taba soon I hope, and  therefore, it is not a question of what happened or what took  place. The important thing is what should take place from now  on. [end recording]    Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan also  told reporters that Jordan and Egypt agreed to move ahead with  strengthening bilateral cooperation.     "

The main items on this year's agenda include ways to improve  the economy and measures to increase employment within the  group, as well as strengthening multilateral trade systems.    With the total number of unemployed within the group topping  35 million, discussions will focus on promoting structural  changes in industries and creating new business opportunities to  increase new jobs, according to meeting sources.    Jean-Claude Paye, secretary general of the organization, is  expected to issue a special statement after the meeting to urge  members to job-creation programs within two years, the sources  said.    On trade matters, the OECD will call for early ratification  of the Uruguay Round trade accord which was completed last  December after seven years of negotiations under the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The participants will then discuss trade issues outstanding  after the Uruguay Round, the sources said. The issues concern  relationships between trade and five other areas -- the  environment, competition, labor standards, investment and  regionalism.    With Mexico participating as the OECD's newest member, the  Paris-based group now gathers ministers and representatives from  25 nations in the world.    On the second day of the meeting, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev will be invited to sign the first agreement on  economic assistance, the sources said.    Japan has sent Nobuo Matsunaga, the government's  representative for external affairs, to the meeting. Schedules  of the Diet sessions prevented a minister from being sent. It  is the first time in 27 years that Japan has not sent a minister  to an OECD meeting.    According to Japanese trade sources, Matsunaga is expected  to  meet with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who is also  attending the OECD meeting, to discuss schedules for the ongoing  Japan-U.S. trade framework talks.    A meeting set initially between Matsunaga and U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher has been canceled, they said.     "

The day before, Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin urged his U.S. partners ""not to be  afraid but to approach the Russian market more boldly."" Has  there been a real response to these appeals or has nothing been  done about them? The three days that the U.S. business  delegation headed by Brown spent in Moscow do not seem to have  completely clarified this question.    On the one hand, four intergovernmental agreements were  signed between the two countries Wednesday, including statutes  on the Committee for the Development of Business Cooperation  between Russia and America and on the creation of U.S. business  centers in Russia. The joint statement adopted by Russia and  the United States made special mention of the question of access  to the U.S. market for Russian goods and to the Russian market  for U.S. goods. Summing up the results of the U.S. delegation's  three-day visit to Moscow at the end of the day on Wednesday,  Brown made a special note of the successes of the delegation's  representatives from the U.S. private sector and in particular  the agreements signed with Russian partners by such U.S.  corporations as McDermott International Inc., (shipbuilding),  the Halliburton Company of Texas (gas and oil industry), Allen  and Associates (the pharmaceutical industry), the Westinghouse  Electric Corporation (modernization and construction of nuclear  power power stations), and others.    At the same time, as the secretary himself acknowledged,  U.S.  private capital investments in Russia, which have almost doubled  in the past year, are still only $1 billion, which is a paltry  sum by U.S. standards (by comparison, U.S. companies have  invested $239 billion in West Europe). During the visit Brown  predicted that U.S. investments in Russia could easily rise to  $45-$50 billion if the right conditions are created. He cited  the lowering of Russia's customs tariffs and the easing of tax  legislation among those conditions.     "

The men, mostly former  soldiers of the South African Defense Force or former members of  Koevoet [Crowbar; Namibia police counterinsurgency unit],  returned to South Africa at the beginning of this year when they  found they were not only supposed to train Angolan soldiers, but  also fight against UNITA. The operation in Angola is believed to  be under the command of former members of the Civil Cooperation  Bureau [CCB].    Executive Outcomes is alleged to be hiring former South  African soldiers under the pretext of training soldiers in  Angola and guarding the oil refineries. They receive salaries  of between 7,300 and 14,000 rands, paid in U.S. dollars.    Eben Barlow, Nico Palm, and Lafras Luitingh are among the  people running Executive Outcomes. Mr. Barlow is the director,  and Mr. Palm is the financial manager. Mr. Luitingh, former CCB  member, was the ""handler"" of Mr. Ferdi Barnard, a former CCB  member accused of having killed human rights activist, David  Webster.    Reliable sources have disclosed to BEELD that the men  employed by Executive Outcomes heard at the beginning of January  that they had to fight against UNITA as well. A group of about  20 refused to carry out the instruction and were sent back to  South Africa. Another group was also sent back about three weeks  later because they had also refused.    It is also alleged they were told that they would be  ""eliminated in a natural manner"" should they talk about what is  going on in Angola.    A Namibian newspaper reports that UNITA itself had said that  it had shot dead 12 South African mercenaries. One of them was  Lieutenant Steyn Marais, who had grown up in Namibia and served  five years in the South African Defense Force's reconnaissance  commando.     "

The flamboyant Van Kloberg was  not so jocular Wednesday, saying: ""Our arrangement terminated in July.""    Take Richard M. Fairbanks III, the former assistant secretary of state who was  one of President Bush's chief foreign policy advisers during the 1988 campaign.  Also listed on the most recent roster of Iraq's lobbyists, Fairbanks said that  his relationship with Baghdad was limited to legal work and that he resigned in  March. Attorney-client privilege prevents him from revealing his reasons,  Fairbanks added, but ""obviously if we had felt comfortable with the  arrangement, we would have continued it.""    There's also Mary E. King, the well-connected former Jimmy Carter  Administration official known in days gone by as a stalwart of the U.S. civil  rights movement. As executive director of the U.S.-Iraq Business Forum, King  squired Iraqi officials around, making sure that they were introduced in the  right social and political circles.    ""I don't make speeches and I don't give interviews and I'm very busy,"" King  said in response to a request for comment.    It was not so long ago that Iraq had plenty of friends in Washington.  Particularly during its eight-year war with Iran, when the United States took a  decidedly pro-Iraqi tilt, many people were willing to knock on the doors of the  powerful on Iraq's behalf, acting either as representatives of the government  itself or those who wanted to do business with it.    Since last week, it has been U.S. policy to strangle the Iraqi economy with an  international embargo. But things looked pretty cozy as recently as January,  when the Commerce Department, under pressure from business, was planning an  aerospace trade mission that would include a stop in Iraq aimed at making sure  U.S. companies got in on the action there.    In the Commerce Department's news release announcing the trade mission, the  department noted that Iraq is among the countries that will ""offer numerous  consulting opportunities in aviation service, maintenance and the avionics  equipment market. . . . Iraq has ambitious plans for upgrading its civil  aviation system, including new airports, air traffic control and related  equipment.""    Weeks before the trade mission was supposed to take place, six Iraqi agents  were caught in London engaging in another type of commerce -- trying to smuggle  40 American-made nuclear bomb triggers into Iraq.    John L. Wolf, the trade mission coordinator, insists that the idea for  including Baghdad in the trip never got past the planning stages. The proposed  stop in Iraq was canceled because ""we didn't like some of the things (the  Iraqis) said,"" Wolf explained. ""We were very prophetic and proper about it but  we never get credit for it, do we?""    There are still some who -- while not quite defending Hussein -- contend that  he is not a total villain.    ""We've focused a little too much on his brutal side,"" said Marshall W. Wiley,  the former ambassador to Oman who founded and heads the U.S.-Iraq Business  Forum. ""In a personal meeting with him, he can be charming.""    The forum is an organization composed of about 70 companies that were doing  business in Iraq, or wanted to. Wiley said that it was funded solely by its  members' dues and does not lobby Congress. Still, it regularly and publicly  argued the other side against critics of Iraq.    Although Hussein wiped out thousands of his own people with chemical weapons,  Wiley has often noted that he also fostered literacy and economic development.  Wiley warns even now that the United States ""has got to come to grips with the  fact that Iraq is an emerging power"" and should not back an unpopular and  undemocratic monarchy in Kuwait, which was invaded Aug. 2 and annexed by Iraq.    Iraq's social heyday in Washington was surely the mid-1980s, when Ambassador  Nizar Hamdoon ran what the New York Times described as ""one of the liveliest  dinner tables in Washington."" Hamdoon drew notables, including American Jewish  leaders -- which seems particularly ironic in light of Hussein's subsequent  threat to wipe out half the population of Israel with poison gas.    Fairbanks insists that the U.S. position in the Iran-Iraq War was a sensible  one, ""based on U.S. national interests"" of preventing a clear winner from  emerging from the conflict.    But California Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), one of Iraq's most  dogged foes on Capitol Hill, says that the attitude persisted well past the  war's end in August, 1988.    ""That continued until the day before the invasion,"" he said. ""They all thought  that Hussein could be a force for moderation.""    He noted that the Administration and many in Congress opposed his bill banning  arms and high-tech exports to Iraq, a bill that cleared the House Foreign  Affairs Committee the day before the invasion. It quickly passed the House as  Iraqi troops rolled into Kuwait.    Over the years, Iraq has mounted what Berman described as a sophisticated  lobbying effort on Capitol Hill, involving State Department officials, defense  contractors, agricultural interests and Iraqi-Americans.    Berman said that he was even telephoned on Iraq's behalf by William P. Clark,  after Clark retired in 1985 as President Reagan's national security adviser and  began working as a Washington attorney. Clark's office said that he has never  been engaged as a lobbyist by the government of Iraq. He is out of the country  and unavailable for comment.

The press  conference was attended by foreign diplomats along with  representatives of the United Nations and nongovernmental  organizations to the LPDR. Director generals of various  departments under the Foreign Affairs Ministry were also present.    On this occasion, Souban Salitthilat explained the line and  policy of the party and state on the settlement of the narcotics  problem in the LPDR for the period from now to 2000. He also  reported the achievements in investigating narcotics problems  throughout the country, especially in northern provinces, where  there are some 19,000 hectares of land for poppy plantation. He  noted that in the northern provinces in 1992-1993, a total of  some 125 to 150 metric tons of opium were produced and some  42,000 people became addicted to the drug.    In view of the aforementioned problem, the chairman of the  Lao National Committee for Narcotics Control proposed as many as  16 infrastructural projects requiring as much as $35 million.  He said: In implementing the various projects, an emphasis will  be put on restricting and reducing drug production. Regarding  this, more rural development projects will be set up in Phong  Saly and Oudomsai provinces and in Saisomboun District,  Vientiane Province. Existing projects now being implemented  include the rural development projects in Xieng Khouang  Province, the Lao-American Cooperation Project for Integrated  Rural Development in Houa Phan Province, and the drug reduction  projects in Bokeo and Luang Namtha provinces.    In the recent past, the Lao National Committee for  Narcotics Control has received technical and financial support  in the form of loans and gratis aid from many organizations,  such as the (?Christian) Organization of Norway, the United  Nations Drug Control Program, the International Fund for  Agricultural Development, and the Lao-American project in Houa  Phan Province.

Mr Uthai earlier met Malaysia's International Trade and  Industry Minister, Dato' Seri Rafidah Aziz.    He said Dato' Rafidah wanted him to make clear the Thai  Government's view on the EAEC. He told her he supported the  move because it was a good concept. However, it was merely an  initiative with no action taken yet.    At the weekend, officials who asked not to be identified  said  that Thailand was still not enthusiastic about the EAEC.    Mr Uthai said he stressed with Dato' Rafidah that the most  important aspect was to strengthen the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN) to increase the group's bargaining power  in international forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) group.    Under current understandings, the EAEC would comprise East  Asian members of APEC and not the United States, Canada, Mexico  or Chile. In November, senior ASEAN secretariat officials said  their initial exploratory talks with potential members received  a warm response.    Mr Uthai said Dato' Rafidah asked him whether Thailand would  participate in the first meeting of APEC in Hawaii on March 18  and 19 because she believed the United States would force  smaller countries to open up their financial markets further.    Mr Uthai said he told Dato' Rafidah that he could not speak  on behalf of the Thai finance minister but he thought that  Thailand would have a clearer position after Tharin Nimmanhemin  met the US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.    Dato' Rafidah said the ASEAN secretary-general had visited  countries which would be founders of the EAEC, such as Japan,  South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Results would soon be  reported to ASEAN economic ministers.    She said the private sector would benefit from the loose  consultative forum.    The arrangement would benefit the private sector in finance,  industry and even by linking the stock markets.    Dato' Rafidah said the private sector should realise the  marketing possibilities as the EAEC would include Japan, South  Korea, Taiwan, China, Indochina and all of ASEAN.     "

Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation  Wu  Yi and Indian Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee put their  signatures on the two documents on behalf of their respective  governments.    Both sides agreed to further develop and diversify bilateral  trade between China and India on the basis of equality and  mutual benefit, according to the protocol which is valid for one  year from today.    The two countries also agreed that they will encourage  direct  trade and promote the exchange of delegations in specific areas  and encourage their respective trade organizations and traders  to explore the possibilities of promoting bilateral trade  through various forms of trade and cooperation.    According to the protocol, China expects to import India's  mineral ores, iron and steel, agricultural products, chemicals,  engineering products and jewels and processed diamonds while  India would import from China silk yarn, agricultural and native  products, light industrial products, metals and minerals,  chemicals and petroleum products, pearls, engineering products,  pharmaceuticals and newsprint.    At the meeting, both sides reviewed the developments in the  fields of economic relations and trade, scientific and  technological cooperation in 1993 and noted that there existed  great potential for mutual cooperation in these fields.    India and China agreed to provide necessary facilities  including expeditious grant of entry visa to businessmen of the  two countries.    It was also agreed that problems arising from bilateral  trade  and economic cooperation should be settled through friendly  consultation.    The two countries agreed in principle to the extension of  the  trade to the other points on the China-India border apart from  Lipulekh and Shipki.    The minutes said that both sides agreed to explore the  possibilities of expanding technology transfer, setting up joint  ventures in various areas and trading in complete plant and  production lines.

The country spent 2.700 billion pesos, equal to the dollar,  to subsidize this field in the sugar cane and non-sugar cane  sectors that underwent transformations at the end of 1993, when  state farms where converted to cooperatives.    During a news conference, the secretary general of the Cuban  Workers Federation maintained that in the past quarter the  tobacco sector surpassed its production goal in the manufacture  of tobacco for export by 125 percent. Meanwhile, tourism grew  by 30 percent.    Regarding the parliamentary debate on the reorganization of  internal finances announced for 1 May, he indicated that the  measures to be taken will be political and not technocratic.    Ross said that these decisions cannot be made behind the  workers' backs given their affect on millions of people and the  benefits and sacrifices that almost the entire nation will have  to make.    He indicated that a great deal of suggestions were made  during the more than 80,000 meetings recently held throughout  the nation and in which more than 3 million workers participated.    Ross admitted there were different points of view and  different criteria for some issues, but everything was taken  into consideration during the labor union debates, called  parliaments in the workplace.    The workers' meetings began to show results, according to  Ross, when decisions were applied on efficient productivity and  savings that have immediate effects on the economy.    For Ross, this is part of a group of measures implemented in  the past months, such as the turnover of thousands of hectares  of state-owned lands to workers for the organization of Basic  Productive Cooperation Units.    The creation of such units was of the greatest political and  social scope as it changes production and distribution  relationships established since the triumph of the Revolution in  1959 and which have benefited more than 1.1 million workers, he  added.

Addressing the China petroleum investment conference which  opened here today, he said China ""offers much scope for oil  exploration and development"" and has ""bright prospects for  economic growth and the growth of the oil sector.""    Therefore, he said, China ""has a strong interest in helping  to maintain a reasonable level of oil prices, which will  encourage further investment.""    The China petroleum investment conference, attended by a  total of 329 delegates from 183 well-known multinational oil  companies, banks and financial organizations and China's oil  industry, is the highest-ranking international oil forum ever  held in the country.    The delegates were expected to discuss issues concerning  joint and cooperative exploration and development of China's oil  and natural gas resources during the two-day conference.    Addressing the opening, Wang Tao, president of the China  National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), spelt out China's  strategy to develop its oil industry.    He said China has opened its petroleum industry to the  outside world and thus provided more opportunities to foreign  investors.    He added that China welcomes world investors to cooperate in  China's petroleum industry.    Sheng Huaren, president of the China Petrochemical  Corporation (Sinopec), Wang Yan, president of the China National  Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and Zheng Dunxun, president of  the China Chemical Import and Export Corporation (Sinochem),  spoke on the development trends in China's oil and petrochemical  industries.    Also present at the meeting were Omani Deputy Minister of  Petroleum and Minerals Salem Shaban.    The conference, sponsored by the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, CNPC,  Sinopec, CNOOC and Sinochem, is designed to provide a forum for  oil companies and financial institutions both in and outside  China to increase understanding and exchange information.    Foreign delegates and speakers come from oil companies and  financial institutions including Esso, Chevron, Shell, Amoco,  Arco, BP, Texaco, ELF, the Japan National Oil Corp., Mitsubishi,  the Japan Import  Export Bank, the Bank of America, and the  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

IT IS A  MODEL OF PARTNERSHIP AND A VISION OF A EUROPE OF PEACE IN FREEDOM.      By MANFRED WOERNER, Manfred Woerner is secretary general of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization.      The prospect of war in Europe is at its lowest ebb in nearly 50 years. Risks  remain, but the situation in Europe has evolved to the point where NATO's  concept of political security is coming into its own. We have an opportunity to  develop a new European architecture of peaceful cooperation that can deal with  potential conflict as well.    What remains important about the alliance?    First and foremost, it has oriented the United States toward a lasting  commitment to uphold peace and stability in Europe. The United States will  maintain this commitment as long as the allies wish.    Since its inception, NATO has become a model of how free nations broadly define  and collectively manage their security. Within the alliance, former enemies  have reconciled. All members enjoy equal security.    The alliance's stabilizing framework extends to the neutral states of Europe.  The emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe also recognize that  without NATO they would not have recovered their independence. Only the  alliance's collective security system can offset the preponderance of Soviet  power in Europe and ensure that the relatively weaker feel confident vis-a-vis  the relatively stronger. Without it, Europe would return to the shifting  alliances and power politics of the past.""    One of the alliance's historic achievements has been to convert nuclear weapons  into the ultimate instrument of peace-keeping. Since arms control can reduce  but never disinvent nuclear weapons, Europeans would be well advised to retain  the controlling structure that the alliance represents.    NATO is not, of course, alone in striving to put in place the architecture of a  future European order. But talking about one or another institution as the  basis for the future misses the essential point: We must build on existing  institutions and successes. The European community, for instance, is playing an  important political role, not least in the economic reconstruction of Central  and Eastern Europe. It is obviously the most attractive and dynamic European  political organization. Yet despite its emerging political identity, it has no  security dimension, nor will it acquire one for the foreseeable future.    The cohesion and stability at the heart of Western success are the result of  NATO and the Economic Community. Building on this, the Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe has a promising future in the new European order. Yet  it lacks the legal authority of binding obligations, permanent institutional  status and the machinery to resolve conflict. Given the differing values,  interests and views of its 35 members, each with a veto right, it alone cannot  guarantee security.    The Atlantic Alliance thus remains an essential pillar of any future European  security structure. Only it can keep the United States and Canada tied to  Europe; ensure stability so that change can unfold without fear of reversals;  coordinate overall Western strategy for the reconstruction of Central and  Eastern Europe, and make sure that a united Germany remains firmly anchored to  the West.    The alliance, in meeting its challenge of extending security without  diminishing it, will face three tasks in the 1990s:     -- Building a new European order that is not only more just but also more  durable than that created by the Cold War. The demise of the Warsaw Pact and  its military threat and the imminent prospect of German unity have  fundamentally changed the terrain. We are already adjusting, militarily and  politically, to this new environment.    By supporting Mikhail S. Gorbachev so long as he moves the Soviet Union toward  democracy and reform, the allies are proving that they do not intend to exploit  Soviet weakness. The allies will respect the legitimate security interests of  the Soviet Union in Europe so that it can confidently embrace reform. NATO is  also offering a united Germany membership in the alliance, making the Germans'  inherent right of self-determination compatible with stability in Europe. It is  in the Soviet interest as much as that of Germany's neighbors and partners.    At the same time, the alliance will spur the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe, speed up the establishment of democratic institutions  and promote respect for human and minority rights and the rule of law.  Additionally, it will use the conference as a means to tear down barriers to  human, cultural and economic exchanges across Europe's vanishing line of  division and to promote economic progress in the East.    The alliance is stimulating arms-control negotiations to make the ebbing of  East-West confrontation an irreversible process. If we can bring the states of  Europe to cooperate on their vital security interests, the Europeans will find  it much easier to cooperate on everything else. An agreement on reducing  conventional forces, which we hope to secure this year, is the indispensable  foundation of a new European architecture.     -- Maintain a secure peace. Our defense structure will continue to be the main  guarantee of peace as well as the vehicle for crisis management. War at the  close of the 20th Century is so potentially catastrophic that we cannot take  its prevention less seriously merely because it is now less probable.    But conflict cannot be prevented by arms control or diplomacy alone.  Developments in the Soviet Union are unpredictable. Conventional disarmament  must not obscure the fact that the Soviet Union is still a nuclear superpower.  Although the Soviets are following through on their promised unilateral  reductions in troops and armor, they have restructured their remaining forces.  We must also remember that the collapse of the Soviet imperium has stirred both  regional tensions and nationalism throughout much of the Soviet Union and  Central and Eastern Europe.     -- NATO must ensure the partnership between North America and an increasingly  self-aware and politically unified Europe, while managing all the complexities  of their relationship. Erosion of the transatlantic linkage will leave all of  us worse off, including our partners to the East.    NATO is not simply an alliance against threat or intimidation. It is a model of  partnership, success and a vision of a Europe of peace in freedom.

In Bratislava, Nekvasil met with Slovak Defence Ministry  State Secretary Andrej Sobol and Slovak Army Commander  Lieutenant General Julius Humaj.    Generals Nekvasil and Humaj confirmed after the talks that  four protocols to an agreement on cooperation between the two  countries' armies were agreed upon so that the Czech and Slovak  Defence Ministers, Antonin Baudys and Pavol Kanis, would be able  to sign the agreement on May 2 in Bratislava.    ""There are no obstacles on the way of cooperation,"" Humaj  said.    The cooperation would primarily concern an exchange of  experience in solving specific problems, for example the army's  logistic support according to the Western model, Nekvasil said.  He mentioned the possibility of joint exercises and joint  armament projects but declined to give details. He admitted,  however, that he liked the new Slovak howitzer Susana.    The Czech and Slovak Armies are predetermined to cooperate  in  building their national defence by similar conditions, identical  problems and tasks and the situation in the region, Humaj said.    ""Although we are aiming at integration into European  structures and have adopted the Partnership for Peace programme,  neither the Czech Republic nor Slovakia had their security  guaranteed by any treaty. We therefore rely on our own forces  and ought to build our national defence. In this we are finding  a common tongue and will to cooperate,"" Humaj said.    He said that the second major task which is awaiting both  armies -- transformation in order to be able to integrate into  NATO -- also requires cooperation and an exchange of experience.    Humaj described as premature considerations about common  armament systems. Given the shortage of finances, the two  armies would concentrate on modernising the current combat  equipment in the near future and only after this would they be  able to develop new systems, he said. He added, however, that  talks on this topic conducted so far were purely informative.     "

Temchin, under the rubric ""Investments"":  ""Where to Put Capital: In Snickers or Lathes?: Commercial  Structures Offer Their Assistance to State Enterprises""]    [Text] Something seems to be starting to change in our sick  economy: for the first time a group of major businessmen, at  their own initiative, have approached Anatoliy Ogurtsov,  chairman of Roskommash [RF Committee on Machinebuilding], with  an offer to collaborate. It used to be just the opposite:  Roskommash sought out partners among commercial structures. But  didn't find any. It is more profitable to invest capital in  Snickers than in lathes or turbines. There is practically no  risk involved, and a speedy accumulation of capital is ensured.  Machinebuilding is a long and risky affair.    Russia's machinebuilding complex finds itself in a very  difficult position--mutual nonpayments, a lack of working  capital, difficulties with the market and output, and so on.  Last year mutual nonpayments and creditor indebtedness reached  nearly 6 trillion rubles [R]. In January another more than R1  trillion was racked up. Tractor and combine plants are standing  idle; the collectives of our glorious auto giants have been put  on forced leave; and our lathe builders and instrument makers  are just barely working.    One of the instigators of the meeting with the  industrialists, Aleksandr Yefanov, chairman of the board of  directors of the Mikrodin AO (joint-stock company), stated that  commercial structures possess sufficient capital to support  financially several sites of the machinebuilding complex, but  doing this will require above all strictly selecting, with the  help of experts, pilot projects for potentially progressive  output that is certain to be competitive and that will enjoy  elevated demand on the domestic as well as the foreign market.  ""Mikrodin AO,"" he said, ""is a happy exception. We have no  problems with marketing our output or with nonpayments."" He  explained that it is just a matter of the system he put  together: NIOKR [scientific research and experimental design  work]--financial organization--marketing. These are the three  whales on which the Mikrodin association rests. First an  interesting and promising project, then a study of its marketing  possibilities, and, after that, its financing. The main  misfortune of many enterprises is that they do not use this kind  of system, or in any event they lack the two most important  links in the chain--marketing and financing. Abroad, banks work  with industry in the closest possible way. This has not been set  up here.    One person who spoke in the wake of the industrialists said  that work in this direction is our last hope. Someone else added  that this meeting between financiers and industrialists could  become a historic turning point in machinebuilding. In short,  fine words were spoken at this conference, hopeful words.    But I sat there and listened and thought that many fine and  hopeful words had been spoken in recent years, but the reality  is much worse. Tens of plants have come to a complete  standstill, hundreds are working three or four days a  week--there is no money even for salaries. The reasons for this  misfortune are well understood by everyone, and there are plenty  of plans for getting out of this labyrinth, but just which of  them will lead us out into the bright market future? We are  drowning in macroprograms, of which we are periodically  informed, but how do are they going to be carried out on the  microlevel? What specific plans are there on this score?    Anatoliy Ogurtsov, Roskommash's chairman, told me that a few  days ago the leaders of the industrial committees, famous  academicians, and representatives of bankings structures had  gathered and discussed how to get out of the present impasse,  and they never did come to a unanimous opinion. Each group has  its own macroprogram, each of which contains good ideas, but  they mesh badly. At Roskommash they made an attempt to  synthesize them. A working group of 11 highly experienced  financial analysts was created. They got hold of ""outsider""  programs (although this is not always easy; we have retained the  old habit of not showing ""outsiders"" our ""secrets""), subjected  these programs to painstaking analysis, selected the most  far-sighted elements, and added their own.    At the meeting between the machinebuilders and the ""sharks""  of capital, several contradictions were noted in the goals of  industrialists and financiers. Most important to the former, in  order for such giants as ChTZ [Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant],  Rostselmash, and others like them to take up work again, was  that their investment return workers and engineers from their  forced leave. The other side was interested in something else.  The president of the inter-branch commercial Resurs Bank, Semen  Epshteyn, said sternly that bankers were acting in this instance  not as altruists or as patrons, but were guided above all by the  desire to defend our market against foreign intervention. And  there is only one way to do that: by investing in pilot  projects. But these have to be selected very carefully, not only  for their technical characteristics but also for their marketing  possibilities as well. Banks are not going to invest capital in  something that the market doesn't demand and that will not yield  a definite profit.    In his opinion, it makes no sense to invest capital now in a  tractor or combine giant, because their current mass output is  not in demand in the market. All you can do here is get bogged  down and go bankrupt. It would be another matter if there were  new developments that were promising from a marketing aspect. In  that case there would be food for thought.    After the second meeting, Roskommash created in quick order  its own expert commissions, which must choose what they think  are the most promising projects.    These will be subjected to expert banking analysis, and then  they will see.    The fact itself is important. For the first time in the  years  of economic reforms, commercial structures have turned away from  Snickers and toward machinebuilding, which never yields quick or  large dividends anywhere in the world but does ensure the  prosperity of all other branches.    This meeting of young native capital and our old  machinebuilding may set off a saving spark. We will have to wait  a month. That was the deadline set.     "

For the most part, however, the leaders who began arriving in Casablanca on  Monday for the two-day conference will be preoccupied with old and by now  tiresomely familiar themes.    Indeed, what is likely to be the most significant event at this 16th Arab  League summit in 25 years has quietly taken place already.    At a preparatory foreign ministers' meeting on Sunday, Egypt, the most populous  country in the Arab world, resumed its seat in the league 10 years after it was  suspended for signing a separate peace treaty with Israel.    While Egypt's readmission underscores the extent to which political perceptions  have changed in the region over the past decade, the chief topics on the agenda  are anything but new: Palestine, the perennial centerpiece of Arab summitry;  Lebanon; lingering tensions in the Persian Gulf, the Iran-Iraq cease-fire  notwithstanding, and various inter-Arab conflicts such as those between Iraq  and Syria, Syria and the Palestinians and Yemen and South Yemen.    Lebanon, the most urgent and intractable of these conflicts, dominated the  preparatory discussions leading up to the summit and threatened to undermine  it.    A six-member committee chaired by Kuwait has been trying to devise a formula to  consolidate a cease-fire in Lebanon, but after two days of intensive and  often-acrimonious talks, it was not even able to decide who should represent  Lebanon at the summit.      Hassan Gets Hot Potato    In the end, it was decided to pass the issue along to Morocco's King Hassan II,  the conference host, with a recommendation that Lebanon's Christian army  commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, and Muslim Premier Salim Hoss be invited to  take separate seats at the meeting.    A similar question mark hung over Libyan participation, with Col. Moammar  Kadafi threatening a boycott because of Egypt's readmission to the league.    The presidents of Syria, Algeria and Tunisia flew to Libya over the weekend to  try to persuade Kadafi to come, but whether he does is not likely to have much  of an impact on the proceedings.    ""It would be nice, from the point of view of Arab unity, to have everyone  here,"" one Arab diplomat said, ""but Kadafi himself is irrelevant. If he comes,  he will be tolerated. If he boycotts, he will be ignored.""    The other main ""emergency"" the meeting was called to deal with is the  Palestinian question, in particular the intifada against Israeli rule in the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.    Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, is coming  with an agenda that seeks to win the political and financial support of his  fellow Arabs for the uprising and for recent PLO peace efforts, including its  recognition of Israel, renunciation of terrorism and the creation of an  independent Palestinian state in the occupied territories.    Specifically, the PLO will be pressing fellow Arabs to honor the commitments  they made at another so-called emergency meeting last year in Algiers to  finance the intifada with a one-time contribution of $128 million plus $43  million a month. Only Saudi Arabia and Libya have been paying their share. A  Palestinian source said the PLO has so far received only $40 million of the  lump-sum payment, along with $12 million a month from the Saudis and the  Libyans.    Summit sources said they expect the leaders to endorse the PLO's peace moves  but -- in deference to radicals such as Syria -- only in general, non-specific  terms.    The conference is expected to condemn the peace plan recently proposed by  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. It calls for elections in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip to choose non-PLO leaders who would then negotiate and  administer an interim plan for limited Palestinian autonomy.    Expressing the consensus that is considered certain to emerge at the summit,  Arab League Secretary General Chedli Klibi told the foreign ministers Sunday  that the transparent purpose of Shamir's plan is to counter ""the growing  sympathy the Palestinian cause is winning in Western countries . . . to get rid  of the intifada . . . and then to try to impose local leaders in an illusory  attempt by the Zionist leadership to wipe out the role of the PLO.""    While virtually everyone attending the conference agrees that the Shamir plan  is, in the words of a senior Egyptian diplomat, ""a complete non-starter,"" how  this sentiment is expressed in the final communique is likely to be the subject  of intense negotiations.      Morocco's Rehabilitation    Whatever shape the final resolutions take, the main point of this meeting has  already been made. It is the first Arab summit conference in Morocco since King  Hassan was forced to resign his chairmanship of the Arab League three years ago  for meeting publicly with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.    Thus, the meeting marks not only Egypt's formal rehabilitation in the Arab  world but Morocco's as well. In so doing, it affirms and furthers the sense of  unity and moderation that has been gaining ground in the Middle East in the  last few years.    This is due in part to Iraq's emergence relatively unscathed from its war with  Iran and its alliance with Egypt, Jordan and other regional moderates at a time  when Syria, the traditional spoiler of Middle East politics, is becoming more  bogged down in Lebanon.    The intifada and the pressure it has put on the PLO to come up with a realistic  peace plan to capitalize on the sympathy the Palestinians in the occupied  territories have earned over the past 18 months has been another major factor.    But as is so often the case in this part of the world, the main motivation is  fear -- in this instance fear that as the intifada turns more violent, a  historic opportunity for a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict will be  lost.

Al-Bid  asked the Gulf Cooperation Council countries to take a decisive  stand. He declared that the people in the south are expecting  their state to be recognized.    In an interview with AL-KHALIJ newspaper today in the city  of  al-Mukalla, where he is currently residing, he said: I was  expecting a decisive stand to be taken. The issue now is the  security of the Gulf region, the stability of the people, and  the interests of these two countries. Al-Bid affirmed that an  effective cease-fire must be the priority. He said that  continued fighting, which will go on for a long time, will not  stop when Yemen is split in two. He also confirmed that he is  ready to take up the issue of unity once again, build new  institutions, and take new action, with wisdom and sanity this  time round. Al-Bid said that unity is our right. It is not the  unity of the House of al-Ahmar, but the unity of Yemen and the  Yemeni people. We will continue our peaceful and democratic  struggle for this cause.    Al-Bid revealed that he has information regarding the  delivery of eight Iraqi aircraft the day before yesterday to  Sanaa via Tashkent. He believes the mediators are Iranian. He  said that there might be Iraqi support for Sanaa through Iran.  As for reports about Jordanian aid to Sanaa, al-Bid said: We  have information that Jordanian planes are flying to Sanaa  carrying ammunition and weapons. On the returns from the oil  resources in the south, al-Bid said that Exxon has frozen the  profits from sales and deposited them in a bank for both sides.  Production, however, continues and is increasing. It has now  reached over 150,000 barrels per day. Production in Hadhramaut  has reached 130,000 barrels per day. On the reasons for his  transfer from Aden to Hadhramaut, al-Bid said: I have come to  al-Mukalla for organizational purposes. The region has oil and  the people must know that someone is protecting it.     "

The document, which may be published only simultaneously in  Poland and the West, consists of 32 typewritten pages. It  includes a one-page political declaration; the following pages  contain details of various undertakings. The first part of the  IPP document recalls the declaration made at the NATO summit on  10 January of this year and the offer of the Partnership for  Peace, then the fact that Poland signed the so-called framework  document of the PFP on 2 February (general rules of  participation in the program). It is also recalled that our goal  is participation in the organization and the incorporation of  operational forces into the integrated military structure of  NATO. Therefore, we are ready to attain the capability for  joint operations and to adjust to the requirements of the  Western Armed Forces. In the second part of the document, all  intentions are marked with the symbols P1, P2, and P3. These  symbols denote the sequence of the implementation of the various  intentions. Each page is divided into six vertical columns:  Code, Areas of Cooperation (Goals of the Partner), General  Activities of the PFP, Type, Executive Instance, Remarks.    NATO has recognized the fact that the main Polish priority  in  cooperation with this organization is to ensure our country's  effective air defense, which is possible exclusively in a system  integrated with NATO. NATO has generally agreed that the issues  of the so-called three ""C's"" (communication, command, control  [preceding three words in English]--that is, the systems of  communication, command, and control) are the most important to  us, and it also wants to include them in the area of cooperation  with Poland.    According to Jerzy Milewski, under secretary of state in the  Ministry of National Defense [MON], who has all along been  responsible for the shape of the agreement with NATO, an  agreement that was proposed by NATO at the January summit  meeting and that is now at the final stage of negotiation, the  final agreement will not differ, at least basically, from the  joint decisions that have already been made.    The IPP will be accepted any day now, certainly before the  visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Poland (6 and 7 July).  Poland was the first country to present NATO with the so-called  presentation document (25 April), in which it specified its  priorities for cooperation (after the so-called framework  agreement, containing general rules and plans, was signed on 2  February). Now it will be the first country to sign the IPP  with NATO. It will be of symbolic significance to both us and  the ""16."" To us, because we stated already a long time ago that  our strategic goal is to join the Euro-Atlantic security  structures, and to them because they perceive Poland as a  country that is determined to join NATO.    We Are Setting Off Without an Umbrella    When they started negotiating IPP, Poland and NATO had  relatively little cooperation experience; however, there were no  serious problems in the friendly atmosphere in which the talks  were held, stressed Jerzy Milewski, under secretary of state in  MON, in an interview for RZECZPOSPOLITA. We were able to draw  on bilateral agreements--that is, on undertakings that were  planned earlier by Poland and the individual NATO member states,  such as the joint exercises with the Dutch, the British, and the  French. Also, we could take advantage of the contacts within the  framework of the North-Atlantic Council, which existed until the  end of 1991.    In its presentation document, Poland listed its wishes and  proposals in 40 points. NATO experts codified them in a method  practiced in contacts among the member states of the ""16."" They  marked them with appropriate symbols, letters, and numbers. As a  result, the entire IPP document, except for the one-page  preamble, consists of tables.    There Were No New Ideas    Then negotiations started (on the level of officers of both  sides), the goal of which was to explain the various points.  ""During these talks,"" Milewski emphasizes, ""NATO did not have  any new concrete ideas; however, the organization's intentions  for cooperation with us became increasingly clear.""    NATO's negotiators wanted Poland to do the following:     -  Agree to use the principle of clarity in the activity of  the Armed Forces--that is, agree to introduce the fundamental  standards that would make the planned activity predictable for  all partners.    -  Agree to democratic control over the Army  (exercised by elected civilian authorities).    -  Be able and ready  to take part in UN peacekeeping forces because peacekeeping  missions are currently becoming the basic type of military  activities and of preventing destabilization in the world.    -  Be  able to take on peacekeeping, rescue, and other types of  operations thanks to joint defense planning and exercises.    -  Make  clear its intentions concerning its future cooperation with the  organization.     Poland accepts all these conditions.    Jerzy Milewski underscores that Poland's participation in  the PFP is subordinated to our strategic goal, formulated two  and a half years ago: full membership of Poland in NATO. This  is why Poland declared in the IPP that it will incorporate all  of its operational forces into the military structures of NATO,  even though we were only expected to double our participation in  peacekeeping missions. Poland will take measures that may help  us incorporate our own Army in the NATO structure: The  commanding staff of our Army will cooperate with the  various--land, air, naval--commanding staffs of the joint NATO  forces in Europe and with the combined task forces [preceding  three words in English], which are being established by NATO  right now.    Cooperation with NATO would consist of the following:     -  The beginning of permanent consultations concerning the  defense policy.    -  Communication between our General Staff and  SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe) and AFCENT  (Allied Forces Central Europe).    -  Installation of technical means  of communication (mainly digital communication, coding  methods).    -  A striving to adjust the Polish Air Defense and  incorporate it in the integrated NATO system (which in the West  is at least 50-percent automated). Poland mainly wants to get  access to the air reconnaissance system.    -  Adaptation of the  command procedures and all other procedures, such as signs on  maps and methods of commanding (in NATO, there are approximately  2,000 signs that codify their procedures).     The IPP envisions various individual undertakings that are  supposed to help achieve these goals.    In Entirety or in Part    According to Milewski, we must strive for a situation in  which both all our Armed Forces and smaller formations (such as  one corps, three divisions, two battalions) can be used--in  cooperation with NATO. Contrary to what it seems to be, the  second possibility may be more difficult to implement because  the isolated units must be able to operate on their own, must be  well equipped and mobile. Later at least some Polish airfields  and martial ports should be adjusted to Western standards; in  addition, appropriate supply needs should be satisfied--for  example, fuel characterized by appropriate parameters.    Minister Milewski believes that cooperation with NATO should  develop ""step by step."" As a result of concrete minor  organizational and technical measures, as well as greater  undertakings, the Polish Armed Forces should be considered to be  adjusted to NATO requirements, adjusted to cooperation so that  all or part of those forces could be commanded by international  commanders, should a NATO summit decide to launch a military  operation.    Under the Name PFP    Cooperation within the framework of the PFP is practically  under way. Before that, even before an agreement is reached, the  planned undertakings have already begun--under the name PFP.  From the formal point of view, the first joint undertaking will  be international exercises of the peacekeeping forces, which  will be conducted on the firing ground near Zagan in September.  Participating in it will be 400-500 U.S. Army soldiers, soldiers  from other Western countries and from Poland and some  Central-East European states. Because NATO is the one that  issues an invitation, the possibility cannot be ruled out that  the Russians will also come to Zagan. Soldiers will use only  light personal arms.    Central-East European states unofficially inform each other  about their negotiations with NATO. Individual programs of  partnership will not be secret. It will be possible to review  these documents every year.    Without Political Protection    The question whether the IPP is satisfactory to Poland  evoked  many words that were critical of the entire PFP; Jerzy Milewski  told us that two aspects should be distinguished in this  program. The first concerns so-called temporary guarantees; the  other pertains to a long-term program of full integration with  Western structures. The PFP was rightly criticized as a program  that would not give us any political protection from pressure on  the part of the Russian Federation, the goal of which is to  leave Poland and other Central European states in the gray zone.  This pressure caused anxiety among the people. Because the  pressure did not encounter a counterreaction from the Western  states, the entire situation began to be increasingly similar to  Yalta. If we were offered membership in NATO or at least some  form of association with the organization, political protection  would be expected. Full integration into NATO is not possible  right now. It calls for an adaptation process, as a result of  which our defense structure would be adjusted to the NATO  structure. This should make our future membership real, not  only formal. We look upon the PFP as a mechanism to help  integration into NATO, and, from this standpoint, it can be  considered sufficient.    Jerzy Milewski stresses that Poland should make efforts to  be  admitted to the NATO structures gradually. The political  integration might be made right now; military integration,  because of the necessity of defense planning and adapting the  Army, would take some time. The example of Spain, which signed  six agreements on gradual integration before it was actually  admitted to NATO, shows that gradual integration is possible.     "

He said: Inclusion of the Great  Jamahiriyah in such claims and allegations and the concoction of  accusations against it is not a new thing. It has become one of  the hallmarks of the conspiracy against the Libyan Arab people  in order to exert pressure on its choices and to force it to  serve certain interests which are known to everyone.    Concerning the issue of terrorism and other related matters  which have been used by the Western powers to serve their  interests in the world, we wish to explain the following points:    1. The Great Jamahiriyah, which is eager to see  international peace and security established on solid bases  which will help relations between peoples of the world to be  based on equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in  internal affairs as well as the nonuse of violence in resolving  disputes, has been calling on the international community to  overcome negative aspects [in international relations], such as  the phenomenon of terrorism, by defining it, analyzing the  reasons for it, and combatting it.    2. The Great Jamahiriyah is another victim of terrorism,  particularly the state terrorism which has been used against it  for years, a matter which has claimed tens of innocent victims  as well as causing material damage. It reached its zenith  during the U.S.-Atlantist aggression against the innocent  inhabitants of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986, as well as  against the brother leader of the revolution and his family.  This was a serious international precedent, condemned by the UN  General Assembly in successive resolutions.    3. The Great Jamahiriyah reacted to the U.S.  Administration's  claims on terrorism with clear and public statements, documented  by international and regional organizations, in which they  condemned terrorism in all its forms. All international  organizations and bodies highly praised this stand.    4. The Great Jamahiriyah, in a bid to refute American  claims,  asked the UN secretary-general to take appropriate measures to  expose the falsehood of such claims.     "

In view of the recent  successes of the CDU in the presidential elections and with its  gaining the necessary votes in the European parliament, the  continued rule of this party seems likely in the future.    In this period, the relations between Tehran and Bonn have  been one of the most stable with any European country. Every  year has witnessed an increase in the number of economic and  financial exchanges between the two countries. Germany is  Iran's foremost trading partner and heads the list of importers  of Iranian commodities. The largest volume of Iran's non-oil  exports is sent to Germany, which collaborates with Iran in  numerous infrastructural and industrial projects.     "

I shall only welcome if its conditions  are observed,"" French President Francois Mitterrand told a news  conference in Tashkent on Tuesday where he is on a state visit.    France prefers a peaceful solution of the problem, the  president continued. Therefore, ""we support the initiative to  call an international conference with the participation of  Russia, the United States and the European Union under the U.N.  aegis.    ""Russia and the U.S. are now discussing this proposal. To  all appearances, its convocation can take one month.

Replying to ITAR-TASS, Mitterrand stressed that, following  the collapse of the Soviet Union, some concern developed in  Europe over a future military and political situation.    ""To maintain political stability and security,"" he said, ""we  have several mechanisms at our disposal. These are the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the  U.S.-brokered `Partnership for Peace' programme.    ""Last but not least, this is an idea put forth by France to  call an international conference at which we suggest that a pact  on stability in Europe be concluded and that obligations of all  countries be defined on preventing and settling conflicts at the  earliest possible stage.""    Mitterrand also noted that he understands Russia's  hesitations concerning its accession to NATO's ""Partnership for  Peace"" programme. ""Russia is a great country, and it remains a  nuclear power. It led the system opposing NATO.    ""Such a confrontation was fraught with war but at the same  time, it served as a balance of forces."" The president did not  want to give advice to Russia how to get out of this situation.  ""It should make its own choice,"" he stressed.     "
0,FT934-1002 ,"FT934-1002 _AN-DLVCCAANFT 931222   FT  22 DEC 93 / Greece's idea of EU future fails to impress      By LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS   Greece yesterday proposed setting up a committee of 'wise men' to study a future European constitution when it takes over the presidency of the European Union in the New Year, but the plan met a cool response from larger member states. Britain, France and Germany yesterday all expressed polite reservations about the idea floated in Brussels by Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs. The idea of opening up a 'post-Maastricht debate' on the future of the European Union has been circulating recently, driven partly by fears that the 12-strong EU could become unwieldy if it takes in Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Mr Pangalos, an outspoken Greek socialist, said his idea of a high-powered independent group of constitutional experts was modelled on the 'Dooge committee', which paved the way for the 1985 Single European Act creating an integrated market by 1992. He added that he was frustrated by recent debate about the institutional impact of enlargement, because it focused on secondary issues such as the number of European Commissioners and the balance of voting power between large and small states. He suggested that the committee could produce a report for heads of government at the European summit in Corfu in June, well in advance of the scheduled 1996 conference which will review Maastricht. 'It is better to have talks about institutional questions now rather than have the question rise up continually like the Loch Ness Monster,' he said. The Greek government takes over the EU presidency from Belgium on January 1. Mr Pangalos described the presidency's goals as tackling unemployment, implementing the European Commission White Paper on competitivness and growth, and producing new initiatives on health, education, culture and consumer protection. On external affairs, he hinted at plans for a new EU 'joint action' on nuclear non-proliferation and new measures to strengthen the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Yet Mr Pangalos accused the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia of harbouring territorial claims against the northern Greek province of Macedonia and of engaging in other 'provocations' through the design of its flag.

Estonia by now has prepared in most part the text of the  document it is going to propose from its side. Still to be  agreed upon are the issues pertaining to the military resources  to be given to NATO's disposal by Estonia. Work is going on  over these issues at the defense forces Central Staff in Tallinn.    After all necessary amendments have been made in the  Estonian  text of the plan, the government will get a draft budget of the  expenses connected with Estonia's participation in the program.  If the government approves the budget, Estonia will submit its  program to the NATO leadership for approval.    The Foreign Ministry says Estonia will be ready to take part  in the program in the second half of this year. Cooperation  under the Partnership for Peace program will follow the 16+1  formula, i.e. 16 NATO members plus that particular non-member  partner. But the program also provides for extensive bilateral  cooperation between NATO members and the partner countries.    The cooperation project is being prepared in Estonia by a  work group, led by the head of the Foreign Ministry's political  department, Toivo Klaar.    Officials at the Foreign Ministry said Estonia has been  working closely particularly with Denmark, but also with Germany  and the United States while drawing up the program. Exchanging  of information goes on steadily with Latvia and Lithuania, the  ministry officials said.    Enn Tupp, the head of the defense policy department at the  Estonian Defense Ministry, told reporters on Wednesday [27  April] that the country above all is interested in the  possibilities that the partnership program offers in the field  of military training. ""This is one of our main aims while  participating in the program,"" Tupp said.    Estonia in the documents pays much attention to the  strengthening of its coast defense. The country expects from  the NATO members not only assistance in the form of consulting,  but also ""certain material support,"" Tupp said.     "

Mr. Zhou said that a consensus was reached during the  meeting  for a heavy crackdown on such illegal practice. Participants  lent their support and expressed understanding of three punitive  measures submitted by the ministry, the General Administration  of Customs and the State Import and Export Inspection Bureau and  of the punishment handed down to four enterprises found guilty  of violation of the relevant law. They expressed their  determination to further fight against the illegal re-export of  textiles.    All of the participants were clearly aware of the serious  harm resulting from such offences which bypassed the quota  system administration at home and disrupted the conducting of  foreign trade while it also ran counter to a commitment made by  China in bilateral and multi-lateral international agreements,  resulting in great damage to China's prestige and credit in  terms of foreign trade in the international community. Illegal  re-exporting carried out by a handful of enterprises caused  damage not only to the state, but also to themselves finally.  Their offence made other law-abiding enterprises subject to  unnecessary inspection and accusations when undertaking  foreign-related business.    Leading teams have already been set up in Tianjin  Municipality and Shandong Province to counter the illegal  re-export of textiles and have worked out measures for  inspection and handling of the offence. The Shenzhen Import and  Export Commodities Inspection Bureau and the Shenzhen Bureau of  Economic Development often join forces in inspecting processing  plants.    The Foreign Trade Ministry, the Administration of Customs  and  the State Inspection Bureau will continue to send inspection  teams to do spot checks on enterprises this year. The  implementation of any decision made by this meeting will be  examined, while Guangdong, Shantou, Shenzhen, Fujian, Xiamen,  Zhejiang and Ningbo have to boost cooperation and coordination  in carrying out inspections of production, transactions,  examinations, customs declarations and the export of textiles  there.

It  focused on ways of developing and enlarging the Peninsula Shield  Force and linking radar networks in the member states in the  form of an early warning network. The meeting of the GCC chiefs  of staff is considered the first practical step toward  implementing a number of recommendations the GCC defense  ministers made during their meeting in Abu Dhabi last November,  which were referred to the GCC leaders during their December  summit meeting in Riyadh. [passage omitted]    Sources at the GCC General Secretariat say that ""the joint  Gulf early warning network which has been agreed will not lead  to a radical change in what already exists in the member states.

The meeting of the chiefs of staff  committee will determine a location for the command of the early  warning network system.    Regarding development of the Peninsula Shield, there is an  agreement to enlarge it, namely by each state allocating units  from its army to join the Peninsula Shield Force whenever  necessary or during joint exercises and maneuvers.    There is also an agreement that the Peninsula Shield Force  command be assumed by turns among the member states, provided  that the headquarters of these forces remains in the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia and that a unified general staff, based in Riyadh,  is formed for these forces.    Regarding financing and armament, each state will contribute  according to the number of units it allocates to the Peninsula  Shield Force.

In a report on employment and unemployment, the Paris-based  Western think tank also called for improvement of education and  job training systems to meet a shift in demand away from  unskilled jobs to more highly skilled jobs.    The report came out as the OECD opened a two-day ministerial  meeting to look into ways to secure employment, with as many as  35 million people out of work within the group.    As for working hours, the report proposes introducing  flexible working schedules for part-time workers, reducing  overtime allowances and reviewing the minimum wage to provide  more job opportunities.    But the report is quick to underline the need to carry out  the changes without reducing social protection levels for  workers.    ""High unemployment should be addressed not by seeking to  slow  the pace of change, but rather by restoring economies' and  societies' capacity to adapt it [as received],"" the report says.    ""But this must be undertaken in ways which do not abandon  the  social objectives of OECD societies. Rather, social objectives  must be met in new, more carefully designed ways that do not  have the past unintended and undesirable side effects.""    It brushes aside a persistent argument in some industrial  nations that imports of low-priced goods from developing nations  is the main cause of unemployment in industrial nations,  describing such a view as ""ill-founded.""    The report points to data showing that the weight of  low-wage  countries' exports in the overall expenditure of OECD countries  on goods and services is only about 1.5 percent.    ""The number of markets which they (low-wage countries)  contest is greater, and their effect on the intensity of  competition is increasing,"" it says.    ""But the judgment on present evidence is that the overall  impact both of imports from these countries and their  contestation of OECD markets is too small to account for a  significant part of either current unemployment or falling  relative wages of the low-skilled.""

From now on, we must gear all our efforts toward  prevention and education."" This was how Raymond Kendall, the  secretary general of Interpol, summed up the conclusions of the  second pan-European conference on drug addiction, which brought  together some 40 European health ministers at the Council of  Europe.    Prevention and education: Those were the main points of the  conference, along with an undercurrent of aid to the countries  of East Europe, which are for the moment totally devoid of any  legislation, institutions, or specialist personnel. Cooperation  with the East European governments, which are asking for a great  deal of aid to combat drugs, ""is slowly taking shape,"" explained  Christopher Luckett, head of the drug division at the Pompidou  group. ""These countries have set up government committees on  drug trafficking with which we are working,"" continued Luckett.    Unlike our Western democracies, East Europe is not yet used  to a high level of consumption of hard drugs. ""In these  countries, alcohol, solvents, and the abuse of medicines  prevail,"" continued Luckett. The priority in the fight against  drugs is therefore, as the Interpol head stressed, ""to prevent  the importation of a consumption market into East Europe. This  is where prevention is essential,"" something which could be  implemented through pan-European action.    East Europe -- a drug transit region through the historic  Balkan route, which bypasses wars like the one in Yugoslavia, or  which finds different ways --has become a major production area.  This is what really worries most of the participants at the  Strasbourg conference. ""Indeed, our biggest worry today, or at  least the worry of the institutions which are fighting drug  trafficking and production, is the tens of thousands of hectares  planted with poppy and cannabis and growing in the Asiatic  republics of the former USSR: Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and  Tajikistan have now become uncontrollable areas for us, where  local and ethnic conflicts are mixed up with arms and drug  trafficking, with the one financing the other.""

In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Sunday, Vladimir  Kazimirov,  head of the Russian delegation to the talks, expressed  satisfaction with the negotiations, stressing that both sides  consider as inadmissible any attempts to internationalise the  conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.    The participants in the talks agreed to take practical steps  and act together if need be in order to end the bloodshed and  stabilise the situation in the war zone. Iran and Russia are  ready to support constructive moves by international  organisations and separate countries in this direction,  Kazimirov said.

It channels its efforts in several  directions: Mediation proper, activities within the framework of  the Minsk talks of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe, as well as active contacts with the states interested in  ending the bloodshed because of their geographical closeness to  the war zone, Kazimirov said.    ""Within this context we continue enhancing mutual  understanding with Iran, whose borders are now close to the war  as never before,"" Kazimirov said.    He stressed that the talks have revealed the closeness of  the  two countries' approaches to and assessments of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. An agreement has been reached to  maintain regular contacts and take concrete steps to resolve the  conflict.    Kazimirov noted that Russia will continue ""persistent""  mediatory efforts in order to reach a concrete and binding  agreement on ceasefire and termination of hostilities. This  will pave the way for solving many other problems caused by the  conflict, including the withdrawal of troops from the occupied  territories, the return of refugees to the places of their  permanent residence, resumption of transport services and energy  supplies, and acceleration of the negotiation process on the  whole.

But only 168  contacts, or 27 percent of those approved, took place as the  others did not due to lack of their preparations or refusal by  North Koreans to meet.    One hundred and eleven contacts were made in China, mostly  in  Beijing and Shenyang, 33 in Hong Kong, 15 in Japan and nine in  other countries, the National Unification Board [NUB] said in  its ""White Paper on Unification"" released yesterday.    The ratio of actual contacts to total authorized  applications  declined from 39 percent in 1990 and 1991, 27 percent in 1992  and 21 percent last year, apparently in line with the growing  tensions between the two halves of the peninsula.    As far as the number of applications was concerned, small  and  medium industrialists were more inclined to inter-Korean  contacts. A total of 516 applications came from small and medium  companies and 137 from large ones.    Since the enactment of the Law on South-North Exchange and  Cooperation in 1990 through last year-end, the NUB said, 419  South Korean businessmen met with North Koreans in the 168 cases.    They were part of the 3,088 South Koreans who made contacts  with North Koreans in 838 cases on various occasions such as  academic forums, family reunions and business during the period.    Those who visited the other side of their fatherland  numbered  1,270 on 38 occasions, largely consisting of the several rounds  of prime ministers' talks, each attended by a total of 100  negotiators, support personnel and newsmen.    Economic cooperation, which started in October 1988 with the  capitalist South lifting its trade embargo in the wake of the  successful hosting of the Seoul Olympic Games, cooled later in  1992 when Seoul linked it with the nuclear issue.    Businessmen here expect that inter-Korean economic ties  would  resume soon after the one-year impasse over the North's nuclear  development plan is broken.

The sources, with  whom AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT spoke in European capitals, say that Iraq  has sent secret missions to South Africa to achieve the  following five main objectives:    1. Purchase of blueprints of a new type of artillery shells  not yet produced worldwide. They are the 210-mm giant shells.  Dr. Gerald Paul (who was later assassinated) drew up the main  design of the shell and the Iraqi branch of Dr. Paul's company  coordinated with the company's branch in South Africa for that  purpose.    2. Reach agreement with an arms establishment in South  Africa to act as intermediary between Iraq and world companies  (mainly American and British) for the procurement of extremely  advanced equipment for checking missiles after they are filled  with explosives. Such missiles include the Scud missiles and  heavy artillery shells. British, American, and other companies  were not permitted to export such sophisticated devices to a  state like Iraq. It should be noted that the effectiveness of  missiles and projectiles depends basically on the use of that  kind of device. The sources said that Iraq did in fact get some  offers through South Africa for the purchase of missile testing  equipment.    3. The third aim of the Iraqi contacts with South Africa has  been fully achieved. Baghdad has been able to purchase a  complete factory for the manufacture of 130-155 mm artillery  shells.    4. The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the fourth aim  has been the training of technicians and engineers. The sources  said that quite a few Iraqis have received training in South  Africa. Travel from Iraq to Johannesburg via Frankfurt and  London was under assumed names. According to the sources, the  visas were issued for ""the crescent state,"" the expression used  in official correspondence.    5. The fifth aim has been exploratory research on uranium in  South Africa [as published]. The sources said that Baghdad had  indeed received some offers in this connection.     "

Juppe, who arrived in Japan earlier in the day for a four-day  stay, expressed his support in a meeting with his Japanese  counterpart Tsutomu Hata, the officials said.    Juppe said in a meeting with Hata it is necessary to enlarge  the Security Council and the number of its permanent members to  reflect the current world situation, they said. ""In this  context, it is natural for Japan and Germany"" to acquire  permanent seats, he was quoted as saying.    Juppe added that France does not want to create new  categories for permanent members such as creating permanent  members without veto power. ""France wants to maintain the  current system,"" he reportedly told Hata, adding it is necessary  to enlarge the council but also to maintain its efficiency.    He also noted the need to take into account regional  allocations when considering enlargement of the permanent  members, the officials said. ""In any case, France's position is  flexible,"" Juppe was quoted as saying.    Juppe's remarks were the clearest support yet by a French  Government official for Japan's bid for a permanent seat,  according to the officials.    Hata said Japan would carry out its responsibilities within  its capacity.    Turning to problems involving North Korea's alleged  development of nuclear weapons, Juppe and Hata agreed on the  need for the international community to take a firm stance to  tackle the issue, the officials said. Juppe told Hata that  France, which currently chairs the U.N. Security Council,  considers the problem very important and is very concerned, they  said.    Touching on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  forum, Juppe said France wants to have some kind of dialogue  with APEC because it has close relations with the region,  according to the officials. Hata replied that Japan thinks APEC  should be open and wants to promote transparency of APEC's  activities, the officials said.    Also during the meeting covering a wide range of topics,  Hata  urged France to continue to refrain from conducting nuclear  tests, they said.     "

He said: Inclusion of the Great  Jamahiriyah in such claims and allegations and the concoction of  accusations against it is not a new thing. It has become one of  the hallmarks of the conspiracy against the Libyan Arab people  in order to exert pressure on its choices and to force it to  serve certain interests which are known to everyone.    Concerning the issue of terrorism and other related matters  which have been used by the Western powers to serve their  interests in the world, we wish to explain the following points:    1. The Great Jamahiriyah, which is eager to see  international peace and security established on solid bases  which will help relations between peoples of the world to be  based on equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in  internal affairs as well as the nonuse of violence in resolving  disputes, has been calling on the international community to  overcome negative aspects [in international relations], such as  the phenomenon of terrorism, by defining it, analyzing the  reasons for it, and combatting it.    2. The Great Jamahiriyah is another victim of terrorism,  particularly the state terrorism which has been used against it  for years, a matter which has claimed tens of innocent victims  as well as causing material damage. It reached its zenith  during the U.S.- Atlantist aggression against the innocent  inhabitants of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986, as well as  against the brother leader of the revolution and his family.  This was a serious international precedent, condemned by the UN  Gneral Assembly in successive resolutions.    3. The Great Jamahiriyah reacted to the U.S.  Administration's  claims on terrorism with clear and public statements, documented  by international and regional organizations, in which they  condemned terrorism in all its forms. All international  organizations and bodies highly praised this stand.    4. The Great Jamahiriyah, in a bid to refute American  claims,  asked the UN secretary-general to take appropriate measures to  expose the falsehood of such claims.     "

Hungary was represented by Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky,  International Economic Relations Minister Bela Kadar,  Transportation Minister Gyorgy Schamschula, and Minister of  Industry and Trade Janos Latorcai.    The Russian negotiating group included Telecommunications  Minister Vladimir Bulgak, Foreign Economics Minister Oleg  Davidov, Nuclear Energy Minister Vitaly Mikhaylov, Deputy  Finance Minister Andrei Vavilov, and Deputy Foreign Minister  Sergei Krilov.    Hungarian Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman told the  press that the talks focussed mainly on bilateral economic  cooperation. The two prime ministers agreed that unresolved  issues outstanding from the past should be quickly settled,  including Russia's debt to Hungary, so that efforts can be  concentrated on strengthening business ties.    Herman said the $800-900 million which Russia owes Hungary  could be repayed through the participation of Hungarian  companies in Russian privatization, the use of non-commercial  services, or machine deliveries. The possibility of further  arms purchases was also raised, though Hungary would prefer  modern market methods of debt repayment which promote economic  relations.    Ministry leaders are to spend the next day-and-a-half  discussing debt settlement. It is hoped that an agreement on  this issue will be signed during Chernomyrdin's visit.    The two prime ministers noted with satisfaction that  bilateral trade has stopped declining and conditions have been  created for an increase in the near future.    Chernomyrdin said Moscow hopes Hungary will move ahead from  the 7th place it presently takes among Russia's trading  partners. Boross believes Hungary could mainly increase its  exports of farm and food products, medicines and buses.    Regarding the Hungarian-Russian basic treaty, Chernomyrdin  said that while the former parliament was unable to approve it,  there is now a good chance for ratification.    Touching on the South Slav crisis, the Russian prime  minister  stressed that Moscow will do all it can for a peaceful  settlement as soon as possible, which he noted was also in  Hungary's best interest.    The two heads of government voiced agreement that political  relations are settled and progressing fairly well between the  two countries.     "

Demirel expressed Turkey's readiness to join all efforts at  ironing-out differences and preventing the war from eventually  spreading to Kosovo, Sanjak, Macedonia, or Vojvodina.    The Middle East peace process was the subject of talks  between 'Arafat and Goncz. Arafat said he hopes for an early  agreement on the basis of his Davos discussions, because it is  important for the peace process not to lose its credibility by  further delay. They also discussed Hungarian-Palestinian  relations and the reconstruction program. Goncz confirmed an  invitation for 'Arafat to visit Hungary.    Birkavs told Goncz of Latvia's intention to increase ties  with the Visegrad Group (comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary,  Poland, and Slovakia). He called for new accords with Hungary,  mainly in business and law. Birkavs cited security as a top  priority for his country.    Goncz welcomed endeavors to boost bilateral links, and  expressed Hungary's readiness to help Latvia join European  integration organizations.    Goncz asked Paye to back Hungary's efforts to attain full  OECD membership. Paye expressed his appreciation of previous  cooperation between various committees of the OECD and Hungary.    Accompanied by Hungarian Foreign Economic Minister Bela  Kadar, Goncz and Larosiere discussed EBRD assistance for  economic restructuring, privatization, and infrastructure  projects in Hungary, amounting to ECU200 million so far, plus  aid commitment of ECU700 million. They also reviewed areas for  possible additional EBRD support, primarily banks and large  privatized companies.     "

Sarney promptly accepted the invitation, which was extended  personally by Franco. Sarney returned from France on 20 June.  Today he stayed home recovering from labyrinthitis. At 1700 on  22 June, Sarney will meet with the members of the Brazilian  delegation to discuss details of the trip, which is scheduled to  start on 24 June. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has informed  the Portuguese Government about the change.    Franco said by asking Sarney to head the delegation he was  paying tribute to the presidents of Portugal, Angola, Cape  Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe  because the first meeting aimed at creating the International  Institute of the Portuguese Language with the attendance of the  heads of state of these countries was held on 3 November [no  year given] in Sao Luiz (Maranhao) and was organized by  Ambassador de Oliveira, who was then culture minister of the  Sarney government.    In a communique released today at Planalto Palace, the  president states that despite having postponed his trip to  Portugal, he will visit that country before the end of his term  to commemorate the creation of the CPLP and to resume bilateral  talks with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco e Silva. The  Brazilian delegation will include cabinet ministers, executives  of state-owned companies, and private businessmen who will pay  their own travel expenses.    Presidential Spokesman Fernando Costa has said Franco's  decision to postpone the trip was in no way related to the death  of his nephew and private secretary Ariosto Franco, although the  cancellation came after his death. ""The president was shaken by  Ariosto's death,"" Costa said, ""but he has chosen to stay in  Brazil because he considers his presence necessary on the eve of  the implementation of the real.""     "

Our  ambassador in Kabul met heads of some of the conflicting groups  yesterday and expressed our country's readiness to mediate  between the belligerent groups to end the conflict and establish  peace and tranquility in Afghanistan.    The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly expressed its  concern over any conflict in Afghanistan, whatever its reason,  and supports a political solution. The Iranian nation and  Government, acting according to their canonical duties,  supported the just struggles by the mojahedin during the 14  years of their jehad against the communists and extended  financial and material assistance to it. During the same period,  they also hosted 2 million Afghan refugees.    The Afghan mojahedin's victory in the war against blasphemy  and atheism made the Iranian nation happy, since expectations  then were that Islamic rule in Afghanistan would be established  and the two Muslim neighboring countries, which share historic,  religious, and cultural characteristics, could live in  tranquility next to each other. Despite these expectations,  bloody clashes among rival groups that once fought against the  communists on one front, concerned the Iranian nation. So, the  Iranian Government--as a friendly, neighboring, and Muslim  country--considers it its duty to spare no effort to end the  conflict in that country.    Islamic Iran has always wanted Afghanistan's unity and  territorial integrity and, having adopted a policy of not  interfering in others' domestic affairs, it considers  cooperating and coordinating with friendly Muslim countries to  overcome their problems to be among the principles of its  foreign policy.    Afghanistan is facing state organizational problems,  problems  in economic reconstruction and in establishing social law and  order, the problem of refugees, and fuel and food problems. The  Islamic Republic of Iran has always expressed its readiness to  help the Afghan nation to overcome any need it has.    Hopefully, cooperation by friendly, Muslim, and neighboring  countries can help to end the clashes in Afghanistan and  stability and tranquility can be returned to Afghanistan. But  success in this calls for cooperation and coordination among the  jehadi forces.     "

Interviewed by IRNA, Shirzadian stressed that Iran's nuclear  program aims at peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and its  activities are within the framework of the rules and regulations  of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The daily which is simultaneously published in London and  Beirut, in its Monday edition alleged that a Spanish nuclear  firm is to provide Iran with necessary technology to transform  its two nuclear installations for peaceful utilization of that  energy into plants with military purposes.    The daily claimed that the Spanish company is to sell  diversion technology to IRAN under a 80 million dlrs [dollars]  contract signed by an Iranian nuclear delegation in Madrid last  month.    The Islamic Republic of Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear  Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and has repeatedly announced its  firm adherence to it.    The official noted that Iran has always proclaimed that its  nuclear facilites are open to the IAEA and the agency's  inspection teams have repeatedly confirmed that Iran's nuclear  program is for peaceful purposes.    Despite the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has  repeatedly rejected such wild reports, some segments of the  western media are trying to portray Iran as a country which is  in quest for nuclear arms, regretted Shirzadian.    In a separate statement today, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs also rejected rumours circulated by 'AL-SHRAQ-UL-OWSAT'  daily accusing Iran of seeking nuclear weapons.    The statment dismissed as ""baseless"" the daily's allegations  and called it part of the psychological war against Iran by the  arrogant countries and the zionist regime.    Certain media often lauch such fabrications of Iran's  cooperation with a third party, in a bid to poison world public  opinion against Iran's peaceful nuclear program and the peaceful  ends of its foreign policy and they want to undermine its  friendly relations with Spain, the Foreign Ministry said.    On December 2, Iran's permanent representative at the United  Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, announced at the general assembly  meeting that Iran is firmly committed to the establishment of  the Middle East as a nuclear free zone (NFZ).

By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ANKARA, Turkey      A pivotal American ally from the opening round of the Persian Gulf crisis,  Turkey is settling in for a long siege, exerting tough economic, military and  psychological pressure on neighboring Iraq.    So far this week, Turkey has welcomed nearly two dozen U.S. F-16 interceptors  to an air base in the south that is already crowded with American ordnance, and  it has extended by a year the expiring leases on more than a dozen American  bases and listening posts on Turkish soil.    Next week, President Turgut Ozal will fly to Washington for lunch with  President Bush; the two have been in touch by phone regularly since Iraq  invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and have agreed on virtually everything. Now both want  to keep unremitting pressure on Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.    In Washington, Ozal will seek short-term U.S. economic concessions and, for the  longer term, increased military aid.    Ozal says that siding with the United States is a matter of principle for which  Turkey expects no direct pay-back. But as Washington knows, and is grateful  for, in confronting Iraq, Turkey has abandoned a neutralist role in Middle East  affairs that had been a pillar of Turkish foreign policy since the collapse of  the Ottoman Empire after World War I.    In a region where racial hatred runs deep, it is a truism that Turks and Arabs  dislike one another.    ""We ruled these Arab countries for 400 years, and they don't look at the Turks  as friends,"" Yilmar Usluer, a retired admiral and editor of M5 Strategic  Magazine, said in a recent interview. ""But we cannot stay isolated. Turkey took  sides; it had to take sides. If there is a fire in your neighbor's house, you  are affected.""    Overnight, Turkey has taken center stage in the Middle East. Without Turkish  support, economic sanctions against Iraq could not succeed. The closure of  pipelines that carried about half of Iraq's oil to world markets and the  rupture of commerce -- along with a decline in tourism and other losses,  including $1 billion in exports -- will cost Turkey around $5 billion a year,  Central Bank governor Rusdu Saracoglu estimates.    All this will mean a spurt in inflation and a 20% decline in growth in 1990 --  to a still-robust 8% -- but it is a bill that must be paid, in the official  Turkish view. Twice so far, Turkey has rebuffed official Iraqi overtures --  promises of cheap oil -- to ease the pressure. A shipload of Argentine beef  consigned to Iraq marks time in a Turkish warehouse. Suspicious Bulgarian cargo  flights bound for Baghdad are denied overflight rights by Turkey.    Without Turkish military pressure, Hussein would have as many as 100,000  additional troops available against the U.S.-led multinational force in Saudi  Arabia. With Turkey neutral in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, Hussein did not  defend his border with the Turks.    As part of the global response to the invasion of Kuwait, though, Turkey  swiftly reinforced its forces on the Iraqi border, with up to 85,000 men by one  estimate. Now, military sources say, there are up to nine Iraqi divisions --  about 100,000 men, or nearly 10% of Hussein's armed strength -- in defensive  positions on the Turkish frontier.    ""Turkey has destroyed any military benefit of Saddam Hussein's accord with  Iran,"" said Seyfi Tashan, director of the Foreign Policy Institute, a private  think tank.    In addition, the air base at Incirlik, near Adana in southern Turkey, normally  home for about 9,200 U.S. service personnel and their dependents, bristles with  newly arrived firepower. Usually, there are no U.S. warplanes based at  Incirlik; they are rotated in and out for training. Now, though, there are 14  U.S. F-111 fighter-bombers from England at the base.    This week, they and four F-16 fighters there since last month for training were  joined by 20 F-16s from Torrejon Air Base outside Madrid, according to a  spokeswoman at the base. No one expects the F-16s to return any time soon.    For his part, Ozal ramrodded a war powers bill through the Turkish Parliament  earlier this month. It allows the dispatch of Turkish troops abroad and the  stationing of foreign troops in Turkey. There is no expectation that Turkey  will send troops to join the allied force in Saudi Arabia, but a senior Turkish  diplomat described the war powers act as a psychological maneuver by Ozal to  keep Saddam Hussein off-balance. The diplomat thinks sanctions rather than war  are the best means of forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.    Ozal, who believes Turkey's future lies with the West and has applied for  membership in the European Community, is by all accounts enjoying himself.    ""He is clearly liking what he is doing,"" one Turkish official said.    Opponents complain that Ozal displays the same one-man high-handedness in  handling the gulf crisis that he uses to run the country, but public opinion is  with him. Turkey, an Islamic but secular and democratic country of 56 million  people situated between East and West, finds itself not seeking friends but  being sought out and praised.    Not only does Ozal talk with Bush; his ministers deal with the Iraqis, and also  with the Iranians, providing a conduit to the West. If Turkey is enjoying this  unaccustomed regional role, it may be a sign of things to come.    That, Turkish officials say, will mean upgrading the large but dated Turkish  armed forces, which are getting $500 million in U.S. military aid this year.    Ozal may raise the military aid issue with Bush, but it would be at the risk of  alarming the strong Greek lobby on Capitol Hill. U.S. military aid to Turkey  and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but  constantly at odds over the Aegean Sea and divided Cyprus, is currently  apportioned at a ratio of 10 to 7.    The United States, the European Community, Japan and the oil-rich gulf states  have all promised to compensate Turkey, Egypt and Jordan for their losses in  implementing sanctions.

The aim of private training programs using ODA funding  has so far been to promote exchanges of technology. But  additional ODA funds will now be used to support a training  program on Japanese industrial property rights, which will be  carried out from this fall by the Japan Institute of Invention  and Innovation [JIII] (an auxiliary organization to the Patent  Office). This is in response to the agreement on Trade Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIP) reached in the  Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which urges  developing countries to establish an industrial property system.  Tokyo plans to assist developing countries mainly in Asia in  establishing the system, thereby exporting Japan's system of  protecting property rights to those countries.    The training program will be carried out mainly by the  Industrial Property Patents and International Cooperation  Training Center, which was established by the JIII on 1 April.    The center will dispatch Japanese private sector patent  specialists to foreign countries and also invite specialists  from foreign companies so that Japan's patent application system  for such products as computer circuits and semiconductors will  take root overseas.    ASEAN will be a main participant in the project. The project  will be funded by a portion of an ODA subsidy (which totals 9  billion yen in fiscal 1993) provided to the Japan Overseas  Development Council (JODC) and the Association for Overseas  Technical Scholarship (AOTS). The subsidy will cover one-third  to one-half of trainees' living expenses during their stay in  Japan.    Developing countries have been trying to establish an  industrial property system following the Uruguay Round  agreement, which obligates them to establish one. The United  States and the European Union have been working to export their  own industrial property systems to developing countries in a bid  to help private companies make inroads into those countries in  the future. Similarly, Japan's training program is aimed at  conforming an industrial property system in Asia to Japan's to  back Japanese companies in making inroads into developing  countries in Asia.     "

The weakening of regional  cooperation in Central Europe could threaten this goal, Slovak  Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan said today.    Czechs, Poles, Slovaks, and Hungarians have created the  Visegrad group to be able to ""coordinate their final liberation  from the sphere of influence of the former Soviet Union,"" Kukan  told a WEU meeting. He said Slovakia considered cooperation  between the Visegrad countries very important. Through good  neighborly relations and cooperation with its neighbors Slovakia  seeks to contribute to stability in Europe as well as to its own  security, he said. However, Bratislava is expecting a similarly  accommodating approach from its neighbors, Kukan stressed. He  admitted that individual Visegrad countries attached different  weight to their mutual cooperation but expressed the conviction  that all of them understood the inevitability of close  cooperation.    Kukan appealed to Western countries' representatives to  speed  up Central Europe's integration into its security structures.  Cooperation with NATO and WEU and the clear prospects of  Slovakia's membership in these organizations is necessary for  the success of economic and democratic reforms in the country.  ""The prosperity and security are inseparably connected,"" he  said, adding that the consequences of the forced division of  Europe would disappear at the time when individual areas on the  continent would have similar security guarantees.    NATO and its European pillar -- WEU are the basis of  European  security. That is why Slovakia is seeking to join these  organizations. ""I would like to emphasize that this orientation  is based on the political consensus of all political entities in  the country and on the public support,"" Kukan said. He pointed  out that Slovakia had proposed that international peace-keeping  and humanitarian forces could train on its territory.    Kukan rejected the view of some deputies that serious  problems existed between Slovakia and Hungary. He also stressed  that the division of the former Czechoslovakia did not mean that  the Slovak population was against European integration. ""We are  expecting to join the European Union at the turn of the century,  maybe already as soon as in 2000,"" Kukan said.     "

Responding to an appeal from the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees Sadako Ogata for a halt to the repatriation of refugees  from Iran and Pakistan, the English-language TEHRAN TIMES said  the Islamic republic was no longer able or ""obliged"" to host  them.    ""The nature of the Afghan refugee problem has changed since  the liberation of the country from the former Soviet Union,"" it  said. ""The world should not expect us to treat the refugees with  the same urgency when they are victims of factional infighting  in their country.""    The paper warned Iran's national security was ""threatened""  and that the country could no longer afford spending its  resources on the large number of refugees there.    ""Our security forces are engaged daily in clashes with  Afghan  drug smugglers disguised as refugees,"" it said. ""What would  Western countries do under the same circumstances?""    The Afghan capital Kabul has been hit by a new surge in  fighting since January 1, which has left some 10,000 people dead  or wounded and forced thousands to flee the country.    Troops loyal to President Borhanoddin Rabbani have been  pitted in a fierce battle against combined forces of  Uzbek-Pashtun warlord Abdol Rashid Dostam and Prime Minister  Golboddin Hekmatyar.    Ogata warned on Tuesday that the civil war raging in  Afghanistan could trigger a new influx of refugees into Iran and  Pakistan and called for a halt in the repatriation process.    Her message was contained in a letter read out to ministers  at a meeting of the 10-member Economic Cooperation Organisation  (ECO) in Tehran.    Ogata said she did not expect the international community to  fund the repatriation process as long as fighting threatened the  lives of the returnees.    She warned of the ""tendency of many governments to close  their borders when faced with the threat of refugee influxes,""  and called for borders to remain open for ""people who require  international protection.""    With UNHCR help Iran and Pakistan have stepped up efforts to  repatriate Afghan refugees who fled the 14-year civil war in  Afghanistan. Iran says the refugees have been encouraged but  not forced to return.     "

The heads of the two states, Boris Yeltsin  and Eduard Shevardnadze, spoke one-on-one.    Also held behind closed doors were meetings of official  delegations. Oleg Soskovets, first vice premier, and Georgian  Cabinet of Ministers Chairman Otar Patsatsiya discussed a  complex of reciprocal, primarily economic, relations.    Political aspects of intergovernmental cooperation were  taken  up by Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev and Aleksandr  Chikvaidze. Representing the Georgian side in the negotiations  were Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the Temporary Committee on  the Extraordinary Situation in the Republic, and Aleksandr  Kavsadze, chief of the State Committee on Protection of Rights  of Man and Interethnic Relations. The agenda went beyond general  Russian-Georgian relations to include certain aspects of the  Abkhaz and South Ossetian problems and the situation concerning  rights of non-native ethnic groups, particularly the Russian  population.    Also held was a meeting between Russian Minister of Defense  Army General Pavel Grachev and Major General Guram  Nikolayshvili, chief of the General Staff of the Georgian Armed  Forces, and Major General Paata Datyashvili. Army General Pavel  Grachev was highly pleased with the progress of the talks,  emphasizing that it was found possible to realize agreement on  the entire military cooperation agenda. Incidentally, the start  of the Russian-Georgian talks was preceded by a terrorist act:  Georgian Deputy Minister of Defense Nikolay Kekelidze was killed  in an explosion occurring in his apartment on 3 February. The  minister of defense himself, Major General Georgiy  Karkarashvili, retired from his position on the eve of the  talks. A KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent was able to determine  that the reason for the retirement was ""unacceptability of a  policy of establishing closer relations between Georgia and  Russia.""    Completion of the talks was followed by the signing of a  package of Russian-Georgian bilateral agreements, chief of which  was the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly Relations, and  Cooperation.    Also signed was a number of intergovernmental agreements  relating to trade and economic ties, status of Russian Border  Troops stationed on Georgian soil, and cooperation in science  and technology, cultural matters, education, and communications.  One of the agreements signed that is of great importance governs  the migration process and protects rights of settlers. Another  agreement pertains to cooperation in prevention and clean-up  operations in emergency situations.    A provision to create three Russian military bases on  Georgian soil was set down in writing in a protocol of  intentions signed by the representatives of the defense  ministries of the two countries. Army General Pavel Grachev  stated that they could be created as early as 1994, with the  sites being Batumi, Akhalkalaki, and Vaziani. The minister of  defense also stated that ""Eduard Shevardnadze's refusal to  accept our offer of introducing Russian peacekeeping forces into  Abkhazia in September of 1993 was a mistake on Georgia's part.""  Pavel Grachev pointed out that this was admitted by  representatives of Georgia's Ministry of Defense.    Following the signing ceremony, Boris Yeltsin and Eduard  Shevardnadze held a joint press conference.    Relative to prospects of Georgia's entering into the ruble  zone, Boris Yeltsin stated at the press conference that it was  necessary to organize a working group which would weigh the  positive and the negative aspects of this kind of step, and only  after that would it be possible to make a decision.    Eduard Shevardnadze in principle shared Boris Yeltsin's  view,  adding that in Georgia there are ardent supporters and persons  adamantly opposed to the republic's entering into the ruble zone.    Boris Yeltsin, responding to journalists' questions relative  to Abkhazia's concern and alarm over the article in the  agreement providing for military-technical cooperation, stated  emphatically that technical assistance to Georgia is not a  matter of the present. The military cooperation process is to  take place gradually, in phases, tied closely to the rate of  progress made in political settlement of the Abkhaz problem.    Eduard Shevardnadze in turn stated emphatically that Georgia  will not be capable of creating an army without Russia, and she  has no intention of posing a threat to anyone. He also said that  he sees nothing that could preclude resolving the Abkhaz and  South Ossetian problem. The conflict settlement process, in  Shevardnadze's opinion, should proceed under the aegis of the UN  and the CSCE, with the employment of peacekeeping forces,  including those supplied by Russia.    In the opinion of Emil Pain, Presidential Council member,  all  the provisions of the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly  Relations, and Cooperation between Russia and Georgia, which  today was signed by the heads of the two states, are ""useful for  Russia largely in the political aspect.""    The Presidential Council member singled out the problem of  stationing Russian troops on Georgian soil and creating military  bases. ""Georgia,"" he said, ""is giving a guarantee of setting up  Russian servicemen."" Emil Pain continued by saying that there is  a complex of strategic military agreements which are of general  significance to the CIS member countries. He cited an example:  It would cost Russia tens of millions of rubles if she were to  erect a new border. Also of importance are agreements made with  Georgia which pertain to moving Russian freight through Georgia  by land and sea.    Thus, the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly Relations, and  Cooperation between Russia and Georgia has been signed. It is a  thing already done. This is illustrated to some extent in the  photograph of the unnamed soldier - taken by our correspondent -  who is a member of the Russian peacekeeping forces stationed in  South Ossetia. Thanks to young men such as he, Ossetian and  Georgian peasants for the first time in many years of the bloody  encounters are able to do their work as before on the land of  their ancestors.    Without him, the Russian peacekeeping soldier, the knot of  Caucasian contradictions could not be cut. And it seems that  this is finally being recognized by those who only yesterday  were shouting ""occupier"" at him.    In the afternoon of the day, Boris Yeltsin met with  Patriarch  Ilya the Second, the head of the Church of all Georgia. Later  the President of Russia and Eduard Shevardnadze held a meeting  with representatives of Georgia's intelligentsia. In the  evening, Chairman of the Parliament and Head of State of the  Republic Eduard Shevardnadze hosted an official dinner in honor  of the President of Russia.     "

Speaking at a press conference yesterday for the coming  four-day Hong Kong '94 China Trade and Investment Conference to  be held in the territory next week, Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) deputy director-general Ma  Xiuhong said the administration had seen rapid growth in foreign  investments in inner regions since late 1992.    ""As China's open door policy continues and foreign  investments increase to a certain level along the coastal areas,  inner regions have become the targets recently for most foreign  investment,"" Ms Ma said. In addition, they (the inner regions)  are also improving their own investment environment, which also  contributes to the rapid growth,"" she said.    Ms Ma said the amount of foreign funds flowing into the  inner  regions last year exceeded that of the coastal areas by 5 to 10  percent.    Earlier this year, China vowed to continue its foreign  investment policy and extended it to the inner regions. ""In  fact, the trend had already begun in late 1992. But it was more  obvious last year.""    She said that in its bid to re-enter the General Agreement  on  Tariffs and Trade, China was ""actively"" refining its trade laws  to conform to international standards. ""We are determined to  tailor a more secure and better protected environment for  foreign investments in terms of adjusting our laws.""    The country had stepped up work on trade regulations this  year. ""In the process of reform, the refinement of legislation  is necessary and will be to the interest of foreign investments.""    Moftec, under the Foreign Investment Administration, is to  jointly host the Hong Kong' 94 China Trade and Investment  Conference with the territory's Trade Development Council at the  Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. The conference  begins on Monday and will continue until 26 May. Seminars on  China's latest foreign investment policies will be held during  the conference, to brief interested investors.    Meanwhile, China's April industrial production figures  showed  a year-on-year increase of 17.9 per cent, according to the State  Statistics Bureau.     "

Ramos issued Memorandum Order  [M.O.] No. 201, creating a committee to study the expeditious  issuance of environmental compliance certificate [ECC] for  infrastructure projects. The committee is composed of the  National Economic and Development Authority director-general as  chairman, and the secretaries of the Departments of Environment  and Natural Resources, Public Works and Highways [DPWH], Energy,  and Transportation and Communications and the chairman of the  Coordinating Council of the Philippine Assistance Program as  members.    In signing the order, President Ramos said the government is  now engaged in the implementation of major infrastructure  projects that are crucial to the attainment of the Philippine  development goals. Mr. Ramos noted that lately, implementation  of this infrastructure projects has been delayed due to the  difficulties encountered in securing environmental compliance  certificates. The president tasked the committee to undertake  the following:    1. to determine the scope of environmental compliance  certificates;    2. to formulate ways and means by which the issuance of  environmental compliance certificate may be expedited; and    3. to submit recommendations to the executive secretary for  the formulation of the appropriate order. These recommendations  should be submitted to him not later than 15 May of this year.    Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. said President  Ramos issued M.O. 201 in view of the request of Public Works and  Highways Secretary Gregorio Vigilar for presidential assistance  for the immediate implementation of the Pampanga Delta  Development Project [PDDP]. According to Vigilar, the  submission of an environmental compliance certificate is one of  the priority requirements of the Overseas Economic Cooperation  Fund [OECF] of Japan before it issues a conforme to the  contracts of the PDDP. Vigilar said that during the president's  visit to PDDP site last 25 March, the OECF representative in  Manila, (Iteyo Tanakan) informed him that the OECF will continue  to withhold the release of PDDP funds until the DPWH has  complied with the conditions stated in the ECC. Vigilar said  that the OECF is particularly concerned with Section 1.3 of the  ECC which requires the DPWH for the contractors to secure  endorsement from every concerned local government units and  municipalities for right, suitable and acceptable relocation  scheme and conduct consultations with affected residents prior  to project implementation.

He  will carry out his policies, focused on globalization and  openness, by strengthening the competitive power of the country.    His government will push efforts to ease economic and  administrative regulations and restrictions to make a second  economic leap in the new economic order brought on by successful  conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.    The government will try to concentrate the national strength  for economic revitalization and increased exports through  stepped-up capital investment and stable industrial relations.    To achieve these goals, President Kim believes, the  political  foundation has to be stable first. He will, therefore, continue  to remove factors that breed irregularities and corruption while  adopting legislation on unified elections, political  fundraising, and political parties at an early date.    At the same time, the administration plans to redraw  election  districts in preparations for next year's local elections and  undertake local administrative reform.    An official at Chongwadae [presidential office] said Monday  that Kim contemplated the three basic policy directions of  internationalization, economic revitalization, and reform during  his two-day new year's holiday.    Kim's ideas include strategies for internationalization and  openness in the wake of the Uruguay Round, local elections in  1995, parliamentary elections in 1996 and the presidential  election in 1997, the official said. He regards the North  Korean nuclear issue as the key to inter-Korean relations. He  plans to map out multilateral strategies for the resolution of  the issue. His government will work out measures for economic  cooperation with North Korea and establishment of diplomatic  relations between Pyongyang and Washington and Pyongyang and  Tokyo if, or when, the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved,  the official said.    President Kim will actively pursue summit diplomacy for  closer coordination with the United States, Japan, China, Russia  and others to maintain peace on the Korean peninsula.    He is scheduled to visit Japan in the first half of the year  to be followed by a visit to Jakarta for the second Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the second half.    The president is expected to spell out his policies in  detail  at his first press conference of the year and on other  occasions, the official said.     "

From now on, we must gear all our efforts  toward prevention and education."" This was how Raymond Kendall,  the secretary general of Interpol, summed up the conclusions of  the second pan-European conference on drug addiction, which  brought together some 40 European health ministers at the  Council of Europe.    Prevention and education: Those were the main points of the  conference, along with an underlying current of aid to the  countries of eastern Europe, which are, for the moment, totally  devoid of any legislation, institutions, or specialist  personnel. Cooperation with the governments of the countries of  eastern Europe, which are asking for a great deal of aid to  combat drugs, ""is slowly taking shape,"" explained Christopher  Luckett, head of the drug division at the Pompidou group.  ""These countries have set up government committees on drug  trafficking with which we are working,"" continued Luckett.    Unlike our Western democracies, eastern Europe is not yet  used to a high level of consumption of hard drugs. ""In these  countries, alcohol, solvents, and the abuse of medicines  prevail,"" continued Luckett. The priority in the fight against  drugs is therefore, as the Interpol head stressed, ""to prevent  the importation of a consumption market into eastern Europe.  This is where prevention is essential,"" something which could  be implemented through pan- European action.    However, eastern Europe--a drug transit region via the  historic Balkan route, which bypasses wars like the one in  Yugoslavia, or which finds different ways--has primarily become  a major production area. This is what really worries most of  the participants at the Strasbourg conference. ""Indeed, our  biggest worry today, or at least the worry of the institutions  which are fighting drug trafficking and production, is the  implantation of tens of thousands of hectares with poppy and  cannabis growing in the Asiatic republics of the former USSR:  Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan have now become  uncontrollable areas for us, where local and ethnic conflicts  are mixed up with arms and drug trafficking, with the one  financing the other."" Luckett concludes that Europe has no  weapons to fight this.     "

This is  the trend of the times and the desire of the people. Although  Sino-U.S. relations are still full of contradictions and  maintaining the improving trend requires effort, this is an  important step. In particular, the U.S. Government has  recognized the importance of cooperating with China and has  realized that linking human rights to trade will lead itself  into a dead end; regarding this point, it is praiseworthy.    In the international community today, some major economic  powers are particularly willing to become partners in  cooperation with China to develop economic and trade relations,  and this has already become a world trend. Please look at the  following:    Japan: Entrepreneurial circles have a strong desire to  strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and a China fever  is sweeping across the Japanese islands. Last year,  Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations created three  first's, that is, Sino- Japanese trade volume set records and  Japan ranked first among China's trade partners, Japan's exports  of technology to China ranked first among China's technology  imports, and the realization rate of capital invested in China  by Japanese entrepreneurs also ranked first.    Germany: With Chancellor Kohl's China visit last October as  a landmark, Sino-German relations entered a new period of  thorough development, and many large enterprises marched toward  the Chinese market like an army, with Germany becoming China's  largest trade partner in Europe. Kohl said Germany was willing  to become China's ""real partner"" and hoped that relations  between the two countries would ""resemble ever-flowing steams  and rivers.""    France: Owing to arms sales to Taiwan by the French  Government, Sino-French relations were hurt. After going  through some twists and turns, the French Government changed its  mind and took the initiative to mend ties with China. In April  this year, Prime Minister Balladur visited China and said he  wanted to ""open a new chapter on Sino-French relations."" After  the leaders of the two governments held summits, a joint  communique on the restoration of relations was issued, and,  since then, relations between the two countries have entered the  track of normal development.    Russia: Earlier this year, Russian President Boris Yeltsin  proposed building a ""constructive partnership"" with China. Not  long ago, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin visited China, the two  countries signed seven agreements involving many areas, and  bilateral relations took a big step forward.    Some big powers have one after another adjusted their China  policies, and this can be regarded as the result of a re-  interpretation of China by those governments. Whether they are  willing or unwilling, politicians in Western countries,  including the United States, must admit: first, China is a  giant, and no pressures or sanctions of any kind can have an  impact on it; second, China has the fastest economic growth in  the world and has a great impact on the world's economic  development; third, China is a market with great potential and  is opening to every trade partner, who now find it provides the  best opportunity to enter the Chinese market and develop their  own economy. If a country looks down on China or even confronts  China, the one which will be hurt is not China but itself. The  French prime minister openly admitted that he had neglected the  development of the Asia region in the past and had now  discovered the consequence of such negligence, and that from now  on, he must pay special attention to China's development and  strengthen cooperation with China. The French foreign minister  also said that France ""regrets the quarrel with China caused by  the matter of arms sales to Taiwan,"" and asked ""should we bet on  a region of 20 million people or a country which has 1.1 billion  people and is probably the world's third largest economic power?  To us, the choice is very obvious.""    Economic factors are the determining factors about whether a  regime can be consolidated and whether society can develop. If  a country's politicians do not look at the economy, do not put  economic development in the first position, and do not consider  their country's long-term interests, they will lead their  country into decline and chaos and they will be abandoned by the  people. The contemporary Western world generally faces economic  depression, and it must put economic factors in pole position  when handling international relations to cast off this difficult  situation. This is an important reason why some of the major  powers are seeking cooperation with China.    There is also another point, that is, more Western countries  feel that it is not feasible to deal with China by exerting  pressure on it or imposing economic sanctions against it in  order to achieve political aims. The United States has even  failed to score results by imposing sanctions against some small  countries, let alone China, which has 1.1 billion people! In  the 1950's, armed intervention and economic blockade by the  United States failed to bring China to its knees; after ""4  June,"" the United States joined hands with some Western  countries to impose economic sanctions against China, but failed  to make China lower its head; in recent years, the United States  has waved the human rights stick but has failed to scare China.  Clinton linked human rights to MFN status and was strongly  opposed by various circles, especially commercial circles in the  United States; therefore, he could not but admit that the effect  of linking the two had vanished.    In handling relations with China, even France and the United  States have bowed their heads to reality and to economics; they  have rid themselves of erroneous ideas of their own and have  made choices which conform to their long-term interests and to  the world trend, and this cannot but deal a blow to the British  Government, which continues to insist on confronting China. Up  to now, Britain still hopes to see turmoil emerging in China,  hopes to use the human rights stick to scare China, and hopes to  see its allies and the United Nations exert political pressure  on China so that it can achieve its goal of extending its  colonial interests in Hong Kong; this is really absurd. We can  certainly say that in Hong Kong, while the British side is  staking its chips on a small handful of pro-British elements who  are trying to cause chaos in Hong Kong, it is doomed to failure.

Shevardnadze told a press conference arranged at the end of  his official visit to Turkey that the visit was the beginning of  a new stage for the two countries' relations.    He said the legal basis of the bilateral relations was  completed between Turkey and Georgia with the signature of  agreements adding that these two countries shared the same  opinion on regional issues.    He said a meeting with President Suleyman Demirel (whom he  called an ""experienced statesman"") was very beneficial.    Shevardnadze said Turkey and Georgia shared the views that  the problems should be solved in a peaceful way adding that the  same view was relevant for Abkhazia.    He said he hoped the UN- mediated talks in Geneva for the  solution of the Abkhazian problem would end positively.    Answering a question, Shevardnadze said ""the biggest problem  is the return of the refugees. Some 250,000 Georgians have fled  from Abkhazia. They are left homeless, hungry. If their  security is achieved, peace can be possible with Abkhazia.""    Asked if they wanted support from Turkey on the Abkhazia  problem, he said Turkey already joined in the problem.    Turkey earlier extended credit to Georgia and said Georgia's  territorial integrity should be preserved.    Shevardnadze said during the talks that Turkey and Georgia  discussed the improvement of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation  [BSEC] Project adding that the BSEC would contribute to the  peace, stability and economic development of the region being a  bridge between the European Union and the Commonwealth of  Independent States.    He said the BSEC should have a crisis-solving function  adding  that the issue will be discussed in a summit with the heads of  governments and heads of states in Tbilisi in May or June.    He said he invited Demirel, Premier Tansu Ciller and  Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk to Georgia.    Shevardnadze said they work on an ""Asian-European corridor""  project including petroleum and natural gas pipelines, highways,  railways, telecommunication networks and airways that will pass  from Turkey and Georgia.    He said Georgia will cooperate with NATO on the ""partnership  for peace"" project and open a military representation in NATO's  center.     "

The officials said both Hata and Kohl agreed that regional  groupings should be open to maintain free trade. Hata pledged  Japan's efforts to keep the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) forum as a mechanism to supplement the general agreement  on tariffs and trade, the officials said, adding Hata supported  closer dialogue between APEC and the EU. The 12-nation EU is  expected to expand its membership to include Austria, Finland,  Norway and Sweden.    Hata met with Kohl after talking with German Foreign  Minister  Klaus Kinkel about Japanese and German bids to win permanent  membership in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Hata  and Kinkel pledged to cooperate with each other in the UNSC  bids, officials said. Hata and Kohl, meeting for three hours,  also shared the need for Japan, Germany and other countries to  support Russia's reform efforts and maintain equal partnership,  the officials told reporters.    On North Korea, the two leaders also stressed international  solidarity to address Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons  program, although Hata said Japan believes channels of  communications with North Korea remain open to achieve a  negotiated settlement. Asked by Kohl about China's political  landscape in the future post-Deng Xiaoping era, Hata said the  collective leadership under President Jiang Zemin is functioning  and predicted no drastic change in China's open-door policy,  officials said.    Hata arrived in Bonn on the third leg of a European trip  with  previous stops in Italy and France. He will visit Belgium next.  In his talks with Kinkel, Hata said permanent UNSC seats for  Japan and Germany would benefit UN activities, and Kinkel said  Germany shares the same view. Hata and Kinkel expressed their  shared concern over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons  program, urging Pyongyang to dispel suspicions about the nuclear  issue, the officials said.    Kohl said in the course of his talks with Hata that he gets  tired as Japan changes its prime ministers every two years,  according to Japanese officials.    They said Hata responded, ""I will do my best"" to stay in  power longer than his predecessors. Hata's immediate  predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, was in power for only eight  months.     "

An official who refused to be identified said that the PLO  is  expected to set up an interim committee soon to receive  financial aid from the world for the rehabilitation of the Gaza  Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho.    Seoul expressed its will to support rehabilitation of the  autonomous region at multilateral talks in Washington Oct. 2-3  last year. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu attended the talks  co-chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev.    The talks were the first international ones held to handle  the aid program since Israel and the PLO signed a peace accord  in Washington early last September.    ""We are unable to discuss the aid program as no recipient  body has yet been set up by the PLO,"" the official said.    But inter-ministerial consultations are under way on the  methods of financial aid to the PLO following the establishment  of a recipient body, he said.    He said he is quite sure that the aid program will be  discussed bilaterally with the PLO, not international bodies or  Israel.    Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres telephoned his Korean  counterpart Han to support the rehabilitation of the autonomous  region of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, shortly  after the signing of the peace accord.    It is expected that the government will extend soft loans  from the Economic Development and Cooperation Fund (EDCF). The  EDCF is a government-managed fund for developing nations.    But other officials did not rule out that nonrefundable aid  would also be delivered although in small amounts.    The United States has projected collecting contributions  through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank.    At present, no country has extended aid to PLO for the same  reason as Korea and also because of the uncertainty of the  Middle East peace.    PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat also expressed hope for assistance  from South Korea in a recent interview with KBS [Korea  Broadcasting System]. 'Arafat is familiar with North Korean  leaders, having visited Pyongyang several times.    South Korea has no formal diplomatic ties with the PLO but  has already recognized its identity.     "

He also said that in a democracy, social statistics should  be ""available to all"" and not just to a ""technocratic elite""  that ""stresses only what is convenient"" and suppresses anything  that ""threatens its interests.""     -  70 percent of Bolivians are poor.    -  Of the 2,725,946  Bolivians who live in rural areas, 95.14 percent are poor.    -  As of  1991, 73.8 percent of the 2,488,800 Bolivians living in major  cities were of working age. Of this total 36 percent were  employed, the others were unemployed, or ""inactive.""    -  Mortality  rates have decreased--75 per thousand in 1992 from 151 per  thousand in 1976.    -  Fertility rates have also gone down--5 births  per woman in 1992 from 6.5 in 1976.

Interviewed by IRNA, Shirzadian stressed that Iran's nuclear  program aims at peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and its  activities are within the framework of the rules and regulations  of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The daily which is simultaneously published in London and  Beirut, in its Monday edition alleged that a Spanish nuclear  firm is to provide Iran with necessary technology to transform  its two nuclear installations for peaceful utilization of that  energy into plants with military purposes.    The daily claimed that the Spanish company is to sell  diversion technology to IRAN under a 80 million dlrs [dollars]  contract signed by an Iranian nuclear delegation in Madrid last  month.    The Islamic Republic of Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear  Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and has repeatedly announced its  firm adherence to it.    The official noted that Iran has always proclaimed that its  nuclear facilites are open to the IAEA and the agency's  inspection teams have repeatedly confirmed that Iran's nuclear  program is for peaceful purposes.    Despite the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has  repeatedly rejected such wild reports, some segments of the  western media are trying to portray Iran as a country which is  in quest for nuclear arms, regretted Shirzadian.    In a separate statement today, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs also rejected rumours circulated by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  daily accusing Iran of seeking nuclear weapons.    The statment dismissed as ""baseless"" the daily's allegations  and called it part of the psychological war against Iran by the  arrogant countries and the zionist regime.    Certain media often lauch such fabrications of Iran's  cooperation with a third party, in a bid to poison world public  opinion against Iran's peaceful nuclear program and the peaceful  ends of its foreign policy and they want to undermine its  friendly relations with Spain, the Foreign Ministry said.    On December 2, Iran's permanent representative at the United  Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, announced at the general assembly  meeting that Iran is firmly committed to the establishment of  the Middle East as a nuclear free zone (NFZ).

Last month, the company concluded two technological  cooperation agreements for development of mobile satellite  communications systems and optoelectronics components used in  optical communications.    The first agreement, signed with Embratel [Brazilian  Telecommunications Company, Inc.] and Simac Systems, a Dutch  company, calls for distribution of the Logiq system in Brazil.  That system is used to manage fleets of vehicles via Inmarsat  satellites, owned by an international consortium of which  Embratel is a member. Avibras, according to its vice president  Rubens Domingues Porto, will supply the complete system,  including installation, training, and technical assistance.    The Logiq system, Porto said, will permit a user to locate  and track his fleet automatically, to plan routes, give  instructions and directions, and exchange information between  each vehicle and the user's company. ""Communications can be  exchanged 24 hours a day,"" the vice president emphasized.    Optoelectronics    Through its Fiber Optics and Telecommunications unit,  Avibras  will also manufacture optoelectronics components (lasers,  optical receptors, amplifiers, etc). The project is being  carried out with technical support from Telebras [Brazilian  Telecommunications, Inc.] and Hewlett-Packard's Components for  Fiber Optics Division. The firm, according to Porto, will  initially supply submodules for assembly and encapsulation of  the devices in Brazil.    The partnership agreement with Hewlett-Packard, the Avibras  official said, will permit nationalization of the production and  exclusive distribution of the components in Brazil and the rest  of South America.    Avibras Fiber Optics is also preparing to enter the fiber  optics market within the next 12 months. ""We are finishing work  on the facilities for the unit, in which $6 million has already  been invested,"" he reported.    Before it can begin operating, Porto said, the fiber optics  will need another $4 million, which would be used to import  equipment. The company predicts an annual market for 100,000 to  150,000 kilometers of fiber optics in Brazil.    The new Avibras factory will make fiber optics by the MCVD  (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) process, using technology  developed by Telebras's Research and Development Center (CPqD)  and support from S.G. Control, a British firm.     "

We consider  this document to be historic and have therefore decided to  publish the full text of it. It was by Foreign Minister Jozef  Moravcik.    Evaluation of the Fulfillment of Slovak Foreign Policy in  1993    In 1993, the Slovak Republic established itself as an entity  under international law. In the first year of its independent  existence, the Slovak Republic has successfully become party to  all of the important international organizations and agreements,  as permitted by the conditions and the situation that arose  after the partition of Czechoslovakia. In the course of the  year, we have succeeded in defining the interests and priorities  of the Slovak Republic's foreign policy and in gradually  presenting ourselves as an equal-right partner on the  international scene. These facts create favorable prerequisites  for the Slovak Republic's foreign policy in 1994.    1. The Sphere of Multilateral Cooperation    1.1 Slovak Foreign Policy in the Security Sphere    The unequivocal definition of the Slovak Republic's  orientation on security matters and drafting a concept in that  sphere has been one of the most important results of the Slovak  Republic's foreign policy in 1993.    The Slovak Republic is not able to secure its security  through its own forces. This is why Slovakia began to seek  security guarantees at the very beginning of its establishment.  Slovakia unequivocally sees the guarantee for its own security  in West European security structures, and it seeks the optimal  ways of integrating itself into them.    In the European security system that is being established,  there are several entities of different importance and weight.  NATO is the most efficient security organization in Europe.  The process of the Slovak Republic's rapprochement with NATO is  a long-term process involving many aspects. This process fits  harmoniously into the process of establishing a new European  security system.    The basic steps and measures that are inevitable for the  Slovak Republic's integration into the North Atlantic Alliance  (NAA) are detailed in the Project of the Slovak Republic's  Rapprochement with NATO. A commission comprising members of the  Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry, and Finance Ministry  participated in drafting this project.    NATO and the Western European Union [WEU]    The Slovak Republic regards extending its activities in the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) and participating in  the NATO program for Central and East Europe as the most  important element of its rapprochement with NATO. Slovakia's  efficient engagement in NACC activities have resulted in its  participation in the work of the Political Committee, the  Economic Committee, and an ad hoc peacekeeping group. The  Slovak Republic's charge d'affaires in Brussels has regularly  participated in NACC meetings at an ambassadorial level. At the  end of 1993, Slovakia intensified its contacts with NATO,  particularly with the aim of influencing the final shape of the  Partnership for Peace plan.    In 1993, the parliamentary aspect of cooperation with NATO  intensified. The Slovak Republic, as an observer, began  regularly and actively to participate in North Atlantic Alliance  meetings.    The intensification of the contacts on all of the levels  represents yet more evidence of improving cooperation between  NATO and the Slovak Republic. In the course of 1993, Slovak  Republic representatives at the highest level visited NATO. The  president's and the prime minister's visit to NATO has finally  dispersed worries about our security orientation and its nature.  NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner received the Slovak  deputy prime minister and the foreign minister on the occasion  of the European Community Three meeting with the Visegrad Four  countries.    The contacts of the Slovak Republic's representatives within  the NACC are also universal. Between 8 and 29 March 1993, there  was an NACC meeting at the level of defense ministers. The  participants in the meeting gave their opinions on NACC  activities since the previous meeting of defense ministers;  discussed defense-related problems linked to peacekeeping  operations, which were conducted on the basis of a document  drafted by the NACC ad hoc group; and gave their opinions on the  possibility of further cooperation in the sphere of security.  On 11 June 1993, there was an NACC meeting on the level of  defense ministers in Athens. On 17 July 1993, A. de Francis,  NATO first deputy secretary general, received the Slovak foreign  minister during his visit to Brussels. On 3 December 1993,  there was an NACC meeting on the level of defense ministers in  Brussels.    Several high NATO officials visited the Slovak Republic in  1993. J. Shalikashvili, supreme commander of NATO troops in  Europe, visited Slovakia. In Bratislava, a staff meeting  between the Slovak Defense Ministry and a NATO SHAPE delegation  took place with the aim of evaluating the level of mutual  cooperation and finding ways to improve it. On this basis, the  plan for cooperation between the Slovak Defense Ministry and  NATO SHAPE has been drafted for 1994. From the viewpoint of  searching for the optimal forms of cooperation, the visit to  Slovakia by Dr. E.v.C. Bruce, NATO director of press and  information, was an important event.    In the fall of 1993, W. van Eekelen, the WEU general  secretary, visited the Slovak Republic and met with the  president, the prime minister, and the foreign minister.    The visit of the NAA secretary general to the Slovak  Republic  on 15 November 1993 helped to develop relations between the NAA  and the National Council of the Slovak Republic.    The Slovak Republic, however, still does not have  specialized diplomatic representation in NATO in Brussels. The  task of securing cooperation with NATO and the WEU has been  fulfilled by our mission in Brussels and the Slovak Permanent  Mission at the WEU.    CSCE    The Slovak Republic's course of action during the CSCE  meetings in Vienna in 1993 was based on Resolution 980, approved  by the Slovak Republic Government on 22 December 1992. The  activity and contacts with the U.S. Department of Defense, the  Defense Ministries of Sweden and Italy, and the CSCE general  secretary have helped to efficiently establish the Slovak  Republic within the CSCE. The Slovak Republic's Permanent  Mission in Vienna has considerably contributed to this  establishment.    One of the first tasks of Slovak diplomacy within the CSCE  was to dispel worries about the status of the Hungarian ethnic  minority living in Slovakia. The partition of the former  Czechoslovakia has been used to dramatize the situation. The  mission that visited Slovakia as a new CSCE country in March  1993 confirmed that the Slovak Republic had fulfilled the  obligations it had toward the CSCE and ethnic minorities. The  mission also stated that the transition toward a market economy  and pluralist democracy and respect for human rights were  satisfactory in the Slovak Republic. These processes have not  been discontinued since the partition of Czechoslovakia. The  mission's conclusions have also contributed to lower tension  surrounding the ethnic minorities issue. According to the  mission, there are opportunities for improving the legal status  of the minorities in Slovakia, but, in general, the mission has  not discovered any signs of tensions or hostility between  various ethnic groups.    The mission of the CSCE High Commissioner for Human Rights  has similar results. In the interests of reducing tension in  that sphere, making the situation clear, and building mutual  trust, the Slovak side proposed, on the initiative of the Slovak  prime minister, the establishment of an impartial group of CSCE  experts to examine the status of the Hungarian ethnic minority  in the Slovak Republic and the status of the Slovak ethnic  minority in Hungary, and the overall ethnic policies of the two  countries.    We consider the acceptance of our proposal to establish a  group of experts from other countries as a success for Slovak  diplomacy. This was something new in the CSCE's attitude toward  solving problems related to the status of ethnic minorities and  in the CSCE concept of preventive diplomacy. For the first  time, the CSCE is taking preventive steps in a situation where  there is no open conflict or center of tension.    Our membership in the coordinating CSCE Three and our  participation in important activities, mainly in the sphere of  preventive diplomacy, have helped the Slovak Republic to  establish itself within the CSCE. Our activity in the Three,  consultations on the higher ministerial level, participation in  CSCE missions and in the decisionmaking process, plus our  fulfillment of all of our obligations, helped the Slovak  Republic to obtain its proper position.    We can mention several of the most important activities in  which the Slovak Republic participated as a member of the Three:  the meeting between the Three and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, consultations with the top officials of the Council  of Europe and the United Nations about problems of human  dimensions, the meeting with ZRJ [expansion unknown] officials  in Stockholm on extending the CSCE mandate in former Yugoslavia,  and the ministerial meeting of the CSCE Council on further  improving CSCE activity. Moreover, Slovak diplomats participated  in Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas's mission in  Central Asian and Transcaucasian countries on the level of high  commissioners, and in the intelligence mission in Macedonia  commissioned in connection with Macedonia's admission to the  CSCE.    At meetings of the CSCE Forum for Security Cooperation, the  goal of which was to strengthen cooperation between CSCE member  countries on security and to reduce the risk of new conflicts in  the region, the Slovak Republic has built on the activity of the  former CSFR and has become a coauthor of the proposal to draft  new measures to strengthen trust and security and to harmonize  the obligations adopted on military security in the previous  period, and a coauthor of the joint proposal by 24 countries on  the nonproliferation of arms and the control of their transfer.  The Slovak foreign minister spoke at a plenary meeting of the  CSCE Forum for Security Cooperation in Vienna on 29 September  1993.    One of the most important roles of the Slovak delegation at  the Vienna meetings dealing with the Conventional Forces in  Europe Treaty [CFE] and the Open Skies Treaty was to ensure the  Slovak Republic's successorship as regards both treaties. The  countries that signed the CFE Treaty approved at an  extraordinary conference on 5 February 1993 the division of the  former CSFR's obligations between the two successor countries.  The Slovak Republic's successorship in the Open Skies Treaty,  which creates conditions for building the trust by observing the  military activities of the CSCE countries, was confirmed on the  plenary meeting of the signatories on 3 May 1993.    The Slovak Republic has also participated in the meeting of  the Consultative Committee of the CSCE Center for Preventing  Conflicts, whose importance, however, has significantly declined  with the progress of CSCE institutionalization. The task of the  Forum for Consultations on Security Issues was transferred onto  the newly established Vienna Group of CSCE Committee of High  Commissioners.     "

The meeting discussed and adopted the bill on the  establishment and the functioning of the Supreme Council of  Judges. This bill, consisting of 22 articles, is very important.  It not only ensures the independence of the judiciary but is  also the basis of a law to move toward the establishment and the  functioning of the Constitutional Council of the Kingdom of  Cambodia [KOC]. The state secretariat for relations with  Parliament will submit this bill to the National Assembly for  examination and decision.    2. In accordance with Article 41 of the KOC Constitution,  the cabinet decided to examine the press law at its next meeting  to determine the freedom of the press, freedom of publication,  and the responsibility of organizations or networks  disseminating information to Cambodian listeners. This is to  conform with the country's political situation.    3. The cabinet also discussed the legal procedures relating  to the cabinet and assigned the cabinet office to supervise and  implement this task.    4. The meeting also listened to the report by the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on goals  relating to the consolidation and expansion of international  relations, particularly bilateral relations with countries that  have diplomatic relations with the KOC.    5. The plenary session also listened to the report by the  Ministry of Industry, Energy, and Mines on the progress of oil  exploration and on the restoration and repair of hydropower.  The cabinet examined a number of concrete measures to ensure  proper and firm implementation of the decisions of the cabinet  at its plenary session on 26 January, which set the electricity  rate at 350 riel per kilowatt/hour for general users. Relevant  ministries were requested to consider reducing the rate for  light industry.    6. The cabinet also listened to the report by the Tourism  Ministry relating to a number of principles for developing  tourism.    The cabinet closed its plenary session at 1145 with a lofty  spirit of unanimity and responsibility.    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 10 February 1994     "

""Despite everything, Russia condemns the Molotov-Ribbentrop  pact and the Stalinist oppression,"" Kozyrev said in the  interview.    The Russian foreign minister met today with the Conference  on  Security and Cooperation in Europe High Commissioner for  National Minorities Max van der Stoel to discuss the problems of  ethnic minorities in Estonia and Latvia.    Stoel voiced the opinion that there are many problems in the  framework of the ethnic issue which are waiting to be solved.  ""On the one hand, the preservation of those states' national  character needs to be safeguarded; on the other, the future of  the Russians living there must be secured on an equal footing,""  the CSCE high commissioner maintained.    Speaking about the alleged human rights violations in  Estonia  and Latvia, Stoel admitted that ""neither torturing nor  deportation of members of ethnic minorities occurs there.""    Yet, he said, both countries have serious problems  pertaining  to the legal status of the Russian-speaking population. ""I  drafted numerous recommendations to remedy the matter and I hope  they will be accepted,"" Stoel said.    Kozyrev said Russia expects the Baltic Sea countries to  establish the post of a regional national minorities  commissioner.    The Russian foreign minister said that the troop withdrawal  negotiations with Estonia and Latvia have reached the final  stage. All issues, including that of social protection for  Russian military pensioners, have been resolved, he claimed.  ""The package of agreements will be signed after discussion in  the Estonian and the Latvian parliaments and approval by those  countries' heads of state,"" was Kozyrev's opinion.    Kozyrev emphasized that Russia managed to coordinate the  troop withdrawal with Lithuania and Latvia ""in a civilized  manner, on a contractual basis."" The signing of a similar  agreement with Estonia now depends on that Baltic nation, he  said. In Kozyrev's view, this will help ""Russia's friends in  the West"" to focus attention on the protection of human rights  in Estonia and Latvia.    Russia withdrew its troops from Lithuania by September 1993.  To date, also a troop pullout agreement with Latvia has been  initialed. The problem of the status of Russian military  pensioners remains the stumbling-block at the Estonian-Russian  talks.     "

He stated that the importance of Turkey's constructive  role in the region was once more confirmed at the Davos meeting.    Demirel was received at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by  Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand National  Assembly; General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff; Murat  Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime minister; State  Minister Necmettin Cevheri; Interior Minister Nahit Mentese;  Presidential Secretary Necdet Seckinoz and other officials.    In an airport statement, Demirel said that world economic  and  political problems were discussed at the Davos meeting, adding  that within this framework he found the opportunity to explain  Turkey's approach to international problems. Demirel noted that  the Economic Cooperation Organization, the developments in the  Central Asian republics, and Turkey's relations with the  European Union were discussed in detail at the Davos meeting.  He stated that Turkey is a very important country in its region  and continued:    [Begin Demirel recording] Turkey, actually, is a singularly  significant country as a result of its relations with Central  Asia, Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the  Arabian peninsula following the positive results of the Middle  East peace conference. Turkey, in other words, is a very  significant bridge in a region extending from west to east, that  is from Europe to China. I found the opportunity to explain this  view. I hope that in the near future Turkey will become a  significant energy terminal by transporting and selling the gas  and oil reserves of Central Asia, namely Turkmenistan,  Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, to the world. This is one of the  most significant issues on the world's agenda. [end recording]    Demirel stated that there is interest in Turkey's  constructive role in the region as well as in the bilateral and  multilateral relations it is cultivating.    Demirel said that he will find the opportunity to discuss  the  Middle East peace process and possibilities for regional  cooperation with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak who will be  arriving on an official visit in Turkey tomorrow. Noting that  the Bulgarian president will also be visiting Turkey in the  coming months, Demirel said that steps to be taken to realize  the East-West highway that will transit through Bulgaria,  Macedonia, and Albania will be discussed during this visit.

In its policy on industrial development, the Lao government  has attached great importance to the expansion of hydro-power  plants. With its own input combined with assistance and loans  from friendly countries and international financial  institutions, the Lao government has in the past years tried to  exploit this potential. This has also provided opportunities for  investors to participate in various forms, such as joint  ventures, build-operate-transfer projects and so on.    One example is the construction of a hydro-power plant at  Seset in the southern province of Saravane. The Seset plant came  on line a few years ago and has a generation capacity of 45  megawatts, more than enough for domestic consumption in the  whole south of the country. The Seset power plant is the second  largest in the country, second only to the Nam Ngum Power Supply.    Last month, the state-run electricity company, Electricity  du  Laos, signed a contract with a French company, SOGREAH, for a  survey to be conducted at Nam Leuk. In the same month, the  Committee for Planning and Cooperation signed a memorandum of  understanding with Thai company MDX Public Co., Ltd. on the  development of the Nam Ngum Three Hydro-Power Project. The Nam  Leuk water flows into Nam Sang and Nam Ngum, while the Nam Ngum  Three project is located at the junction of Nam Ngum and Nam Ma.    The local electricity company has received a loan for the  Nam  Leuk project from the Asian Development Bank. Estimated cost of  the project is U.S. $90 million. The project is expected to  produce 40 megawatts of power.    As provided in memorandum of agreement for the Nam Ngum  Three  project, the Thai company will conduct a survey at a cost of  U.S. $1 million. Once completed, the project will be capable of  producing 400 megawatts of power. In this venture the Lao side  will hold a share of 45 percent with the balance held by the  Thai company.    Laos earns 800 million baht (U.S. $32 million) a year by  selling electricity from its Nam Ngum power supply to Thailand.  Revenue from the export of electricity represents the second  largest source of foreign exchange for the country.     "

The only person with whom contact has not been made is Major  Van Baal, who left to take leave 10 days ago in Sarajevo,  against UN advice.    Development Cooperation Minister Pronk made an appeal on the  radio this morning [20 April] for the West to send more ground  troops to Bosnia. According to Pronk, the Serbs must be  convinced by the reinforcement of the international peacekeeping  force that the international community is ""serious.""    Since the UN troops have only a peacekeeping mission, air  strikes are only allowed if UN troops are directly endangered.  Neither the Air Force nor the ground troops, who are in the  UN's service, have a mandate to impose peace. Moreover, they  operate only with the consent of the belligerents in Bosnia.    Within NATO, there have been hurried consultations to decide  whether NATO aircraft can also be put into action if the  populations of the ""safe areas"" are directly endangered, as was  the case in Goradze. The Security Council has never given a  mandate for ground actions. Ground troops must indeed protect  the population of the ""safe areas"" and provide assistance for  the passage of humanitarian transport.    Pronk's statements are causing increasing irritation at the  Defense Ministry and some high-level military officials fear  that the military and political opinions of the development  cooperation minister could cause confusion among the Netherlands  military regarding Netherlands policy. [Defense] Minister Relus  Ter Beek has repeatedly said that the Netherlands could not  deliver more ground troops since there are not enough  sufficiently trained career military personnel.    Ter Beek let it be known to those around him that Pronk was  speaking for himself and was not giving the government view.  The safety of the Netherlands troops has not been endangered  through actions taken in recent days, the Defense Ministry said.  At noon Friday, the Second Chamber will talk with the defense  and foreign ministers about the new situation in Bosnia. A  majority of the Chamber wants the Netherlands to make  politically active efforts in order to curb Serbian violence in  Bosnia. The parliamentarians initially wanted an emergency  debate but now they will settle for a statement.     "

The agreement includes  the exchange of teachers, researchers, and students between  universities and institutes of the two countries, to expedite  the training process in the areas of greatest scientific  interest.    The Cuban mission, which was made up of Higher Education  Minister Fernando Vecino Alegret, Higher Education Vice Minister  Miguel Garrido, International Relations Director Fernando Rojas  Avallos, and Matanzas University Rector Angel Vega, visited  several Brazilian universities in the Brasilia Federal District,  and in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao  Paulo, to identify areas and possibilities for cooperation.    In the state of Sao Paulo, the mission's visit was  coordinated by Roberto Muller Filho, secretary of science,  technology, and economic development. Muller accepted the entry  of 10 Cuban scientists as visiting professors to carry out  research at the University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo State  University (UNESP), and Campinas State University (Unicamp).  The agreement also includes scholarships for Cuban students in  Sao Paulo universities for masters degrees and Ph.D.'s, as well  as for Brazilian professors from Sao Paulo agricultural  technical schools to be trained in Cuba.    The main areas of knowledge for exchange are: molecular  biology, civil construction materials, immunology, agriculture  and livestock, health, education, physics, genetics, biology,  energy, and biotechnology. Vecino said: ""The main purpose of  the scientific exchange with Brazil is to strengthen the  postgraduate studies of Cuban professors.""    He explained that Cuba has 46 universities with 24,000  professors, of whom only 20 percent have doctorates. He added:  ""The goal is that at least 50 percent of that amount get their  doctorates.""    The Sao Paulo Science and Technology Secretariat will  provide  additional funds, along with the Sao Paulo Federation to Support  Research (Fapesp), to finance the scholarships for the  researchers and postgraduate students. Muller reported that the  program will start with the arrival of 10 Cuban scientists to  carry out joint research, who will get about $1,500 per month.    Cuban Minister Vecino also visited the Sao Paulo State  Federation of Industries (FIESP) to evaluate the possibility of  the transfer of business technology through associations.    As a result of the visit to the FIESP, a business delegation  will visit Cuba in the first half of this year to identify the  areas of interest.     "

Mr.  Besharati announced the agenda of the talks as being the  expansion of security, military, political, and parliamentary  cooperation between the two countries.    The interior minister's visit to Turkey is within the  framework of the visits that have taken place during the recent  decade of ties between the two countries. The heads of the two  countries' executive authorities exchange visits to Tehran and  Ankara regularly in order to study the possibilities for  expanding political and economic relations. The last such visit  was First Vice President Hasan Habibi's trip to Ankara in  December of 1993, and President Suleyman Demirel is to visit  Tehran in the near future.    Iran and Turkey are the founding members of the Economic  Cooperation Organization, ECO, and are regarded as active  members of the Islamic Conference Organization vis-a-vis the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. Tehran and Ankara cooperate in  technical, economic, and transportation fields as well as on  regional issues. The volume of trade between the two countries  was about $600 million last year, and the amount of goods  transported from Turkish ports to Iran reached a figure of  200,000 tonnes. At the same time, security and military  cooperation to establish order and tranquility along the borders  is considered one of the important aspects of the two countries'  relations.    Iran and Turkey share a common border of 511 km. Two years  ago, a joint security committee was set up to prevent  infiltration of elements that threaten the two countries'  security. On the basis of the agreements reached, the two  countries will not permit any illegal activity on their  territory that threatens the other country's security. At  present, the interior ministers of Iran and Turkey; officials of  the security cooperation committee; the border provinces'  governors general; and the governors, military, and security  officers stationed along the two countries' borders are in  direct contact. These initiatives on the whole and the existing  mutual goodwill is assisting the two countries in their war  against terrorism and drug trafficking. It is hoped that in the  wake of Mr. Besharati's visit to Ankara, further steps will be  taken to continue and expand cooperation.     "

Finance Minister Lin Chen-kuo, who will represent Taiwan in  the March 18-19 meeting in Hawaii, will also ask Southeast Asian  nations to allow Taiwan banks to set up branches in order to  provide better financial services to Taiwan-invested firms  there, the official said.    Taiwan businessmen have invested more than US$15 billion in  Southeast Asian nations during the past few years but many  investors have complained about difficulties in getting  financing there. Most Southeast Asian nations impose strict  restrictions on the opening of foreign bank branches.    Lin will also discuss the signing of bilateral tax exemption  agreements with his counterparts from Malaysia, Thailand,  Indonesia and the Philippines, the official said. Taiwan has  signed an agreement with Singapore to avoid double taxation on  investors from either side. Its negotiations with other  Southeast Asian nations for similar accords have, however, been  stalled for various reasons. Lin will try to mend differences  with those nations over the tax issues during the upcoming APEC  ministerial-level meeting, the official said.    APEC groups the United States, Canada, Japan, Singapore,  Malaysia, The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Taiwan,  Mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand,  Mexico and Papua New Guinea.    The Ministry of Finance has proposed three issues --  economic  growth strategy, external financing and capital market  development -- for Lin and other Taiwan delegates to raise in  the first-ever APEC finance ministers meeting, the official said.    He added that eight APEC members have expressed intentions  to  hold bilateral talks with Taiwan during the meeting. The United  States hopes to discuss problems concerning commodity taxes on  imported compact cars and other goods; The Philippines wants  Taiwan to reduce tariffs on coconut and palm oil; and South  Korea, Japan, Canada and Indonesia will discuss Taiwan's dumping  charges against them.    At the end of their meeting, APEC finance ministers are  expected to issue a ""declaration"" or ""joint statement"" pledging  to promote regional economic prosperity through free capital  flows and financial cooperation, the official said.    Vice finance ministers from all APEC members are currently  meeting in Hawaii to work out a full agenda for the  ministerial-level meeting.     "

It is reported that according to new aid agreements it  signed  last year with 61 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and  the South Pacific, China will implement 272 economic and  technical aid projects in 72 [as received] recipient nations, of  which 77 are turnkey projects, 113 are technical cooperation  projects and cooperation projects of other types, and 82 are  preconstruction projects. All of these projects have been  proceeding satisfactorily.    To meet the economic restructuring and development plans of  recipient nations, China will open wholly foreign-owned and  jointly owned enterprises as well as leasing firms in foreign  countries through economic and technical assistance channels.  Forty-five such projects were explored and discussed with 24  recipient nations last year, resulting in the signing of 12  agreements between enterprises on both sides. China also  offered over 50 aid programs for general goods and materials to  41 countries to help them solve production problems, meet  certain needs for their people's livelihood, and overcome  difficulties caused by natural disasters.    In cooperation with UN development agencies, China actively  participated in technical cooperation projects among developing  countries in 1993, offering a host of wide-ranging aid programs.  Among them were 23 China-sponsored short-term practical  technical training courses in food, aquaculture, agricultural  machinery, and small hydropower, in which more than 230  technicians from 46 developing countries were trained.    It has been learned that, in the future, while continuing  its  efforts to extend economic and technical assistance to foreign  countries, China will undergo reforms in foreign aid work,  primarily the following: focus on projects that help recipient  nations develop small and medium-sized production units with  local demands and resources and that train personnel; in  promoting direct cooperation between PRC enterprises and those  of recipient nations, help them develop their national economies  while integrating bilateral and multilateral economic and trade  ties and promoting better cooperation between governments; and  further perfect foreign-aid administration that emphasizes  standardized and scientific management.

To the  South!: Russia's Involvement in the Partnership for Peace Could  Critically Destabilize the Situation on its Southern Flanks""]    [Text] It would be utterly unproductive in an  examination of the Partnership for Peace program and the  prospects of Russia's participation in it to address it  alone--the texts of the Invitation, the Framework Agreement, and  Organization and Procedures. Much should be derived from a  consideration of the contexts of this program  also--geopolitical, military-strategic, economic, and others. In  addition, it is impermissible to ignore also the fact that the  states of the post-Soviet South--of the Transcaucasus and  Central Asia--would be drawn into the orbit of NATO's influence  also. And the situation in this ""soft underbelly"" of Russia will  largely determine the future of both the global South and of  Russia itself.    Russia--Missing Link in the Global Military-Political  Alliance of the North    The consistent and successful realization of NATO's  Partnership for Peace would impart a finished nature to the  North-South global opposition. The membership of the Atlantic  structures of Russia and also all the other components of the  former great Eurasian state--the Soviet Union--would signify the  emergence of a global military-political bloc of states of the  North (the northern hemisphere).    The North's line of contact with the South, this global zone  of instability, does not run along the Equator, of course. For  the United States, Canada, and Mexico it is the narrow isthmus  of Panama. North America is protected from Asia and Africa with  their vast South by two oceans. For West Europe this boundary is  the Mediterranean. There are some remnants of the South in the  former Yugoslavia still, it is true, but they could soon be  wiped out.    In other words, this part of the North is protected against  the destabilizing factors of the South by natural barriers. This  North is doing and will continue to do everything possible to  bar to states of the South as far as possible, if not in full,  access to weapons of mass destruction, primarily nuclear, and to  their delivery systems capable of delivering these weapons to  the North. The examples of the pressure on Iraq, Iran, Libya,  Syria, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are typical in this  respect. The North even looks askance at Israel.    But with Russia things are considerably more complicated.  Russia is in direct, immediate contact with the South. So  immediate that it is not always clear where Russia ends and  where this notorious South begins. According to one version  (""each for himself""), Russia borders the post-Soviet South--the  Transcaucasus and Central Asia, that is, zones of extremely high  conflict potential. It is sufficient to recall the  Abkhaz-Georgian, Karabakh, and Tajik conflicts and a mass of  others--of a lesser scale or occurring in latent fashion.    In the other version (""Russia as an integral part of the CIS  with vital interests in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia"")  Russia--both directly and indirectly--is in contact with another  conflict-potential zone, which is to no less an extent rich in  factors of instability: the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Kurdish  problem (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria), the Afghan problem (the  civil war in Afghanistan and this state's practical  disintegration), the Pakistani-Indian contradictions (the  problem of Jammu and Kashmir), Uighur separatism (China's  Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous District), and so forth.    Russia--Pacifier of the South?    Let us assume that Russia has subscribed to the Partnership  and/or has actively begun to participate in NATO actions in some  other form. All questions would then confront it in entirely  particular fashion, if Russia is in contact with the South,  being part of the global military-political alliance of the  northern hemisphere (the North). Historical circumstances  themselves would impose on Russia the role of gendarme covering  the global North on one of its ""burning"" flanks and locking onto  itself many most acute problems of North-South relations on a  world scale.    Why would Russia involuntarily find itself in this role? I  see at least three reasons here.    First, peacemaking operations or, in NATO terminology,  ""peacekeeping operations"" are envisaged by both the plans of  NATO and the NACC (North Atlantic Cooperation Council) and the  content of the Partnership for Peace program itself (clause 3-D  of the Framework Agreement). The actual force capable of  undertaking broad-based peacemaking operations on the territory  of the CIS and in the entire post-Soviet space is the Russian  Army. Evidence of this is the correlation of the participants  and the degree of their assertiveness in the CIS Collective  Peacemaking Force in Tajikistan.    Second, ""peacekeeping operations"" are at this moment the  priority direction in NATO activity, virtually. We would recall  Somalia, Bosnia, and even Egypt (the participation of NATO  consultants in the organization of the struggle against Islamic  fundamentalists in this country). A special zone of NATO  interests in this respect, incidentally, is the Caucasus region  (see, in particular, clause 03 of the section ""Questions of  Policy and Security."" Supplement to ""Curriculum of the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council for Dialogue, Partnership, and  Cooperation in 1994""). The same applies also to post-Soviet  Central Asia, the ""projection"" of stability onto which is,  according to a statement of Manfred Woerner, general secretary  of NATO, a principal function of the North Atlantic alliance. A  number of NATO ""peacekeeping operations"" have shown the  direction in which the tactics of such operations are evolving,  these contemplating the active enlistment in direct combat  operations of the peacekeeping subunits and covering units.    Third, Russia would very much like to take part in  peacemaking operations on the territory of the CIS. One has the  impression that certain influential Russian politicians and  military figures, not without peasant cunning, see such activity  as a convenient form of the restoration of Russian influence in  ""zones of Russia's vital interests."" If they are lucky, what is  more, with these operations being funded and a mandate for them  being granted by any party--the United Nations, the CSCE, the  CIS... and NATO?    Fourth, the talk about the danger of ""Islamic  fundamentalism""  (P. Grachev and A. Kozyrev and B. Yeltsin have already spoken  about it in the appropriate manner) puts us on our guard. A  number of influential Russian politicians and military personnel  are prepared, it would seem, to turn Russia into a kind of  barrier against so-called ""Islamic fundamentalism,"" moving up to  the forward lines of contact with it.    How To Destroy Russia    Were this conjecture to be realized, Russia's future would  seem utterly bleak. On its ""southern"" flank Russia (like the CIS  as a whole) is exceptionally vulnerable. A border, which is  designed to perform a protective function, with the new  independent states of the post-Soviet South (in the regions of  the Caucasus and Central Asia) is lacking; in a number of  sectors the external border of the CIS here is eroded and  penetrable (to a varying extent) in both directions (the  Iranian-Azerbaijani, Afghanistan-Uzbekistan, Afghanistan-Tajik,  and other sectors).    Russia could find itself--voluntarily or involuntarily, for  reasons, at times, not even susceptible to predictions based on  the logic of common sense--pulled into a number of conflicts.  Primarily the Tajik, Abkhaz, South Ossetian, or Karabakh, which  are now ""habitual."" It is difficult for Russia even now in its  attempts to extinguish these centers of military danger situated  in direct proximity to its borders. But the difficulties could  grow many times over were Russia to operate under the aegis of  NATO or within the framework of NATO programs. We can imagine  the frustration of the leadership of Georgia and Azerbaijan,  which, endeavoring to protect themselves against Russian  peacemaking, had hastened to sign the ""framework agreement"" (in  March and May of this year respectively) and which, as a result,  could get those same Russian troops as peacemakers. Whatever the  case, Russia would not, in any event, manage to preserve a  normal relationship with all the parties to the conflicts on the  territory of the post-Soviet South, and the resistance to it of  some parties would be assured.    A particular danger of the situation for Russia is the fact  that there is no clear-cut border between the non-Russian South  within the framework of the CIS and the purely Russian South. It  is sufficient to recall here the North Caucasus (that is,  Russian!) operational formations--from subunits of the  Confederation of Peoples of the Caucasus through the  Cossacks--that participated (are participating) actively in the  Transcaucasus conflicts: Karabakh, South Ossetian, Abkhaz. It is  hard to foresee the details and the routes by which the  conflagration of the conflicts being ""pacified"" could spread.  But some directions are easily defined: the zones of the spread  of Islam and of the settlement of Turkic peoples on the  territory of Russia.    What the response of the states of the traditional South to  the globalization of NATO and the conversion of the border of  the CIS or a part thereof into the NATO border would be is a  special and very difficult question. For Iraq, Iran, and Syria  border Turkey--a NATO member. Desert Storm (1991), on the other  hand, demonstrated together with many other things, it is true,  a readiness for cooperation even on the part of sworn enemies (I  would recall the coordinated crossing to Iranian territory of  Iraqi aircraft to preserve them from American strikes). But  Russia, were it to find itself NATO's southern flank, would have  to assume assignments pertaining to elimination of the nuclear  missile programs in such countries as Iran, Iraq, India,  Pakistan, and Syria for the realization of one further NATO  goal--blocking these countries' missile programs for protection  against missile attacks against the forward and expeditionary  units of NATO and its allies.    Opposition to so-called ""Islamic fundamentalism"" as a  strategic goal, Russia's conversion into an outpost of this  struggle--all this would necessarily evoke and exacerbate  hostility between Russia and, at a minimum, Iran (it is usually  seen as the source of ""Islamic fundamentalism"") and, possibly,  Afghanistan, Pakistan, and more distant Near and Middle East  neighbors also.    Nor can Russia's involvement as a ""peacemaker"" in conflicts  that the world community imposes on itself and that blaze or  merely flare up in direct proximity to Russia's borders be ruled  out. The Kurdish problem is already making itself felt quite  nearby--on the Turkish-Armenian border. Iranian-Arab  contradictions are not completely settled. There is no certainty  that it will be possible to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict  conclusively and to general satisfaction. Afghanistan, for many  of whose inhabitants war has become a way of life, demands  pacification. The Pakistani-Indian disputes over Jammu and  Kashmir are not subsiding. Chinese Xinjiang is beginning to boil  over. The list could easily be continued.    Thus in the event of Russia's aggressive participation in  NATO activity, it would face the threat of involvement in a  whole series of conflicts in the South. Some of them would  detonate in Russia itself. The time would come for ""peacemaking  operations"" in Russia. The very existence of the Russian state  could be in jeopardy. The ""last push"" to the South beneath the  NATO pennant could be for Russia the last in its history  altogether.     "

Swords-to-plowshares, tanks-to-toys planning among Israeli defense industries  mirrors a process under way in the United States, where major contractors are  diversifying and cutting back labor forces in response to reduced military  spending.    In Israel, the success of the adjustment will go a long way to setting the pace  for the country's economic growth in this decade. State and privately owned  arms industries in Israel account for one-quarter of the country's industrial  output. Exports average about $1 billion a year to customers that include the  United States, Canada and Western European nations, as well as Third World  clients as far-flung as Singapore and Guatemala.    Because exports help bankroll the country's domestic industry, a slowdown in  that sector could also affect Israel's relative self-sufficiency in arms.    ""You have to follow the market,"" said Phil Herman, a spokesman for Israel  Aircraft Industries, the country's largest military contractor. ""With the  decrease in defense budgets, the military-industrial complex will be looking  for other missions to accomplish.""    In its battle against chronic inflation, the government has shaved military  spending during the past several years, and there are calls for deeper cuts.  Michael Bruno, governor of the Bank of Israel, recently called for cuts of at  least $150 million a year from the defense budget.    His call, which set off a storm of debate, was based in part on reports that  Syria, considered Israel's most aggressive adversary, is reducing its defense  spending. The Soviet Union is reported to have told Syria that Moscow would no  longer bankroll Syria's effort to reach arms equality with Israel.    Israel's defense ministry is resisting cutbacks, arguing that the nation can  ill afford the risk of reduced levels of equipment and manpower.    ""There are still many people in the defense establishment who believe that even  if peace is some day achieved, Israel's security situation will still be  regarded with the utmost gravity, and Israel will have to maintain its  vigilance,"" a ministry official told Israeli reporters.    Defense officials note that the struggle to put down the Arab uprising in the  occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank has also cut into outlays for equipment  designed for the defense of Israel's borders. Last year, the army spent about  $200 million on everything from bullets to new jails to battle the intifada, as  the Arab revolt is known. The expenditures were only partially made up for with  extra money from the treasury.    ""The intifada has definitely cut into acquisition of new equipment,"" said  Shalom Eitan, a spokesman for Tadiran, the third-largest private industrial  firm.    Most Israeli defense firms have the advantage of already producing consumer  goods. Tadiran, for instance, makes a variety of appliances, including  refrigerators and microwave ovens.    ""At least, Israeli companies won't be starting from scratch,"" commented Zeev  Eytan, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, a defense think  tank.    But the end of the Cold War is compelling changes at a faster pace than  expected.    ""No one knew that the Berlin Wall would fall so fast. Our plan, which had been  to move into civilian fields, is going to go faster than anticipated,""  Tadiran's Eitan predicted.    Tadiran began to sense the shifting mood during the final years of the Reagan  Administration when arms agreements showed the way to reduced superpower  tensions, Eitan said. The winding down of the war in Afghanistan and the  Iran-Iraq conflict were further signposts on the road to a new era.    Within Israel, budget cuts began to take hold three years ago, and Tadiran  began a difficult process of cutting its work force to 10,000 from 14,500. Its  current balance of military and civilian production, mainly in communications,  is 50-50. The company plans to move toward a 70%-30% mix in favor of civilian  sales, Eitan said.    Israel Aircraft is also beginning to market goods originally designed for the  military for civilian use.    ""The only difference between military and civilian uses, in many cases, is that  the military product goes boom,"" spokesman Herman quipped.    For example, a pilotless airplane that was built for military reconnaissance is  now being advertised for use in televised monitoring of forest fires, oil  spills and even drug dealers carrying contraband across remote frontiers.    An exception to the trend at Israel Aircraft is its continuing effort to  develop a fighter jet. The company suffered a grave setback two years ago when  its Lavi fighter was canceled after it became clear that the Israeli government  could not afford to pay for development and that Washington, Israel's biggest  aid giver, was not interested in footing the bill. The company laid off about  6,000 of its 22,000 workers and lost tens of millions of dollars.    The new jet under study at Israel Aircraft is a more economical model. Company  officials deny that it is meant to make up for the Lavi cancellation.    ""We are in the airplane business, and so we must look ahead. If we find a  customer for it, good,"" Herman said.    A cheaper fighter jet would seem ready-made for the regional conflicts that  still flourish outside the fading superpower rivalry.    ""We can see just in the example of Panama that small conflicts and  low-intensity warfare are still around,"" Herman said.    The United States is Israel's biggest customer for military goods, with sales  estimated at $150 million, according to the Jaffee Center for Strategic  Studies. Among other top customers are Spain, which buys tank guns, tank fire  control systems and range finders; Chile (tanks and air-to-air missiles);  Brazil (surface-to-surface missiles); Colombia (transport planes and there are  reports of combat planes on order); Ecuador (air-to-air missiles, combat  planes) and South Africa (patrol boats, refueling aircraft, surface-to-surface  missiles and rifles).    Small customers are Haiti (Uzi submachine guns) and Zaire (small arms), and  Israel's government has reportedly embarked on efforts to expand sales to Third  World countries engaged in hostilities. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin recently  hinted that sales to Iran, which is recovering from its costly war with Iraq,  are under consideration. But Muslim Iran considers purchases from the Jewish  state taboo.    Press reports indicate that Israel's recently renewed diplomatic ties with  Ethiopia include supplies of arms to that country, which is trying to put down  a tenacious revolt by separatists.

Heavy clashes have been reported since December inside  of Burma, opposite the Thai border at Chiang Mai and Mae Hong  Son.    The sound of gunfire was not heard over the new year  holiday.  The Burmese Government, however, has reportedly sent more troops  to crush the international drug kingpin's army and cut off the  huge income he earns each year from his opium crops and the  export of heroin.    About 20 heroin refineries are believed to exist in that  part  of the Golden Triangle in Burma that is under the control of  Khun Sa, who is said to command an army of over 6,000 troops.  If the Burmese junta cannot stop Khun Sa's expansion, the world  faces a bigger danger from drug addiction.    The world looks upon Thailand as a transit route for opium  and heroin smuggled out of the Golden Triangle for distribution  worldwide. Thailand has never been able to stop the flow of  drugs completely, no matter how tough its prevention and  suppression measures are.    The vice chairman of China's Narcotics Suppression  Commission  once said that, only a few years after the country opened up in  1976, it began to encounter several problems related to  narcotics--especially heroin--flowing out of the Golden Triangle  and the Economic Quadrangle to its north.    China seized 900 kg of heroin in 1991, but in 1992 it seized  a total of 4,200 kg of heroin. Most of the arrests were made in  Yunnan. Heroin is therefore one of the most worrisome problems  China now faces.    It can be assumed that without effective measures by both  Thailand and China to stop production at its source--and halt  the flow of narcotics from the Golden Triangle and the Economic  Quadrangle in Burma before they reach international  markets--narcotic drugs will surely continue to flood world  markets.    We cannot rely entirely on the capabilities of the Burmese  soldiers to suppress Khun Sa's army and provide the only hope  for preventing people around the world from becoming slaves to  drug addiction. It is the duty of Burma's neighbors--Thailand,  Laos, and China--to cooperate closely in their efforts and  seriously prevent and suppress the trafficking of all types of  narcotic drugs.     "

The weekly FINANCIAL GAZETTE, an  independent newspaper in Harare, reports that the Zimbabwean  business community has been extensively infiltrated by about 600  criminals linked to the CCB.    The paper said that a crime syndicate, also linked to the  Blue-Light Gang, was responsible for the exportation from SA  [South Africa] to Zimbabwe of more than 600 stolen vehicles.  The proceeds of the sales of the cars are believed to have been  used to buy drugs which were then sold to finance the SADF's  [South African Defense Force] covert military intelligence  operations.    SA military intelligence was responsible for setting up the  CCB. According to the paper the SA criminal syndicate was  uncovered by the Zimbabwean security in early 1992. In June  1993 Kaarman Noortman, whose aliases include Malcolm Anthony  Cheney and Jack Cheney and who was allegedly wanted at the time  by the SAP [South African Police], was arrested. It quotes SA  records revealing that Noortman was a member of the stolen  vehicle division at John Vorster square until 1985, and that in  1993 he was wanted by the division for car theft and fraud. In  July of the same year Noortman was handed over to SA immigration  officials at Beit Bridge but according to the GAZETTE was  ""inexplicably let loose"".    Intelligence sources also link Noortman to Frederick Alex  Harding, regarded as the Blue Light Gang's Godfather and the  CCB's operational chief in Zimbabwe until he was arrested and  deported two years ago. It said that Harding, 50, was  interviewed by the ANC [African National Congress] last year  shortly after he had allegedly admitted that he had been  recruited by a SA government agency to carry out dirty tricks in  neighbouring countries.    Harding is also alleged to have admitted that he had headed  a  car and drug-trafficking ring in the 1980s whose task was to  procure funds for military intelligence-linked operations.    SAP Media Liaison officer Colonel B.S.I. Van Rooyen  confirmed  to CITY PRESS that Noortman was an SAP member, and was  re-arrested shortly after being freed at Beit Bridge.    Although Zimbabwean sources suspect Noortman of being in  Harare, Major Van Rooyen told CITY PRESS that Noortman was  currently awaiting trial at the Pretoria Central Prison.     "

Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup and his Estonian  counterpart Indrek Kannik signed the treaty today.    The framework agreement outlines the principles of  cooperation between the Estonian and the Danish Defense  Ministries and military structures as well as the relations  between military and civilian authorities, foresees  establishment of civilian control over military structures, and  provides for exchange of information and consultations on  peacekeeping issues and military budgeting, as well as for  environmental cooperation to eliminate damage to nature caused  by the military. The agreement allows the two countries to  conclude additional bilateral agreements on military cooperation.    Kannik noted at the press conference after the signing that  this is Estonia's first treaty on defense cooperation.    The Danish defense minister stated that his country attaches  great importance to the treaty in the hope that it ""becomes a  vital step on Estonia's road to NATO membership.""    Haekkerup met during his visit with Prime Minister Mart  Laar,  Kannik, Foreign Minister Juri Luik, Parliament Speaker Ulo  Nugis, and members of the parliamentary National Defense  Commission.    The meetings covered a wide range of issues including the  development of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and Denmark's  assistance in it, as well as Estonian-Russian relations and the  situation in Europe.    Haekkerup said at the press conference that the matter at  issue at present is, not the threat of Russia's military  aggression, but its political power. ""We stick to our position  that Russian troops must leave Estonia,"" the Danish defense  minister said. ""Their presence in Kaliningrad is another matter,  since that territory belongs to the sovereign Russia, although I  think Russia has at present more troops stationed there than  necessary for the defense of the region.""    Kannik said the Danish defense minister affirmed his  negative  attitude toward Russia's concept of the ""near abroad"" and  whatever division of spheres of influence in Europe.    ""Denmark has done its utmost for Estonia, and Estonia is  very  grateful to Denmark for its support,"" the Estonian defense  minister said.    Haekkerup yesterday presented the Estonian Defense Forces  with an inspection cutter donated by the Danish Royal Navy.    Today, the Danish defense minister delivered a speech on the  subject of ""Denmark, Estonia and European security"" at the  Foreign Ministry.    Haekkerup leaves Estonia in the afternoon.     "

This was announced by Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State  Planning Commission, here on Tuesday [12 April].    He was addressing 500 American business leaders attending  the  China-U.S. Trade and Investment Conference, organized by the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec).    The plan envisions an average 9 percent annual growth rate  for the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the 1990s. And  GDP growth will continue to be on the fast track through the  first decade of the next century.    According to the plan, China will build 1,000 kilometres of  new railways and 3,500 to 4,000 kilometres of highways each year  in the future.    Also, about 14 million new lines for digital phones will be  needed each year to expand phone service.    Ye said China will augment its handling capacity in ports by  300 million to 400 million tons over the next 15 years. The  ports will mainly handle oil and other cargo.    A number of large open-pit coal mines will be built to  increase the country's annual coal production output by 30  million to 35 million tons each year.    And the nation's steel output is expected to surpass 100  million tons by 2000. To achieve that goal, China has to  renovate its existing 10 major steel works, while setting up  some new manufacturing bases.    Ye said China is gradually opening its onshore oilfields to  foreign explorers and developers. The offshore oilfields have  already been opened.    Analysts said that China is picking up momentum in  developing  its onshore oil in the country's vast West to offset the  dwindling output of the old fields in the Northeast and East.    By 2010, the country's oil-refining capacity is expected to  be almost double the 1993 level of 160 million tons.    Ye revealed that China will also give priority to developing  the machinery, automotive, petrochemical and construction  industries.    In the machinery sector, Ye said priority will be given to  developing basic components, power generation equipment,  electronic communication systems, computers and aircraft for  major and spur flights.    ""The market for automobiles will be huge,"" Ye added, noting  that the government's strategy is to enable ordinary families to  own cars in the coming years.     "

Exposure Duration         As mentioned previously, EPA originally proposed a program   that included six separate tests for the evaluation of the   endpoints of concern. Because of cost considerations, a minimum   six-week (42-day) exposure period was proposed in the NPRM,   instead of the traditional 90-day test. EPA requested comments   on the adequacy of the proposed exposure period and exposure   regimen, and on the possibility of extending these tests to 90   days for comparability to historical data. Comments were also   requested on the possible use of an alternative approach for the   testing program, the Screening Information Data Set (SIDS)   protocol developed for use by the Organization for Economic   Cooperation and Development (OECD). The standard SIDS protocol   is designed as a single-study screen (45-day) for repeat dose,   reproductive, and developmental effects.     Public comments from industry supported the 90-day test over   either the proposed 42-day test or the SIDS protocol. Commenters   expressed concern regarding both of these protocols because   relatively less scientific experience and historical comparison   data are available for these shorter test scenarios. Upon   reconsideration, EPA agrees that the 90-day protocol is more   suitable and more cost effective than either of the alternatives   proposed in the NPRM for purposes of the F/FA registration   program. EPA recognizes that the shorter tests might miss some   adverse health effects that might be identified with the 90-day   exposure. Apart from the study duration, the SIDS protocol   includes somewhat less information for each endpoint, in   comparison with the selected 90-day subchronic inhalation study,   with relatively small savings in time and cost. For example, the   SIDS protocol includes a fertility screen (i.e., one-generation   reproductive study), but does not include an examination of the   fetus for teratogenic effects.     Thus, today's final rule requires F/FA manufacturers to use   the more standard 90-day subchronic inhalation protocol for the   evaluation of health effects, with an exposure regimen of at   least six hours per day, five days per week. EPA judges the   exposure regimen of five days per week for the 90-day protocol to   be the minimum acceptable exposure period for the purposes of the   Tier 2 evaluation. Also, the 90-day protocol provides a broad   and efficient testing approach that allows the evaluation of   several endpoints at the end of the same exposure period using   the same exposed test animals. As a result, the modified Tier 2   program provides a reduction in the number of animals needed to   perform the evaluation of the endpoints of concern and savings on   emission generation and testing costs.         2.

Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti doubted whether anything  more than a vague statement of principles would emerge from the  two-day session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE).    ""The subject is not completely ripe for a decision,"" Cotti  told reporters as foreign ministers and other representatives of  the CSCE states continued their deliberations.    ""There will not be an absolute consensus but a rather broad  accord in principle with strict conditions,"" he said.    Delegates here said the ministers were generally agreed on  the need to strenghten peacekeeping structures across a Europe  plagued by ethnic and national strife.    But Moscow's request for a mandate in the former Soviet  republics drew warnings of caution from several nations and  opposition from the Baltic states, where Russia still has troops.    They fear Russia could use peacekeeping operations as a  pretext for maintaining control over its former domain.    The Russians, who have deployed forces in such hotspots as  Georgia and Tajikistan, have sought authorisation from the CSCE  or United Nations to give them international legitimacy and  financing.    But officials here said questions remained on the system of  financing, the relationship of Russian troops to their  international supervisors and other issues.    A Swiss diplomat, who asked not to be named, said the CSCE  would ask a group of experts to study the matter and report back  in a few weeks. The aim is to reach a conclusion by a meeting  of CSCE senior officials in Prague in March.    ""I understand the fears of certain countries,"" Cotti said.  ""But it is in everybody's interest to see a country, above all a  large country, operating within the framework of international  law.""    The Swiss minister said another subject of hot debate here  was pressure on the Ukraine to dismantle the nuclear arsenal it  inherited from the defunct Soviet Union.    Sources said Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev asked  the CSCE to condemn the Ukraine for balking on disarmament and  unconditional ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction  Treaty [START I).    Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko reiterated here  Tuesday that his country was moving towards gradual elimination  of its stockpile but required security guarantees and financial  help.     "

The measures have brought initial success.    Economic development in Guangzhou, capital of South China's  Guangdong Province, has enjoyed a good start this year, as  reflected by the economic figures of the first quarter.    This information was released today by the foreign trade and  economic cooperation committee of Guangzhou city.    The new series of reforms in the tax system, foreign  currency, banking and foreign trade introduced nationwide this  year by the Chinese Government has allowed more margin for the  development of Guangzhou, a city already boasting the most brisk  and prosperous economic activities of the country.    During the first quarter this year, 699 contracts for  foreign  investment were signed and actually-utilized overseas capital  totalled 489 million U.S. dollars, with a growth of 80.8 percent  over the same period last year.    The city has earned 820 million U.S. dollars in exports  during the first three months, up 23 percent over the same  period in 1993.    This has been stimulated by the abolition of the dual  exchange rates and the previous rules that foreign currency  earned had to be turned over to the government.    To further expand exports, Guangzhou has set up three  overseas enterprises and will establish commercial centers soon  in New York, Sydney and Moscow.    According to Wang Deye, director of the Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Committee, Guangzhou has further relaxed  limits on some high-tech enterprises and old enterprises in  urgent need of technological renovation in absorbing foreign  funds.    By the end of last month, projects involving overseas  capital  higher than five million U.S. dollars each had totalled 134,  covering fields like industrial processing, transport, real  estate, tourism and service industry.    The number of countries and regions that have directly  opened  enterprises in Guangzhou increased from 12 to 19 in the first  quarter as against the same period of last year.    Investments in the city totalling more than 20 million U.S.  dollars have come from each of the following: Hong Kong,  Taiwan, Macao, Japan, Singapore, Britain and the United States.    Israel, Germany and Finland have also expressed intentions  to  invest or expand cooperation.     "

The conference is designed for  exchanging information on Japanese auto parts makers hoping  business in China and on Chinese products and factories which  may interest Japanese companies. Some Western automakers,  including Volkswagen of Germany and Chrysler of the United  States, are taking part in Chinese national projects on  automobile development but Japanese companies are far behind in  this field. Under such circumstances, MITI decided to pave the  way for Japanese companies' advance into the growing Chinese  market.    MITI has already started listing domestic parts  manufacturers  that want to set up production strongpoints in China, aiming at  promotion of joint ventures in the auto industry.    The conference will be organized by officials of the Japan  Auto Parts Industries Association and Chinese auto and auto  parts makers. They will meet periodically to accelerate  bilateral cooperation through exchanging information on definite  plans for business tie-ups. The formal accord is expected to be  concluded in May, when Chinese State Planning Commission  officials visit Japan.    China's automobile production counted 1.4 million units in  1993, and production has doubled in the last three years. Some  estimates say the figure will reach 3 million in 2000. While  Japan's Daihatsu and Suzuki are participating in China's  national automobile projects, no major Japanese automakers are  involved in. In general, Japanese automakers' ties with China  is weaker than those of Western automakers.    The Chinese Government is attaching importance to developing  its own auto parts industries, and it called for Japan's  assistance to the national policy when a Japanese automakers'  mission visited Beijing in the fall of 1993. In response,  Nissan's affiliated Kinugawa Rubber Industrial Co. Ltd.  established a joint venture company in Tianjin. Also, Yazaki  Corporation and Koito Manufacturing Co. Ltd. have subsidy  companies in Tianjin and Shanghai, respectively.    Some auto parts makers are conducting feasibility studies on  operations in China, and the ""cooperation conference"" is  expected to accelerate moves toward technological assistance and  joint ventures.    About 4,000 auto parts factories are reportedly conducting  business in China, but only 20 are subsidies of Japanese auto  parts makers. In the ninth Five-Year Economic Plan starting in  1996, China intends to improve productivity of auto parts makers  through mergers and large-scale management.     "

During an interview with Cuban Ambassador Abelardo Curbelo,  the Mexican official expressed Mexico's willingness to establish  and expand technical and scientific relations throughout the  continent. As an example of this, he highlighted Mexico's  contribution of technological methods used in the production of  corn, wheat, tubers, and vegetables, among other types of crops,  which are not in use in several other countries.    Curbelo said the Cuban Government was pleased with the  progress achieved in its trade activities with Mexico. He  proposed extending this exchange to include genetic studies for  improving basic grain seeds and vegetable oil crops, as well as  several species of cattle. He also stressed the Cuban farmers'  interest in learning about new methods of controlling  agricultural pests and disease, currently in use in Mexico. The  Cuban official offered to transfer sugar cane farming and  production technology developed by his country to Mexico in  exchange.    Hank Gonzalez also spoke with Japanese Ambassador Mitsuro  Donokawi. They discussed the new conditions of the world market  and the need to increase bilateral relations to ensure a fair  and balanced commercial system. They also examined the  cooperation programs currently being channeled through the  Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The JICA is  in charge of administrating the Japanese Government's resources  and the development areas it supports in its beneficiary nations.    Furthermore, they evaluated three projects that are already  under way. The first of these projects is a five-year  agricultural development program for the mining communities in  the dry desert regions of Guerrero Negro, Baja California. The  second project is called Basic Silkworm Breeding Technology,  which deals with silkworm breeding and collection techniques.  This knowledge is currently applied in several states across  the country and will receive $950,000 over five years. The  third of these beneficiary programs is the production technology  improvement plan for small-scale rice growers. This plan is now  being applied in Morelos State.    The officials exchanged points of view on another nine  projects currently under evaluation for future implementation.  An agricultural modernization plan, a reconversion study for  Tapachula, an agricultural equipment and machinery test and  evaluation center, and residual waters recycling and usage  techniques for more efficient irrigation are some of the more  significant topics being discussed.

Qian said this at a meeting with visiting Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.    Qian said that China, the most populous country in the  world,  is a big developing country with a vigorous economy, while  Russia is a country with a vast territory, rich industrial  technology and natural resources.    He said that it is important for China and Russia, neighbors  and both permanent members of the Security Council of the United  Nations, to strengthen mutual friendship and cooperation.    Kozyrev said that another Sino-Russian summit should take  place this year so as to push bilateral relations to a new stage.    Just as President Boris Yeltsin stressed during his China  visit in December 1992, Kozyrev said, further development of  Russian-Chinese ties enjoys priority in Russia's foreign  policies and it would not be affected by domestic political  changes in Russia.    Qian said that China attaches importance to the dialogue and  contacts between leaders of the two countries, which he believed  were significant to promoting mutual understanding and trust and  enhancing the good-neighborly relations between the two sides.    Qian expressed his satisfaction over the recent development  of the Sino-Russian ties.    He noted that high-level contacts between the two sides also  maintained momentum and the bilateral economic and trade  relations have been further developed. The trade volume between  China and Russia hit over seven billion U.S. dollars.    Qian said that Yeltsin's China visit in 1992 gave a big push  to the development of Sino-Russian ties.    Briefing the guests on China's stand of banning nuclear  tests  and non-use of nuclear arms, Qian said that the provisions  concerning the mutual non-use of nuclear weapons in the  Sino-Russian joint communique is very important.    Kozyrev told Qian about the new theories on national defense  of Russia, saying that they are of totally defensive.    The Russian foreign minister said that the Russian side is  willing to participate in China's construction of large  projects, such as the Three Gorges Project.

Speaking at a news conference in Vienna on Tuesday, Eliasson  said that during his trip to the war zone he had met with  Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev and Armenian President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan. Both leaders called for the soonest possible end  to the bloodshed. However, they have different approaches  towards ways of solving the conflict, Eliasson said.    The Swedish diplomat believes the conflict cannot be solved  by military means and called for looking for a political  stage-by-stage settlement which should involve exchange of  prisoners and creating conditions for the return of refugees.  The problem of the disputed enclave's political status remains  the biggest stumbling block. Solving this problem will require  coordination of peace initiatives. Eliasson said he had had  talks with Russian officials to this end.    The Azerbaijani president said earlier today in Beijing  where  he is currently on a visit that the reconsideration of the  status of Nagorno-Karabakh was conditioned on certain terms.  Among them he named ""unconditional withdrawal of Armenian armed  units from the occupied territory of Azerbaijan, territorial  integrity and inviolability of borders.""    Eliasson said that the CSCE Minsk group sees its role in  sending representatives to the region to monitor ceasefire and  to help find a political solution to the conflict. The proposal  about CSCE observers is welcomed by all sides, including Russia,  the ambassador pointed out.    At the same time he said the CSCE did not yet look deep into  the question of bringing a disengagement force to the region.  ""We could also assist in the withdrawal of troops, normalisation  of communications and trade, the return of refugees, and  humanitarian aid matters"", he said.    Eliasson said the success of peace settlement will depend on  whether the sides involved in the conflict will manage to  overcome mutual suspiciousness between the conflicting sides,  build confidence in the military, political and humanitarian  areas, including in cooperation with the International Red Cross  Committee, and display ""reasonable political will.""    The ambassador pointed out that all who can influence the  situation must work together and concertedly. This is why, he  said, ""We closely cooperate with Russia as a big mediator in the  region"".     "

The ministry said Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom  Sirivut conveyed the wish during a meeting with his Thai  counterpart, Prasong Sunsiri, at last weekend's Non-Aligned  Movement meeting in Egypt.    Prasong told Prince Sirivut he would forward Cambodia's wish  to other Asean foreign ministers for consideration. Asean  includes Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore and  Thailand.    Cambodia will attend the 27th Asean Ministerial meeting on  July 22-23 as a special guest. The meeting will be followed by  the ARF meetings on July 25 and a Post Ministerial Conference on  July 26-28 in which Asean's dialogue partners will participate.    The ARF will set aside three hours for participants to  discuss security issues that they consider significant for  regional peace and stability.    Participants in the forum are Asean members plus Laos,  Vietnam and Papua New Guinea as observers. Asean's dialogue  partners, which include the United States, Australia, Canada and  Japan, will also participate. China and Russia will attend as  Asean's consultative partners.    It is still uncertain whether Cambodia's participation will  be possible as participants in the forum should have formal  status in Asean, according to an earlier agreement among senior  Asean officials. Senior Asean officials and representatives of  prospective ARF participants met last month for the final ARF  preparation.    Cambodia has not acceded to the treaty of Amity and  Cooperation in Southeast Asia, a prerequisite for Southeast  Asian nations to become Asean members. Vietnam and Laos both  acceded to the treaty before being accorded observer status.    Prince Sirivut had previously expressed his country's  interest in joining the ARF but later dropped the idea. During  his visit to Cambodia earlier this year, Prasong Sunsiri  suggested Cambodia write a formal letter expressing interest in  the ARF, but the suggestion was not taken up.    Cambodia, which now has a democratically-elected government  as a result of UN-organized elections last May, has not yet been  accorded any status within Asean. Despite this, the country was  invited at short notice to attend the 26th Asean meetings in  Singapore.    King Norodom Sihanouk has said Cambodia at this stage wants  to be a non-aligned country and will consider joining Asean at a  later date.    In Egypt, Prasong also met with his Vietnamese counterpart,  Nguyen Manh Cam.     "

The amended law, which is now called the Foreign Investment  Promotion and Management Law, was endorsed by the third ordinary  session of the National Assembly (Third Legislature) held last  month. This was seen as a remarkable and positive move by the  Lao government in its economic policy which is at a new stage of  development.    The amendments to this law were intended to make it suit the  current investment climate in Lao PDR [People's Democratic  Republic]. It reflects more clearly the renovation policy of  the Lao government, and guarantees the interests of both the  investor and the government. As this law is more or less  related to the labor law, amendments were also made to the labor  law during the same session. Improving the labor law ensures  greater fairness in relations between employers and employees,  both local and foreign. In 1988, the Lao government introduced  an open-door policy of multilateral economic ties and  cooperation with foreign countries in an effort to gradually  strengthen the economy of the country along the lines of a  market-oriented economy. To help realise this policy, it  promulgated a foreign investment law in the same year which was  designed to attract investors to boost the social and economic  development of the country. A national level committee, known  as the Foreign Investment Management Committee (FIMC) was set up  under the Committee for Planning and Cooperation to promote and  manage foreign investment.    Over the past years the open-door policy and the foreign  investment law have to some extent added to the attraction of  Laos in terms of business opportunities as well as for tourists.    Investment statistics obtained from the FIMC show that in  the  three months from January to March 1994 some 43 new licensed  foreign investments coming to a total of U.S. $116 million were  made. The investments cover such sectors as agribusiness,  manufacturing, tourism, mining, construction, telecommunication,  banking, and service industries. Of the sectors, the service  industry takes the lead in terms of investment amount.    The investors are from such countries as Thailand,  Australia,  Italy, Japan, and China.    To keep foreign investment growing in the country, the Lao  government will have to ensure the effective implementation of  its newly amended foreign investment law.     "

However their development  in many fields does not meet our mutual expectations,"" German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel says in an interview published in  the economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on Monday [7 March].    Kinkel stresses the need to realise that along with claims  for compensation by Czech victims of Nazism there at the same  time exist claims of Sudeten Germans expelled from  Czechoslovakia after World War Two. Kinkel says that Germany is  aware of its responsibility towards Czech victims of Nazism.  ""We will seek to find an appropriate solution,"" he says.    ""We are watching with interest steps by the Czech Government  concerning partial compensation for Nazi victims. But there  should not be any prejudices and a dialogue should be carried  out with Sudeten Germans,"" Kinkel says. ""Results of the  German-Czech commission of historians which recently published a  report on its symposium on `Germans, Czechs and Slovaks during  the First Republic' should be taken into consideration much more  than before, which would help make the discussion a  `matter-of-fact' one,"" Kinkel says.    Kinkel expresses satisfaction concerning German-Czech  economic relations. ""In the economic field, Germany, with a  roughly 25- percent share in both imports and exports, is  unambiguously the most important partner of the Czech Republic,""  he says. ""We have opened our market to Czech goods. Thousands  of Czechs have found jobs in Germany, and especially in border  regions. Millions of German tourists visit the Czech Republic.  By this we are considerably contributing to economic and social  stability in the Czech Republic,"" he adds. Besides, the Czech  economy ""has absorbed a considerable portion of German  investments oriented towards Central European countries,"" he  said.    On the future of Europe, Kinkel voices the conviction that  ""excessive regulation and centralism"" within the European Union  has to be moderated. However, the goals of the Union will  remain unchanged. On the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,  Kinkel says the approach by the EU, NATO and the United Nations  Security Council clearly shows the ""firmness with which the  international community reacts to the Bosnian war.""    ""To achieve a functioning security system in Europe it is  important that different institutions -- the EU, the Conference  of Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), NATO and Western  European Union (WEU) -- join together, Kinkel says, adding that  Germany supports such countries as the Czech Republic in their  efforts to approach the structures of European and  trans-Atlantic security.

The message says:    ""The faction of deputies of the Saeima or parliament, `For  Fatherland and Freedom', considers it necessary to call your  attention to the fact that issues of ethnic minorities and terms  of granting citizenship are quite different, completely separate  things. It is recognised that `an ethnic minority' is a term  generally applied to those citizens of a country who do not  belong to the indigenous population of the country. The number  of such people in Latvia equals to 365,043 which amounts to more  than 20 percent of the total of citizens. They are granted all  citizen rights, moreover, the minority groups are also given  large opportunities to develop their cultural autonomy. Thus  there is no particular problems with ethnic minorities in  Latvia.""    ""Meanwhile Latvia does face problems concerned with foreign  nationals which have come to this country during the years of  occupation, and their descendants. In violation of  internationally recognised laws the invader country, the former  Soviet Union, has brought a vast number of its civilians into  the occupied country. Russia, which nominally has taken over the  commitments of the former Soviet Union, is seeking to put an  international pressure on Latvia in a bid to make it legalize  consequences of occupation and colonization, instead of  providing means for repatriation of the people transferred here  under the occupation. Regrettably, those groundless claims have  been met with understanding and encouragement also in some  influential international bodies, as it is shown by your  recommendations to Latvia, which would help to maintain  political influence of Moscow here, endorsing it to pursue  criminal policy of Stalin and Hitler. The faction 'For  Fatherland and Freedom' calls on you to not only to counsel  Latvia, but also to exercise your authority to ensure the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to voice as  strong a support to repatriation of the persons transferred to  Latvia under the occupation, as it is voting to the demand for  Russian troops pull-out, as well as to provide a wide political  and financial aid to the process.""    One of the reasons for writing the letter was the fact that  the high commissioner who is visiting Latvia, has scheduled  meetings with representatives of various factions of the Latvian  parliament, but he, incidentally, failed to slate talks with the  faction ""Fatherland and Freedom.""

Nevertheless, when Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National  Committee, arrived at the Brynar Pharmaceutical Research Center,  affiliated with Belgium's Chemistry Union, the sun suddenly  broke through the clouds, coloring the green earth with golden  rays. The distinguished Chinese guest brought ""sunshine"" to  Belgian enterprises, punned Mr. (Jacob), president of the  Belgian Federation of Enterprises and concurrently executive  chairman of the League of Chemistry, who had been waiting for Li  Ruihuan by the research center's gate.    No sooner had Li Ruihuan stepped out of the car, than Mr.  Jacob told him about the Chemistry Union. [passage omitted]    Mr. Jacob, who has been reputed as the ""boss of the bosses""  of Belgian enterprises, was very good at marketing. According  to him, the medicine for cranial nerve system, developed by the  center in cooperation with China, has been selling briskly.

Citing the  successful example of ""Shike [name as received]"" company, a  Sino-U.S. joint venture for manufacturing anthelmintic and cold  medicines, Li Ruihuan urged Belgian enterprises to develop new  medicines which can cure ailments without side effects.    Accompanied by Jacob and other union executives, Li Ruihuan  viewed the center's production assembly lines for pharmaceutical  products, showing great interest in the advanced production and  packing technology. He said: China has a long history of  producing traditional Chinese medicine for counter-sale, but  still lags far behind Western nations in the production of  Western medicine. He hoped that Belgian pharmaceutical  enterprises would cooperate with China in not only technology  exportation but also joint development of new medicines.     "

Visiting Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, meeting his  counterpart Ali Alatas in morning talks, explained North Korea's  obligation to accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspections, South Korean officials said.    Indonesia chairs the Non-Aligned Movement and is the subject  of heavy diplomatic lobbying by North Korea, which keeps its  third largest mission here with a staff of 25 to serve as a base  camp for Southeast Asia.    NAM foreign ministers meet on May 31 in Cairo, with the  North  Korean nuclear problem on the agenda for the first time for  inclusion in the ministerial statement due at the meeting.    Han requested Indonesian support for South Korea's first bid  for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 1996-97,  the officials said. Their discussions included an exchange of  views on overall revisions to the security council makeup, they  said.    The two foreign ministers also swapped views on the upcoming  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November, to  be hosted by Indonesia.    South Korean officials expect a major difference from last  year's APEC summit in Seattle, Washington, which was mostly  dominated by the United States and other advanced countries.    This year, the home advantage and participation of Malaysian  Premier Mohamad Mahathir are likely to change the tone and  direction in favor of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN), according to the officials.    South Korean President Kim Yong-sam plans to attend the APEC  summit.    The foreign ministers touched base on bilateral trade  issues,  expressing satisfaction at the steady increase in volume and at  active investment by the South Korean side.    Two-way trade is predicted to reach 5.1 billion U.S. dollars  this year with Seoul actually ending up about 500 million  dollars in the red.    Han asked for Jakarta's cooperation in ensuring a steady  supply of petroleum and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to South  Korea, the officials said.    South Korea imports most of its LNG from Indonesia. This  year, 3.7 million tons of LNG out of the expected 4.7 million  tons in demand should come from Indonesia.    The South Korean foreign minister winds up his visit to  Indonesia on Tuesday after paying a courtesy call on President  Suharto.     "

Shulepina: ""Energy  Systems and Gas Pipelines Are Indivisible""]    [Text] Beating politicians, energy officials were  first to reach agreement on creating an integrated energy space,  which they did two years ago. They serve the Greater Central  Asian Energy Ring. A joint dispatching administration in  Tashkent handles operations--determining station loads,  operating modes, and maintenance schedules. It is subordinate to  a council of energy industry officials of the region's  republics, who meet to agree on who will produce how much and  who will buy it. An agreement has also been reached on  cooperation between gas industry officials.    How are the republics building their relations in the  highly complex fuel and energy complex today? A PRAVDA VOSTOKA  correspondent put this question to Erken Anafin, Kazakhstan's  deputy minister of energy and fuel resources.    We get 600 million kilowatt-hours of Uzbek electricity  annually. More than 3 billion more kilowatt-hours of Turkmenian  and Kyrgyz electricity are supplied to Kazakhstan via  Uzbekistan. For example, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have energy  surpluses, while Kazakhstan has a shortage in winter. And so our  colleagues help us out. We had a difficult situation on our  hands in the spring of this year as well. The Dzhambyl  hydroelectric station was operating a single power unit, while  five others were idled on account of fuel problems. We bought  Uzbek gas on credit, as there was no fuel oil since we had not  received petroleum from Russia.    The Kzyl-Orda Heat and Power Station is powered by Angrei  coal. And another payment problem arose. Energy was cheap in  Kazakhstan until recently, and so the industry operated at a  loss. The tenge dropped in value, and our partners lacked hard  currency too. And so we agreed to keep our mutual accounts in  dollars. But when it came time to settle, we had nothing with  which to pay.    We owe Uzbekistan $98 million for electricity and gas. The  Uzbek side's debt to us is only one-tenth of that. It was a  tough situation. We started looking for solutions. And we took  drastic measures. They were economically warranted and fully in  keeping with the spirit of a market economy. We raised  electricity prices twice in spring, so that the prices were  comparable to production costs.    The gas situation was also resolved in a market spirit. We  cut off the gas to those who had not paid. We cut consumption to  40 percent. Is that a little or a lot? We received 6.2 billion  cubic meters of gas from Uzbekistan via the Gazli-Chimkent gas  pipeline last year. This year we have ordered 4.2 billion, and  we are not even using all of that. We took 1.3 billion in the  first four months, but paid for 400 million. The Uzbek side took  an understanding view of our situation, and said: Take what you  need within the agreed-upon amounts. But we squeezed our  enterprises.    We are in a difficult transitional period. There is no  longer  any rigid state regulation in Kazakhstan. As an experiment we  are introducing the use of bills of exchange to settle accounts.  For example, if you cannot pay in cash, we will take payment in  copper or lead. The legislative basis for this is being created.  The Kazakh president issued an edict in April on securities. The  matter is now being worked out in the Economics and Finance  Ministries.    In the meantime we are trying to utilize clearing  settlements. This is not all that easy. We are unable to fulfill  many of our obligations for reasons beyond our control. What is  the situation, for example, with shipping petroleum products to  Uzbekistan from the Chimkent Refinery? We try to keep on  schedule, but Chimkent began operating at normal levels only in  May. Before that there had been unbalanced relations with  Russia, from which it gets the oil. We finally reached an  agreement with Russia. We are shipping it oil from Mangizstau,  and receiving Tyumen oil in Chimkent via the oil pipeline from  Omsk and Pavlodar. And we are selling part of the oil to Fergana.    The Fergana Refinery supplies us with transformer and  turbine  lubricants for our power stations. Again you have an  interdependence. It is very important to maintain good relations  with our partners. We are dependent in very many areas both on  each other and within the country. Let me return to  clearing-based deliveries and settlements for them. We agreed in  an intergovernmental accord that Kazakhstan will pay for energy  resources with tinplate and iron ore pellets. The products come  from the Karaganda Metallurgical Plant. But Karaganda is  dependent on Dzhambyl, whose hydroelectric station was idle for  virtually the entire month of April.    Uzbek gas is extremely important to us. We lease the  Gazli-Chimkent gas pipeline, which runs through Uzbek territory.  And the Uzbek side cannot do without the Poltoratskoye  underground gas storage facility, in the vicinity of Chimkent.  Its reserves guarantee vital services in Tashkent. And here the  Uzbek side leases from us.    We also have problems with operations. This used to be  handled in Central Asia and Kazakhstan by Sredazgazprom [Central  Asian Gas Industry Association]. Since the Soviet Union broke  up, we have divided its facilities and equipment. We established  the Kazakhgaz [Kazakh Gas] State Holding Company. The gas  pipeline is operated by a subsidiary know as Dzhetisugaz. The  gas pipeline is 312 kilometers long. Our specialists have  experience in operating such installations, as we used to  service the Bukhara-Ural gas pipeline and its compressor  stations. But here we have dual responsibility. We have to  ensure the gas pipeline's operation on foreign territory. Our  lease agreements provide for mutual control and inspections. We  undertook to deal with any accidents that might happen. But it  is important to prevent them!    Now we are running into the problem of rising water tables  in  the pipeline's vicinity. This problem has to be solved with the  local Ministry of Water Resources, which has to raise the dams  and lower the groundwater level.    In general, the ties have remained strong at bottom level.  All of us power- and gas-industry workers have worked together  for many years. And today too we help each other whenever we  can. We began producing fittings and oil-field equipment at  converted enterprises in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Petropavlovsk, and  Almaty, and we immediately informed our Uzbek colleagues.  Partners in Pavlodar used to supply caustic soda. But last year,  on account of environmental concerns, the enterprise was closed.  And not only for us, but also for our neighbors. The situation  is the same with lubricants, which no one in the region  produces. For example, for 300-megawatt units. So we bought them  abroad for energy workers throughout the region.    Our outlook? The economy will get on its feet. And our task  is to maintain our fuel and energy potential and expand it.     "

A glance at events during this relatively lengthy period  demonstrates that Washington has never abandoned attempts to  attack Islamic Iran by various means. But just as in its attack  on the Tabas desert all its attempts have somehow failed.    The continuous confrontation between the Islamic Republic of  Iran [IRI] and the United States since the victory of the  Islamic revolution has been one of the most complex  confrontations of the recent decades, which have engaged two  international political entities. Ploys and parameters  exploited by Washington in this confrontation are very diverse  and extensive. In the field of politics, the White House takes  advantage of its influence in such international forums as the  United Nations and Amnesty International. It does not miss an  opportunity either to persuade or force member countries of such  regional bodies as the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council and the  Arab League to pressure and isolate Iran. [passage omitted]    At present Washington is carefully monitoring every military  purchase by Tehran. By exaggerating the Islamic Republic's  military objectives and by repeating allegations that Iran is  seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, it is pursuing some sort of  covert embargo. Also in the confrontation against the Islamic  revolution, the White House is extensively exploiting the lever  of economic pressure. American officials exploit their  relations with major European or Asian states to carefully  monitor any expansion of economic ties between Iran and these  states. To check the IRI's economic capabilities, the American  officials on occasion have been prepared to pay a high price.  These sorts of reactions by such a country as America seems odd  and incredible, unless one tries to analyze these stances by  understanding the depth of imperialism's grudge against Islam.    In the face of the diverse and extensive ploys designed by  the U.S. strategists to confront the Islamic revolution, the IRI  leadership, while being vigilantly aware of the complexity of an  all-embracing struggle, is relying on two basic axes: First on  Islam as a comprehensive and effective system to realize the  revolution's short-term or long-term goals; and second on  maintaining the people's presence to strengthen legitimacy of  the regime. On the surface these two factors seem so simple,  but they provide so much strength and have the potential to  divert the continuous Washington-Tehran confrontation to favor  the Islamic revolution in practice.

The leadership and the policy has not changed,  while the price was paid -- generally patiently and voluntarily  -- by the population.    It is doubtful that the citizens are aware of this, because  according to Dragan Popadic, professor of social psychology,  ""the sanctions affect the tissue of society in the same way  radiation does: At first glance nothing seems to be changing  and life goes on as usual. Like some irradiated organism,  society becomes gravely ill without noticing it due to the still  existing facade that things are functioning normally.""    On the second anniversary of an unheard-of international  isolation of a country, the Yugoslavs can conclude that,  according to calculations of the Center for Development and  Economic Policy of the Federal Ministry for Science and  Development, they have lost some $45.117 billion. Zarko Katic,  minister of transportation in Serbia, claims that this economic  branch alone lost some $10 billion. The social product has been  halved. This calculation does not include the other expenses  caused by the blocked financial assets and property (20 sea and  43 river vessels, and six aircraft, whose value exceeds $600  million), and the loss of capital caused by the conversion of  property into consumption. If the sanctions stay in place until  2011 -- the Center assesses -- the cost of the blockade could  mount to $147.334 billion. No one has yet calculated what will  happen after a thousand years.    Infant mortality has climbed to 21.7 percent in 1992, while  mortality among diabetics has doubled. Every other child in  Belgrade is anemic; out of every 100 children hospitalized in  1989, 1.45 died, while last year this number climbed to 2.07.  In the first year of the embargo, mortality among old people  increased from 501 percent in comparison to the distant 1986.  The number of murders in the same period rose by 49 percent,  and suicides by 22.8 percent. With an unemployment rate of 40  percent among the able, working population, Yugoslavia tops the  international charts. [passage omitted]     "

The  sides stressed the need to have bilateral relations further  improved and described the level of existing relations between  Turkey and Iran as good and constructive. During his three-day  visit, Hashemi is expected to hold talks with the Turkish  officials on important regional issues, the situation in the  Islamic world, and the crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina.    The relations between Turkey and Iran, which have many  common  historical and cultural ties, have been placed on a sound basis.  The factor that requires the two countries to further strengthen  their relations is the question of safeguarding their common  interests in ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization]. Political  and economic experts are convinced that the relations between  Iran and Turkey should be viewed from three angles. Compared  with the past, the economic relations between the two countries  within ECO's framework are rather important for them. That is  why they are maintained at a favorable level.    The trade and economic cooperation between the two countries  in ECO's committees has significantly contributed toward the  improvement of their relations. As far as the political aspect  of their relations is concerned, Iran and Turkey need to take  measures to defend their common border more effectively than in  the past. In view of the fact that that matter has to be  carefully followed, the two countries concluded important  agreements on terrorism and border security during the past one  and a half years. They have done so in accordance with the  principle of noninterference in each other's internal affairs.  Regarding regional issues, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have held  several summits on the question of northern Iraq. The outcome of  the summits and the bilateral relations between Iran and Turkey  show the importance they attach to the establishment of peace  and security in the region.    Iran and Turkey are two important ECO and ICO [Islamic  Conference Organization] members. As such, they have many  opportunities and resources to further improve their bilateral  relations. In view of that, Hashemi's visit to Turkey should be  assessed as the outcome of the effort the Turkish and Iranian  officials have made to further improve and strengthen the  relations between the two countries as much as possible.

I consider that  the transatlantic alliance and relations are as vital today as  they were before the end of the Cold War. And our relationship  is also crucial for the future. New challenges are arising and  important political and economic changes are taking place both  in the European Union [EU] and in the United States and also in  the rest of the world. Europe and the United States have a  common world responsibility.    That is the reason why the agreement reached on the Uruguay  Round is of great importance. It is really a major achievement  and especially for European Union-United States relations.  After a period during which European Union-United States  relations were subject to some strain, the first visit of  President Clinton to Europe provided opportunity to revitalize  the European Union-United States dialogue.    It was a very good surprise that President Clinton so  clearly, supported European integration, expressing the view  that Europe should be a very strong and equal partner. He  underlined the importance of the European Union for the United  States and made it clear that ""America's commitment towards  Europe's safety and stability remains as strong as ever.""  [passage omitted]    Let us come now to the prospects of European Union-United  States relationship.    The European Union and the United States have the most  important interdependent relationship in the world. Both sides  have major, concrete, overlapping interests in the other. The  European Union and the United States are each other's largest  single trading partner. Both share fundamental political  principles and both have an interest in promoting these  principles in the world. Given the depth of EU-U.S. economic  and political interdependence and the order of magnitude of  global political, economic, trade and environmental problems  which neither side can any longer solve on its own, it is  imperative that both work together in order to develop common  strategies and actions. This close relationship between the  United States and the EU is fully reflected in the transatlantic  declaration of 23 November 1990, which provides the  institutional framework for the transatlantic dialogue. In it,  both sides agreed inter alia on regular and intensive  consultations, by making full use of and further strengthening  existing procedures.    With the end of the cold war, new economic and political  challenges have emerged. The European Union, together with the  United States, is bound to remain in the forefront of regional  crisis management, especially in the framework of the United  Nations. Both partners are contributing to stability and  constructive change in Central and East Europe and the former  Soviet Union and to the achievement of peace in ex-Yugoslavia.  Both partners continue to share a common interest in the  management of other political issues: China, the Middle East,  and the promotion of democracy and human rights throughout the  world. At the same time the EU and United States together with  Japan have the common responsibility and the economic strength  to stimulate world trade, to revitalize global economic growth,  including employment and to reduce exchange rate instability.    At the NATO summit the approval of the partnership for  peace approach established a framework for enhanced political  and operational military cooperation with the Central and East  European countries. With respect to ex-Yugoslavia, a converging  approach emerged also from the NATO summit. Formal  consultations with the United States as called for by the EU  have contributed to better policy coordination in this area.    Following seven years of tough negotiations on the Uruguay  Round, which quite often put extreme strain on the transatlantic  relationship, the successful conclusion of the round in December  1993 demonstrated that both the US and the EU still have the  political will to work together constructively.    On the basis of competitive and cooperative partnership, the  EU and the United States remain a pole of stability for the  international community. But if both want to remain each  other's key partner on the world scene, timely changes and  adaptations will be needed in the transatlantic dialogue in  order to contain potential sources of friction and to build up  an agenda based on joint interest and cooperation.    It is important to improve transatlantic channels of  information and communication in order to avoid misinformation  and the resulting friction over each other's share of the burden  of financial, economic and trade efforts necessary to assist the  reform process in the Central and East European countries and  Russia.    In order to achieve a better cooperation between the EU and  the United States it is essential that the EU gets its act  together and speaks with one voice on foreign and security  policy issues.    On the economic and trade side, it is now necessary to  implement the Uruguay Round and to keep the process under  political purview.    The EU and the United States will have to tackle the  so-called next generation of trade issues such as trade and  environment, trade and social issues, trade and competition and  work closely together on global issues such as population growth  and environmental degradation.    It is very important that an active bilateral dialogue be  developed on all issues of common interests.    As a European Commissioner in charge of taxation and  customs,  I have initiated a new dialogue in these fields between the  European Commission and the United States administration. That  has been fruitful in the case of the difficult problem of  unitary taxation. Other tax problems of common interest could be  discussed in the same way.    Another field which seems to me to be crucial for the coming  years is new technologies. In that field, European Union/United  States cooperation should be strengthened. It is not only a  matter for cooperation at governmental or public agencies level.  It is a matter for business cooperation between European and  American companies. In some areas, such as the new information  highways, if Europe and the United States want to keep or to get  a technological leadership, they must work more together.    A kind of common leadership often seems to be the only way  to  face competition from Japan and Asia.    As you can see, there are a lot of reasons why I think that  the United States and Europe need each other.    The challenges and common responsibilities which both the  European Union and the United States have to face clearly call  for more coordinated approaches, common action and closer  cooperation. It is a question of political will on both sides  but it is also a question of a better consciousness at all  levels in the business communities and public administrations on  both sides of the Atlantic ocean.    Thank you for your attention.     "

""The world is going through the process of becoming one  market and one economy. This is the new reality,"" Han said in a  luncheon speech to the Korean Council on Foreign Relations.    ""Korea's domestic as well as external situations are  changing  at a breathtaking pace. Our perception should keep abreast of  that pace but in many cases our perception is lagging behind,""  he told the council of senior and foreign diplomats in a speech  titled ""Post-UR International Order and Korea's Foreign Policy.""    Unfortunately, South-North Korean relations are still  calculated on a zero-sum game basis, but South Koreans must  realize the new international order will be based on non  zero-sum games.    In a comprehensive explanation of South Korea's position on  major new issues, Han clarified what the country can and cannot  accept.    On labor, for instance, South Korea has no reservations on  improving protection of workers' basic rights. ""And prisoner and  child labor should be prohibited by all means,"" said Han.    But South Korea does have reservations about attempts to  establish international standards, which ""will hardly contribute  to enhancing workers' rights nor is this practicable,"" the  foreign minister said.    On competition policy, individual mechanisms considered  unfair or restrictive -- monopolies, quotas, subsidies,  countervailing and anti-dumping duties -- ""should be reviewed on  a case-by-case basis before judgement is passed,"" he said.    The foreign minister defended the government's decision to  join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD) by 1996, reasoning membership in the group will give  Korea time to prepare its economy in advance.    But here again, South Korea will pursue independent  policies.    South Korea's Official Development Assistance (ODA) level  lags behind the requirement set by the OECD's Development  Assistance Committee (DAC).    ""Korea is considering wavering its membership in the DAC  even  if it joins the OECD by the year 1996,"" he said.    ""Korea intends to comply with as many provisions as its  economy can abide without serious disruption,"" he said. ""And  for the rest, Korea will present a reasonable schedule for  liberalization.""     "

In light of the current rather chaotic situation in China's  audio [compact disc] and video laser disc production and market,  which see copyright infringement to a certain extent, the CPC  Central Committee Propaganda Department and the six other  departments demand that the audio and video laser disc  duplication business be put under the jurisdiction of  departments directly related to the industry. All audio and  video laser disc duplication businesses must go through the  Press and Publications Administration's examination and obtain  its approval and be put under day-to-day administration by the  Press and Publications Administration as well as local  administrative departments charged with the overseeing of the  audio and video industry. Audio laser disc production lines  already set up without the Press and Publications  Administration's examination and approval are subject to a  full-scale check conducted jointly by the relevant departments  and the provincial, regional, and municipal administrative  departments in charge of the audio and video industry which are  supposed to simultaneously submit their inspection comments to  the Press and Publications Administration and those specifically  on foreign-invested enterprises to the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation by the end of May 1994. Those which  are found to be operating without the necessary conditions or  seriously violating laws and regulations will be given a  deadline for rectifying their mistakes, and those failing to  meet the requirements by the deadline will be ordered to stop  production in accordance with the law. The seven departments  demand strict investigation into and severe punishment for  piracies; the conscientious protection of the legitimate rights  and interests of copyright holders, publishers, and consumers;  and the immediate organization of a force to seriously clean up  the audio and video market. After copyright piracy or illegal  duplication is exposed, joint efforts should be made along with  local copyright departments and administrations for industry and  commerce to immediately rectify or investigate and punish the  wrongdoing in accordance with the law. Various customs  departments should strengthen the examination of imported  modules for audio and video laser discs and of their finished  products exported in bulk.     "

According to this document, to which NOTIMEX had access, the  leaders will repudiate ""any measure that affects free commercial  development, goes against international legal principles, and  worsens the people's living conditions."" Although the final  document does not make a direct reference to the Cuban or  Haitian situation, it does describe the economic blockade as  ""incompatible with the current international economic and  political situation.""    The heads of state or government who will participate in the  summit that is to be held in this Colombian city on Tuesday and  Wednesday of next week, manifest their support for the UN  resolution that demands the elimination of this type of measure.  The first part of the document refers to commerce and  integration as factors that further Ibero-American development  and recommends the adoption of macroeconomic reforms, as well as  the strengthening of the business sector.    The participants also propose that restrictive commercial  practices be eliminated and underscore their commitment to  multilateralism and commercial opening. Cooperation and mutual  assistance, including the exchange of information, are  considered indispensable for countries in the region to adapt to  the new international order, according to the text. In order to  overcome the obstacles that prevent a greater level of  competition in interregional and international commerce, the  heads of state or government will recommend that preferential  treatment be granted to less developed countries.

After evaluating the Ibero-American forum's development --  its first meeting was held in Guadalajara, in the western  Jalisco State of Mexico, on July 1991 -- the participants will  propose that a work method be established for future summits.  The proposal's objective is for statements to concentrate on a  specific area so as to avoid having another long list of topics  that are frequently unconnected and incomplete,"" in the next  summit, scheduled to be held in Argentina in 1995.

On 26 January, the foreign  minister and his party had a meeting with the Chilean acting  foreign minister and delegation. The outcome of the talks is as  follows:    1. Both sides agreed to expand bilateral relations in  politics, economics, and especially trade and investment  cooperation.    2. Chile is pleased with the Thai Government's decision  to open an embassy in Santiago, with the first ambassador  capable of speaking Spanish.

The negotations  confirmed the desire of both sides to ""step up the political  dialogue"", which was noted by the French foreign minister during  his interview with ITAR-TASS on the eve of the visit.    A hot line will be opened shortly between the Kremlin and  the  Elysee Palace. It will help the presidents of the two countries  to hold important and urgent consultations whenever necessary.  The two foreign ministers signed a corresponding agreement  after a talk which lasted for two and a half hours. But already  now, the coordination of actions between the sides is very  close, especially when it comes to protecting the interests of  their citizens.    Thus, the Russian Foreign Ministry has highly appreciated  the  French assistance during the evacuation of Russian citizens from  Yemen. Juppe told journalists that Paris was grateful to Moscow  for its role in the liberation of French hostages, captured in  the Bosnian conflict zone.    The talk, Kozyrev said, has confirmed the importance of  permanent contacts at political level. The sides have discussed  several key problems, including the Russia-European Union  agreement, which is now in the making. The sides also touched  on the French proposal to conclude a ""stability pact"" in  Europe, which will be discussed at a conference in Paris next  week. They also discussed further approaches to the Bosnian  settlement.    The French minister described as ""exemplary"" the interaction  displayed by Moscow and Paris at present in their approaches to  the situation in former Yugoslavia. Both countries are actively  working on the Bosnian problem. Russia, the United States, and  the European Union were able to adopt a joint document a short  while ago. At present, the French minister believes, the sides  should not relax their pressure. It is necessary to further  exert joint influence on the sides involved in the Bosnian  conflict in order to make them stop the hostilities.    According to Juppe, France attaches great importance to  bilateral cooperation with Russia. It is striving to conduce  Russia's partnership with Europe in various European  institutions. Paris wants Russia to join the Council of Europe.  ""We are also glad,"" the French minister noted, ""that the  Atlantic union is ready to grant Russia within the Partnership  for Peace programme a status that would be in keeping with its  specific character.""

This communique specifies all the areas of cooperation in  political, economic, and security matters between Jordan and  Palestine following the establishment of Palestinian rule under  the Gaza-Jericho autonomy accord. The implementation of a major  part of the elements depends on the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho accord, which is now rather ambiguous as a result  of differences between the PLO and Israel.    With this accord, Jordan has consolidated its future  position  in the autonomous regions. Recently, as a result of an  agreement between Jordan and Israel, Jordanian banks are seeking  to resume activities in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  The activities of these banks had been suspended following the  usurpation of these areas in the six-day Arab-Israeli war in  1967. Besides, the Jordanian dinar is currently circulating in  these areas alongside the Zionist regime's currency, the shekel.  In view of the fact that one-third of Jordanian currency is  circulating in these areas, Amman does not wish to relinquish  this sector of its economic activity.    The consolidation of the Jordanian dinar and the banking  activities of this country in the occupied areas of the West  Bank and the Gaza Strip has been affirmed with the signing of  this agreement. In conjunction with economic agreements,  committees on the issues of Jerusalem, refugees, homeless  persons, security, borders, and social affairs have been  envisaged in this agreement. PLO-Jordanian talks commenced a few  days after King Husayn's vehement criticism of 'Arafat and the  PLO. King Husayn described these talks as the last chance for  coordination of relations between Palestine and Jordan.    Political observers believe that Jordan's insistence on this  agreement stems from numerous factors, most importantly that  Jordan is concerned that 'Arafat is giving preference to  coordination and cooperation with Israel even at the expense of  adversely affecting cooperation with Jordan. In view of the  considerable number of Palestinians living in Jordan, which  exceeds half of the country's population, Jordan is greatly  affected by these developments. In fact, 'Arafat's regional  cooperation with Israel undermines Jordan's historical role.  What is interesting in this matter is the regional rivalry over  the economic future of autonomous Gaza and Jericho without any  clear picture of the actual situation.     "

""Interpol, the Belgian police authorities, and the Federal  Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] have proved their  joining effectiveness,"" Bohl told WELT AM SONNTAG.    According to a now available balance sheet of a large-scale  search in 420 German towns, which was conducted the week before  last, a total of 1,049 weapons were seized, including seven  submachine guns and three fully automatic guns. In addition,  2.5 tonnes of ammunition as well as five hand grenades with  accessories were found.    Most of the weapons came from Belgium. Twelve suspects were  arrested and two arrest warrants were issued.    Said Minister Bohl: ""This successful operation is a clear  warning to international criminals. Uniting the police forces  leads to determined operations and greater security. An  abolition of border checks is by far not tantamount to freedom  of international crime. I congratulate the official of  Interpol, of the BKA, and of the laender police forces on their  success.""    A total of 2,247 federal and land official were involved in  the police operations in all laender.    A total of 754 apartments of 724 persons were searched, who  are suspected of having brought weapons to Germany illegally --  in particular from Belgium -- and having sold some of them  already.    The occasion of the search in the FRG was information  provided by Interpol in Brussels to the BKA in Wiesbaden.    Last November and December, Interpol had provided  information  on 1,082 cases of the purchase of guns by German citizens in  Belgium.    Minister Friedrich Bohl announced that the European police  authorities have already increased their exchange of information  considerably. This is an ""advance measure"" regarding planned  ""bolstering measures"" within the framework of the abolition of  borders. Bohl: ""The European registration service already  works before it is officially introduced. This is now paying  off.""    The minister announced that, when it takes over the  presidency of the European Union as of July, the Federal  Government will make a special contribution so that the European  Union can combat international crime with determination as a  ""security community."" Bohl: ""In addition, cooperation between  the judicial, security, and customs authorities of the member  states must be improved in such a way that the latest success  against the arms smugglers becomes a normal part of everyday  police life in Europe.""

Sokolovsky, a senior Soviet environmental  official, detailed new Soviet initiatives to combat pollution in his country,  calling them ""radical perestroika."" Among them, he said, are an emerging system  to tax and fine polluters and the recent creation of a broadly based citizens'  group to advise the government on environmental issues.    Sokolovsky said also that the Soviet State Committee for Environmental  Protection intends to combat urban air pollution, which he said is among the  country's ""most dangerous"" problems.    In no less than 103 cities, he said, air pollution is often 10 times the legal  limit. Sixty-eight additional cities have ""rather steady violations of air  pollution norms,"" he said.    An increasing source of such pollution, Sokolovsky said, is the automobile. In  more than 250 cities, he said, auto emissions now are more responsible for air  pollution than industry emissions. As a result, Sokolovsky said, plans are  being developed to ban leaded gasoline altogether, either by 1996 or 1998.    Reilly hailed the Soviet environmental initiatives, calling the Soviets'  pollution problems ""serious, difficult and daunting.""    Earlier, Sokolovsky had given Reilly a document that the EPA boss called ""the  very first Soviet state of the environment report ever to be published.""    The Soviets' newly created Citizens Advisory Council is made up of 150  environmental activists, scientists, architects, journalists, trade unionists  and artists, among others, according to Sokolovsky, who is first deputy  chairman of the State Committee on Environmental Protection. He said six of the  members have been elected to the Supreme Soviet.    The collaborative environmental studies will include not only government  agencies but numerous scientific organizations, academic institutions and trade  associations.

The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo conveyed Washington's opposition  to  the EAEC proposal to the Japanese Government June 7, saying the  caucus would have a negative effect on the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum.    It marks the first time that the administration of President  Bill Clinton, which has taken a wait-and-see attitude on the  EAEC, has explicitly opposed the proposal.    The embassy also told Japanese officials that Thailand,  which  is the current chairman of ASEAN, and Brunei, as the ASEAN  chairman of the U.S.-ASEAN dialogue this year, will be informed  about Washington's stance.    The declaration of U.S. opposition to the caucus comes soon  after ASEAN officials briefed the U.S. Government during the  u.S.-ASEAN dialogue meeting in Washington in may on the details  of the EAEC as formulated by ASEAN in a blueprint on the EAEC  concept.    According to the blueprint, the EAEC is not ""a subsidiary  organ of APEC but would function independently of it.""    It points out that even though ASEAN agreed last year that  the EAEC would function as a caucus within APEC, it is not a  caucus ""of"" APEC.    The blueprint also says ""the caucus would determine its own  agenda"" and ""the results of the caucus' discussions need not be  reported to APEC meetings unless deemed necessary.""    At the Washington meeting, ASEAN officials assured the U.S.  Government that the EAEC would not be confrontational and would  be compatible with the U.S.-favored APEC forum. U.S. Assistant  Secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord did not  give a response at the time.    The administration of former President George Bush had  bitterly opposed the plan for the EAEC, which would exclude the  U.S. because of worries that it would become a confrontational  economic weapon of Asian economies against the developed world.  But the Clinton administration initially appeared to move  toward a softer stance.    Washington's latest opposition makes it more difficult for  Japan to accept ASEAN's invitation to join the EAEC. So far,  Japan has remained cool toward the issue because of fear of  antagonizing the U.S.    The absence of Japan, Asia's economic powerhouse, from the  EAEC would put the proposal in a quandary and analysts say ASEAN  may now have no choice but to make further changes to the EAEC  concept.

Speaking at a news conference in Helsinki on Monday, Rybkin  said that owing to Russia's efforts a safety belt is now being  established around Gorazde, similar to that around Sarajevo. He  pointed out that ""Serbia is a bare nerve of Europe,"" adding that  for the first time since 1945 this state which has never joined  any bloc is bombed.    He assured the journalists that the ""State Duma will take  the  necessary measures to facilitate a peaceful settlement of the  Bosnian crisis.""    Asked about the prospects for Russia's joining NATO's  Partnership for Peace programme, Rybkin linked it to NATO air  strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. In his view, the  participation in the NATO programme presupposes some sort of  ""family relations."" ""But in a good family every member tells  what he intends to do,"" he said.    ""We are for partnership for peace, but we do not want to see  a situation when one partner acts without consulting the other  in this partnership.""    Summing up the results of his visit to Finland, Rybkin said  that his talks with Finnish leaders, industrialists, farmers and  public figures were useful and fruitful. ""We say in Russia: an  old friend is worth two new ones. Three days of hard work and  very good and intensive meetings have proved the validity of  this saying,"" he said.    During the talks the sides discussed a wide range of issues  connected with the expansion of relations between Russia and  Finland in all spheres, including their interaction in the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Nordic  Council, the Council of Europe, the European bank for  Reconstruction and Development and other international and  regional organisations.    Speaking about the prospects for Russia's accession to the  Council of Europe, Rybkin noted that the process of adopting a  decision on this issue has obviously been dragging on for too  long. Some connect this with the withdrawal of Russian troops  from the Baltic republics. Russia is interested in the soonest  possible return of its soldiers no less than any other concerned  state. But the talks with some Baltic states proceed no exactly  in the way Russia would like them to go, he continued.    Rybkin said he has requested Finnish leaders to mediate the  process in order to find a solution to the problem.     "

""It means Japan is at last fully convinced that not only is  it geographically right in the midst of East Asia, but it  belongs to East Asia,"" said International Trade and Industry  Minister Rafidah Aziz.    ""It's good if the report is true that Japan has now decided  to recognize the EAEC,"" she said, commenting on a report  Wednesday in a Japanese daily that quoted government sources as  saying that Tokyo has reversed its cautious EAEC stance.    The ASAHI SHIMBUN report said the new position hopes to  create a ""diplomatic balance"" in the Pacific region following  implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA) among the United States, Canada and Mexico at the  weekend, and to curb U.S. dominance in the 17-member  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which held its  first summit in Seattle in November.    The news report was carried on the front pages of all major  Malaysian newspapers Thursday. The Japanese Foreign Ministry  declined to comment on it.    Rafidah added that Japan joining the EAEC should not detract  Tokyo's network with groupings in other parts of the world.  [sentence as received]    The six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN)  hopes to lure Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan  into forming the EAEC hopefully by this year, but only China has  so far publicly welcomed the grouping. ASEAN groups Brunei,  Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.    Japan and South Korea have been noncommittal over their  participation after the previous U.S. Administration of  President George Bush strongly opposed the exclusive Asian  grouping, saying it is a potential trading bloc.    Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed proposed the EAEC  in late 1990 when the recently concluded Uruguay Round of talks  to free the global trading system was bogged down mainly by  disputes between the U.S. and the European Community.    The ASAHI report said the conclusion of the talks allows  Japan to reverse its stance on the EAEC which it feared would  have hampered the round that was held under the General  Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    It added the change was also due to Japan's concern that  NAFTA is evolving into an exclusive bloc, especially since  president Bill Clinton used the threat of Japan edging out the  U.S in Mexico to garner support for NAFTA from the U.S. Congress.

About 20 blue-eyed members of the ""Russian team"" join in  this apartment complex' soccer team practice at 0530 every  morning. The ""Russian team"" is merely a pet name given by the  residents of this apartment complex, not a real soccer team  representing Russia. They are high- level Russian technological  brains who have been invited to and are working at the Samsung  Space Aeronautical Research Institute. [passage omitted]    After an hour of exercise, they come to the office each  morning on a 45-seat bus provided by the institute. They are  researchers from the SDC [expansion unknown], a company  specializing in engine design located in Moscow, Russia.    The SDC is a private company formed in 1989 by former  researchers of ""Soyuz,"" Russia's state-run engine designing  bureau, with a total of 1,500 employees. A total of 28 came to  ROK, including seven doctorate-degree holders. Most of them are  from the Moscow (?Mollini) University, which is called ""Russia's  MIT,"" and from the Moscow Aviation College. They came to this  research complex last June under a one-year contract, and live  in apartments ranging from 30-pyong [one pyong is equivalent to  3.954 square yards] to 45- pyong in size, provided by Samsung.  They participate in debates with researchers from Samsung and in  joint research projects, and sometimes offer advice.    Their specialized fields are mainly design and manufacturing  of industrial gas turbine engines, as well as technological  support for production. Samsung Aviation Company has intensively  researched this field for several years, according to its  long-term development plan. This being the case, the 28 Russians  are providing technical training to the Samsung side in a  person-to-person basis under a tight schedule in their three  respective specialized fields-- combustion, turbine, and  compression. Kim Chae-chol (47), director of the company and  head of a research and development team, said: The United States  and Japan, which have ultramodern technology in these fields,  have built thick barriers to protect their technology. Under  this situation, cooperation from Russia's technological camp,  which competes with the United States for the summit position of  the world, is of great help to us. In the event that we obtain a  broad range of technology, ranging from basic technology to  high-level applied technology, including aircraft engine, the  ROK will be able to enter into the rank of 10-top aviation  industry states before long.    According to the materials of the Ministry of Science and  Technology, since scientific and technological exchanges began  on a full scale between the two nations in December 1990 when  the ROK- Russia agreement on science and technology was  concluded, the number of Russian scientists and technicians, who  came to the ROK and stayed for over a month, was 95 in 1992 and  116 in 1993. This number is expected to reach 150 this year,  thus showing nearly a 25 percent increase each year. [passage  omitted]    The areas in which Russian scientists have remarkably  advanced are ultramodern technology fields including space  aeronautics, new materials, machinery, semiconductor, and  chemistry, where the domestic technological foundation is  relatively weak.    Government-supported research institutes, including the  Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Atomic Energy  Research Institute, Energy Research Institute, Machinery  Research Institute, and Standardization Research Institute;  civilian enterprises that are in true need of basic and  ultramodern science and technology; and even universities,  competitively employ Russian scientists and technicians. Thus,  they are accelerating the development of new technology. In  particular, practical joint research results have appeared in  succession in certain research project domains. Such results are  being accepted as a ""green light"" for strengthening the nation's  competitive power in industrial fields. [passage omitted]    In 1992, the ROK and Russia, for the first time, jointly  applied for patents for automobile oil filters; carbon pellicle  coating equipment, and natural gas engines. This is regarded as  an example of the achievements attained with the support of  Russian scientists.    Civilian business firms are inviting Russian scientists more  actively than government-supported research organizations, thus  attracting the people's attention. This trend is being led by  large business groups such as Samsung, Daewoo, and Lucky-Gold  Star. Samsung was the first business group to employ Russian  scientists under long-term contracts. In April 1992, Samsung  employed Mr. (Georgiy Park), a Moscow University doctorate  degree graduate with a major in semiconductors, under a one-year  contract basis. He has been in charge of the joint research  development of optical electronics at the Samsung General  Research Institute in Kihung, Kyonggi Province. He is known to  be a third-generation Korean in Russia. He worked as senior  researcher at the (Ioepe) Research Institute and (Polius)  Research Institute, renowned as authoritative research  institutes in Russia.    In addition, the Samsung General Chemical Company invited  four technicians from the (Kalkin) Research Institute, which is  reputed for its development of new ultramodern materials of  synthetic chemistry, to work in its chemical research institute  at the Taedok Research Complex, starting in November 1993.  [passage omitted]    What interests the people is that the Russian technical  teams' activities have even extended to the domestic ""beer war.""  On 20 May, the Chillo Group's ""Kas Beer"" challenged ""Hite Beer""  and ""OB-Ice Beer."" [passage omitted]    The Russian scientists actively responded to the request for  participation in long- and short-term joint projects by major  universities including the Seoul University, Inha University,  Catholic University, Kyongbuk University, Kyonghui University,  and Hongik University, and the number of Russian scientists  participating in domestic projects ranges from 20 to 50 each  year. The Russian scientists' advance to the ROK has been  prompted by the increasing demand for them by our domestic  business groups. A ROK business firm can acquire high-level  technology, which cannot be obtained from any other advanced  country, by paying a low salary of between $1,000 and $2,000 a  month. This being the case, the increase in demand is quite  natural. On the other hand, the Russian scientists are paid  three times more in the ROK than in their home country.    However, relevant officials from business circles point out  that since the treaty for the prevention of double taxation  between the ROK and Russia and other CIS countries has not been  concluded, Russian scientists are subject to pay over 20 percent  higher tax- rate. As a result, instances in which Russian  scientists have refused our side's employment proposals are  increasing. Besides, precise materials concerning the background  of Russian research institutes and scientists are not available  at home, thus causing difficulties in choosing Russian  scientists.    Yi Chin-kyu, secretary at the technical cooperation section  in the Ministry of Science and Technology, pointed out that  ""Russia has recently emerged rapidly as a source for our nation  to import ultramodern technology, pushing aside the United  States, Japan, and the European Union. With a view to  invigorating the exchange of scientists between the ROK and  Russia, the government will abolish various restrictions,  including the ratification of the treaty for prevention of  double taxation and the simplification of the visa issuance  procedure, and will work out plans for the active inducement of  Russian scientists.""

The sum is approximately the same as in the current  fiscal year. Commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov:    When this announcement was made, some congressmen asked  themselves the question whether the already planned program of  cuts in defense spending would be possible. The program  provides for reducing defense allocations by $120 billion within  the next five years. The congressmen began to analyze President  Clinton's words that the United States must not cut defense  further. They came to the conclusion that the adopted plan of  cuts in defense spending remains in force, and the word further  meant there would be no more cuts except those already planned.  Senator Sam Nunn reacted positively to the conclusion.    The most important thing is that the U.S. military budget is  least of all linked with the relations between Moscow and  Washington. Russia and the United States, the two great nuclear  powers, do not consider each other as an adversary. Cooperation  in the military field replaced confrontation. This showed  itself in the agreement on the reduction of strategic arms and  in the U.S. assistance in dismantling the Soviet nuclear  arsenal. The level of mutual understanding is characterized by  the recent agreement, under which Russian and American nuclear  missiles will not targeted at each other's territory or any  other country.    So what's the reason for Washington's intention to cut the  Pentagon's budget even more than it was previously planned?  This is obviously attributed to difficulties of the military  conversion process. There have been a number of reports in the  American media on behind-the-scenes activities of congressmen  from the military industrial regions.    New threats is probably another reason: These are regional  conflicts. John Murtha, chairman of the House of  Representatives Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, believes  the United States may face a dangerous conflict on the Korean  peninsula, a conflict even more dangerous than Haiti, Bosnia, or  Somalia. In the meantime, the Pentagon insists on a strategy  calling for a military force ready to fight two major regional  conflicts simultaneously.    According to the mass media, there is no unanimity in the  Congress to give up cuts in defense spending. According to  experts and research institutions in the United States, the end  of the cold war and military confrontation between Moscow and  Washington has created a unique chance to direct material  resources to civilian programs, the more so since regional  conflicts can hardly be compared with the threat to life on  earth.    That was a commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov.     "

In a letter made public at a meeting of the Council's Public Safety Committee,  Gates also objected to a provision that would bar any police cooperation with  an INS investigation, detention or arrest except in service of a search or  arrest warrant or in cases in which police believe that the suspect has  committed a felony.

The proposed guidelines would prevent the LAPD from initiating any action on  the basis of an individual's immigration status. Cooperation with any foreign  government's investigation of immigrants would also be prohibited, unless the  immigrant was suspected of having violated federal, state or local laws.    Immigrant rights groups and council members Michael Woo and Richard Alatorre  called for the new guidelines after two recent incidents in which police have  rescued immigrants from the hands of smugglers demanding ransom, only to turn  the hostages over to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for  deportation.    Alatorre said the proposed policy would help curb what he called a rash of  unreported crimes against immigrants. ""Those crimes go unreported for one  simple reason -- people are afraid of being turned over to the INS,"" Alatorre  said after the meeting.    In response to Gates' objections, Alatorre made minor changes in the wording of  some of the proposed amendments to department policy. Deputy Chief William  Rathburn told the committee that the department had not yet reviewed the  amended proposal.    To give the Police Department time to respond to the amendments, the committee  then forwarded the proposed policy to the full council without recommendation.

At the same time, however, Bush and his senior aides continue to issue  bellicose warnings about Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait -- warnings that one  official said are part of a deliberate campaign to prepare the American people  for the possibility of military action against Iraqi forces.    Bush, campaigning in Texas, for the first time explicitly compared Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler and, also for the first time, publicly  raised the possibility of a war crimes trial for the Iraqi leader's ""ghastly  atrocities"" against the Kuwaiti people.    ""The story of two young kids passing out leaflets: Iraqi troops rounded up  their parents and made them watch while those two kids were shot to death --  executed before their eyes,"" Bush said as he listed the ""horrible tales"" of  Iraq's actions in Kuwait.    ""Hitler revisited,"" he declared.    The strong rhetoric, U.S. officials say, is part of an effort to keep  international pressure focused on Iraq at a time when events elsewhere in the  Middle East, particularly in Israel, threaten to create dissension within the  anti-Iraq alliance.    Even more dissension would be likely if Iraq did withdraw from parts of Kuwait,  officials fear. And new signs indicating that may be a possibility have  prompted considerable discussion within the Administration.    ""There are two schools of thought here,"" one Administration official said.  ""One, that Saddam Hussein is trying to find a way out; the other, that he is  simply trying to divide everybody"" by pretending to be willing to withdraw. The  tactic is one Hussein used frequently during the Iran-Iraq War.    ""It could be something. We don't know,"" the official said.    Earlier this fall, some U.S. analysts, pointing to the massive looting of  Kuwait, had suggested that Hussein was planning to strip the country first,  then pull out of most of it. Iraq's chief interests in Kuwait, the analysts  noted, are a large oil field straddling the border between the two nations and  two Kuwaiti islands, Warba and Bubiyan, that command the approaches to Iraq's  only Persian Gulf port.    Iraqi denials of any willingness to withdraw from any part of Kuwait had  quieted such speculation. But the possibility is now being taken seriously once  more because of more recent signals, ranging from movements of border signposts  by Iraqi troops to statements by a ranking Soviet official after a visit to  Baghdad that Hussein had indicated a willingness to withdraw from much of  Kuwait.    In Saudi Arabia, the wife of the Kuwaiti planning minister, who recently left  Kuwait, reported that Iraq is fencing off the northern third of the country --  an area that includes the oil field and the disputed islands.    ""The Iraqis are setting up a wire fence across Kuwait. They apparently plan to  gulp up Bubiyan and the northeastern oil field,"" said Fatima Hussein, who fled  her occupied country last week. She is the wife of Planning Minister Salman  Abdul-Razek Mutawa.    At the same time, a senior member of the Saudi royal family confirmed that  intelligence reports indicate Iraqi troops may be building reinforced positions  in northern Kuwait south of the disputed islands and the Rumaila oil field.    And a member of Kuwait's ruling Sabah family said he has received reports that  Iraqi troops are putting up concrete barriers along the Mutla Ridge, a range of  low mountains that separates northern Kuwait from the more populated areas  around Kuwait city.    Kuwaiti officials at the government-in-exile in Saudi Arabia are clearly  alarmed about the possibility of what, for many of them, has been a nightmare  scenario: a partial Iraqi pullout that likely would cause fatal leaks in the  international alliance against Iraq.    Nations now willing to confront Iraq for the liberation of Kuwait would be far  less likely to do so over a mere border dispute between the two nations, they  fear.    ""We would become just another international conflict,"" one member of the Sabah  family said. ""Another Palestine. Another Lebanon.""    Indeed, many officials say that -- had Hussein seized only part of Kuwait in  the first place -- the international campaign against him never would have  gotten off the ground. After a brief period of protest, ""we would have jumped  quickly there and mediated and kissed each other,"" one senior Arab diplomat  said.    The Kuwaitis, along with some Saudi and U.S. officials, fear that Hussein may  now try to pull back, hoping to hold onto much of what he truly wanted in the  first place while avoiding a war that would probably end his regime.    Other officials are far more skeptical, however.    ""I don't believe Iraq now has any thinking of withdrawing from Kuwait,"" one  Saudi official said. ""There is no sign at all that that is Hussein's intention.  The Iraqi officials still say they don't want to leave Kuwait, that there is no  Kuwait. Something like that doesn't mean peaceful intentions.""    Administration officials say Bush would oppose settling for a partial  withdrawal from Kuwait but would have to defer to whatever decision the  Kuwaitis made on the issue. Any such compromise, U.S. officials fear, would be  seen in the Middle East as a victory for Hussein.    ""It's certainly better to use the military option than it is to compromise your  objectives,"" one senior U.S. official said. ""Do I think it is better to use the  military option than realize the existing objectives diplomatically? No. Is it  better to use the military option than having Saddam Hussein sit in Kuwait  forever? Yes. . . .""    The official said ""everyone is pretty sober"" about the possibility of war  although he added, ""People realize that it's potentially costly, but it's a  serious option.""    Bush, meanwhile, stepped up his condemnation of Hussein. In Texas, where he  campaigned for Clayton Williams, the Republican candidate for governor, Bush  denounced Hussein's ""systematic assault on the soul of a nation.""    Reiterating reports delivered last month, when he was visited at the White  House by the Kuwaiti emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, Bush told of infants  removed from incubators and dialysis patients taken from kidney machines so  that the equipment could be shipped to Iraq.    ""Remember -- when Hitler's war ended, there were the Nuremberg trials,"" Bush  said, referring to the war crimes trials that followed World War II.  Administration officials have privately been investigating the possibility of  such trials since August.

During the past five years large quantities, including tens  of tons of opium, heroin and morphine, have been seized by the  Iranian National Security Forces from the smugglers, the bulk of  which were en route to the European markets and possibly from  Europe to other regions of the world. In their efforts to  combat the well armed international drug smugglers, a number of  Iranian law enforcement personnel were martyred.    Meanwhile every once in a while, some international human  rights organization or certain foreign countries criticize  Tehran for its anti-drug activities. For instance in October  1993, Amnesty International under the pretext of protecting  ""human rights"" criticized Iran for its death penalty policy for  traffickers.    The recent statement by the U.S. assistant secretary of  state  for international narcotics strategy, Mr. Robert Gelbard, who  accused Iran of not being successful in its drug campaign is  surely part of a general conspiracy to degrade the Islamic  Republic of Iran's successful efforts in combating drug  trafficking.    Unable to convince the European countries and Japan to join  Washington's economic embargo plans against Tehran, it is not a  big surprise to see a senior U.S. official making such a  baseless statement at a time when Iran is planning to further  enhance its cooperation in combating traffickers both at  regional and global levels, within the framework of the Economic  Cooperation Organization as well as international organizations  such as the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) or  Interpol.    It is crystal clear that drug smuggling is a major  international problem which knows no boundaries and without  regional and international cooperation, combating traffickers  and drug abuse will be a costly measure and a bit difficult for  individual states. Therefore it is no wonder to hear a senior  U.S. official to make such a baseless statement in order to  merely degrade Iran's anti-narcotic strives.    Indeed, it can be assessed that what Mr. Gelbard has said is  part of Washington's general foreign policy strategy to isolate  Iran by using all available means to crate a negative picture of  the Islamic Republic in the minds of the international  community. But, surely the antinarcotic planners of the country  and the brave personnel of the National Security Forces will  foil Washington's propaganda by adopting proper measures.     "

A joint  communique has been issued that mainly discusses the regional  conflicts in the former Soviet Union, disarmament, and  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Sources close to the conference have said that no  concessions  were made to Russia's objections concerning the Azeri-Armenian  conflict and the reduction of Conventional Forces in Europe  [CFE].    The statement supports the idea of holding a conference  within the framework of the CSCE to reach a lasting and just  solution to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. The statement  says that the problem can be resolved only through negotiations.    The statement points out that the NACC follows developments  in the Crimean Autonomous Republic with concern. It adds that  the problem should be resolved within the framework of the  territorial integrity of the Ukraine.    The statement discusses the Russian military presence in the  Baltic countries without using the word Russia. It says that  the withdrawal of foreign troops from these areas as soon as  possible will contribute positively to the security of both the  regional countries and Europe.    On Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says that a political  solution should be reached as soon as possible.    On arms control and disarmament, the statement stresses the  importance of fully implementing all the existing agreements on  the issue. The statement stresses the need to fully implement  within this framework the CFE, the agreement to prevent the  proliferation of nuclear arms, and the agreements on chemical  and biological weapons, as well as poisonous gases.    The statement says that an agreement must be concluded as  soon as possible that completely bans nuclear experiments.    NATO Acting Secretary General Sergio Balanzino held a news  conference at the end of the meeting where he said that Russia  accepted the Partnership for Peace plan as it is, but that it  requested a [word indistinct] on how the plan will work.    Balanzino stressed that it was very important for all the  members to reach an agreement. If that had not been achieved,  he said, we would have given a negative message to the world.    Replying to questions, Balanzino said that Russia is a very  important force in Europe and NATO's close relations with this  force will contribute to world peace.    Asked if Kozyrev's objections to the joint statement are a  negative sign that Russia might change its policies in the  future, Balanzino said: I do not know the answer to that  question. I do not know about the future. However, today,  there is no change of policy. Maybe Kozyrev lacked sleep, maybe  he was tired.     "

They exchanged opinions on China's re-entry into GATT and  some other issues of common concern.    Li said that eight years have passed since China applied for  re-entry into GATT, and now, although the Uruguay Round has  ended, the re-entry issue remains unsettled.    He said that China was a full participant in the Uruguay  Round and China advocates a balance between rights and  obligations on GATT issues.    Li noted that China, as an open country now, has to practice  trade in accordance with international rules, adding that China  is making efforts to re-enter GATT and become a founding member  of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is due to be set up  next year, in order to meet the demands of China's economic  development and many other countries' requirements.    On market access, Li said this is a gradual procedure and  China will lower its tariffs step by step, pointing out that  along with the development of China's economy, China will  realize its commitment through its own efforts.    Touching upon the national treatment issue, Li said that the  unification of China's dual-track exchange rates is the most  profitable treatment for overseas business people.    He continued that the opening of China's service sector,  from  hotel management over 10 years ago to shops, banks and  insurance, has expanded during the past few years.    To assure healthy development of China's service sector, Li  noted that the opening of this sector should go forward step by  step, for China lacks experience and qualified personnel in this  field, adding that such an opening will be profitable for both  the Chinese and the foreign sides.    Li said that the future WTO should treat China as a  developing country, and China should never accept the standards  for developed countries.    Before the meeting, China's Minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Wu Yi also met with Sutherland.    Wu said that China needs the assurance of a multi-lateral  trade system and the world trade system also needs China as a  participant.    She added that, without the participation of China, WTO  would  be incomplete and would lack universality.    Sutherland said that China should become a full participant  in WTO so as to provide it with both assurance and  opportunities, and he expressed hope that both negotiating sides  would show some flexibility to achieve the anticipated results  at an early date.

During his first official China trip since taking office  last  August, Hosokawa will hold talks with President Jiang Zemin and  Premier Li Peng on bilateral and international issues, Chinese  and Japanese officials said.    He will also fly to Shanghai on Monday to visit the Pudong  Development Zone, the officials said.    The prime minister told a group of Chinese journalists today  that he hopes to reaffirm the consensus arrived at by Japanese  and Chinese leaders that the bilateral relationship should be  future-oriented and contribute to the world.    ""I hope that the two sides will hold very meaningful talks  and exchange views frankly with each other,"" he said.    Hosokawa's visit comes at a time when there are no major  pending issues between Japan and China, a Japanese Foreign  Ministry official said.    Both countries feel satisfied over the smooth development of  bilateral ties and hope to further develop them toward the 21st  century, the officials said.    They said recent exchanges between Chinese and Japanese  leaders have brought the mature relationship into ""a new era of  development.""    Jiang visited Japan in April 1992, while Emperor Akihito and  Empress Michiko toured China in October of that year in  celebration of the 20th anniversary of the normalization of  diplomatic ties.    Under Hosokawa's government, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  met his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen in September, and  Hosokawa held talks with Jiang in Seattle in November when they  met at an unofficial summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation Forum.    In January this year, Hata visited Beijing and Chinese Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji came to Japan last month.    The bilateral trade volume reached 39 billion U.S. dollars  last year, when Japan took over Hong Kong to become China's  largest trading partner while China became Japan's second  largest trading partner after the United States.    The officials said Hosokawa will express Japan's continued  support for China's reform to shift to a market economy and  backing for Beijing's bid to become a full member of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Hosokawa will also supervise the signing of an environment  cooperation treaty during his visit, they said.    Under the accord to be signed, Japan will provide China with  technology to combat acid rain, and air and water pollution in  the wake of China's rapid industrialization, according to the  officials.

They  are aiming at a joint strategy by proposing a low-interest loan  system to promote commercialization of clean energy vehicles  such as compressed natural gas (CNG) cars, while investigating  how various laws can be applied. Usually, ministries fight over  policies and budget proposals, but on energy issues they are  keeping inter-ministerial conflict in hand.    Cooperative efforts by MITI with other ministries include  the  joint development project on housing models and residential  subdivisions which incorporates natural energy such as  photovoltaic power generation in order to cope with  environmental problems. Measures for energy-efficient facilities  and demonstration of photovoltaic power generation systems which  had been promoted under the leadership of MITI, and housing  construction incorporating energy conservation measures  heretofore promoted by the MOC will be worked out jointly.    A committee of housing manufacturers within the Solar System  Promotion Association has been investigating use of integrated  roofing systems. In this area also a special committee under the  guidance of MOC has given special attention to the applicability  of laws related to construction. Furthermore, they will  cooperate with MOC on architectural standardization regulations  in order to use integrated modules for building materials.    This cooperation extends to clean energy vehicle  development.  The results of the CNG car fleet tests conducted by MITI will be  checked by MOT's Safety Standard Investigation Committee. Both  MITI and MOT have held five conferences on low pollution  vehicles since last fiscal year. At these meetings they have  prepared basic information on the development of CNG, electric,  and methanol vehicles and related infrastructure, and the  outlook for commercialization.    MITI and MOT are making special efforts to cooperate in  development of systems to aid the commercialization of CNG  vehicles. They are also cooperating on a joint proposal for a  low interest loan system for CNG, electric, and methanol  vehicles. Furthermore, they are making proposals jointly with EA  to have CNG, electric, methanol and hybrid vehicles included in  the new tax system.    In addition, MHA is currently holding an ``Investigative  Research Forum for the Promotion of Local Energy Operation'' to  discuss power generation using waste materials, refuse  solidification for fuel/power generation, and wind power  generation. MITI is also showing great interest in this area by  exchanging information frequently through their divisions  involved.     "

""I haven't heard...and don't know,"" about such a meeting,  Fujii told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting. He was  referring to reports of a German proposal to hold a G-7 meeting  in late February.    Fujii also denied reports that he would be talking with U.S.  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Sunday in Tokyo, saying, ""I  have absolutely not heard of it...I learned of his (Bentsen's)  schedule for the first time through newspapers.""    Concerning a meeting of finance ministers of the  Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Fujii said it will be held in  Hawaii on March 18 and 19 as disclosed by Bentsen on Monday.    The APEC meeting will be for ""exchanging wide-ranging  views...and not for negotating policies,"" he said.    Turning to domestic issues, Fujii repeated that the timing  and size of an increase in the consumption tax must be included  in a package of tax reform bills for cutting income tax.    That is the ""collateral"" for issuing ""bridge bonds"" to  finance the tax cut, Fujii said, reiterating his strong  opposition to an issuance of ""untreated"" deficit-financing bonds.    The finance minister has retracted his objection to cutting  income tax before raising the consumption tax as a stimulus  measure on condition that repayment of bonds is guaranteed.    On Friday, disputes surfaced between the Finance Ministry  and  the Tax Commission over the sensitive issue of tax reform.    Kan Kato, head of an advisory panel to the prime minister,  told reporters that a simultaneous cut in income tax and  increase in the consumption tax rate is ""not necessary,""  apparently opening the way for further objections to such a move  by the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] and some other parties  in the ruling coalition which oppose a tax increase.    But later Friday, Kato called a press meeting to retract his  comments after they drew strong objections from the ministry.    Meanwhile, Fujii welcomed decisions by the coalition parties  to drop a proposal to use public funds to purchase land as a way  to stimulate the real estate market.    ""I believe the decisions are correct...because the  government  can't win public support,"" he said, pointing to the easing of  regulations as one of a number of measures and saying his  ministry is still studying what actions can be taken.    He also rejected any changes in the land tax.  (endall) 180219 foad DF131801.007 ym 18/0244     "

As of today, representatives of the five large enterprises  who accompanied Premier Li Peng have signed four agreements, two  contracts, and more than 20 letters of intent on economic  cooperation in petroleum, natural gas, construction, metallurgy,  textiles, electronics, and other industries.    At a recent meeting with the entrepreneurs' delegation, Li  Peng said: This is the first time a Chinese entrepreneurs'  delegation has accompanied a state leader on a foreign tour.  This is a beneficial experiment: good results have been  achieved and we may continue the practice. In developing  economic and trade cooperation with Central Asian nations,  Chinese enterprises should give play to their own strengths and  fully use the resources of the countries with which they  cooperate. Cooperation must be on a equal and mutually  beneficial basis, and we must take reality into consideration  and pay attention to the economic results of cooperation.    Li Peng also pointed out: We must pay special attention to  the quality of Chinese export products and must prevent  counterfeit, fake, and substandard products from entering  Central Asian markets. At the same time, we should protect the  Chinese people's legal business activities in the area and crack  down on speculation and profiteering.    Li Peng stressed the importance of building a modern ""silk  road"" between China and Central Asian countries, saying that,  without a free transportation channel, it will be difficult to  greatly develop economic and trade relations with these  countries.    Zheng Hongye, head of the Chinese entrepreneurs' delegation  and president of the China Council for the Promotion of  International Trade; and persons in charge of China Construction  Engineering Corporation, China Petroleum and Natural Gas  Corporation, China Steel Industry Trade Group, China Textile  Products Import and Export Corporation, and China Electronics  Products Import and Export Corporation, who accompanied Premier  Li Peng on his visit, jointly held a news conference this  afternoon to brief reporters on their companies' trade talks  results.    They unanimously said: Chinese and Central Asian countries'  economies are highly complementary to each other and the  potential for cooperation is huge. As the cooperation climate  improves, the level and quality of cooperation gradually will be  raised. Chinese enterprises should be farsighted in developing  economic cooperation with these countries.     "

He noted that  the bilateral boycott [muqata'ah thuna'iyah] can be ended  gradually if progress is made on the basis of goodwill  initiatives.    At a press conference he held this afternoon on the  sidelines  of the second international conference on challenges facing the  Arab world amid world changes, Shaykh al-Qasimi said that there  is no fear of Israeli penetration of Gulf markets if a  comprehensive peace is achieved. He remarked that the GCC  states will not be a ""piece of cake"" for Israel.    On the GCC stand on Iran's occupation of Tunb al-Sughra,  Tunb  al- Kubra, and Abu-Musa--the three islands of the United Arab  Emirates-- al-Qasimi pointed out that the GCC will refer the  matter to international organizations if Iran and the Emirates  do not resolve the dispute.    Asked about the varying stands the GCC states adopted on  Iraq  and Iran, al-Qasimi emphasized that the GCC summit resolutions  on these matters are binding to all members. He pointed out  that varying views do not mean that these states are divided.  Each state is entitled to its own views and what counts is for  all these views to serve the GCC's interests, he said. He added  that any contact between a Gulf state and either Iran or Iraq is  in the GCC states' interest because these contacts seek  solutions to the problems involving these two states.    On the GCC stance on borders among Gulf states, Shaykh Fahim  remarked that the GCC is not a unique case and that these  matters are on their way to a solution.    Answering a question on increasing the number of the  Peninsula Shield troops, al-Qasimi stated that the GCC has  agreed to increase the troops from 8,000 to 17,000 and to  develop united military and communication systems.    Shaykh al-Qasimi added that the Gulf states must develop a  common vision of cooperation. He also said that the Damascus  Declaration leaves defense cooperation between Gulf states and  both Egypt and Syria up to each individual state.    Al-Qasimi answered a question on the visit the Omani energy  minister paid to European and East Asian states to negotiate a  reduction in oil output. He said the visit produced encouraging  results and that he received a report from the Omani minister,  affirming that the responses were very reassuring. He remarked  that a reasonable reduction in the oil output will contribute to  price stability.     "

The Saudi monarch, in an interview with Egyptian newspaper editors, also  confirmed that Riyadh will help finance the reconstruction of an Iraqi nuclear  reactor destroyed by Israel in a 1981 air raid.    Both Israeli and U.S. officials have warned that Iraq, like its antagonistic  neighbor Iran, is trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability. While that  effort was set back by the Israeli air strike against a French-made nuclear  reactor near Baghdad nearly eight years ago, Rear Adm. Thomas A. Brooks,  director of naval intelligence, testified recently before the House Armed  Services Committee in Washington that Iraq was again ""actively pursuing"" a  nuclear capability.      Crash Nuclear Program    Asked Friday about a Washington Post article quoting Israeli sources as saying  that Iraq is engaged in a crash program to develop a nuclear warhead, President  Bush said in Washington: ""I don't want to give credence to the fact that Iraq  is in the process of building nuclear weapons. I cannot confirm that. Anytime  you see representations that there will be nuclear proliferation, it has got to  concern us.""    King Fahd, in his remarks to the newspaper editors, which were published  Friday, denied that the reactor in question was meant to manufacture nuclear  weapons, which, he noted, Israel is widely assumed to already possess.    Affirming Saudi Arabia's ""readiness to help rebuild"" the Iraqi nuclear plant,  Fahd proposed that Israel and Iraq both agree to inspections by the  Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency to ""determine which (reactor)  is for military uses: the one in Israel or the (Iraqi) one. . . . ""    The Saudi monarch was referring to Israel's top-secret nuclear facility at  Dimona, which successive Israeli governments have refused to allow the IAEA to  inspect.      Flurry of Interest    While Fahd's remarks about Iraq's postwar nuclear development plans provoked a  flurry of interest among diplomats and other observers here, it was his strong  and seemingly unequivocal endorsement of Egypt's readmission into the 22-member  Arab League that was, from the Egyptian point of view, the most important  outcome of his long-anticipated visit.    ""Egypt's presence within the Arab group is indispensable . . . to effective  joint Arab action,"" Fahd said in a joint communique issued with Egyptian  President Hosni Mubarak at the end of his five-day visit.    The Arab League suspended Egypt's membership 10 years ago after Mubarak's  predecessor, the late President Anwar Sadat, signed a separate peace treaty  with Israel. Although most Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, resumed  diplomatic relations with Cairo more than a year ago, Egypt's formal return to  the Arab fold has been stymied by opposition from Syria, which the normally  skittish Saudis have been reluctant to antagonize.    In the complex currents of inter-Arab politics, however, several recent shifts  have emerged to prod the Saudis into taking a bolder stand on this issue.    The most significant of these, Egyptian and other Arab analysts said, was an  agreement last February among Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen to form the Arab  Cooperation Council, a loose economic confederation.    While the economic significance of this grouping is doubtful, given the  near-bankrupt state of its members' economies, its political point was not lost  on the Saudis, whose regional influence could be eclipsed by the emergence of  any post-Persian Gulf War alliance between Iraq and Egypt, the two largest Arab  military powers in the Middle East.    Egypt and Iraq have been pressing the Saudis for more economic assistance, and  the fact that Fahd's decision to visit both countries -- he stopped off in Iraq  before coming to Egypt -- followed the Arab Cooperation Council's formation was  not mere coincidence, a senior Egyptian official admitted privately.    ""The Saudis decided to come when they saw that Egypt's weight was being  siphoned off toward Iraq and Jordan,"" this official said somewhat gleefully.    The joint Egyptian-Saudi communique said the two sides had agreed to establish  a committee to increase economic ""cooperation,"" but there was no confirmation  of local press reports suggesting that Fahd had ordered Saudi banks to lend  Egypt $2 billion to meet a serious shortage of wheat and other essential  commodities this year. There was also no indication that Fahd had brought Egypt  a quick-fix check of several hundred million dollars, as had been rumored.    However, if Fahd's visit failed to meet Egyptian expectations on the financial  side, it clearly boosted Mubarak's prestige in several other ways, diplomats  and Egyptian officials agreed.    ""Fahd in Cairo, more than any other single visit or event, symbolizes Egypt's  return to the Arab fold,"" a Western diplomat said.    By throwing his substantial weight behind Egypt's quest for readmittance into  the Arab League, Fahd has virtually assured that Egypt's suspension will be  lifted at the next Arab League summit, diplomats said.    Because it speaks directly to Egyptians' sense of pride, the gesture of the  visit is considered extremely important to Mubarak, who is facing growing  discontent at home over inflation, food shortages and other increasingly  visible signs of Egypt's worsening economic crisis. Indeed, the effusive,  almost fulsome, fuss that Egypt made over Fahd seemed to be aimed at least as  much at boosting Mubarak's image as Fahd's, analysts said.    The support the Saudi monarch gave to Egypt's diplomatic efforts to convene a  Middle East peace conference was also seen here as strengthening Mubarak's hand  on the eve of his first visit to Washington since President Bush took office,  the analysts added.    Praising Bush as a ""far-sighted thinker"" who will ""spare no effort to solve the  Middle East problem,"" Fahd told the newspaper editors that Saudi Arabia ""fully  supports . . . the constructive position"" on the peace process that Mubarak  will try to persuade Bush to embrace when they meet in Washington on Monday.    This position, the joint communique added, calls for the convening of an  international peace conference, under the auspices of the U.N. Security  Council, as ""the only formula"" that can lead to peace in the Middle East.    The communique also endorsed the recent decisions by the Palestine Liberation  Organization to renounce terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist as a  ""positive development in the Palestinian position (that) offers a rare  opportunity all the parties should seize to reach a just and comprehensive  settlement"" to the Middle East conflict.    Mubarak held talks last week with King Hussein of Jordan and PLO Chairman  Yasser Arafat to agree on the tack he will take in Washington. Now, with the  added weight of Saudi Arabia's support, he will go to the White House with the  enhanced stature of spokesman for an influential Arab consensus on the peace  process, Egyptian officials said.

The delegation, the largest ever from that country, led by  Minister of Trade Negotiations Philip Burdon, is expected to  lead to a new ""investment wind"" blowing from the South Pacific  island nation, trade officials from both countries believe.    In the trade group are representatives from New Zealand's  leading enterprises, such as Fletcher Challenge, Calt Halt and  the Lion Company, which have already invested in China. They  will tour Tianjin, Suzhou, Chongqing and Guangzhou to discuss  specific cooperation projects with local officials in addition  to holding two trade seminars in Beijing and Shanghai,  respectively.    In his talks with Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, Burdon said that his country  attaches great importance to developing trade and economic ties  with Asian countries, China in particular. The New Zealand  Government has also launched the ""Asia-2000"" strategic plan  targeting the shifting of its trade focus from the traditional  European markets to Asia.    With the implementation of the plan two years ago, New  Zealand-China economic ties have entered a new stage in which  sole trade has given way to a variety of methods of economic  cooperation. China so far is New Zealand's tenth-largest export  destination and its sixth-largest import source, involving a  total trade volume of more than 500 million U.S. dollars last  year, a rise of 14.5 percent over 1992.    The first quarter of this year saw the bilateral trade rise  to more than 93 million U.S. dollars, up 12.6 percent over the  same period of last year. Chinese exports are mainly garments  and textiles and electronic appliances, and imports are mainly  resource-based products such as wool, timber, coal and iron ore.    As a traditional capital absorbing country, New Zealand has  in recent years encouraged its enterprises to invest in China.  By the end of last year New Zealand had invested in 148  enterprises in China involving a total capital of nearly 70  million U.S. dollars. Last year alone they set up 76 joint  ventures in pasture development, feedstuffs, woolen textiles,  fishing, computers and inland oil exploration. The total  contracted capital of 44.5 million U.S. dollars was more than  the previous year's total.    A New Zealand trade official said that the investment wind  is  expected to blow stronger along with China's economic  development and opening drive.    Over the past few years Chinese enterprises have also  invested in New Zealand. They run more than 20 joint ventures  with investment much larger than that poured by New Zealand into  China.     "

The two sides reached the consensus on Tuesday [25 January]  during talks between Bai Jingfu, Vice-Director of the National  Narcotics Control Committee and Robert Gelbard, the U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State for international narcotics matters.    Bai and Gelbard exchanged views on fighting international  narcotics crimes, especially those originating in Asia's  notorious ""Golden Triangle,"" the sources said.    The two sides agreed on the necessity of strengthening their  efforts in fighting the drug trade.    The Chinese side said it hoped the U.S. would adopt measures  to remove any barriers impeding the two nations from working  together to stop the drug trade.    Gelbard was quoted by the sources as saying he would ""try  his  best"" to do so.    Gelbard also held talks on illegal immigration with Zhang  Hongxi, Director of the Consular Affairs Department of the  Foreign Ministry.    During their meeting Zhang outlined factors contributing to  smuggling and illegal immigration, reiterated China's opposition  to such activities and discussed what steps have been taken to  combat them.    Zhang asked the U.S. to clamp down on the so-called  ""snakeheads""--those involved in smuggling Chinese people to the  U.S.    He said that China opposes the U.S. Government offering  political asylum to these smugglers.    Such people, he said, falsely claim they are fleeing  political persecution in China.    And he added that China's view on granting asylum  indiscreetly is that it encourages smuggling.    The Chinese officials said that normal exchanges between the  two countries should continue and that they hoped the U.S.  Government would help Chinese who apply for visas from the  country.    Gelbard said the U.S. is formulating new laws to crack down  on international crime organizations.    He also said the US is willing to strengthen co-operation  with China to combat crime.    And relevant U.S. departments are ready to work with their  Chinese counterparts, the U.S. official said.    At the meeting, the two sides agreed to establish an ad hoc  consultation system, further strengthen bilateral exchanges and  co-operation between law-enforcing departments, exchange  information and take effective measures to punish those who  smuggle people.    Describing his talks with the Chinese officials as ""frank,  friendly and productive,"" Gelbard told reporters that both sides  ""expect greater cooperation at all levels.""    Gelbard left Beijing yesterday for Fujian, Guangdong and  Yunnan provinces en route to Thailand and Hong Kong.     "

Speaking to the diplomatic chiefs and ministers for budget  and foreign trade from the 25-nation OECD, Martino stressed how  the commitment of the Rome government was ""for greater economic  freedom, not limited to just Italy, but one which will develop  on an international level.""    Yesterday, during the first day of the OECD ministerial  session, Italy was singled out for its budget problems and told  the best way out was through a reduction of taxes for lower  level employment and greater flexibility in hiring regulations  with the eventual suppression of a minimum salary.    Today, the OECD economic policy committee revised its  economic growth forecast for Italy for the 1994-1994, predicting  a 1.5 percent increase in the GDP for this year, close to its  earlier forecast, while in 1995 the GDP is expected to climb by  2.5 to 2.6 percent.    Unemployment in Italy was forecast to remain ""just below"" 12  percent this year, while there should be a slight reduction in  store for 1995.    In his address to today's session, Martino went on to  underscore how ""the program of the Italian Government expresses  in an explicit way the readiness of Italy to operate for the  enlargement of the European Union towards East Europe and to  increase world trade relations, first of all with North America  and the Pacific regions.""    The Italian foreign minister then went on to add how premier  Silvio Berlusconi believed that ""nothing, in Italy's  international trade relations, should be done which in any way  fuels the protectionist spiral.""    Martino also voiced his satisfaction for the agreement  reached with Russia, also in view its agreements with the  European Union, as well as the participation of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin at the July G-7 Naples summit.    In order to help support the transformation of the Russian  economy, Italy last week took part in the renegotiation of the  Russian foreign debt, taking on costs of close to a billion  dollars.    Looking also at other countries which are evolving towards a  free-market system, the Italian foreign minister said the  current situation was difficult and was one to which the OECD  had to adapt, by moving cautiously.

In an interview with the newspaper AL-QADISIYAH published  here today, the minister said that these international  companies, which play a great and effective role in their  countries' governments, seek to reemploy their expertise and  investments in our oil industry despite the continuation of the  blockade imposed on Iraq.    He said that there is another group of oil companies that  seek to improve and promote their relations with Iraq, and that  they seek to seize the appropriate opportunity to hold contacts  and talks with Iraq in order to reach a specific agreement or to  conclude contracts to develop their investments after the  blockade is lifted.    The oil minister said: Negotiations with the international  oil companies have taken place not only in Baghdad, but also in  other world capitals, including Amman and Vienna. He stressed  that the negotiations with the French oil companies, which were  recently held in Paris, resulted in agreements that will be  implemented after the blockade is lifted.    He emphasized that the continuation of the blockade not only  affects Iraq and its people, but it is now affecting the  neighboring states and other states with interests in Iraq.  These states have begun to feel the grave damage inflicted on  their economies. He added that Turkey is now suffering from a  serious economic crisis after the stoppage of the Iraqi-Turkish  pipeline, and after banning the crude oil exports through this  line to Turkey and then to other ports. He said that  reoperating this line will secure jobs for thousands of Turkish  workers.    Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad added: The closure of the  Iraqi- Turkish oil pipeline has led to the deterioration of the  economic situation in the Anatolia region and the Turkish ports,  to the growth of unemployment rates, and to the deterioration of  the security situation in the region.    He noted: As a result of these problems and obstacles,  Turkey began to pressure the UN Security Council to allow the  reopening of the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline, which will reactivate  trade between the two countries using 1,000 trucks per day to  transport goods.    The oil minister pointed out that Iraq's current production  of crude oil falls within the limits of 550,000-600,000 barrels  per day to meet the local needs for oil byproducts. He said  that important explorations have been undertaken in the central  and western regions of Iraq, and that previously-discovered oil  fields have also been developed.     "

Having installed an  offshore platform and using its own prospecting personnel, the  Brazilian company is working on the island as subcontractor to a  consortium put together by Total, of France, and the Canadian  firm CMW.    Exploration of the Cuban coastline in search of petroleum  began last year when risk contracts were signed with  multinational oil companies. Since it has no funds to meet any  high-cost commitments, Cuba will use the oil taken from the  bottom of the sea to pay the companies that operate there.    ""Indications of Oil""    Andrade Gutierrez's efforts, explained Roberto Rivas,  director for the Americas of the Cuban Cooperation Committee,  focused first on reserves that had already been analyzed by  Cuban Government geologists and geophysicists. ""We have  indications that there is petroleum under the sea,"" said Rivas,  who is an important adviser to Carlos Lage Davila, considered to  be the strongman of that country's economy.    According to Andrade Gutierrez press advisers, the builder  has already fulfilled half the contract. The work began on 18  December 1993. So far, 1,760 meters of drilling has been done in  three 3,500-meter deep wells in Cardenas Bay, on the north of  Cuba across from Valadere beach (the country's biggest tourist  center), according to reporter Elizabeth Rosa.    Andrade Gutierrez sets the total value of the project at $9  million. It took the firm, which began drilling oil wells in  Brazil early in the 1980's, 13 days just to transport the  platform from Brazil to the Cuban coastline. According to  Gutierrez, the platform was inspected by international firms and  considered to be ""in legal and acceptable condition in terms of  the United States trade embargo against Cuba.""    Decline in Production    Even during the years of close ties to the Soviet Union, the  Caribbean island had been producing as much as one million tons  a year of petroleum, Rivas noted. But since Soviet assistance  ended, local production has leveled off at about 500,000 tons a  year, not enough to satisfy domestic needs.    The state corporation in charge of business transactions in  the petroleum field--everything from prospecting to refining and  distribution--is Cupet Cubana de Petroleos. The current  off-shore risk contracts, the director of the cooperation  committee stated, will also have the effect of using the idle  capacity of the island's three refineries--one in Havana,  another in Santiago de Cuba, and a third in Cienfuegos.  Considered the most modern of Cuba's refineries, the plant at  Cienfuegos has the capacity to refine three million tons of oil  a year.     "

His objective is to hold  talks on regional and international developments and political  and security matters between Iran and Turkey. In a statement  after his meeting with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, 'Ali  Besharati-Jahromi recalled the favorable relations between the  two countries and stressed that neither a security nor a  political problem exists between Iran and Turkey. He also  described the cooperation between the two countries on the  struggle against terrorism as a positive outcome of the  uninterrupted contacts between the officials in Tehran and  Ankara and outlined Iran's uneasiness over the activities of  certain anti-Iran elements in Turkey.    The situation in northern Iraq and the bearing it has on  security in the region was a focus of the talks 'Ali  Besharati-Jahromi had with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin.    Iran and Turkey have established strong relations because of  their historic, religious, and cultural ties as two neighboring  countries. The cooperation between the two countries within the  framework of the Economic Cooperation Organization is a factor  that enhances their relations. Meanwhile, the meetings of the  Turkey-Iran Joint Security Committee in Tehran and Ankara  constitute one of the results of the important agreements the  two countries have reached to promote their cooperation on  security matters. Iran's approach is based on the principle of  non-interference in the internal affairs of foreign countries.    'Ali Besharati-Jahromi stressed that the friendly relations  between Iran and Turkey are motivated by the concept of  good-neighborly relations and noted that Turkey's enemies have  no place in Iran. He also stressed that Tehran is well aware of  Turkey's problems and regards Turkey's foes as its own enemies.    The Iranian and Turkish officials had discussed the question  of peace and security on the common border between Iran and  Turkey and the developments in northern Iraq several times in  the past. Tehran and Ankara support the maintenance of Iraq's  territorial integrity. In view of that, the two sides call for  an urgent solution to the problems in northern Iraq. The  continuation of the clashes will further complicate the  situation and create instability in that region. A tripartite  meeting will be held on the matter in Damascus between Iran,  Turkey, and Syria. The outcome of the assessment of the  developments in Iraq will be very important.    Meanwhile, matters concerning relations between Iran and  Turkey will be discussed once again when President Suleyman  Demirel visits Tehran in July. The two countries are expected  to draw up an effective plan to strengthen their bilateral  cooperation in the near future.     "

Finland supports Estonian oil cleanup efforts at sea. The  environment ministers of both countries, Andres Tarand and Sirpa  Pietikainen, agreed last Wednesday in Helsinki that Finland  would support Estonian oil cleanup operations by offering, among  other things, training, equipment, and expert help. Finland also  agreed not to charge Estonia for all the costs involved in  cleaning up after oil spills in Estonian waters.    The Finnish aid is financed by, among other things, adjacent  area cooperation funds.    Finland intends to continue its support during a five-year  transitional period, but the period may be extended, if  necessary.    On the other hand, the permanent agreement signed by the  environment ministers is based on equality, as each country is  obligated to lend assistance in case of oil spills. The  agreement provides the basis for cooperation between  environmental protection authorities in case an oil spill  accident happens in the Gulf of Finland.    Russian oil, for example, is exported through Estonian ports  for foreign destinations.    Estonia's defenses against oil spills are still quite weak.  The country has two vessels with oil recovery equipment. In  addition, the Estonian Board of Navigation has ordered from  Finland two 18-meter-long workboats. There is also some other  oil spill equipment in the country. Senior inspector Olli  Pahkala from the Ministry of the Environment said that the oil  companies at the new oil terminal in Tallinn had acquired their  own oil spill equipment.    Cooperation and Experiences    The cooperation between Finland and Estonia was put to the  test last January when the coastal tanker Kihnu leaked oil into  the waters of Tallinn. Two oil cleanup vessels and a sea rescue  helicopter were rushed from Finland to provide help.    Sources at the National Board of Waters and the Environment  told us that a bill covering the expenses had not yet been sent  to Kihnu's owners. The board has been unable to issue a bill as  it has not yet, in its turn, received all the outstanding bills  from other agencies that participated in the operation.    Tarand Thanked for the Help    The ministers also signed a joint planning agreement and  program for 1994. In addition, Tarand and Pietikainen have  conducted negotiations regarding environmental cooperation  between the two countries .    Tarand thanked for the help with a pleased smile: ``Of all  environmental aid received by Estonia, about half has come from  Finland.''    Pietikainen, on her part, praised the Estonian efforts to  protect its shores. The country's coastline has been protected  from builders.     "

On the date of his upcoming visit to Baghdad, Velayati said  that an expert delegation will go to Baghdad and will designate  the date for the visit of the two countries' foreign ministers.    He described the United Nations Resolution 598 as the ground  for consolidation of Tehran-Baghdad relations and said that the  implementation of the United Nations resolution positive steps  [as received] would be taken to strengthen bilateral relations.    Asked about Iran's view on the developments in Yemen,  Velayati said that Iran's policy favors unity and territorial  integrity of Yemen. ""We believe that the crisis in Yemen can be  resolved through peaceful means,"" velayati Said.    On Iran's support for Bosnian Muslims, he said that despite  some claims, Iran has not dispatched forces to interfere in  Bosnian affairs directly. Instead it has repeatedly announced  its readiness to dispatch 10,000-strong peacekeeping force to  Bosnia under the banner of the Nia Oionsxmh [as received].  Answering a question on the export of the revolution, Velayati  said that Iran was against the so called forcible export of the  revolution, calling the allegation that Iran is using force to  promote its revolution as ""the fabrication of the western  propaganda machine.""    The Islamic Republic of Iran regards strengthening of  regional cooperation as an important principle and makes efforts  to expand activities of the Economic Cooperation Organization  (ECO) and the organization of the Caspian Sea Littoral States to  stregthen ties among neighbouring states, he said.    Velayati described his talks with German officials as  positive and said that the talks opened a new chapter in  bilateral relations in the framework of ECO and the European  Union (EU).     "

That is 400 million U.S. dollars more than in 1992,  resulting  from stable bilateral relations and complementary economies. It  shows a strong momentum for the two sides' trade and economic  cooperation.    Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)  figures show that in the first ten months of this year, this  trade volume reached 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.    ""Latin America, among China's trade partners, has jumped  from  no. 5 to no. 4, following Asia, Europe and North America,"" said  Wang Zhiquan, a MOFTEC official responsible for trade with Latin  America.    Wang attributed the thriving trade mainly to the frequent  summit contacts between China and Latin American countries.    Chinese President Jiang Zemin toured Cuba and Brazil in  November and the presidents of Uruguay, Dominica, Guyana and  Mexico visited China one after the other.    ""The visits have offered a favorable environment for the  further expansion of Sino-Latin American trade, "" Wang said.    During the visits, agreements were reached in the fields of  economy, trade, investment, and scientific and technological  cooperation. Some of the Latin American countries are  negotiating with China for accords on scrapping double tariffs.    ""A sound legal foundation has been laid for the growth of  Sino-American trade,"" Wang said.    China has been a traditional importer of Latin America's  major exports, such as copper, iron ore, steel, petrochemicals,  paper pulp, timber, wool, grain and leather.    China's exports to these countries have been commodities of  choice because of their good quality and reasonable price.    ""We have shipped more machinery and electronic products to  Latin America. They are leading items next only to light  industrial goods among all China's exports to that region in  1993,"" he said.    As China is vigorously developing its economy and looming as  a huge market, it welcomes Latin American businesses to invest  and produce here with their technology and resources,"" Wang said.    China has established over 80 joint ventures and enterprises  with exclusive Chinese financing in 17 Latin American countries.    On the possible effect of the North America Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) on Sino-Latin American trade relations, Wang  held that the competition will be fiercer on the American market  for labor-intensive products, as the United States will shift  its labor-intensive industries, such as textiles, garment-making  and shoe-making industries, to Mexico to take advantage of the  cheap labor and resources there.    However, China will be given more opportunities of trade and  economic cooperation when the economies of Mexico and other  Latin American countries are spurred in the wake of the NAFTA  implementation.

Foreign Aerospace Firms  Provide One-Third of the Orders for the Largest Aviation  Scientific Research Institute""]    [Text] The TsAGI (Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute) in  Zhukovskiy in the Moscow region and its Moscow affiliate in the  former USSR carried out virtually all the theoretical work and  static tests of aviation technology. The institute has an  entirely modern and the world's largest ensemble of wind tunnels  (more than 60) for the wind tunnel testing of aircraft and their  models. Now, when orders from the principal client, the Ministry  of Defense of the Russian Federation, have ceased, the volume of  these tests has been reduced by a factor of three. Research  related to the Buran spaceship, for which TsAGI had constructed  unique test stands such as even NASA does not have, has been  stopped in its tracks.    Nevertheless, today the institute is supplied with resources  adequate for carrying out research, development, testing and  engineering work at the very highest technical level (40%  of  the TsAGI orders are received from the Russian space and defense  industry, the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy and the  Russian Space Agency, 27-30% of the work is funded by  agreements with aviation design bureaus and the rest is earned  by filling orders from foreign aerospace companies).    Among the foreign partners the first place is occupied by  the  Boeing Corporation, with which the institute has been  cooperating since 1991. Major orders have been placed by French,  but also by German, Indian, Japanese, South Korean and British  companies (research on the An-226 ""Mriya-Hotol"" aerospace  transport system has already been carried out in collaboration  with British Aerospace for more than 2.5 years).    Cooperation with Chinese enterprises is developing in three  directions: testing of models of civilian aircraft,  modernization of the aerodynamic base of the Chinese People's  Republic, reoutfitting of plants producing helicopters.    In the words of German Zagaynov, TsAGI director, there is an  extremely high probability that some foreign producers of  passenger aircraft will turn to the institute for carrying out  tests and certifications of those planes which may be in demand  in the Russian market.    The TsAGI also is developing industrial equipment for  agriculture, fuel and energy complex branches, medicine and  metallurgy. Solar cells for the heating of cottages enjoy a  great demand. The institute has served as an organizer for  establishing the ""Regional Scientific-Industrial Association of  the Southeast Moscow Region,"" which is concerned with the  conversion of defense technologies. It is proposed that it will  include aerospace enterprises located at Zhukovskiy, Ramenskoye,  Lyubertsy, Lytkarino, Reutovo and Balashikha.    Telephone: TsAGI: (095) 556-42-05     "
0,FT931-8555 ,"FT931-8555 _AN-DBRCKAF4FT 930218   FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fragile Opec deal leaves credibility gap - Sticking to quotas will be even harder than agreeing them      By MARK NICHOLSON   ALTHOUGH IT proved harder for the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reach its agreement on second quarter output than most member countries had expected, the hardest part is still to come: sticking to it. By the time ministers gathered in Vienna last Saturday, the oil market had already discounted the main elements of the deal reached late on Tuesday. Strong signals from Saudi Arabia and Iran during a pre-meeting tour by Mr Alirio Parra, the Opec president, that they wanted to remove at least 1m b/d from the cartel's first quarter ceiling of 24.58m b/d had added more than Dollars 1.5 to the price of a barrel. Opec will largely succeed in its aim of shoring up prices, therefore, if it can hold that premium. But this will rely entirely upon member countries holding hard to their respective allocations and actually delivering a ceiling of 23.58m b/d from March 1 - thus taking 1.4m b/d off the market, given Opec's leakage earlier in the year. Saudi Arabia, the architect of the deal, and Iran both said in Vienna that they would immediately begin notifying customers of their allocated cuts under the agreement - statements the cartel's two biggest producers hoped might add some credibility to the Vienna deal. The kingdom has said it will cut by 400,000 b/d to 8m b/d, while Iran is to trim to 3.34m b/d from 3.49m b/d. Industry analysts attending the meeting were unanimous that the agreement would offer real support to prices only once it became clear in mid-March if Opec members were keeping their word. Several suggested that even with some leakage, perhaps to a real output figure of 23.7m b/d or even 23.8m b/d, prices might still find support. European traders did not seem impressed yesterday, however, and nearby prices for Brent crude slipped back below Dollars 18 a barrel. The agreement's fragility was signalled clearly by Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Kuwait oil minister. After having bowed with enormous reluctance and only after four days of stern pressure from Saudi Arabia and Iran to cut Kuwaiti production to 1.6m b/d for the second quarter, he said: 'I'm going to watch this market; and any additional barrel or two and I am at liberty'. If there was any cheating elsewhere, he said, Kuwait would immediately pump to what it claims will be a 2.1m b/d capacity in the second quarter. The tough wrangling that finally brought Kuwait back within a regime of Opec allocations for the first time since the Gulf war revealed a more serious flaw in the latest agreement, however. Kuwait agreed to its cut only on condition that at the next Opec meeting in June it will be accorded a third quarter ceiling 'in parity with the production allocation to other countries with similar production capacity, historical market share and quota'. It took eight hours of negotiation for Opec members to agree this wording on Tuesday and thus enable a deal-finalising communique. But it became apparent soon after the communique's release that there was no real agreement on what it meant. Mr al-Baghli said immediately after the meeting that this represented an 'explicit agreement' that Kuwait would be awarded parity with the United Arab Emirates when allocations for the third quarter are decided at Opec's next meeting in June. Kuwait and the UAE were both awarded quotas of 1.5m b/d under Opec's last formal quota system, agreed in July 1990, just before the Gulf war. Before the war both countries had roughly similar production capacity of around 2.5m b/d. Under the present deal the UAE will pump 2.1m b/d. Kuwait was determined above all at the latest meeting that it should re-establish its claim to its pre-Gulf war share of Opec output, even though its oil industry had not yet physically reached the point where it could sustain pre-war capacity. Mr al-Baghli said on Tuesday that he considered that battle won. Minutes after Mr al-Baghli spoke, however, his Iranian counterpart, Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh said that the communique gave absolutely no guarantee that Kuwait would be given any sort of parity when ministers met again in June, with the UAE or anyone else. 'Maybe that's Kuwait's perception,' he said curtly. Iran opposed any mention of parity or any overt reference to Kuwait's special post-war circumstances largely because it already had its eyes on Iraq's eventual return to the oil market. Before the Gulf war, and under a hard-bargained Opec compromise between the two big Gulf neighbours reached during the Iran-Iraq war, both countries were awarded exact parity at a quota of 3.14m b/d. Above all things, Iran now wants there to be no precedent set that might tie them back into parity with Iraq. Iran says it has already spent Dollars 3.5bn on raising output capacity towards a target of 4.5m b/d by March and hopes to go on to achieve an eventual sustainable capacity of 6m b/d. Whenever Iraq returns to the market, once the UN agrees that it has met all the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire and sanctions are lifted, it will do so with considerably lower output capacity than Iran - even given that most industry estimates say Tehran's claims for present capacity are inflated. Iraq is certain to latch firmly on to any precedent Opec has set for Kuwait during its post-war reconstruction and Iran fears this means it will seek to achieve agreement that it should once again be tied into an equivalent quota to its neighbour. Indeed, Iraq said firmly after the latest deal that it regarded the July 1990 quota system, with its entrenched parity between Iran and Iraq, as the sole benchmark for Opec allocations. However successful Opec is, therefore, in achieving its target for the second quarter, its members have already drawn the battle lines for a far tougher fight in June over market share. Iraq's return to the market is still somewhat distant - indeed Saudi Arabia is confident that the country will never re-enter the market fully while Saddam Hussein remains in power. But the arguments to accommodate Iraq have begun and are likely to detain Opec delegates for much longer than four days when they next meet in June.

Cetin was speaking to reporters at a joint press conference  with his Israeli counterpart Shim'on Peres, at the conclusion of  Turkey-Israel official talks.    He said during the talks both countries have agreed on  Turkey's more active participation to the Middle East peace  process.    Cetin also said that visa applications will not be required  for Turkish citizens who want to visit Israel, adding that  Israel will not ask for a visa from Turkish businessmen or from  those visiting the country for cultural reasons.    Stressing the existence of a great cooperation potential  between the two countries, Cetin said agreements on incitement  and protection of investments, prevention of double-taxation and  technological cooperation will be concluded at the soonest.    Peres said that Turkey is a country that can play an  important role in many ways for the future of the Middle East,  adding his country gives great importance to its relations and  ties with Ankara.    He said that the fact that Turkey is a secular and  democratic  Moslem country at the same time having very good relations with  Israel gives it the possibility of being a ""bridge"" between  different cultures.    Peres also underlined the possibility for cooperation with  Turkey and the United States for investments in the Central  Asian republics.    He said that Turkey is the only country with enough water  for  its needs in a region where water has become as important as  oil, adding countries such as his own which are in need of water  could buy from Turkey and he has discussed this topic with Cetin.    On the Israeli pullout from Jericho and the West Bank  according to an agreement signed earlier between the PLO and  Israel, Peres said this would only be completed by the end of  the month.    Answering a reporter's question on the use of Turkish waters  for meeting the needs of the Middle East region, Cetin said  there exists a number of possibilities.    The first posibility is the use of the Manavgat river in the  Mediterranean Province of Antalya which flows into the sea, by  collecting its waters for transport to needy Middle Eastern  countries.    The second choice is the transfer of the waters of the  Euphrates and the Tigris in the southeast, via pipeline to the  Middle East region.    Cetin said Turkey considers its waters as ""peace waters"" and  not ""conflict waters.""     "

According to foreign wire service reports, Li is scheduled  to  visit the tourist island of Bali this week. During his  three-day stay, Li will meet with Indonesian President Suharto  and Minister of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie.    Indonesia is one of the major targets in Taipei's ""southern  strategy"" launched late last year to promote bilateral  cooperation with Southeast Asia. Other countries targeted by  the plan include Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.    During his visit to Indonesia, Li is expected to raise the  question of Taiwan's planned US$10 billion investment on the  island of Batam, 20 kilometers southeast of Singapore.    Taipei is attaching even greater importance to Indonesia  these days because Indonesia is the current chairman country of  the non- aligned movement and the host of the 1994 Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meetings.    Taiwan, with 56 investments worth more than US$1.056  billion,  was the biggest investor country in Indonesia in 1991, according  to Indonesian Government statistics.    In 1993, Taiwan investments dropped to 21 projects worth  US$131 million. And by the beginning of this year, Taiwan's  ranking slid to fourth place, behind Japan, Hong Kong and the  Netherlands.    Local economic analysts attributed the decrease in Taiwan  investments in Indonesia to increasing Taiwan investments in  Mainland China and Vietnam.    Indonesia, however, is expected to become the best choice  for  Taiwan investors in 1994, rather than Vietnam, according to Liu  Tai-ying, chairman of the Taiwan Institute for Research.    With its Five-Year National Economic Development Plan  reaching maturity, Indonesia is expected to record 7 percent  economic growth this year, Liu said.    Taiwan investors will succeed in Indonesia if they choose  the  right businesses with right partners, he added.    Economics Minister P.K. Chiang, who visited Indonesia twice  recently, said Taiwan Sugar Corp.'s plan to set up a sugar  refinery in Indonesia will be a good beginning for Taiwan's  state-run enterprises to explore the rich raw materials resource  and cheap labor force in that country.    Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinatrust Commercial Bank  which  has established business links with Indonesia and other  Southeast Asian countries, said Taiwan should emulate the  Japanese formula by locating Taiwan banks in Indonesia where the  banks can directly serve Taiwan investors.    Koo added that peripheral industries, including service  industry, to help with investment are difficult to find in  Indonesia. He suggested that potential investors should form  their own investment army, including up-mid- and down-stream  operations.     "

Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, who left Manila  yesterday after concluding a six day visit, disagreed with the  Philippines' views that the EAEC will be a ""meaningful bridge""  between ASEAN and the developed countries.    Evans stressed the EAEC, a sub-regional grouping within  Asia,  was ""potentially divisive.""    ""I think it's very dangerous to the region to develop into  splits or fissures down the Pacific, as between the North  American and East Asian economies. We've seen the dangers that  may be involved in that,"" Evans explained.    Evans cited the recent trade disagreements between the  United  States and Japan and the United States and China. He said these  potential splits within the Asia-Pacific may be transformed into  wide divisions in the world trade areas if the EAEC pushes  through.    He said that it would be more conducive and productive to  develop the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which  brings together trade powers from both sides of the Pacific  including the United States, China and Japan.    Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo disagreed with  Evans' position, stressing that the EAEC, a concept spearheaded  by Malaysia, was a ""value-added"" item to APEC-member countries.    Romulo said Evans needs to be educated on the EAEC concept  so  that he would understand the positive effects of the forum  within APEC.    The EAEC was conceived as a loose forum for APEC-member  countries in Asia to discuss achievements gained and informal  agreements arrived at during the APEC meeting last November in  Seattle.    The EAEC has the support in the ASEAN which groups the  Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and  Indonesia. It has invited Japan to the forum but shut its doors  to the United States and other North American countries .    ""I guess we need to enlighten (Evans) further,"" adding he  was  informing other EAEC members of Australia's position on the  issue.    Evans, however, supported the Philippines' stand in opposing  the use of non-trade issues such as human rights and labor  conditions on developing countries as prerequisites to trade  relations with rich nations.    He stressed that while Australia puts priority in its human  rights campaign, it shuns the use of this issue as a  protectionist tool by developed countries such as the United  States.    The United States recently granted its most favored nation  status on trade to China, although earlier it had contemplated  tying up the issue with China's human rights record .     "

Finland supports Estonian oil cleanup efforts at sea. The  environment ministers of both countries, Andres Tarand and Sirpa  Pietikainen, agreed last Wednesday in Helsinki that Finland  would support Estonian oil cleanup operations by offering, among  other things, training, equipment, and expert help. Finland also  agreed not to charge Estonia for all the costs involved in  cleaning up after oil spills in Estonian waters.    The Finnish aid is financed by, among other things, adjacent  area cooperation funds.    Finland intends to continue its support during a five-year  transitional period, but the period may be extended, if  necessary.    On the other hand, the permanent agreement signed by the  environment ministers is based on equality, as each country is  obligated to lend assistance in case of oil spills. The  agreement provides the basis for cooperation between  environmental protection authorities in case an oil spill  accident happens in the Gulf of Finland.    Russian oil, for example, is exported through Estonian ports  for foreign destinations.    Estonia's defenses against oil spills are still quite weak.  The country has two vessels with oil recovery equipment. In  addition, the Estonian Board of Navigation has ordered from  Finland two 18-meter-long workboats. There is also some other  oil spill equipment in the country. Senior inspector Olli  Pahkala from the Ministry of the Environment said that the oil  companies at the new oil terminal in Tallinn had acquired their  own oil spill equipment.    Cooperation and Experiences    The cooperation between Finland and Estonia was put to the  test last January when the coastal tanker Kihnu leaked oil into  the waters of Tallinn. Two oil cleanup vessels and a sea rescue  helicopter were rushed from Finland to provide help.    Sources at the National Board of Waters and the Environment  told us that a bill covering the expenses had not yet been sent  to Kihnu's owners. The board has been unable to issue a bill as  it has not yet, in its turn, received all the outstanding bills  from other agencies that participated in the operation.    Tarand Thanked for the Help    The ministers also signed a joint planning agreement and  program for 1994. In addition, Tarand and Pietikainen have  conducted negotiations regarding environmental cooperation  between the two countries .    Tarand thanked for the help with a pleased smile: ""Of all  environmental aid received by Estonia, about half has come from  Finland.""    Pietikainen, on her part, praised the Estonian efforts to  protect its shores. The country's coastline has been protected  from builders.     "

Exports grew 13.6 percent during the first two months, 11.3  percentage points higher than the same period last year.  Imports, meanwhile jumped 20.5 percent, down 2.5 percentage  points from a year ago.    Still, this left a trade deficit of $1.24 billion.    ""From past experience, the beginning of a year is usually a  period for more exports because commodities for export,  especially agriculture products, are abundant at the time,"" said  Wang Huaian, an economist with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation (Moftec).    At the same time, seasonal imports usually ebb because most  domestic units are still drawing up plans for the year's  imports, he said. Wang added that imports usually peak in the  latter half of the year.    ""It will be difficult for China to achieve a 1O percent  growth in exports this year because there exist some  unfavourable factors,"" Wang said.    The domestic market will continue to be brisk this year, he  said, deterring enterprises from exporting their goods.  Domestic price hikes squeeze exports by making them more  expensive and trimming profit margins.    The devaluation of the renminbi, brought by the unification  of the dual-track exchange rate system, has also reduced its  purchasing power at home and pushed up the cost of exports, Wang  said.    He noted that the pressure for imports is still rather  strong  this year.    The government hopes to slow down the growth of the economy.  The official target this year is 9 percent growth in the gross  domestic product.    But many local authorities are staking their plans on higher  growth.    Such an economic expansion will surely stimulate the demand  for imports, he said.    China wishes to set up more foreign-funded enterprises to  bring in large quantities of imported equipment.    To improve its chances of re-entering the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he said, China is opening its  markets wider to worldwide competition. The government has  lowered tariffs and cancelled import licenses and quotas for  numerous products.    Because of these factors, Wang said a trade deficit seems  inevitable this year.    But the deficit could be slashed from last year's $12.2  billion because of some positive factors, he said.    The rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production  will provide more products for export, and the convergence of  renminbi exchange rates can facilitate exports and curb imports.     "

They are growing  dynamically in the Urals region and Western Siberia (especially  in the Tyumen and Tomsk regions), in the north and north-west of  the European part of the Russian Federation, in the North  Caucasian region (Krasnodar and Stavropol territories) and in  the Volga area (especially in the Samara and Nizhni Novgorod  regions and Tatarstan).    Regions have broad rights in matters of the attraction of  foreign investments. They may conclude agreements on economic  cooperation with regions of foreign countries. These are as a  rule geographically close territories.    According to forecasts, the sectoral structure of foreign  investments in the Russian Federation should in the next few  years change towards the production sphere (up to 70 percent of  foreign investments), the priority sectors being:    oil and gas production;    conversion of the defence industry;    agricultural production and other branches of the  agro-industrial complex;    material and technical equipment of business infrastructure;    industrial application of the results of research and  technical development.    Following are the most important institutions which are  being  formed in Russia for purposes of investment cooperation:    The Russian Agency of International Cooperation and  Development which has replaced the committee for foreign  investments and the committee for technical cooperation with the  World Bank. The agency effects the state policy in the sphere of  international financial and investment cooperation.    The State Investment Corporation whose main  function is the activization of the investment process and the  pursuance of the state investment policy. The corporation  effects the entire investment process, has a considerable  mortgage fund of property worth one billion dollars and an  authorized capital of 50 million dollars and 200 billion  roubles. It is establishing an investment bank, an insurance  company and sectoral insurance funds and plans to set up  foreign branches and offices.    The Russian Financial Corporation attracts, along  with the use of state investment credits and credits of the  Central Bank of Russia, funds of commercial banks and foreign  investors. It has the right to grant state guarantees to foreign  investors.    The international agency for insuring foreign  investments in the Russian Federation from noncommercial  risks was formed by a decree of the President of the  Russian Federation on February 26, 1993. Its main task is to set  up an insurance system which should grant concrete financial  guarantees to foreign investors in addition to the guarantees  offered by the Russian legislation and Russia's obligations  under international treaties.

By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      With gasoline prices less than a penny per gallon below the all-time record,  consumers have responded by cutting back on their use of gasoline and switching  to less-pricey grades.    Driven by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait 11 weeks ago, the price of regular  unleaded self-serve gasoline has risen on average more than 30 cents a gallon  nationally since Aug. 1 to nearly $1.38 a gallon, the American Automobile Assn.  reported this week.    In Los Angeles, the price for the same grade of gasoline climbed more than 23  cents a gallon to about $1.34 as of Oct. 5, according to the latest figures  from the Lundberg Survey.    Meanwhile, federal investigators are trying to nail down proof that oil  companies colluded to raise prices. Earlier this month, they issued subpoenas  to oil companies and refiners for internal documents.    Legislators and consumer groups continue to accuse the industry of  price-gouging and profiteering, because gasoline prices rose so quickly and so  sharply after the Aug. 2 invasion.    Connecticut and Massachusetts quickly enacted emergency anti-price gouging  measures similar to one already in force in New York, and Sen. Joseph I.  Lieberman (D-Conn.) is pushing a federal anti-gouging bill designed to prevent  a future gasoline price shock.    For their part, oil industry officials have steadfastly denied charges of  price-fixing, arguing that the price hikes merely reflect the workings of the  marketplace.    ""We believe (the investigations) will show, as they have in the past, that the  market is working, and that there are just too many transactions involving too  many people to engage in collusive activity,"" said Joe Lastelic, a spokesman  for the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group.    Industry officials added that gasoline price hikes have failed to keep pace  with the rapid run-up in prices of crude oil, from which gasoline is made.  Refiners and marketers of gasoline, they note, are now losing money.    On Wednesday, the price of light, sweet crude oil for November delivery fell  $2.17 a barrel to $36.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The  sharp drop was only the latest move in a volatile market characterized recently  by dramatic increases and declines almost daily.    Even if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein pulls out of Kuwait tomorrow and crude  prices plummet, gasoline prices are expected to lag by weeks. That would give  refiners time to recover losses incurred during the period of high crude  prices, analysts said.    ""On the upside, everyone says that gasoline prices move up immediately, but on  the downside, they move with a lag"" behind crude oil prices, said John  Lichtblau, president of the industry-funded Petroleum Industry Research  Foundation in New York. ""This time, they will follow with a considerable lag.""    The automobile association reported that the nationwide increase in gasoline  prices has slowed. Still, the average national price of $1.379 a gallon is just  a hair short of the record price of $1.388 a gallon reported the weekend before  Easter, 1981, during the Iran-Iraq war.    As a result, demand for gasoline is off. Demand last month was 1.5% lower than  a year ago, a higher-than-usual drop attributable in part to the higher prices,  the petroleum institute reported Wednesday.    Meanwhile, drivers reportedly are switching in droves from higher-priced  premium blends to regular gasolines, though there's no clear data on the trend.    Prices are expected to continue rising to make up for the continuing run-up of  crude oil prices.    Compared to the 30-cent-a-gallon hike in retail gasoline prices, the cash price  of the benchmark U.S. grade of crude oil has risen more than 42 cents a gallon  since Aug. 1. As the price of crude oil goes up, the cost of making gasoline  goes up. If the price of gasoline does not follow, the profit margin for  gasoline shrinks.    Because the hike in gasoline prices has not kept pace with crude prices,  international oil companies are expected to report that refining and marketing  profits fell 52% in the third quarter, which included August and September,  according to a report by Salomon Bros.    That would more than offset the 50% increase expected in earnings from  exploration and production operations, due to higher crude oil prices.    Still, industry critics charge that the oil industry conspired to unfairly  raise gasoline prices. Wholesale and retail gasoline prices jumped as much as  10 cents a gallon within days of the invasion, even though that gasoline was  refined from crude oil purchased weeks earlier at much lower prices.    The industry argued at the time that such rapid increases were intended to  cover the anticipated higher replacement costs of crude oil and to reflect the  greater influence of spot and futures markets, where prices react almost  instantaneously to world events.    But such explanations didn't satisfy regulators.    The Department of Justice launched an investigation into the price hikes on  Aug. 6. After interviewing industry executives, the department took the further  step of issuing subpoenas for company records.    Several states have pressed similar investigations, though California deferred  to the feds. ""All of the prices were going up pretty much in unison, and the  question arose: Was there a possible antitrust violation? Did they get together  and raise their prices in a conspiracy?"" said Joe Bizzaro, spokesman for  Florida Atty. Gen. Bob Butterworth. Florida issued subpoenas to 16 major oil  companies operating in that state.    Analysts and industry observers doubt that the investigations would turn up  evidence of an actual back room conspiracy. ""They don't need to collude,"" said  Ed Rothschild, director of energy policy for Citizen Action, a Washington-based  consumer group. ""Communication is so readily available, they are aware of the  pricing decisions they and others make in the marketplace all the time.""    Short of finding conspiracy, there's little the federal government can do about  the rapid price run-ups.    Lieberman is proposing a federal law that would regulate price hikes, similar  to a law in New York that prevents retailers from raising prices faster than  their costs increase. The industry opposes the measure.    In New York, the state attorney general's office is investigating whether  petroleum refiners or marketers violated the price-gouging law, and subpoenas  were issued to service station operators.    But initial results of the investigations suggest the limits of such laws.  Investigators found that retailers were merely passing on wholesale price  hikes, said Edward Barbini, a spokesman for New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams.  ""We don't see a widespread pattern of (price-gouging) at this time,"" he said.  The state's law does not extend to wholesale price hikes, said Edward Barbini,  a spokesman for New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams.    PUMP PRICES: Average retail and wholesale prices of regular and premium  unleaded gasoline in Los Angeles, including cash and credit card prices and  taxes.

K.: ""Hungarian President's Visit to Poland:  Motion Requesting Membership in Union""]    [Text] In the near future, Poland and Hungary will  introduce motions requesting recognition of their full  membership in the EU, said Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski  after his meeting with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. The  Hungarian leader began his three-day visit to our state  yesterday.    Hungary will most likely introduce a motion regarding its  full EU membership by 1 April, and we will do so some time  later, added the chief of the Polish diplomatic service. He  also stated that, during an earlier meeting in the Belweder, the  Polish and the Hungarian presidents discussed, above all, the  international situation. Arpad Goncz and Lech Walesa agreed  that their views on the subject coincide entirely, stated  Olechowski.    Both leaders acknowledge that regional cooperation is a ""key  goal"" for the Middle and East European states. During his talks  with Lech Walesa, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz stressed that,  in addition to centrifugal forces, the Visegrad Group has  ""stable prospects for future development.""    Discussing cooperation among the Visegrad Group states,  President Lech Walesa stated that ""some [states] do not want to  achieve some of the goals alone."" He added that ""not  everything develops the way we would like it to develop"" because  ""we are not doing things together.""    At the Belweder, the Polish president awarded the Hungarian  guest with the Order of the White Eagle, and the Hungarian  president, in his turn, awarded Lech Walesa with the Hungarian  Great Cross of the Order of Honor.    Premier Waldemar Pawlak, who was received by the Hungarian  president at his residence, said that the subject of their  meeting was connected with political and economic cooperation  between the two countries. They also discussed the ""Partnership  for Peace"" program. Recalling the negotiations addressing the  Central European free trade area, the Polish prime minister  disclosed the wish to speed up the realization of this agreement.    President Goncz also met with Marshal of the Sejm Jozef  Oleksy. The Hungarian leader spoke in favor of the admission of  Slovenia and Croatia--after the war in former Yugoslavia is  over--to the Visegrad Group.    Minister Olechowski stressed that the ""Partnership for  Peace""  program and joint efforts of NATO and the Middle and East  European states to begin cooperating in military areas serve the  faster rapprochement of the two states.    The chief of the Polish diplomatic service added that,  despite the closeness of their policies, the Hungarian and  Polish Governments differ in treating ethnic minorities.    ""If the future of the Visegrad Group depended on only our  will, it would have developed dynamically,"" said Olechowski. In  his opinion, the governments of the two states believe that the  slowing down of the development within this group is only  temporary.     "

President Li, who was reported to have  left the Philippines for Indonesia yesterday, is expected to  arrive in Thailand on Monday on the last leg of a regional tour  that Beijing strongly opposes.    Squadron Leader Prasong said the Taiwanese president  arranged  the trip to Thailand through the private sector and that there  were no plans for him to meet Prime Minister Chuan Likphai or  other Cabinet ministers. The Foreign Minister reaffirmed  Bangkok's one-China policy but he pointed out that this did not  exclude economic relations. Thailand and Taiwan are co-members  of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.    Sqn Ldr Prasong made the points after meeting China's  Ambassador-designate Jing Guihua, who made a second trip to the  Foreign Ministry yesterday, to make sure that the Foreign  Minister had received Peking's protest note.    The envoy had delivered Peking's protest to Permanent  Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem on Tuesday, when  the Foreign Minister was absent.    The envoy presented his credentials to His Majesty the King  yesterday afternoon, after meeting Sqn Ldr Prasong.    ""I informed him [the Chinese envoy] that the Thai Government  did not issue the invitation, and that the Foreign Ministry had  received no communication on the matter,"" Sqn Ldr Prasong sald.    ""They [the Taiwanese] contacted the private sector,"" he  said.  Thailand broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan when it  normalised relations with China on July 1, 1975.    ""We respect the agreement and we have a one-China policy,""  Sqn Ldr Prasong said. Thailand did not intervene in the  political problems between China and Taiwan which were ""their  internal affair"". But economic relations were a different  matter, especially when Thailand and Taiwan were co-members of  APEC. Exchanges of visits for talks on economics and trade were  ""possible"".    China is also a member of the 15-nation grouping, which  rallies all six member states of the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN) and their main trading partners. In a  statement issued on Monday, Beijing warned regional states of  possible damage to ""friendly relations"" between them and China  if they endorse ""in whatever name or form"" Mr Li's visits.    Taiwan is a major investor in the region. According to  informed sources, the Taiwanese president is accompanied by  First Lady Cheng Wen-hui. Foreign Minister Fredrick Chien,  economic planning agency chief Vincent Siew, deputy secretary to  the president Tai Jui-ming and Nationalist Party  secretary-general Hsu Hsui-teh.    Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin is  reported to be planning visits to Thailand and other ASEAN  member states in the second half of this year.     "

The widening of commercial and economic ties that has  begun now should become a stable tendency. Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said this at Hungarian-Russian  intergovernmental negotiations in Budapest on Thursday. The  negotiations of the delegations in an enlarged composition was  preceded by a one-on-one conversation between the Russian prime  minister and his Hungarian counterpart Peter Boross.    Special attention was given at the talks to the development  of cooperation between the two countries under the principles of  genuine equality, trust and respect for each other's interests,  ITAR-TASS learned from sources in the Russian delegation.  Chernomyrdin and Boross informed each other of the political and  economic situation in their countries and the pace of  transformations and reforms.    During the exchange of opinions of the development of  bilateral relations and the implementation of arrangements  reached at the summit level during Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's visit to Hungary in 1992, the participants in the  talks pointed to the need to step up joint efforts, to raise the  level of commercial and economic cooperation in accordance with  the potential of the two countries, to restore on new market  principles traditional economic ties and to set in motion new  financial and economic mechanisms.    The Russian side raised the question of the expediency of  concluding a free trade agreement between the two countries, as  well as encouragement of mutual investment, establishment of  cooperation introducion and of direct ties between enterprises  and regions.    Topical international problems, including the situation in  Europe and processes of European integration, have also been  discussed at the talks. Positively assessing the level of  interaction between Russia and Hungary in foreign policy,  Chernomyrdin said that the ensurance of stability and  consolidation of security in Europe should become the main  tendency of that interaction.    Russia proposes the creation of an integrated European  security system on a basis of cooperation and equality regarding  the consolidation of cardinal political role of CSCE, the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, as a top  priority.    During the negotiations the Russian side noted that NATO's  initiative ""Partnership for Peace"" had become an important step  in shaping universal European structure of military-political  cooperation.    A meeting of the Hungarian-Russian intergovernmetnal  commission of commercial and economic cooperation was held in  the parliament building on the same day. Bela Kadar, Hungarian  minister of international economic relations, said in a brief  remark after the meeting that ways to pay off Russia's trading  debt to Hungary loomed large in the debate. An arrangement on  problems discussed has in principle been reached.     "

According to Li Shouren, chief engineer of the Ministry of  Machine-Building Industry, the Three Gorges Project will need a  total of 26 large generating sets, each with a 700,000 kw  capacity. The design and manufacturing process for the hydraulic  turbine -- one of the largest hydropower units in the world,  each with a wheel about 9.85 meters in length -- require fairly  high technical standards. In recent years, China's  machine-building industry has made many attempts to solve major  technical problems and other preparations for the manufacturing  of such power units. As a result, it has been equipped  basically with the ability to manufacture such large hydropower  units.    In consideration of the possibility that foreign funds may  be  used in the Three Gorges Project, as well as for the purpose of  guaranteeing that the technology and quality of such power units  are of advanced-world levels and promoting China's standards in  developing and manufacturing power-generating equipment, the  state has made the following decision: The bid for the 26 large  hydropower units will be open for foreign companies around 1996.  The 12 generating sets, which are for the first-phase  construction project, shall be jointly designed and manufactured  by a foreign bid winner and the Harbin Electric Machine Plant  and the Dongfang Electric Machine Plant. The foreign company  shall be fully responsible to the China Three Gorges Project  Development Cooperation for technology, quality, and time of  delivery. The Chinese plants, in turn, shall be responsible to  the foreign company. During the joint production process, the  Chinese plants shall gradually increase the percentage of  locally made products in an effort to master design and  manufacturing ability. The other 14 units shall mainly be  manufactured at home, with the Chinese plants becoming major  suppliers of the goods.    It was learned that the 550,000 kw flow-type hydraulic  generating set for the Ertan power station shall be jointly  manufactured by the Dongfang Electric Machine Plant and the GE  Canada Company soon in accordance with the above-mentioned  method. Such a method shall be helpful in accumulating many  experiences for Chinese plants in terms of jointly developing  and manufacturing power generating units with foreign companies.  The Harbin Electric Machine Plant and the Dongfang Electric  Machine Plant, which are to be responsible for developing and  manufacturing power generating units for the Three Gorges  Project, are now making technical preparations.

This was recently announced by Lin Kun, a department  director  of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, who is responsible for foreign investment in China.    Reportedly in order to more rapidly boost the construction  of  transport facilities in all fields, China will adopt various  forms to encourage and attract foreign investment. China will  open its aviation market to foreign investors, and this is one  of the major actions to be taken. In fact, China's transport  industry, especially the air transport industry, is far from  being able to meet the needs of its economic development. Such  problems as insufficient transport capacity, backward  technology, poor management, a lack of competent personnel, and  the low safety coefficient have become increasingly serious and  have caused serious concern among people at home and abroad.    People in this industry pointed out that if China's air  transport industry is opened up to the world and introduces  advanced world equipment, management methods, and technology,  this will play a certain role in resolving the above-mentioned  problems and will help change the current backward condition of  the air transport industry and promote its healthy development.    Foreign investors have strong interest in the Chinese  mainland's huge air transport market, which has great  development potential. Aircraft maintenance and repair is a  major field of such investment. At present, China Southern  Airline, Rockefeller International Airplane Service Corporation  of the United States, and Hutchison Whampoa (China) of Hong Kong  have set up a joint venture in Guangzhou to offer aircraft  repair services.    In addition, Hong Kong Air Terminal Service Ltd. and Xiaman  International Economic and Technological Cooperation Corporation  have also signed an agreement to set up an aircraft maintenance  joint venture in Xiamen. Other Hong Kong companies  participating in the joint venture include the New World Group,  Kumagai (Hong Kong) Ltd., the Fok family, and Macao's Hainan  Tongao Economic Development and Investment Ltd.    Regulations on the operation of travel agents for  border-crossing air tickets were formulated before Director Lin  Kun announced the opening of China's aviation market. Travel  agents allowed to sell air tickets into China should have at  least 500,000 yuan of registered capital; and those being  allowed to sell air tickets out of China should have at least  1.5 million yuan of capital. They must have registered offices  inside China, and their personnel should have work experience in  the field of air transportation. After their applications are  approved, their business licenses will be valid for three years.     "

Ma  Xiuhong, a senior official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign  Trade  Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said yesterday that  the  ministry was examining how to modify the preferential treatment  to meet the requirements of GATT and its successor the World  Trade Organization (WTO).    ""Apparently, some of the preferential policies go against  the  GATT rules and should be modified appropriately. However, there  will be some phase-out periods, as shown by current GATT  members, which could still give preferential treatment to  foreign investors,"" Ma, the deputy director-general of the  ministry's foreign investment administration, said.    China hopes to join GATT this year before it is replaced by  the WTO.    Foreign investors who operate in China enjoy lower customs  tariffs, more tax incentives, and longer tax holidays than the  domestic enterprises, among other forms of preferential  treatment. The situation is further complicated by the fact that  foreign-funded ventures in the Special Economic Zones and  Economic Development Zones enjoy even better treatment.    Meanwhile, Ma said that she was confident that China would  get the renewal of the most favoured nation [MFN] trading status  from the U.S. ""I believe that the Sino-U.S. business  relationship will continue but there will still be quarrels in  the future.""    The U.S. President, Bill Clinton, must decide before June 3  whether MFN status, which gives China the lowest tariffs for its  goods, should be extended.    To illustrate growing confidence, Ma announced that China  would hold a large-scale trade and investment conference that  starts next Monday in Hong Kong, the largest of its kind to be  held in the territory. The conference, which lasts four days,  is jointly organised by the ministry and the Hong Kong Trade  Development Council. A team of 160 trade officials from four  Chinese ministries and 24 provinces and cities will seek foreign  investment on 800 projects involved in industries from  transportation to electronics. The Hong Kong conference comes  after China staged a similar large-scale conference in the  United States last month to drum up support from U.S. businesses  for the renewal of MFN.    During the conference, senior officials from the nine  ministries--including MOFTEC, the Ministry of Finance, the  People's Bank of China, and China Securities Regulatory  Commission -- will make presentations.    China has become the favoured destination for foreign  investors. Last year it approved 83,265 foreign-funded projects,  with the contract value of foreign investment at U.S.$110.85  billion (about HK$864.64bn) and a total amount of U.S.$25.76  billion actually invested.
