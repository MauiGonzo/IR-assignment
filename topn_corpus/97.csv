After a year-long review of US nuclear strategy, the administration decided against trying to move beyond the limits on nuclear warheads already agreed with Russia in the Start 2 strategic arms reduction treaty, which would cut the US arsenal from around 6,000 warheads to around 3,500. Mr Clinton overruled some senior administration officials who had argued that the US should pursue an agreement on still deeper cuts in the Russian and US nuclear forces. Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, was due to give details of the new nuclear policy yesterday evening. Earlier this week, however, he warned that Russia had fallen behind schedule in its programme for dismantling nuclear weapons. Military officials argued that the US needed to maintain an adequate security hedge against the risk of a reversal in Russia's progress towards democracy and its possible failure to complete its promised cuts. Mr Clinton is expected to offer more money for dismantling nuclear missiles when he meets President Boris Yeltsin in Washington next week. The US has decided, however, to trim its stockpile of short range tactical nuclear weapons, which will leave approximately 480 weapons in Europe. In addition, the US is expected to cut its fleet of nuclear missile submarines from 18 to 14, and reduce the number of B-52 bombers from 94 to 66, instead of complying with the Start 2 limits by having each submarine or bomber carry fewer warheads. The US is now concentrating its efforts on talks aimed at extending the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The White House yesterday also called on China to join the moratorium on nuclear test explosions declared by the other nuclear powers, and urged an acceleration of negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test ban.

Before departing from Tokyo's Haneda Airport, Nazarbayev  told  reporters that the central Asian country will proceed with  ongoing economic reform although he acknowledged it is  impossible to achieve the reform without ""pain."" He also said  that raising productivity through joint ventures with advanced  countries, such as Japan, that have high technologies would  contribute to preventing falling living standards of the people  in the former Soviet republic.    In a joint statement signed by Nazarbayev and Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa Friday, Japan pledged to allocate 1,170  million yen to Kazakhstan to help dismantle its nuclear arsenal  inherited from the former Soviet Union.    Tokyo will also provide a loan totaling 12,982 million yen  for improving railway infrastructure and tackling air pollution  from thermal power stations.    The Export-Import Bank of Japan will extend an untied loan  valued at 220 million dollars to support its transition to a  market economy.     "

'We are prepared to remove all SS-24s from military alert, but only if conditions discussed at these talks (with Russia and the US) are fulfilled.'

Officials in Kiev yesterday confirmed a report in the Moscow daily newspaper Izvestia that they had this week begun dismantling 10 of the country's 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles. The decision represents the first concrete step that Ukraine - which has come under fierce diplomatic pressure for failing to ratify two key international disarmament treaties - has taken to reduce its strategic nuclear arsenal since becoming independent nearly two years ago. In contrast with its often hostile reporting on Ukraine, Izvestia welcomed the action as a signal that 'although one swallow does not make a summer, it cannot be denied that the ice has been broken'. However, the Ukrainian move did not deter the Russian Foreign Ministry from issuing a tough statement condemning Kiev's decision earlier this month to claim ownership over nuclear warheads on its territory. In keeping with that decision, Ukrainian military officials said the warheads from the disabled missiles would be temporarily stored in Ukraine. At a press conference in Kiev Ukrainian Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma defended the ownership claim, saying it was necessary to ensure Ukraine received compensation for the valuable enriched uranium released when warheads are dismantled. But Mr Sergei Yastrzhembsky, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, warned Ukraine against going a step further and declaring itself a nuclear power, a move the Ukrainian prime minister and a large lobby in parliament favour as a temporary measure. 'Is it not clear that making Ukraine a nuclear state is tantamount to opening a Pandora's box, giving the go-ahead to the appearance of other nuclear states, putting an end to the non-proliferation of nuclear arms and saying No to nuclear disarmament?' Mr Yastrzhembsky asked. Kiev's tentative step toward disarmament, taken with little fanfare or attempt to win political credit from the west, does not rule out a future attempt by Ukraine to become a nuclear power. The 10 missiles which have been taken off military alert are Russian-manufactured SS-18s. Even Ukrainian hawks like Mr Kuchma support the dismantling of these weapons. Their position is that Ukraine should, at least temporarily, keep only the 46 SS-24 missiles on Ukrainian territory, which were made in Ukraine and are serviced by a Ukrainian factory.

Almaty is proposing the formation of a joint command. Moscow  has rejected this idea, because it would be a violation of its  international commitments.    There is general satisfaction that the Ukrainian option of  ""privatization"" of strategic missiles did not start a trend.  The Kazakh parliament, at its recent session, ratified the  Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons.    At the same time Russia looked on jealously at the  U.S.-Kazakh agreement, signed 13 December, on the safe  dismantling of nuclear warheads belonging to the strategic  arsenal of the former USSR. Washington promised to grant Almaty  $84 million out of the total sum of $1.2 billion allocated by  the U.S. Congress to the CIS countries for these purposes.  Russia, which has great experience in such operations, had  expected to find a common language with Kazakhstan and do the  dismantling itself.    In formal terms, all 108 SS-18 missiles stationed in  Kazakhstan, and the 1,400 warheads, are Russia's property. The  total value of their nuclear contents, after dismantling and  reprocessing, will amount to about $1 billion. The world  uranium market is strictly limited by IAEA [International Atomic  Energy Agency] guidelines. But the Americans would like to buy  all the uranium left after the warheads are dismantled, and have  made it clear to Kazakhstan that money is no object.    Almaty, having willingly renounced the status of a nuclear  power, expects to receive compensation for the missiles.  Nursultan Nazarbayev's edict banning the exportation from the  republic of anything that is on its territory applies not only  to missiles, but also to weapons [zaryady] that have been  removed from alert status. Kazakhstan's storage facilities are  packed with nuclear ammunition.    Russia is willing to share, but insists that the dismantling  and the uranium reprocessing takes place at its own plants.  Ukraine's uncompromising position cannot but influence  Kazakhstan's behavior. Kiev has decided, by the end of this  year, to remove all the warheads from 20 SS-24 ICBM's, and to  keep them. But Ukraine also does not have the plants and  technology for reprocessing the uranium, which it could use as  fuel for its five nuclear power stations.    After the Russian elections, the former certainty that the  safest course is to ship all the former USSR's nuclear weapons  to Russia's territory is not shared by everyone. Russia may  come up against more persistent claims from Ukraine and  Kazakhstan to keep the nuclear weapons.    It has yet to be decided how Kazakhstan's warheads will be  dismantled and by what means their uranium content will be sold.     "

""If anyone thinks that through some maneuver in the name of peace, he will be  able to continue to threaten with the aim of surprising Israel, he will find  that Israel is ready with its might to destroy his security, to hurt him until  he is sorry and regrets his action,"" Foreign Minister David Levy declared in a  speech to the Knesset (Parliament).    ""Israel is taking nothing for granted and will make its own decisions,"" he  said.    The comments marked an end to Israel's low-profile approach to the Persian Gulf  crisis. They represented a clear expression of growing fears that Iraq's Saddam  Hussein may withdraw from Kuwait with his army and weaponry intact. Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir is scheduled to visit Washington next week and is  expected to reiterate Israel's concerns.    Levy's comments followed by a day his effort to press the United States not  only to expel Iraq's army from Kuwait but also to destroy Hussein's military  might.    On Tuesday, Levy summoned U.S. Ambassador William A. Brown to argue that by  Israel's reckoning, Washington has explicitly committed itself to the  dismantling of Iraq's developing nuclear potential. He further cautioned that  if Baghdad's existing chemical and conventional arsenal remains intact, ""it  would be a problem for Israel and a problem for the entire world,"" reported a  Foreign Ministry official familiar with the talks.    The official insisted that, despite reports in Israeli newspapers, Levy was not  implying a preemptive Israeli attack on Iraq. ""That is taking the implication  too far,"" the official said.    The Levy statements came amid gloomy Israeli appraisals of President Bush's  proposal to open talks with Iraq, an offer that Baghdad accepted Wednesday.  Although Bush insisted that he intends only to impress on Iraq the risks of  staying in Kuwait, Israeli officials compared the decision to Western Europe's  efforts to appease German dictator Adolf Hitler before the start of World War  II.    Science and Technology Minister Yuval Neeman likened Bush to Neville  Chamberlain, the British prime minister who abandoned Czechoslovakia to Hitler  in return for an illusory ""peace in our time.""    Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, a leading Cabinet hawk, demanded that the United  States remove Hussein from power.    ""For Israel, for the Middle East and for the world, it would have been much  better if the United States would not have stepped into the Persian Gulf if the  end of the crisis would be that Saddam Hussein stays in power,"" he said.    Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed that Iraq be de-clawed.  ""Stability and peace in the Middle East are very hard to envision if Saddam  Hussein remains with the weapons of mass destruction, the war machine that he  has, and is building,"" he said. ""How (the weapons) can be neutralized is  something that has to be looked at right now.""    Netanyahu indicated that Israel might take its own action if the United States  wavers. ""What has guided us throughout is, of course, support for the  American-led international effort to reverse Iraqi aggression, but equally, of  course, our concern and our resolution is to defend Israel,"" he said.    Iraq has threatened to attack Israel if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf.  Last spring, Hussein warned that he would ""burn half of Israel"" with chemical  weapons in case of an Israeli attack.    In his comments to Brown, Levy suggested that now is the best time to hit Iraq  because it is unlikely that an alliance such as the one now in place in the  gulf can be renewed in the future. Levy had summoned Brown after receiving a  letter from Secretary of State James A. Baker III explaining Bush's offer to  open talks with Baghdad.    ""Israel is threatened by name, and we are taking a risk by adopting a low  profile. In the event of danger, we must defend ourselves,"" a Foreign Ministry  official argued. The official added that Israel took Bush's recent comments on  Iraq's nuclear potential to mean that the United States is committed to  destroying it.    Israeli newspapers found Levy's performance ominous. The influential Haaretz  newspaper commented: ""These remarks, coupled with the statement to Ambassador  Brown, express a new Israeli policy toward the gulf crisis, following the  invitation to Iraq to negotiate with the United States.""    Despite the hints that Israel might take on Iraq alone, military officials have  said that Israel lacks the capability to do the job, at least using only  conventional weapons.    One military official told reporters Wednesday: ""Israel will never have the  kind of arsenal that the United States has in place in the Persian Gulf --  cruise missiles, B-52 bombers; nor do we surround Iraq on three sides, in  Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the gulf, like the Americans do.""

A mechanism of the implementation of Ukraine's decision  on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its territory will  also be worked out, ITAR-TASS learned from informed sources on  Thursday.    This applies to 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and  some 1,500 warheads. Weapons that, in opinion of the U.S. side,  are the most dangerous ones, SS-24 and SS-19 missiles, are to be  dismantled within three years under an agreement that is to be  signed.    The signing of the documents on dismantling the entire  Ukrainian nuclear potential is to end a prolonged debate on the  destiny of the Soviet nuclear arsenal that remained in the  Ukrainian territory after the Soviet Union's dissolution in  1991. This will mean keeping to the schedule outlined in the  1992 Lisbon protocols. Under the protocols two other former  Union republics with nuclear arms -- Kazakhstan and Belarus --  supported the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and agreed to  destroy nuclear arms, turning them over to Russia for the  purpose.    But the Ukrainian parliament, ratifying the Strategic Arms  Limitation Treaty on November 18, 1993, made a number of  reservations: on the control of strategic nuclear forces in the  Ukrainian territory, on the elimination of extra carriers and  charges, on control over disassembly and destruction of nuclear  charges. Ukraine made its non-nuclear status and stage-by-stage  elimination of nuclear weapons conditional upon guarantees of  its national security by nuclear states.    Several rounds of tripartite talks of Russia, Ukraine and  the  United States were held last month. The foreign press notes  they were held until President Clinton said in Brussels on  Monday that an agreement on problems of nuclear arms in Ukraine  became a reality.    The compensation and splitting between Ukraine and Russia of  proceeds from the sale of enriched uranium was among central  problems at the talks. The United States pledged itself to form  a semi-state corporation which will buy uranium contained in  warheads for nuclear power plants to make up for the  expenditures for nuclear arms destruction. In the runup to the  President's visit to Moscow, the U.S. Congress earmarked a sum  of 175 million dollars as a step to promote the destruction of  nuclear warheads in Ukraine, to compensate for the dismantling  of nuclear arms. The U.S. Congress also endorses economic aid  to Ukraine amounting to 155 million dollars.

A mechanism of the implementation of Ukraine's decision  on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its territory will  also be worked out, ITAR-TASS learned from informed sources on  Thursday.    This applies to 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and  some 1,500 warheads. Weapons that, in opinion of the U.S. side,  are the most dangerous ones, SS-24 and SS-19 missiles, are to be  dismantled within three years under an agreement that is to be  signed.    The signing of the documents on dismantling the entire  Ukrainian nuclear potential is to end a prolonged debate on the  destiny of the Soviet nuclear arsenal that remained in the  Ukrainian territory after the Soviet Union's dissolution in  1991. This will mean keeping to the schedule outlined in the  1992 Lisbon protocols. Under the protocols two other former  Union republics with nuclear arms -- Kazakhstan and Belarus --  supported the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and agreed to  destroy nuclear arms, turning them over to Russia for the  purpose.    But the Ukrainian parliament, ratifying the Strategic Arms  Limitation Treaty on November 18, 1993, made a number of  reservations: on the control of strategic nuclear forces in the  Ukrainian territory, on the elimination of extra carriers and  charges, on control over disassembly and destruction of nuclear  charges. Ukraine made its non-nuclear status and stage-by-stage  elimination of nuclear weapons conditional upon guarantees of  its national security by nuclear states.    Several rounds of tripartite talks of Russia, Ukraine and  the  United States were held last month. The foreign press notes  they were held until President Clinton said in Brussels on  Monday that an agreement on problems of nuclear arms in Ukraine  became a reality.    The compensation and splitting between Ukraine and Russia of  proceeds from the sale of enriched uranium was among central  problems at the talks. The United States pledged itself to form  a semi-state corporation which will buy uranium contained in  warheads for nuclear power plants to make up for the  expenditures for nuclear arms destruction. In the runup to the  President's visit to Moscow, the U.S. Congress earmarked a sum  of 175 million dollars as a step to promote the destruction of  nuclear warheads in Ukraine, to compensate for the dismantling  of nuclear arms. The U.S. Congress also endorses economic aid  to Ukraine amounting to 155 million dollars.    Participants in the tripartite negotiations believe the  signing of documents on problems of nuclear arms in Ukraine must  ease tensions that have complicated relations between the United  States, Russia and Ukraine of late.

The plans amount to the creeping deregulation of voice telephony for households well ahead of 1998, the date set by the EU for the break-up of monopoly control over the continent's public telephone services. These and other issues will be discussed at a meeting of telecoms ministers in Brussels today, amid growing impatience from Europe's leading electronics companies that liberalisation is not proceeding quickly enough. Last month the commission published a green paper on mobile communications intended to open the development of the mobile sector towards the personal communications mass market. Europe has only about 8m subscribers to mobile cellular telephones, but this figure could rise sharply if the opening up of the mobiles sector is accompanied by liberalisation of other telecommunications infrastructures, such as cable TV networks. In a deregulated market there would be nothing to stop mobile and cable operators joining forces to offer - particularly in highly cabled countries such as Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands - an alternative to the existing universal domestic telephone service. Although senior commission officials privately acknowledge that telecommunications markets are overtaking the agreed EU timetable for dismantling barriers in European telecoms markets, they are not prepared to expend the political capital that would be required to dismantle the 1998 deadline. But in a report to be presented to telecoms minsters at today's council meeting, heads of Europe's leading electronics companies are expected to argue that the EU should set precise targets for speeding liberalisation. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, has publicly thrown his weight behind a full and speedy liberalisation of Europe's cable television infrastructure. However, his plans may be scuppered by those member states wary of the political impact of early deregulation. The companies behind the report - Siemens, ICL, Philips Electronics, IBM Europe and Cie des Machines Bull - are part of an EU advisory group on information highways. They have been charged with proposing a strategy for developing pan-European computer and telecommunications networks as part of the EU's broader effort to boost economic growth. The report is likely to intensify debate before the summit in Corfu next month, when Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, is due to present it to heads of state.

[Grigoryev] This statement really caused a sensation and has  already elicited a positive response worldwide. The upcoming  signing of the agreement follows intensive tripartite talks in  Washington, which resulted in Ukraine's renouncing its nuclear  potential.    As you know, following the breakup of the Soviet Union,  Ukraine inherited 176 strategic missiles and 1,800 nuclear  warheads. That constitutes a more powerful arsenal than those  of France, China, and Britain together.    In return for dismantling their weapons, Ukraine's  parliamentarians demanded that the West provide considerable  financial aid for economic reforms and security guarantees, as  well as compensation for the short-range tactical missiles that  have been handed over to Russia. The talks in Washington showed  that this was no time for bartering and that the whole world can  benefit from the agreement. Nor will Ukraine lose out. It is  to receive nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes. And Russia is to  cancel Ukraine's enormous debt for energy sources. Finally, the  United States will provide the republic with economic and  technical aid, as well as guaranteeing its security.    The importance of the upcoming treaty signing is indicated  by  the fact that tomorrow, following a change in the initial  program for his visit, Bill Clinton will meet President Leonid  Kravchuk in Kiev in order to express his support.

0,FT921-11550 ,"FT921-11550 _AN-CA4AUAA5FT 920131   FT  31 JAN 92 / Technology: Reversing the operation - The job of dismantling the world's nuclear arsenal      By CLIVE COOKSON and DAVID WHITE   The United States and the former Soviet republics are embarking on a nuclear disarmament programme of a scale that no one had imagined possible until a few months ago. It will involve dismantling at least 20,000 warheads, ranging from tactical weapons to multi-megaton hydrogen bombs. The process of nuclear dismantling remains shrouded in secrecy, for the simple reason that taking apart a weapon is the reverse of putting one together - and no one wants to risk giving useful clues to building an H-bomb. In the US, UK and France, nuclear weapons are designed with eventual dismantling in mind. The western nuclear powers have been taking apart their old warheads regularly since the 1950s and re-using the materials in more modern ones. For them dismantling is a routine though expensive and time-consuming process, which uses high-technology equipment for remote handling of hazardous materials. The former Soviet Union, on the other hand, has less experience of nuclear dismantling and recycling. Its stockpile contains ancient warheads from the 1960s and, to make matters more dangerous, the nuclear technicians trained to maintain them are said to be leaving their posts in droves, demoralised by the collapse of the Soviet military system and the fact that no one is paying them a living wage. John Simpson, a nuclear specialist at Southampton University's Mountbatten Centre for International Studies, says Russian contacts have told him 'that some of their weapons were simply not designed to be dismantled. In that case, we have to start virtually from scratch, developing ways to get at the fissile cores'. However the Russians do have some dismantling experience, as Viktor Mikhailov, deputy minister of atomic power and industry, made clear in an article published this month in Moscow. 'In fact, our factories are already more occupied with the dismantling of warheads than the production of new ones,' he wrote. Dismantling has to take place in a special cell that is protected with reinforced concrete in case of an accident. There is no risk of a full-scale nuclear explosion but the conventional explosive used to detonate the bomb could conceivably blow up, particularly if the warhead is old and poorly maintained. The containment would then be needed to prevent plutonium - a radioactive and toxic metal - being released into the environment. In the west, the conventional explosive removed from warheads is normally destroyed by controlled burning. But according to Mikhailov the Russians sometimes use it for making synthetic diamonds; when detonated in a sealed chamber it produces pressures high enough to convert graphite, the humble black form of car According to western estimates, Russia has enough cells to dismantle 1,500 to 2,000 warheads per year. That compares with an estimated 15,000 warheads needing destruction under current Russian plans. In addition there are thousands of old weapons in storage, which are likely to present the most difficult dismantling task. The Russians will need western help to build up decommissioning facilities if they are to get rid of their weapons at an acceptable rate. 'The obvious way to speed up the process is to build more cells,' says Simpson. 'But there is a Catch 22.' Cells built for dismantling could be turned round relatively easily to do the reverse - assembling warheads - if the political climate changes. Given the potential instability of the former Soviet states, many proliferation specialists believe the west should concentrate its help on ensuring the physical security of all warheads due for elimination, rather than dismantling them. This means moving them to properly guarded central storage in Russia, making the warheads safe and inactivating their detonators. Francois Heisbourg, director of International Institute for Strategic Studies, says full-scale dismantling of the warheads would be 'worse than leaving them intact' unless foolproof arrangements are in place to safeguard the nuclear materials that come out of the bombs. The International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, is keen to expand its existing role of inspecting the world's civilian nuclear plants and start to supervise the plutonium and enriched uranium removed from weapons, making sure that they are never diverted back to military use. One of the most vexatious issues surrounding nuclear disarmament is what to do with the weapons-grade plutonium. The US already has an estimated 50 tonnes of unwanted plutonium, which was either removed from scrapped warheads or produced for future military use but no longer required, and the weapons decommissioned over the coming years will generated more. The obvious civil use for the plutonium is to generate electricity in power stations. But the type of reactor designed to run on plutonium, the fast breeder, remains far from commercial development. For use in conventional thermal reactors the plutonium has to be combined with uranium in the form of mixed oxide (Mox) fuel. 'Looking at the non-proliferation aspects, the best use of the plutonium is to burn it as mixed oxide fuel,' says David Kyd of the IAEA. Many people in the nuclear industry agree but others are sceptical about recycling plutonium in this way because it is more expensive and difficult to use than straightforward uranium fuel. 'Plutonium recycling is simply uneconomic,' says William Walker of the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex. 'Most plutonium in the world should be regarded not as an asset but as waste to be disposed of.' Suggestions for plutonium disposal range from entombment deep within the earth to firing into deep space. But no one has come up with scheme that is technically feasible, environmentally acceptable and politically supportable. THE IMMENSE destructive power of a modern warhead results from four nuclear explosions - one fusion and three fission reactions - occurring within a few millionths of a second inside its metal casing. At the heart of the weapon is a small 'implosion-type' atomic bomb similar to the one that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. It is detonated by firing a spherical shell of high explosive around a ball of plutonium (or highly enriched uranium). The pressure squeezes the plutonium into a super-critical mass, triggering explosive nuclear fission. The primary explosion transmits an intense pulse of X-ray energy towards a cylinder of lithium deuteride wrapped around a rod of plutonium. This radiation triggers a second fission reaction in the plutonium rod and nuclear fusion between deuterium and tritium - the main source of the H-bomb's awesome power - in the lithium deuteride. The cylinder also contains some tritium gas. The cylinder has a thick outer layer of unenriched uranium (U238) metal. This 'tamper' gives the thermonuclear explosion extra force by holding the deuterium and tritium in place for an extra millionth of a second or so before everything flies apart. At the same time, the intense flow of neutrons from the fusion reaction triggers fission in the U238 itself - adding yet more power to the warhead. The weapon has many other components, including electronics to control the detonator, and radiation shields and mirrors to distribute radiation from the primary explosion evenly over the secondary cylinder.

Mr Kravchuk will draw satisfaction from the fact that a similar partnership agreement between the EU and Russia remains unfinished, though Brussels hopes to wrap up the accord in time for the European summit in Corfu next week. Ukraine's collapsing economy and nuclear arsenal make it the regional danger spot, but the EU's new policy of engagement is being hobbled by a row over a European Commission plan to send emergency food aid. Britain, among others, opposes the provision of farm credit guarantees amounting to Ecu100m (Pounds 77m) so Kiev can buy western fertilisers with scarce hard currency. The UK believes that reports of food shortages are exaggerated, and that the Commission's move is a short-term palliative. Winter crops in Ukraine failed and had to be replanted. Many spring crops were planted without fertilisers, making them vulnerable. Kiev's powerful agricultural lobby, trying to restore traditionally high subsidies, has warned of pending disaster, but western diplomats believe large-scale humanitarian aid is 'premature'. Though choice is limited, food stores are stocked. Many warehouses are watching their potatoes rot because demand has dropped on the retail market. The explanation is that self-sufficient Ukrainians with access to garden plots have been planting their own. 'Ukraine doesn't need food,' said one diplomat. 'They need much more sophisticated help' - such as market incentives to produce, a competitive distribution system and better storage facilities. Nuclear safety in Ukraine will feature high on the agenda of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Naples next month. Brussels estimates suggest that the dismantling of the Chernobyl plant could cost Ecu300m-500m. Ukraine is trying to make a goldmine out of the international outcry to close Chernobyl, raising its asking price to shut the station down from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 14bn. With Ukraine's future government still up in the air, it will be tricky to secure a deal with the executive branch without the danger of it back-firing in Ukraine's parliament.

He also heard President Boris Yeltsin promise active Russian participation in Nato's new programme of co-operation with the nations of the former Warsaw Pact. The US president rewarded Mr Yeltsin's renewed commitment to economic reform by announcing that he had earmarked an additional Dollars 900m (Pounds 608.1m) in assistance in next year's US budget, to be presented in February. He said that meant that, with some existing appropriations unspent, Russia was assured of at least Dollars 1bn in US funds in each of the next two years. But the upbeat comments of Mr Clinton, Mr Yeltsin and President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine praising the various substantive achievements of the past 48 hours could not entirely dispel a sense that not all the commitments on paper would easily be translated into action. The Ukrainian agreement, which provides for the dismantling and removal of the most potent nuclear warheads and missiles over the next 10 months, still has to be ratified by the parliament in Kiev, a prospect that even US officials privately rated as a 50-50 chance. In Kiev last night Mrs Tatyana Yakheyeva, one of the members of the parliamentary commission on Start 1, said: 'At the very least there will be a veto on the deal - at the most, Kravchuk faces impeachment.' At the same time, a row broke out between Mr Anatoly Zlenko, the Ukrainian foreign minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, on whether Ukraine had been promised relief on its Rbs 1,000bn energy debt to Russia. Both Mr Clinton and Mr Kravchuk, the latter visibly elated at his presence on a world stage and looking forward to a Washington visit in March, argued that the more Ukrainians learned about the treaty, the greater the likelihood of approval. Benefits include an estimated Dollars 1bn Ukrainian share of the Dollars 12bn, 20-year agreement also signed yesterday for US purchases from Russia of highly enriched uranium extracted from missiles. On Nato, Mr Yeltsin said its Partnership for Peace, which he called 'a very good formula', should still be seen as only one of the mechanisms for enhancing European security. He also warned against any Nato attempt to 'dismember us' by admitting eastern European nations 'one by one'. US officials insisted, however, that Mr Yeltsin's commitment to the partnership was stronger than they had expected and more than offset his apparent reservations. Once Russia has formally applied to take part, the respective military commands will work out co-operation procedures over the next few months. A big cloud still hangs over economic reform. Deep political divisions were further reflected when the lower house of the Russian parliament elected as Speaker Mr Ivan Rybkin, a former communist who now belongs to the conservative Agrarian party. He was returned with support from the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats, headed by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who, before becoming involved in a fight with a reformist MP, continued in countless interviews to pour scorn on Mr Clinton, Mr Yeltsin and even the existence of US financial assistance. The Russian president's tart rejoinder was that the upper house was 'smarter and more intellectual'. He maintained that the 60 per cent who voted in favour of the new Russian constitution was a more reliable indicator of reform sentiment than the composition of the parliament. Still, Mr Yeltsin, anxious not to appear too much the supplicant, again nudged Mr Clinton towards making the Group of Seven industrialised nations a club of eight by admitting Russia. He said Russia wanted 'full-scale co-operation' in the transition to a market economy.

0,FT924-4517 ,"FT924-4517 _AN-CLBBRABKFT 921202   FT  02 DEC 92 / Scrapyard no longer end of the road for cars: How BMW's recycling plant is opening in the face of uncertainty from the EC      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   BMW AND a vehicle salvage company specialising in the German executive cars yesterday jointly opened the UK's first dedicated car dismantling and recycling plant. The plant is relatively small - it has a capacity of 2,500 cars a year  - but BMW says it is the most advanced in the world and is a potential model for the car and materials reclamation industries to undertake systematic recycling of the 14m cars scrapped annually in Europe. The plant at Bolney, West Sussex is intended to be the first of a network of about 15 that BMW wants to develop in the UK with a number of partners. Before the end of the decade it should be processing most of the 16,000 BMWs scrapped in the UK annually. A second plant is to open next year and a further five in 1994. The plant is opening when the obstacles faced by European legislators and carmakers in seeking a harmonised approach to recycling are becoming increasingly apparent. Rover Group is the only UK-based manufacturer to have announced a full recycling research programme in Britain. It is co-operating with Bird Group, one of Europe's largest materials reclamation and recycling concerns, on dismantling and recycling trials at Bird's headquarters near Stratford-upon-Avon. They expect a demonstration facility to be operating next year. Like Fiat of Italy, however, Rover believes efficient plants will need to be much larger than the BMW-style ones and to be capable of dismantling all makes of vehicle if satisfactory economies of scale are to be achieved. Volkswagen, Mercedes, Fiat and some other European manufacturers have set up or are preparing recycling ventures on the Continent in the expectation of EC-wide legislation governing car scrapping and recycling by 1995. Fiat this week emphasised its unease at what it sees as the haphazard manner vehicle recycling is advancing in the absence of a clear lead from Brussels. Mr Paulo Cantarella, chief executive of Fiat Auto, said some recycling initiatives 'could produce systems that are both costly and inefficient since they are based on insignificant volumes'. Such criticism was rejected yesterday by BMW executives and Bolney Motors, BMW's partner in the venture. They see it and subsequent facilities as offering a practical means of tackling vehicle disposal. For parts and materials reclamation partners such as Bolney Motors, it is seen as a significant commercial opportunity. EC legislation is expected to require disposal certificates for every car produced to ensure that they end their lives only at an authorised dismantling and recycling centre. There is now little regulation of the way vehicles are scrapped, with only 50 per cent finding their way to authorised scrapyards. The Bolney plant will help take the industry closer to its target of being able to recycle nearly 100 per cent of each car, unlike the average of about 75 per cent now and the 82 per cent BMW claims for its latest 3-Series, largely as a result of greater use of plastics which can be easily recycled. Cars arriving for disposal are hoisted aloft in a purpose-built bay where fluids are drained and the battery removed. From there, they undergo a progressive dismantling process. Parts and materials that cannot be sold through Bolney Motors' normal used-parts sales channels are sent to specialised companies for recycling. Since last year, BMW (GB) has been sending used or damaged plastic bumpers and catalytic convertors back to Germany for recycling. Following traditional trading patterns, many engines and transmissions are remanufactured for re-supply through BMW's dealer networks. The stripped body shell is cut up for delivery to a conventional shredder facility prior to recycling. Dismantling takes between two and seven hours, representing a Pounds 40-Pounds 140 cost in time alone. With transport and investment costs added, BMW is assuming an average disposal cost per car of Pounds 175. Thus while EC legislation is expected to place the onus on manufacturers to ensure that vehicles are effectively disposed of, the industry is arguing that owners should share the responsibility because the worst-kept cars could have a negative value. That might mean a car's final owner paying for disposal, according to Dr Wolf.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

But the Explosions Two Years Ago Have  Still Not Been Investigated""]    [Text] Vladivostok -- The Maritime Kray marked the second  anniversary of the notorious explosions at the Pacific Fleet  arsenal in Vladivostok (14 May 1992) with a far more powerful  ""salute"" at the Pacific Fleet air forces central air weapons  dump, which is 100 km from the city, near the settlement of  Novonezhino.    On precisely 14 May, at approximately 1500 hours local time,  there were reports from the dump that a fire had started, that  the guard was unable to handle it alone. Some minutes later  there were explosions -- a first, followed by a second....  According to witnesses, and there were plenty of them, since an  electric train from Vladivostok was pulling in to Novonezhino,  the third explosion was the biggest. According to Maritime Kray  governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, appearing on local television the  next day, the explosion at the Pacific Fleet dump was equivalent  to that of an atom bomb. At any rate, Vladivostok was rocked,  as if a small earthquake had occurred: Windows shook and the  inhabitants of housing developments in Tikhaya Bay and Russkiy  island felt their floors vibrate.    It made a big impression on 66 children from Tokyo on  holiday  at the ""Okean"" children's camp. It is on the opposite shore of  Ussuriyskiy Bay from where the incident occurred. The shock  wave from the explosion blew out all the windows in the central  complex, where the young Japanese were at the time. But the  guests kept their heads, spilled out onto the street, and  organized... a disco.    The inhabitants of Novonezhino and other settlements within  a  radius of six-eight km from the exploding dump -- Anisimovka,  Romanovka, Smolyaninovo, and nearby garrisons and way stations  -- were clearly not in a dancing mood. Some 2,000 people from  Novonezhino, mainly women and children from officers' families,  were evacuated by electric train during the explosions, as  chunks and fragments of metal whistled by over distances of  kilometers. Every minute counted, since the track, embankment,  and contact rails were soon broken or wrecked.    What can you say about the ""theater of combat actions,""  when,  according to information confirmed by the kray civil defense  staff, several very long-range projectiles flew from the site of  the explosion as far as the city of Bolshoy Kamen -- home, as is  known, of the ""Zvezda"" defense plant, which now specializes in  dismantling submarines with nuclear reactors.    As on 14 May, a black day for the Maritime Kray, so today,  when these lines are being written, there is no information on  the victims of the tragedy. There is every reason to believe  that the future holds the key, as in the case of the affair of  two years ago. For instance, the latest victim of the previous  explosions at the Pacific Fleet arsenal was a Vladivostok boy  who found a shell two weeks ago. And his was by no means the  only death. The casualty radius of accidental explosions in the  Pacific Fleet's undeclared war on its own territory against  itself and its own civilian population is great not so much in  spatial terms as in terms of time.    We have been told that no one in the military or in the  civilian population was particularly badly affected. There are,  though, instances of trivial injuries: Cuts and lacerations and  bruises -- no more than that. On Sunday 15 May, thank goodness,  the rain came right on time, the fire was doused, and, as the  kray leadership reported on the radio, the danger of further  explosions passed and it was decided to people should return to  their homes. Arond 3,000 people had been evacuated in all.    It was also announced that the Pacific Fleet air forces  central air weapons dump contained only weapons with powder  charges (around 5,000 aerial bombs, guided and unguided  missiles, 800 truckloads of pyrotechnics, and an amount of TNT  in the dump stores equivalent to two nuclear warheads). It was  stated that there were no chemical, bacteriological, or nuclear  weapons there.    But there is no dump any more following the disaster. The  extent of the devastation is such that the facility cannot be  resurrected. As it happens, it also contained ammunition made  in 1937, long out of date. What the military had failed to do  on schedule has been achieved by accident.    As for the reasons for the fire at the central dump, so far  silence. The investigation of the incident is in the hands of  the Maritime Kray Administration of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service. But we already know the two main  versions of the incident. The first comes from a Pacific Fleet  spokesman, and what it boils down to is the traditional spring  taiga fires. Apparently, there was a gale on 14 May, which  spread the fire to the territory of the protected facility.    This version is totally rejected by governor Nazdratenko.  According to his information, fire originally broke out not on  the outskirts, but in the center of the dump. It was there that  the first explosion occurred. Perhaps someone wanted it to  happen? Incidentally, local people have their own ""domestic""  version concerning a unit commander arrested recently for  trading in weapons. So now the tracks had to be covered....  Incidentally, the latest major theft of weapons from Pacific  Fleet dumps took place actually in the vicinity of Novonezhino.    What the competent bodies are going to say about the tragedy  and whether they will say anything at all is the big question.  The experience of the investigation of the explosions that  occurred the year before last at the Pacific Fleet arsenal in  Vladivostok suggests that it is not just a unit commander who is  covering tracks. In fact, no one has yet been properly called  to account for the sudden combat actions on the streets of  Vladivostok on 14 May 1992; the investigation into the incident  is still not complete.     "
0,FT942-2219 ,"FT942-2219 _AN-EFUD5AAUFT 940621   FT  21 JUN 94 / EU business urges public sector reform      By LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS   European business leaders yesterday called for a sweeping overhaul of the public sector, including privatisation of postal services, telecommunications, energy and transport, in order to recover competitiveness and tackle Europe's unemployment crisis. In a move aimed at lobbying Europe's political leaders before this week's EU summit in Corfu, Unice, the employers' federation, appealed to governments to set targets for cuts in public spending as a proportion of GDP and to take steps to reorganise the welfare state. Mr Francois Perigot, the leading French industrialist and newly-appointed Unice president, said it was time to reduce the burden of the state on business and roll back the public sector. 'We have kept our eyes closed for 20 years. We can't go on like this.' The Unice report - Making Europe more competitive: Towards world class performance - is business's most detailed response to the White Paper on competitiveness, jobs and growth launched last year by President Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The report sets out several areas for action to shrink the public sector through deregulation and privatisation so that Europe can compete more effectively with the US and Asia: Reducing the cost of healthcare, through the introduction of new 'market type' mechanisms to match supply more closely to demand. This would involve bringing private companies into the health care market. Trimming the costs of pensions. This would provide a 'basic' state pension for everyone who has worked, with an optional complementary pension financed by companies and/or individuals. Reducing the costs of unemployment benefits by limiting the period of entitlement and enforcing tougher criteria for eligibility. Reducing the costs of sickness and disablement benefits, with responsibility for additional insurance transferred from the public sector to companies and individuals. In addition, the report urges more flexibility in labour markets, through reductions in minimum wage levels, lowering the costs of employing people, and reducing the cost of protection against dismissal. Unice also wants much small business to be freed of red tape, both from Brussels and national capitals. Mr Zgymunt Tyszkiewicz, Unice secretary-general, acknowledged the recommendations implied Europe was moving toward US-style deregulation at the very moment the Clinton administration was looking to the European social model for inspiration. Mr Perigot said that Unice was not advocating the dismantling of the welfare state, rather it was seeking new incentives for companies and individuals to reduce their reliance on the state.

0,FT941-6658 ,"FT941-6658 _AN-ECAD7ACQFT 940301   FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Animal spirits on too tight a leash - Services in Europe are less attuned to a mass market than in the US      By GUY DE JONQUIERES   When Europeans discuss industrial performance, most of the talk is about manufacturing and little about services. Yet as the challenge of economic regeneration grows more pressing, services' contribution and potential look set to move sharply up the agenda. The sector is already Europe's largest source of output and employment - and its importance is increasing. In west Germany, Europe's leading manufacturing economy, the number of services jobs rose 28 per cent from 1990 to 1992, while totals in other sectors stagnated or declined. The outlook is for a continuing fall in factory jobs and a squeeze on public sector payrolls throughout Europe, leaving services as one of few areas where large-scale job creation still seems possible. Optimists point to the US, where services employment has grown by 23m people since 1980 - double the rise in the EU - and to the growth of Britain's service economy. Though the quality of jobs created is disputed, these examples are cited as arguments for relaxing continental Europe's rigid labour laws. But the story does not end there. The search for new jobs coincides awkwardly with structural upheavals in services businesses such as telecommunications, the media, financial services and retailing. These businesses ought to be at the heart of wealth creation, as Europe upgrades from declining traditional industries to newer, technology-based activities involving higher skills and greater value-added. But, in many, pressures to improve efficiency are likely in the short term to lead to fewer jobs, not more. A report last month for the European Commission found airlines' operating costs were 48 per cent higher in Europe than in the US, largely because of poorer labour productivity. A McKinsey study in 1992 found similar transatlantic productivity differences in telecommunications and banking. More recently, McKinsey found the efficiency of British retailers, supposedly among Europe's highest, trailed far behind US chains. It concluded that, if UK supermarkets had to charge US prices, they would plunge into loss. While most service businesses were labour-intensive and sheltered by national barriers, such discrepancies mattered little. But the discrepancies are becoming unsustainable as cross-border competition and labour-saving technologies compel companies to raise productivity. The pace is being forced by privatisation, which is challenging the over-staffing, bureaucracy and obsolete practices encouraged by a tradition of state ownership in sectors such as telecommunications, airlines and banking. To judge by job cuts by privatised UK companies, the scope for labour-shedding across Europe in the next few years is huge. If services are to generate economically rewarding additional jobs, tackling rigid labour laws will not be enough. Much will also depend on Europe's ability to maximise market opportunities and stimulate service-based businesses with the potential to grow fast and profitably. On this score, services in Europe are bound by two constraints which impose more heavily than on manufacturing. One is domination of important markets by national monopolies. The other is a more complex - and often more restrictive - panoply of regulatory control. The impact of the EU's single market programme on these obstacles has been uneven. Progress in dismantling barriers and encouraging cross-border competition has been reasonably rapid in a range of financial, professional and business services and road transport, but more halting in classic monopoly industries, such as telecommunications, energy supply and air transport. Nor does the programme tackle some inhibiting national regulations, such as Germany's tight curbs on shopping hours. But it is debatable how far fragmentation of Europe's services markets has, in practice, obstructed their development. Though many barriers to market entry have been real, others seem to owe much to participants' attitudes. Among the most persuasive evidence is trans-European expansion by US services producers. While Europe's broadcasters and film makers dabble with collaboration, Hollywood entertainment dominates its screens. The US-owned MTV music channel, now beamed Europe-wide, has pioneered an entirely new market. US telecommunications and cable operators have been more aggressive than most local counterparts in establishing footholds in Europe, while the running in 'multi-media' services, such as home shopping, is mostly by US firms. Most packaged software used on personal computers in Europe is of US origin, while Japanese groups dominate electronic video games. Chains such as Toys R Us and Computerland have revolutionised sectors of European retailing, while McDonald's is now France's biggest restaurateur and has earmarked western Europe as its prime growth market in the 1990s. US companies obviously benefit from scale economies from a large and homogenous home market. But, in most cases, they also succeed in Europe by offering distinctive products, backed by effective marketing and distribution. European services companies such as Ikea or Benetton in retailing, which have made an impact in North America by transplanting a new idea, are more rare. More often the preferred route is to buy market share by investing in established businesses. Though this approach is supposed to reduce risk, the results have been mixed. Grand Metropolitan has revitalised Burger King, but Bass is still struggling to turn around Holiday Inn. Marks  Spencer now admits it paid too much for Brooks Brothers, the US clothing chain, while several European grocery groups which bought into US supermarkets have been troubled by the experience. Of course, US service companies are far from infallible, as the Eurodisney fiasco demonstrates. But, at their best, they often seem more closely attuned than European businesses to the mass market and more confident about exporting innovations. That suggests that, if Europe's services industries are to prosper, ridding markets of artificial barriers and excessive regulation is only half the battle. The bigger challenge may be to unleash the animal spirits needed to exploit them fully against steadily stiffer international competition.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT942-9502 ,"FT942-9502 _AN-EEPCBAATFT 940516   FT  16 MAY 94 / EU seeks even-handed policy towards Russia and Ukraine      By LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS   The European Union will today make a start at trying to forge a more even-handed strategy toward Russia and Ukraine, whose neighbourhood rivalry remains a source of instability on the continent. Barring last-minute objections, EU foreign ministers in Brussels are likely to give the go-ahead to a new 'partnership' agreement with Russia whose ambitious goal is a common free-trade zone by the end of the century. However, in a sign of 'new thinking', the EU is balancing its Russia policy with a deeper engagement in Ukraine, whose nuclear arsenal and collapsing economy make it the regional danger spot. Ministers will today examine a European Commission paper which calls for a host of new initiatives to strengthen political co-operation and overhaul the command economy in Ukraine. The plan recommends Ecu100m (Pounds 79m) in emergency food aid and measures to improve nuclear safety, particularly the dismantling of the Chernobyl plant, which experts estimate could cost between Ecu300m and Ecu500m. Chernobyl funding will be a key topic at the Group of Seven industrialised countries' summit in Naples in July. Ministers may baulk at the Commission's food aid plan because of conflicting evidence of food shortages and worries that emergency shipments could distort local agricultural markets. Some countries may also delay approval of the documents in favour of waiting for a deeper analysis of the Ukrainian political economy. A senior EU diplomat said Russia had modified its earlier resistance to having the EU bolster its relations with Ukraine. But Brussels had to tread carefully in the light of Russia's (and its own) insistence that economic aid should be linked to Ukraine's meeting its pledge to ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The EU recently completed a 'partnership' agreement with Ukraine which is slightly less generous than the EU-Russia pact now virtually complete. Ministers are weighing an invitation to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to attend a signing ceremony. The EU-Russia partnership pact is likely to be approved, provided ministers agree to settle the two controversies which have plagued negotiations over the past 18 months. These are the EU's treatment of Russian uranium exports and Moscow's treatment of European banks operating in Russia. France, the EU's largest producer as well as consumer of enriched uranium for its nuclear power plants, has been worried about being undercut by Russian exports. A new safeguards regime operating until 1997 may ease French concerns. Member states are less enthusiastic about the banking offer because it restricts EU banks to no more than 12 per cent of the total capitalisation of the Russian banking system, with Moscow offering a non-committal review after five years. But Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, believes it is the best deal on offer. Agreement would pave the way for Mr Boris Yeltsin to stage a high-profile visit to western Europe, possibly via an invitation to attend the European summit in Corfu next month.

The presidents of the United States, Russia, and Ukraine  signed a treaty finally defining the fate of the 176 ICBM's and  their 1,600 nuclear warheads on Ukrainian territory. ""The three  of us,"" President Yeltsin said, ""met to close the last chapter  [postavit tochku] on the last problem of the 'Cold War.'""    Kiev gets a full security guarantee and pledges to dispatch  its entire arsenal to Russia for dismantling and for the removal  from the warheads and storage of the highly enriched fissionable  material. After being processed the uranium from the warheads  will be sold in the United States for use in nuclear power  stations, and the money raised -- $1 billion -- will be given by  Washington to Kiev, and will also be returned to Ukrainian  nuclear power stations. At the same time, agreement was reached  on the purchase by America of uranium worth $12 billion removed  from the Russian nuclear weapons to be destroyed under the START  II Treaty. The contract covers a 20-year period.    The treaty on the nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory --  the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world -- is undoubtedly  Clinton's most important achievement. But the signing of the  document was overshadowed by reports of the reaction of deputies  in the Ukrainian parliament. Sergey Golovatyy, a member of the  Supreme Council's Foreign Policy Committee in Kiev, said:  ""Kravchuk can sign anything he likes. But if parliament does  not ratify the treaty, it will remain a piece of paper.""    The Ukrainian president has waiting for him back at home a  seriously deteriorating political situation whose outcome hardly  anyone will venture to predict. The problem of nuclear weapons  in Ukraine has by no means been settled with the signing of the  agreement.    Another agreement signed during the visit was the document  on  the retargeting of Russian and U.S. strategic missiles. Some of  them will be targeted to empty areas of the high seas, while no  flight plans at all will be entered into the computers of the  others. It is virtually impossible to verify compliance with  this agreement. But, despite its symbolic nature, Thomas  Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, said that ""it is of  enormous importance for the strengthening of confidence between  the two countries.""    It is said in the U.S. President's entourage that Clinton  was  greatly impressed with ""Russia's progress along the road to a  free market."" Presumably a definite role in this was played by  Moscow's numerous booths, stalls, and private stores, as well as  by his meetings with Muscovites, which illustrated what Clinton  learned from his talks in the Kremlin and during dinner at  President Yeltsin's residence near Moscow. Addressing  Muscovites directly, Clinton said: Everyone earning their daily  bread in dogged work ""should know that ultimately they will be  rewarded."" He also reported that the talks touched on issues  whose resolution should ""make their lives better.""    Clinton did not propose a new package of aid for Russia --  nor had Moscow expected him to, incidentally. The Russian  leadership had set itself two tasks -- to get Washington to lift  the restrictions on Russian exports to the United States (it  remains to be seen how far this problem was solved) and to get  the money it had already been promised.    Russia received the first $1.5 billion from the IMF last  June. A second package of another $1.5 billion should have  followed soon after. But it was not transferred to Moscow,  which was unable to reduce the inflation rate and the budget  deficit to the agreed level.    Moreover, it has been learned that the World Bank is  prepared  to grant Russia $500 million out of previously allocated funds  in order to improve the position of Russian citizens. Michael  Blumenthal, treasury secretary in the Carter administration,  will head a ($100-million) program to help privatize major  Russian companies. Despite the United States' economic  difficulties, President Clinton hopes, according to his  entourage, to find another $1 billion for Russia this year.    Main attention during the talks was devoted to measures to  accelerate the reform program and define its goals. The sides  agreed that it is necessary to make a greater effort to control  inflation and support the least protected sections of the  population by saving funds on programs to finance inefficient  state enterprises. Clinton called for additional measures to be  taken to encourage Western private investors to invest more in  the Russian economy. In the meantime, U.S. entrepreneurs are  known to be among the most cautious. Their investment is  estimated at just $700 million.     "

Analysts believe it could fetch up to SKr3.5bn (Dollars 477m), excluding debt. The company, which was bought by Electrolux in 1980, has a book value of about SKr2bn. The group wants to sell the unit to Swedish, European and US investors and list it on the Stockholm stock exchange, subject to market conditions. The sale is in line with Electrolux's strategy of concentrating on core business. The company has sold three industrial operations this year, with total capital gains of SKr2.78bn helping to inflate group nine-month profits to SKr5.08bn. Granges is the biggest unit in Electrolux's industrial products division, with 1993 sales of SKr7.6bn. About half of its sales are outside Sweden, with the UK being the largest single market. Its four business areas comprise aluminium, recycling, automotive and distribution. Operations include a smelting plant at Sundsvall with production capacity of 100,000 tons. Granges has benefited from the recovery in aluminium prices and the weakness of the krona. Both factors helped lift operating profits after depreciation to SKr295m from SKr182m in the first nine months as sales expanded to SKr6.8bn from SKr5.7bn. Electrolux has been dismantling its industrial products division. Earlier this year it sold Autoliv, Europe's leading supplier of car safety equipment, and two US operations, Copes-Vulcan and Blaw-Knox.

Groupe Bull of France, Olivetti of Italy and Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany said yesterday they had created a new company, Trans European Information Systems (TEIS), which would have its headquarters in Brussels. The new company, which will have the legal structure of a European economic interest group, is a further step in a scheme to build a European-wide computer network - the 'European Nervous System' - which the three manufacturers have been exploring for well over a year. They have already established a number of laboratories to work on technical aspects of the system. The European Nervous System had its origin in an idea floated by the European Commission but it has been seized on enthusiastically by Europe's beleaguered computer manufacturers. The two major benefits are an increase in sales of data processing equipment through a form of public procurement which could not be seen as financial aid and the opportunity to gain valuable experience of large scale projects. They complain that US computer companies have benefited greatly from their involvement in large public sector and defence projects. The purpose of the new company will be to provide local authorities with applications that improve the availability of information technology services within the framework of the single European market. Computer systems in each of the member-states which 'talk' to each other is seen as a prerequisite for the establishment of harmonised services in areas such as healthcare and environmental protection.

Criminals were exploiting the dismantling of internal borders in the single European market to carry out ever more sophisticated fraud, said Mr Peter Schmidhuber, budget commissioner. The German commissioner responded yesterday with a fresh anti-fraud offensive, including a free-phone service aimed at encouraging informers to tip off Brussels. Most cases of fraud occurred in the Ecu35bn a year Common Agricultural Policy budget which offers generous price supports, export subsidies and refunds to Europe's farmers. In one typical instance, French and Italian criminals bought refined sugar in Rotterdam claiming it was bound for Croatia and Slovenia. But the cargo was diverted secretly to Italy, via Belgium, Luxembourg and France, possibly for sweetening wine. The estimated fraud was Ecu1.6m, the net effect of the effort to circumvent the mandatory compensatory levy for placing sugar on the EU market. Mr Schmidhuber said it was impossible to calculate precisely how much money was being lost as a result of fraud because the Commmission relied on cases being reported by member states. But he admitted: 'The amount of fraud is obviously far higher than we have detected.' The Commission's new fraud action plan includes more use of computers, remote sensing to track phantom olive groves, and a plan for a free-phone service in each EU country so that the public can report frauds to the Commission's fraud task force. 'I know we won't only get serious calls. There is the risk of crank calls and pranksters, but we still think it is worthwhile taking that risk,' he said. Mr Schmidhuber said the Commission was also examining whether to set up an informers' fund and a blacklist of companies and individuals caught engaging in fraud. But both were fraught with legal difficulties.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.   Types:-  TECH  Services  Services use.

0,FT942-2228 ,"FT942-2228 _AN-EFUD5AALFT 940621   FT  21 JUN 94 / Call for overhaul of public sectors      By LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS   European business leaders yesterday called for a sweeping overhaul of the public sector, including privatisation of postal services, telecommunications, energy and transport, in order to recover competitiveness and tackle Europe's unemployment crisis. In a move aimed at lobbying Europe's political leaders before this week's EU summit in Corfu, Unice, the employers' federation, appealed to governments to set targets for cuts in public spending as a proportion of GDP and to take steps to reorganise the welfare state. Mr Francois Perigot, the leading French industrialist and newly-appointed Unice president, said it was time to reduce the burden of the state on business and roll back the public sector. 'We have kept our eyes closed for 20 years. We can't go on like this.' The Unice report - Making Europe more competitive: Towards world class performance - is business's most detailed response to the White Paper on competitiveness, jobs and growth launched last year by President Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The report sets out several areas for action to shrink the public sector through deregulation and privatisation so that Europe can compete more effectively with the US and Asia: Reducing the cost of health care, through the introduction of new 'market type' mechanisms to match supply more closely to demand. This would involve bringing private companies into the health care market. Trimming the costs of pensions. This would provide a 'basic' state pension for everyone who has worked, with an optional complementary pension financed by firms and/or individuals. Reducing the costs of unemployment benefits by limiting the period of entitlement and enforcing tougher criteria for eligibility. Reducing the costs of sickness and disablement benefits, with responsibility for additional insurance transferred from the public sector to companies and individuals. In addition, the report calls for more flexibility in European labour markets, through reductions in minimum wage levels, lowering the costs of employing people, and reducing the cost of protection against dismissal. Unice also wants much small business to be freed of red tape, both from Brussels and national capitals. Mr Zgymunt Tyszkiewicz, Unice secretary-general, acknowledged the recommendations implied Europe was moving toward US-style deregulation at the very moment the Clinton administration was looking to the European social model for inspiration. 'We are both trying to learn from each other. We need adjustment on both sides,' he said. Mr Perigot said that Unice was not advocating the dismantling of the welfare state, rather it was urging political leaders to produce new incentives for companies and individuals to reduce their reliance on the state. There must also be 'adequate' protection for the employed, and support for the low-paid and unemployed. Mr Perigot added that he was worried that the incipient economic recovery in Europe might diminish the appetite for radical reform. 'Will we spend (this extra) growth on employment, wages or social security? We face a terrible problem,' he said. Unice presented its report to Mr Delors at a meeting in Brussels yesterday. The Commission president will report on governments' progress in implementing his White Paper at the Corfu summit. He stressed the importance of new information technologies in creating new jobs.

Terms such as the 'Wild East' and 'Mafioski' punctuate newspaper reports of flourishing black markets and a profiteering old guard. It is an image of chaos. Most reactions are dismissive: this is the difficult transitional period leading to unfettered capital markets and private enterprise. Now that Russia is the west's friend, it is the end of history, a phrase coined in 1990 which still has currency today. Three years later, the end of history is beginning to look decidely ugly, but it is organised, not chaotic. A prostrate country lies open to the international underworld, which sets about constructing the world's biggest criminal safehouse. Crime syndicates have bought up Russia's governing class, looted its natural resources, manipulated its currency and infiltrated every sector of its economy. Russia has become a giant washing machine swapping narcodollars for roubles, a toll gate for Europe's drug trade. Crime Without Frontiers is the story of how western and eastern criminal syndicates secured the former Soviet safehouse, the last piece in constructing a global pax mafiosa. The safehouse is the size of Europe and America combined, a 'point de rencontre' from which to carve the planet into orderly spheres of corruption. In the pax mafiosa, business is business - the Chinese Triads are partners in crime with the American Mafia; the Italians use the Russians to launder for the Colombian cartels, the Japanese Yakuza work hand in hand with the Italians. Crime has come full circle. Sterling works on an underlying paradox. Where there was once legitimate East-West distrust, there is now criminal detente. On one hand are 'sensible crooks' working in dishonest harmony, on the other is lawful society 'haggling over legal jurisdiction and perpetuating a multitude of police agencies carefully keeping secrets from each other'. The use of Germany as a criminal transit point between east and west is the book's most startling case in point, a paradigm of the European Union's vulnerability to the forces of enterprise crime. The legitimate world is ripe for the taking. Germany is a victim of its own punctilious laws of privacy and data protection: phone taps and bugging are outlawed, there is no cross-fertilisation between law enforcement agencies and anti-money laundering legislation is effectively unworkable. And the EU itself? Sterling describes it as 'an epic joke' where crime fighting is concerned. The borders have been removed for crooks, but not for the cops. No two countries have the same drug laws or surveillance of pushers. There is no pooling of police information and no common extradition policy. The EU cannot even agree on harmonising police radio frequencies. In this environment, criminals choose the best countries to ship, store, market and launder their produce. Sterling's book is nothing short of remarkable in its intuitive knowledge of the workings of a new underworld order only glimpsed by the media. It explains the horrifying flipside to the freedom of movement so cherished since the almost concurrent fall of communism and the dismantling of Europe's internal barriers. Unfortunately, few have listened carefully to this flipside. Sterling says that by the time the Western powers-that-be listen hard enough, they may already have become the powers-that-were. They will be dealing with an international shadow government the likes of which has never been seen or imagined.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2731 Book Publishing.

Tiiman told reporters Estonia put forward an ""entirely new  idea"" for dismantling the reactors at Paldiski, which the  Russian side is now studying. ""The proposal differs from the  earlier ones,"" Tiiman said. ""Our position is that the rods must  be removed from the reactors by the end of June, and the rest of  the jobs, such as dismantling the reactors and removing nuclear  wastes, completed as quickly as possible.""    Tiiman declined to disclose the details of the idea, but  declared Estonia's new plan would be optimal in costing the  country less than 10 million U.S. dollars. The dismantling of  the reactors takes place in three stages. Tiiman said in the  first stage nuclear fuel is removed from the reactors and taken  out of Estonia; Russia will remove ""military secrets"" from the  reactors during the second stage; and, lastly, the reactors and  nuclear wastes will be transported to Russia. Should Russia  agree to Estonian proposals, the complete dismantling of the  nuclear reactors in Paldiski will take roughly three years.    Juri Tikk, special representative of the government in  Paldiski, earlier said the first stage of dismantling is  expected to begin in the second half of April. Russia will not  allow even Estonian experts to attend the second stage of the  operation, Tikk said, because they claim the reactors contain  secret equipment.    Rescue Department Director Harry Hein said a special rescue  squad of over 300 men and 100 machines has been formed to ensure  security during the dismantling operation. The unit comprises  fire, rescue, medical, law and order enforcement, evacuation,  and other task forces, he said.     "

Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher has stubbornly pursued her own view of Europe, akin to that  of Gen. Charles de Gaulle, as one of sovereign states, not of supranational  institutions.

He  does have 400,000 Soviet soldiers in East Germany; while his spokesmen  occasionally hint that Soviet troops might leave Hungary and Poland, East  Germany is never on the list.    The continuing stream of East Germans fleeing their county is a reminder of  just how unpredictable the future will be and how fast that future may arrive.

He needs to stress that our primary  goal in Eastern Europe is political and economic change -- ""Finlandization,""  though he would not put it that way -- not dismantling the military alliances.

This has  been reported by Juri Tikk, the government's special  representative in Paldiski. The necessary equipment for  dismantling the reactors and the containers for transporting  nuclear fuel are in place and are located at the training  complex on the Pakri peninsula.    In the words of Tikk, the Russian side demands social  guarantees to those Russian officers who will participate in the  dismantling work. The Russian side wants a single agreement for  dismantling and evacuation to Russia of both the reactor nuclear  fuel and the entire reactor complex. The Estonian side wants a  separate agreement concerning the removal of the reactor nuclear  fuel from Estonia and a separate agreement concerning the  reactor complex being emptied of the reactor fuel, said Tikk.    The nuclear fuel can be taken away in a container either by  railway or by sea. The entire reactor, the complex weighing  (?over) 100 tonnes, can be taken to Russia by railway or by sea,  by using a floating crane and [words indistinct] special  containers. But none of the projects have as yet been finally  confirmed, stated Raul Luks.    The most dangerous stage during the dismantling of the two  reactors located on the Pakri peninsula is, in the words of Raul  Luks, the lifting of the reactor lids to remove the nuclear fuel.    At the nuclear facilities in Russia, in the words of Tikk,  on  three occasions when the lids of reactors have been opened. A  radioactive steam cloud has escaped into the atmosphere. This  has a radius of approximately 10 kms, stated Tikk.    Estonia does not intend to conceal anything during the  dismantling of the reactors, explained Tikk. In his words, a  radiation monitoring service operates in Estonia which relays  information on the level of radioactivity.     "

In many cases, such dialogue achieved positive results.  This is obviously a good omen.    The messages from Beijing were inspiring. First, French  Prime Minister Balladur's special envoy, Peyferitte, visited  China; then China and France issued a joint communique on 12  January after consultations. The French Government reaffirmed  that it only recognized the PRC Government as the sole legal  government of China, and guaranteed that it would no longer  approve any involvement by French enterprises in the sale of  arms to Taiwan. This changed the unharmonious relationship  between the two countries after France decided to sell fighters  to Taiwan in late 1992. After that, Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen visited Paris and met with French President  Mitterrand and other French leaders. Both sides held that a new  chapter had opened in the relationship between the two countries.    Then, Jennifer Hillman, chief U.S. trade negotiator, visited  Beijing, and the fourth round of bilateral textile trade talks  was held. A memorandum of understanding was signed on 17  January, and this averted a trade war between the two countries.  Immediately after that, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen  visited China, and a joint statement was issued after a meeting  of the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee announcing that the  United States ""supports a stable, prosperous, and modern China.""  This indicated that China and the United States had taken a  major step to further develop their relations.    Coordination between the Western countries and between the  Western countries and the countries of Eastern Europe and the  former Soviet Union also achieved positive results. On 10 and  11 January, U.S. President Clinton attended the NATO summit  meeting in Brussels. As a result of this coordination, NATO  accepted a U.S.-proposed ""peace partnership"" scheme, and this  mitigated the contradictions with Russia caused by the original  plan to expand the scope of NATO to some East European  countries. After that, Clinton visited Moscow. After the  United States and Russia held consultations with Ukraine, on 14  January, the presidents of the three countries signed an  agreement on dismantling nuclear weapons inside the territory of  Ukraine. Thus, a major problem of the nuclear arsenal left over  from the Cold War was solved.    As for regional problems, President Clinton and Syrian  President al-Asad held talks in Geneva in a harmonious  atmosphere, and the talks brought about an opportunity to reopen  the Israeli-Syrian talks. While the implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement has encountered difficulties, PLO  Chairman 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Peres held a  meeting when attending the annual conference of the World  Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. They discussed ways to  settle differences between the two sides. Reportedly, the talks  between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have ""approached the  conclusion of a final agreement.""    Some goodwill messages also came from the talks between the  United States and the DPRK on the development of nuclear weapons  in Korea. On 29 January, Billy Graham, a representative of  American evangelical Christianity, met President Kim Il-sung in  Pyongyang, and conveyed a message from President Clinton to  President Kim. Graham and Kim Il-sung ""held talks in a sincere  and friendly atmosphere."" This indicated the ""determination to  make efforts to establish a peaceful and friendly relationship  between the two countries.""    Disputes continue to occur among various countries, and the  world is full of contradictions. Using force and exercising  pressure only intensifies the contradictions. Only dialogue on  an equal footing will reduce trouble and turn danger into  safety. It is hoped that the trend of coordination and dialogue  shown in January 1994 will continue, and this will provide a  bright future to the world.     "

He said the  Russian side has run into some difficulties with the technical  side of the operation, which prevents it from setting things in  motion. The Russian customs officials at Kingissepp have  detained a container without which the dismantling cannot begin,  Tikk claimed.    The government representative said that a Russian landing  ship stands ready in Paldiski's South Port to receive the parts  of the dismantled reactors.    Russia wants to conclude a joint agreement on the removal of  fuel and on the dismantling of the reactors. Estonia stands  firm that both operations must be regulated by separate  treaties. ""We still don't know how (Russia plans) to handle the  dismantling of the reactors and their removal from Paldiski,""  Tikk said. But, he said, the removal of nuclear fuel has been  finalized down to the last detail.    BNS has information nuclear fuel will be removed from  Paldiski by rail. Tikk declined to conform or deny the report.  ""Whichever kind of transport is used, safety will be guaranteed  in any case,"" he stated.    Tikk claimed the most hazardous stage of the operation is  opening of the reactor lid. ""Yet, even if radioactive vapor  should escape, it won't pose a very great danger since the cloud  will disperse soon,"" he maintained.    Jan Christer Lindhe, a researcher from the Swedish National  Radioactivity Protection Institute, also voiced the opinion that  the reactors don't constitute a big threat to the environment.  ""It's more of a political problem,"" he claimed.    ""Should an accident occur, we shan't keep it secret,"" Tikk  declared. Estonia monitors continuously the radiation level  around the reactors and if something occurs there that the  Russian side would like to hush up, Estonia will spread the news  through all mass media channels.    The Estonian Government decided on April 12 to enforce a  special regime on the Pakri peninsula where Paldiski is situated  to ensure the safety of the dismantling operation and the  population.

Moderately optimistic about  the nuclear agreement for the future since, according to him,  the president has met Parliament's demands, Kravtchuk's adviser  sees no progress being made on the dossier regarding the Black  Sea fleet.    The tripartite agreement between the United States, Russia,  and Ukraine, signed last Friday in Moscow, was saluted yesterday  by the European Union as ""an important contribution to  international security and stability,"" albeit on condition that  it be implemented rapidly, failing which any delay would be  considered with great anxiety.    The practical implementation of the agreement effectively  depends on the backing of the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev. Not  directly, but with respect to the conditions that it imposed on  the ratification of the Start I agreement on the reduction of  strategic nuclear arms, and on the ratification of the treaty on  nuclear non-proliferation, both of which Washington had laid  down as preconditions. However, the Ukrainian leaders are  proving relatively confident on these points. That is what was  explained to us yesterday by Anton Buteyko in an interview given  while passing through Brussels. However, he believes that the  West is focussing too much attention on the nuclear problem and  forgetting that other elements are emerging as definitely just  as important. Consequently, he argues, the development of equal  relations with the European Union would contribute to the  stability of the region.    Moreover, in his opinion, only Ukraine can check the  pressure  in Russia caused by new political forces like that of  Zhirinovskiy. For, in his view, the renaissance of these fascist  movements is a menace not only to Ukraine, but also to Europe as  a whole.    Delstanche: Do you think it will be easy to obtain  the Ukrainian Parliament's support for the tripartite agreement  on denuclearization?    Buteyko: The agreement does not formally require  ratification. On the other hand, when Parliament ratified the  Start I treaty, it voiced a certain number of reservations, in  particular concerning the security guarantee for Ukraine, and  the provision of technological and financial assistance in the  context of disarmament. In fact, it must be clear that when  Start I was negotiated, all the arms to be destroyed had to be  eliminated using the combined economic resources of the USSR as  a whole, whereas now we would have to destroy them using our own  resources. That, however, is impossible in view of the economic  crisis ravaging our country. Furthermore, the destruction of  this arsenal will benefit the Western nations at which the arms  in question were aimed. Therefore, it is logical that they  should contribute to that process, for we are contributing to  their security. Then again, Parliament has asked for  compensation for the material contained in the tactical and  strategic arms handed over to Russia.    In addition, it must be remembered that the negotiations  were  launched at the initiative of Ukraine, but that neither the  United States nor Russia took our interests into account. It  was Parliament's decision regarding the Start I treaty that  provided a positive impulse in the negotiations. All the more  so since we also understood that it was impossible to resolve  certain matters on a bilateral basis.  Horyn: Well, this high-ranking German official  explained his idea in approximately this way. Ukraine is  presently in a state of crisis. We do not have enough food.  However, some 10 years will pass, and our state will finally be  standing on its own two feet. It will be a competitor on  European agricultural markets. At the same time, traditional  exporters, such as Germany and France, will find themselves in a  difficult situation....    I replied to those arguments by saying that had Ukraine  remained within the empire, the entire Europe would have been  compelled to spend huge amounts of money on armaments in order  to insure themselves against the imperial threat. Europe would  have trembled before the Moscow empire as it did after World War  II.    Ukraine is not only a dream of the people and the form of  their survival. Ukraine is a factor of stability, peace, and  de- imperialization in Europe. Ukraine must become a therapist  of the imperial moods that prevail among the Russian people.  The recent elections in Russia are disturbing.    Pasichnyy: After all, the consequences of the  recent elections in Russia have again placed before the world a  threat of direct invasion from Moscow. Chauvinism is still  alive, and it has now acquired features of communo-fascism....    Horyn: Yes, they showed that it is not only the  ruling circles in the Kremlin that are infected with the virus  of imperialism. Many Russians display deep nostalgia for the  empire, because its very existence raised our neighbors in their  own eyes.    The results of the elections in Russia have also contributed  to a change in orientations in the West's attitude toward  Ukraine. Instead of diktat, we see a striving for a dialogue.    Pasichnyy: Pan Mykhaylo, you, as chairman of  Ukraine's Republican Party, are a candidate for deputy of the  Supreme Council at the coming elections. What is the attitude  of the Republicans toward Ukraine's nuclear status?    Horyn: We believe that the very fact of nuclear  missiles in Ukraine is a guarantee for us and a warning for all  of our neighbors that they should refrain from playing with  fire. We are not opponents of disarmament and we are not  against dismantling those missiles whose service life has  expired. However, in our opinion, 46 missiles must be left and  dismantled only after all nuclear powers make identical steps.    One more thing. Russia, after it received from us a large  number of medium-range missiles, has not to this day paid us for  the nuclear fuel -- this sum constitutes several billions of  U.S. dollars.    I, for example, do not agree that, while dismantling the  nuclear warheads, we should also be compelled to dismantle the  missiles themselves. They are our separate property -- they  were built at our factories. We will be able to use them to  protect ourselves from territorial encroachments by aggressors.    I hope that the president will not hasten to sign the  necessary documents that would fully disarm Ukraine. It would  be an irreparable blunder.     "

Israeli leaders were understood to have voiced their concern to Mr Tereschenko that none of the central Asian republic's nuclear expertise or weaponry, which includes multi-warhead SS-18 ground-to-ground missiles and nuclear bombers, should fall into the hands of Iran or Arab states hostile to Israel. Kazakhstan has entered an agreement, along with Ukraine and Belarus, to return its nuclear arsenal to Russia by the end of 1994. Mr Tereschenko said fears that economic difficulties might tempt Kazakhstan to sell some of its arsenal 'to Iran or any other country' were unfounded. The prime minister's three-day visit is the highest-level exchange so far in a growing effort by the Jewish state to develop trade and diplomatic links with the former Soviet Moslem republics. Israel is anxious to blunt the influence of Iran and Arab countries over the newly independent regimes, as well as lay the groundwork for what it hopes will be lucrative long-term trade ties. It has made considerable progress with Kazakhstan, run by secular former communists. Mr Tereschenko, who was due to sign several agreements covering trade, technology and cultural exchanges during his visit, held talks with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli premier, and Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister. They decided to set up a committee to study joint economic projects. Two Israeli private-sector companies, Merhav and Mr Shaul Eisenberg's Israel Corporation, have together already established contracts in Kazakhstan, mainly in upgrading agriculture, worth about Dollars 65m (Pounds 33m) a year, officials estimated. A joint US-Israeli team is now in Kazakhstan studying possible agricultural aid schemes.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Tarand  suspects, however, that Russia may start slowing down the  dismantling of the nuclear reactors.

Tiiman stressed that the dismantling could be completed  within three years. Earlier, the Russian party had proposed  that the work be completed by 1999.    The first stage of the dismantling, considered the most  dangerous, consists of the withdrawal of fuel bars and can be  started in the next few days, Tiiman said. This stage is  expected to be finished before June 31, 1994. During the second  stage Russian specialists will withdraw the secret technical  equipment of the reactors after which the last stage begins. It  consists of the dismantling of the walls of the reactors.    Tiiman spoke against temporary or permanent conservation of  the reactors' bodies in Estonia. He pointed out that all of  them must be withdrawn to Russia.    In accordance with the Russian-Estonian agreements Russia  will carry out all the work on dismantling and Estonia will be  responsible for security in the city and its outskirts and will  participate in possible emergency works. Russian  representatives at the international conference in Stockholm  earlier this year agreed to let foreign observers to the last  stage of the work.     "

By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      For all the fear that Iraq is generating with its threat of using chemical  weapons, the fact remains that the United States has a far larger and more  potent supply of nerve and mustard gas at its disposal -- enough, by some  estimates, to kill everyone in the world 5,000 times.

Still, the possibility of the United States turning its chemical weapons on the  Iraqis remains remote, even if Iraq uses chemicals first. For one thing, world  opinion likely would turn against a superpower that inflicted the torture of  chemical weapons; for another, other weapons probably would work better.    ""Rather than make their missile sites more difficult to operate (by disabling  Iraqi troops with chemical weapons), blow them to smithereens,"" suggested  Gordon Burke, senior policy analyst for EAI Corp., a defense-industry  consulting firm. ""That would get to the point much faster.""    Using chemical weapons is a decision that could be made only by the President.  However, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Tuesday that he ""cannot conceive of  a situation"" in which the United States would use chemical weapons against  Iraq.    The world has viewed chemical weapons with particular horror since the Germans  used mustard gas in World War I, killing 100,000 and causing 1.3 million  casualties. Troops sometimes woke up in their foxholes to find that they were  lying in pools of the viscous liquid, which causes terrible blisters when it  touches skin, Burke said. Inhaled, it can blister the inside of the lungs.    Nerve agents, developed in the late 1930s, cause the entire nervous system to  break down. A lethal dose of some types could fit on the point of a pin, and a  liter jar could contain enough to kill a million people, Burke said.    The United States has been building its stockpile of chemical weapons for  decades. Production was halted for 18 years after former President Richard M.  Nixon declared a moratorium in 1969. President Ronald Reagan began pressing for  a resumption early in his Administration, citing evidence that the Soviets were  adding to their chemical arsenal.    The United States acknowledges having about 25,000 tons of chemical weapons, a  supply second only to that of the Soviet Union, which says that it has 50,000  tons. President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed in June  to begin dismantling the two countries' stockpiles, so that neither country  will have more than 5,000 tons by the end of 1992.    In recent years, America produced chemical weapons because it feared that ""the  Soviets might come roaring across Europe behind a cloud of chemicals,"" Burke  said.    But while the United States' top priority was countering a superpower threat,  chemical weapons also were becoming what analysts call ""the poor man's nuclear  arsenal"" -- weapons available to any country with a petrochemical, fertilizer  or pharmaceutical industry, according to a report by the Center for Defense  Information in Washington.    Iraq is believed to have several thousand tons of chemical weapons, CIA  Director William H. Webster told Congress in early 1989.    More frightening than the size of Iraq's arsenal is its inclination to use it.  About 200 civilians died during the Iran-Iraq War when both sides used chemical  weapons, and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has used nerve gas against Kurdish  rebels in his own country.    Both the United States and Iraq signed the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which  banned first use of chemical weapons. The talks currently under way in Geneva  are aimed at a global ban, but it probably will be years before a treaty is  negotiated and signed.

Nedyukha, candidate of technological  sciences: ""Ukraine's Nuclear `Cheapness'""]    [Text] Here is information that was broadcast on 16  January on the ""Ostankino"" TV channel: ""Ukraine will not  receive any other compensations except for reciprocal fuel  elements for atomic electric power plants."" Proceeding from  this concise thesis, what advantages for Ukraine can one speak  about in general?    First, Ukraine will only receive $300 million out of the  $800  million allocated by the United States for the nuclear  disarmament of the CIS countries. This sum [$300 million] is  allocated for dismantling the world's third most powerful  nuclear arsenal that is much larger than those of, for example,  Belarus and Kazakhstan taken together.    Second, Ukraine will have to allocate several times that sum  from its own resources for the destruction of the missiles  themselves, their fuel filling, and especially launch silos. In  accordance with previous estimates, this will amount to at least  $3.2 billion. However, who will cover the resulting deficit of  about $3 billion for the service being rendered by Ukraine in  order to reinforce the national security of the United States  and Russia, something, which the leaders of those countries do  not deny. What about the advertised free market principles,  based upon a balance of demand and supply?    Third, if something really needs to be compensated for in  full, it is Ukraine's growing strategic vulnerability. In  accordance with the information issued by high-ranking  representatives of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense that was  broadcast on Ukrainian TV Channel One on 17 January, it may be  necessary to proceed to modern types of nonnuclear weapons,  something about which the Ukrainian president cautioned earlier.  This means that it will be necessary to take additional  enormous sums from the budget. However, due to the absence of  any prospects of resolving this problem without assistance from  the Russian military industrial complex, more specifically, by  crediting its functioning, this may only be done by lowering the  standard of living of the Ukrainian population.    Fourth, such crediting will, in fact, be done for Russia's  atomic industry. Russia has the possibility of selling the  Ukrainian part of uranium for hard currency and at world prices  and, at the same time, setting exclusive prices for those fuel  elements that will be supplied to Ukraine. Belarus has already  expressed its disagreement with Russia's thesis that the ""lion's  share"" of profits from the sales of uranium will go toward  covering the expenditure for destroying the missiles (IZVESTIYA,  19 January 1994.)    Moreover, at the news conference held by Colonel General Ye.  Maslin, main expert of Russia's Ministry of Defense, that was  broadcast by ""Ostankino"" on 18 January, a categorical demand was  made that all nuclear missile warheads be immediately  transferred to Russia as only then would reciprocal supplies of  fuel elements be made. As they say, the more you have, the more  you want.    On the whole, even from the point of view of the degree of  reliability of the highly advertised economic advantages that  Ukraine may get, all of this does not look as radiant and nice  as the numerous ""advertisers"" are trying to prove.

In simpler terms, this statement means  that the United States will certainly never get involved in  warfare with nuclear Russia, even if the latter does resume its  ""old"" practices.

Nedyukha, candidate of technological  sciences: ""Ukraine's Nuclear `Cheapness'""]    [Text] Here is information that was broadcast on 16  January on the ""Ostankino"" TV channel: ""Ukraine will not  receive any other compensations except for reciprocal fuel  elements for atomic electric power plants."" Proceeding from  this concise thesis, what advantages for Ukraine can one speak  about in general?    First, Ukraine will only receive $300 million out of the  $800  million allocated by the United States for the nuclear  disarmament of the CIS countries. This sum [$300 million] is  allocated for dismantling the world's third most powerful  nuclear arsenal that is much larger than those of, for example,  Belarus and Kazakhstan taken together.    Second, Ukraine will have to allocate several times that sum  from its own resources for the destruction of the missiles  themselves, their fuel filling, and especially launch silos. In  accordance with previous estimates, this will amount to at least  $3.2 billion. However, who will cover the resulting deficit of  about $3 billion for the service being rendered by Ukraine in  order to reinforce the national security of the United States  and Russia, something, which the leaders of those countries do  not deny. What about the advertised free market principles,  based upon a balance of demand and supply?    Third, if something really needs to be compensated for in  full, it is Ukraine's growing strategic vulnerability. In  accordance with the information issued by high-ranking  representatives of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense that was  broadcast on Ukrainian TV Channel One on 17 January, it may be  necessary to proceed to modern types of nonnuclear weapons,  something about which the Ukrainian president cautioned earlier.  This means that it will be necessary to take additional  enormous sums from the budget. However, due to the absence of  any prospects of resolving this problem without assistance from  the Russian military industrial complex, more specifically, by  crediting its functioning, this may only be done by lowering the  standard of living of the Ukrainian population.    Fourth, such crediting will, in fact, be done for Russia's  atomic industry. Russia has the possibility of selling the  Ukrainian part of uranium for hard currency and at world prices  and, at the same time, setting exclusive prices for those fuel  elements that will be supplied to Ukraine.

The date for starting the work will  be most likely set on Apr. 22 or 23, when the Russian group to  carry out the dismantling is scheduled to arrive at the  facility, located some 35 kilometers to the west of Tallinn.  But Tikk expressed hope that the work will still start this  month. The two countries have already agreed upon the technical  issues pertaining to the dismantling of the reactors in the  Russian submarine crew training center.    Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for talks  with Russia and head of the group for military issues of the  delegation, said Estonia had proposed what he called a totally  new plan for the dismantling. ""This idea is different from the  earlier ones. Our position is that the rods must be out from  Estonia by June 30, 1994. But the rest of the work --  dismantling of the reactor corpus and taking out the solid and  liquid nuclear waste -- must take place as quickly as possible,""  Tiiman said in a press conference of the Estonian delegation.  He said the idea reminded of an earlier suggestion, according  to which the reactors would be mounted on special trailers and  taken away by ship or train. He refused to specify.    Tiiman characterized his country's new proposal as optimal.  He said work according to this scheme would cost Estonia less  than 10 million U.S. dollars.    The Estonian Cabinet at its meeting on Apr. 12 ruled to  introduce emergency regulations on the Pakri peninsula, where  Paldiski is situated, during the period of work on the reactors.  The regulations, to become effective after a decree by the  minister of the interior, will make the region again off-limits  area for outsiders. Estonian officials say that if Russia  agrees to the scheme proposed by the country, the whole process  of dismantling the reactors will take about three years.     "

0,FT922-10699 ,"FT922-10699 _AN-CD3BPAAGFT 920430   FT  30 APR 92 / Russia and Ukraine slip toward Slav 'cold war': Tensions over nuclear arms, the Black Sea Fleet and the Crimea      By JOHN LLOYD, JUDY DEMPSEY and CHRYSTIA FREELAND   MR LEONID Kravchuk, the Ukrainian President, will not be a wholly welcome guest when he arrives in the US next week for meetings with President George Bush. He is seen as indulging in too much brinkmanship of the most dangerous kind in his relations with neighbouring Russia. There is a knot of issues between the two Slav states. One part of that is now being discussed between representatives from both in the Ukrainian port city of Odessa - control of the Black Sea Fleet. Both states are vying for control over this 380-ship, 70,000-man navy, now largely militarily obsolete. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the head of the Commonwealth of Independent States armed forces, said in Odessa yesterday that the talks would be 'very difficult' and that Ukraine should have 'at the maximum' 25 per cent of it. Nevertheless, that was a shift in the Russian position from one of claiming total control, and one which may make a compromise possible. Beyond the fleet dispute, however, are larger issues, all of which have their roots in the dissolution of the Soviet Union in which the two states were the largest and most influential members, and in the subsequent explosion of nationalist sentiment on both sides of their borders. That sentiment puts such pressures on both President Kravchuk and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia that a broader compromise is increasingly difficult. More important than the Black Sea fleet to both states is the Crimea, where the fleet is based. Until 1954, it was Russian territory: since then it has been Ukrainian, but the population is mainly Russian and in two months' time it is to vote in a referendum on the question of independence and of subsequent association with 'another state' - presumably Russia. Yesterday, Ukraine's parliament, in a move supported by a majority of deputies who it seems hope to avoid a referendum, proclaimed the Crimea as an 'autonomous part of the Ukraine'. However, almost half the 22 deputies walked out in protest, still demanding full independence. Most important to the international community is control of the nuclear arsenal, both strategic and tactical. No defence expert in Moscow or Kiev can give a precise figure of the tactical weapons in Ukraine - but a general estimate is of at least a thousand. Under an agreement with the CIS earlier this year, Ukraine said that these weapons would be moved to, and dismantled in, Russia by June 1992. The reductions form part of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty signed between Moscow and Washington in 1987. At the beginning of March, the Kiev government stopped transferring the weapons after about half had been moved - on the grounds that it did not believe that Russia was dismantling them, and that Russia would use them to increase its own arsenal. After many bilateral meetings between Ukrainian and Russian officials, both sides confirmed that the tactical weapons would start moving again  - though on the Russian side, the foreign ministry has said it has 'yet to see evidence of movement'. Moving the 176 strategic Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) is proving still more difficult. Under the Start (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreement signed between the US and the former Soviet Union in Moscow in July 1991, the missile forces in the CIS must be cut from 9,700 to 4,900 by 1994. This includes 130 of the ICBMs stationed in Ukraine. Ukraine has agreed to give up this number - but the status of the remaining 46 SS-24 ICBMs, with 10 warheads each, remains contentious. Mr Kravchuk, in advance of his US visit, now insists on security guarantees from the West in return for their dismantling - citing 'territorial claims' on Ukraine from Russia as the reason for his caution. On the Russian side, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, has doubts about Ukraine's commitment to a nuclear-free status. He and other Russian officials argue that Ukraine wants to retain the 46 ICBMs as a means of protecting its independence, and of securing a seat at the table where Start II will be negotiated. 'It is clear that the (first) Start treaty was a bilateral treaty between the US and the former USSR. Whether you like it or not, Russia . . . should be the one which will ratify that treaty. The question for us is how many nuclear states will emerge in the former USSR,' said Mr Kozyrev. 'At the same time, Ukraine is demanding a status as a party to (ratifying) the Start treaty, (yet) it speaks of signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state. This is a contradiction in terms,' he added. Mr Alexander Savelev, head of the independent Institute for National Security and Strategic Studies in Moscow, said: 'The question of who should control the nuclear arsenal is seen by the Ukraine as a matter of prestige, compounded by a feeling that it still sees Russia as a threat to its independence. In this sense, these 46 ICBMs could be used as a bargaining chip.' Meanwhile, in Moscow, conservative deputies at the recent Russian congress tabled a motion questioning the legality of the decision by Mr Nikita Khrushchev, a former Soviet leader (and a Ukrainian), to transfer the Crimea from Russia to the Ukraine in 1954. But the last thing Russian government officials and defence experts in Moscow want is any re-drawing of the internal borders of the former Soviet Union. 'Borders should not be changed in this period of transition. It is too dangerous. Where would it stop? The problem is the influence of nationalist forces in Russia who could push for these territorial changes,' said Mr Alexei Pankin, deputy editor of International Affairs, the Moscow-based foreign policy journal. The next few weeks should tell if compromises on the fleet, on Crimea and on possession of the weapons are possible: realistically, that is all the time both states have to broker a deal. Beyond that, the pressures from nationalist forces, rising faster the more pronounced their economic crises become, will drown out moderate voices and force a retreat into armed camps to a position now becoming all too thinkable: a 'cold war' between the Slav neighbours.

0,FT921-16066 ,"FT921-16066 _AN-CAGBXAATFT 920107   FT  07 JAN 92 / US urged to slash N-arsenal: Report backs nuclear weapons as deterrent to third world      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   THE US should cut its strategic nuclear arsenal by 60 per cent and completely revise its missile targeting strategy, according to a report by a high-level Pentagon advisory panel. The panel recommends cutting the number of strategic nuclear warheads to around 5,000, roughly half the level that would be permitted by the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed last year by the US and the Soviet Union. It advocates, however, using the nuclear threat not only to deter nuclear aggression but also as a deterrent to third world countries which might possess chemical or biological weapons, and as a symbol of US power in the world. The recommendations would represent a significant shift in US nuclear strategy, but still fall some way short of the changes that some analysts have suggested in light of the collapse of the Soviet Union. President George Bush announced in September a series of unilateral measures that significantly cut the number of tactical nuclear weapons deployed by the US, but some critics in Congress and outside have urged him to go further in cutting strategic weapons. According to reports in the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, the panel, chaired by former air force secretary Mr Thomas Reed, recommends preserving a nuclear arsenal that remains larger than the combined total of warheads possessed by China, France and the UK. It also argues that maintaining a substantial nuclear deterrent helps discourage Japan and Germany from developing their own nuclear weapons. Defence analysts noted yesterday that the report's emphasis on preserving a nuclear deterrent against third world threats, now that the Soviet threat has diminished so dramatically, parallels the arguments made by the Defence Department for keeping weapons systems which were originally designed with Cold War objectives in mind. The B2 stealth bomber, for example, was originally devised to penetrate Soviet air defences. Its backers have faced an increasingly difficult task in persuading Congress to maintain funding, but have argued that the success of the F117 stealth fighter in Operation Desert Storm justifies preserving the B2 for conventional missions. The report argues for abandoning the US's 1979 pledge not to use its missiles against third world countries that do not themselves possess nuclear weapons. It says the nuclear arsenal could be used as a deterrent against a wide range of threats, such as the annihilation of countries such as Israel and Taiwan, the seizure of vital raw materials or foreign domination of a segment of space.

0,FT932-1395 ,"FT932-1395 _AN-DFXCNAAVFT 930624   FT  24 JUN 93 / Brussels gurus raise old taboos to find mystery of job creation: The search for radical and acceptable solutions to Europe's growing levels of unemployment      By DAVID GOODHART   A MIDDLE-RANKING manager in a Belgian company on a gross salary of BFr100,000 (Pounds 1,953) a month will cost his or her employer about BFr250,000 a month and will receive in take-home pay only about BFr50,000. To dismiss the same manager will cost the employer about three times the employee's annual salary. The European Commission's post-Copenhagen investigation of competitiveness and job creation - due to generate several reports by the end of the year - will not shy away from examining whether such high payroll taxes and high costs of sacking personnel have contributed to Europe's high unemployment levels. But it is already clear that the Commission's brain-storming will not conclude that the Social Chapter is a bad idea or that European countries should slash their welfare states and adopt the 'hire and fire' policies of the US labour market, where two-thirds of all employees can be fired at will. That does not disturb Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of Unice, the European employers' body. He says: 'It is a gross over-simplification to place all the blame for competitiveness problems on the Social Chapter and labour market rigidities. It may not even be the most important part of the problem.' He does, however, believe that radical questions should be asked of all the institutions that help or hinder employment creation. That means not only the familiar questions about whether employment agencies are matching supply and demand and whether the unemployed have the required skills. It also means, he believes, looking at the price of labour, in particular minimum wage legislation and payroll taxes; the costs and inflexibilities imposed by labour legislation; and the disincentive to seek lower-paid work created by some welfare regimes. The Commission's own agenda is not identical with Unice's but Mr Tyszkiewicz does believe that 'people are now starting the ask questions that have in the past been taboo'. The intellectual challenge for the EC's labour market experts is to come up with a strategy which creates sufficient labour market flexibility to make the unemployed 'outsiders' more attractive to employ without undermining the rights of the already securely employed 'insiders'. The EC has very little direct authority over labour markets, except through its own minimum standard employment directives, but it can analyse best practice across the Community and act as a clearing house for good ideas on job-creation. The Commission is unlikely to start advising member states to start dismantling minimum wage legislation, but it will be examining some parts of the 'deregulatory' agenda, especially in relation to why the European service sector is not more labour intensive. Two particularly important areas of inquiry are likely to be the scope for reducing or shifting payroll taxes and the room for increasing 'atypical' work (part-time, fixed contract and temporary work), especially in the southern European countries. In many of these areas the Commission will be pushing on an open door. The Spanish government is deeply concerned about the high cost of firing and the Belgian government is currently considering a large reduction in payroll social security contributions in exchange for higher energy taxes. Indeed, throughout the 1980s there has been a slow movement towards greater flexibility across almost all EC countries. In the UK that has been accompanied by a reduction in employment rights, through, for example, a significant increase in the qualifying period for employment protection. Such deregulation in the UK has been associated with a large increase in 'atypical' jobs, usually taken by women - but in fact many more such jobs were created in Britain in the more regulated 1970s than the deregulated 1980s and 1990s. Other EC countries have also seen a big increase in 'atypical' jobs in the 1980s, but usually without the accompanying reductions in employment rights. In the 1980s, both Germany and Spain significantly relaxed the rules surrounding fixed contract and temporary work. In other areas, too, there has been movement towards Euro-flexibility. Italy has abandoned indexation of wages and several countries have increased flexibility on working hours, including Spain, France and Italy. Even in countries with relatively tight regulation of working time, such as Belgium and Germany, there has been a trade-off between reduced hours and more flexible use of machinery. One area where the Commission could now make a reforming gesture at little political cost would be to speed up moves to allow the operation of private employment agencies - which are still banned or severely restricted in Greece, Italy, Spain and Germany. The International Confederation of Temporary Businesses has made a formal complaint to the Commission about the restrictions in Italy, Spain and Germany, but has had little response. In view of the new unemployment initiative, the organisation is stepping up its campaign. It claims, for example, that 25 per cent of temporary workers get permanent jobs and that the restrictions on agencies is costing 800,000 jobs. Whatever the validity of such figures it seems certain that the confederation's complaint will attract new interest over the coming months as the Commission strives to shape the jobs debate.

0,FT931-16164 ,"FT931-16164 _AN-DAHCDAC4FT 930108   FT  08 JAN 93 / Ukraine puts brakes on Start: Kiev might obstruct nuclear cuts      By CHRYSTIA FREELAND   George Bush put the finishing touches to his foreign policy legacy in Moscow last weekend when he signed the Start 2 agreement with Boris Yeltsin. But President-elect Bill Clinton may well wish his predecessor had taken the time to visit Kiev. For the unprecedented cuts in the world's nuclear arsenal agreed in Moscow hinge on the decisions of a country which was overlooked by the summit - Ukraine. In addition to Russia, three republics - Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine - still have nuclear weapons stationed on their territories. Kazakhstan has already followed Russia's lead in ratifying the 1990 Start 1 treaty agreed between the Soviet Union and the US, which promised cuts in both countries' long-range nuclear missiles. Belarus can be expected to follow suit if Ukraine complies. But the Ukrainian parliament is resisting ratification of Start 1. And under the accord reached in Moscow, Start 2 cannot go into effect until the previous treaty is ratified. Moreover, in the view of western military specialists, Ukraine is the only non-Russian republic with the capacity to become a nuclear power. It is home to many of the factories used to develop the Soviet nuclear arms industry, and the government in Kiev has won over the loyalty of most of the former Soviet soldiers serving within Ukraine's borders. As a result, many of the personnel guarding the 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles stationed on its territory take orders from Kiev. Thanks to the combination of military potential and political resistance, Ukraine has suddenly emerged as the critical piece in the international disarmament puzzle. Resolving the issue of Ukraine's nuclear arms is complicated by the divisions among the country's leaders. A vocal minority comprising Ukrainian nationalists and ex-communist hardliners contends that nuclear weapons are Ukraine's only guarantee against aggression from Russia. It believes such safeguards are increasingly important, as relations between the two countries have deteriorated following disputes over the division of the Black Sea naval fleet and Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. The Ukrainian ministries of defence and foreign affairs, by contrast, continue to support removal of nuclear weapons. Marshal General Konstantin Morozov, the liberal minister of defence, has repeatedly warned the Ukrainian parliament that retaining the country's nuclear weapons would be prohibitively expensive and technically complicated, and that they should be removed in line with the Start 1 treaty. His views are supported by President Leonid Kravchuk and Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma. But removal of nuclear weapons requires the agreement of parliament, and that will not be easy to win. Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, the influential chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs, has said that the legislature will not consider Start 1 until the country's economic reform programme has been approved by parliament. Even then, ratification of the treaty will face a long and difficult passage. One reason is that Ukraine's fragmented legislature has begun to vote with increasing autonomy and is less amenable to control from President Kravchuk. But there is a second explanation. Having understood the strength of its bargaining position, Ukraine is determined to get something in exchange for surrendering its nuclear weapons. Its two principal desires are economic aid and security guarantees. The issue of economic aid is fairly straightforward. Ukraine is seeking Dollars 1.5bn in aid from the west to offset the cost of dismantling the missiles, and has hinted that a Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn fund to support the Ukrainian currency would speed ratification. After November's announcement of an economic reform programme by Mr Kuchma, western governments may be more willing to supply such finance. Security guarantees, however, are more contentious. Ideally, Ukraine would like public pledges of western assistance in the event of Russian aggression. Aware that they are unlikely to receive such pledges, Ukrainian diplomats are proposing a compromise: that all nuclear powers, or at least Russia and the US, guarantee that they will not attack Ukraine with nuclear or conventional weapons. To date, western governments have been dismissive of Ukraine's efforts to create a special security arrangement, and have instead exerted pressure on Kiev to ratify Start 1. Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of state, has warned of a serious deterioration in bilateral relations if the treaty is not ratified. A year ago, when Ukraine was a fledgling state on the brink of independence, a complete renunciation of nuclear weapons might have been won in exchange for an earlier and more enthusiastic acceptance of Ukraine into the international community. Now, after receiving only grudging international recognition and no substantial financial aid, Ukraine has adopted a tougher stance in diplomatic negotiations. Pressure from the US to eliminate its nuclear weapons has antagonised many Ukrainian politicians. As a result, Mr Clinton, who will be responsible for the next round of disarmament talks, may find the going much harder in Kiev than his predecessor did in Moscow.

Due to Russia's failure to implement the terms of the  contract, western countries are worried that Pyongyang might use  the submarine for military purposes, the sources said.    According to the contract, Russia must send military experts  for on-the-spot observation to confirm that the submarine is  used only as scrap iron and not for military reasons.    The sources said North Korea began dismantling the submarine  it purchased from Russia some months ago, but without  on-the-spot observation by Russian experts, the North Koreans  could use the submarine for military purposes.    For example, Pyongyang could use the parts in its own  submarines or try to improve its military technology by  examining the Russian sub, according to the sources.    Concerned about this possibility, Japan recently asked  Russia  to dispatch military experts to North Korea to observe the  submarine's dismantling, ITAR-TASS reported from Tokyo Thursday.    Russia contracted with North Korea, through the mediation of  a Japanese trading company, to sell 12 decommissioned submarines  and has delivered one so far.    The Russian Navy Command earlier clarified that the  dismantling of the submarine will be observed by Russian  military experts and that it must be used only as scrap iron.     "

Justice Minister Kaido Kama told BNS early in May that the  dismantling will probably start on 15 May. In accordance with  the agreed procedure, Russia is supposed to inform the Estonian  authorities of the starting date a week in advance. Tikk  declined to confirm or deny the operation going ahead on 15 May.    Tikk claimed both parties are prepared to immediately begin  the dismantling of the reactors. He said, however, that the two  containers for the removed nuclear fuel have not yet reached  Paldiski. Still, it is not clear why the Russian side keeps  putting off the operation, Tikk told BNS.    The government allocated earlier this month 1.4 million  kroons to cover the expenses of the dismantling. Kama said a  large share of the sum comes from foreign aid contributions made  specifically for the purpose.    A special ministerial commission was formed at the end of  April to monitor and regulate the removal of the nuclear  reactors from Paldiski. Earlier the same month the Cabinet  ruled to enforce a special regime in the Pakri peninsula where  Paldiski is located for the duration of the dismantling. Also,  a special rescue unit was formed to ensure safety of the  operation.     "

On Monday they will be joined by Swedish  specialists, and consultations will continue until June 22.    Latvia wishes to start the dismantling of the complex as  soon  as possible. Its construction was started in 1976 and stopped  in 1990. Production forms and records for those two buildings,  which have a height of seven and 18 floors, have already been  turned over to Latvia, as envisaged by bilateral agreements,  signed in Moscow on April 30. The Latvian Government announced  a contest among firms. It is going to place the order with the  firm which undertakes to dismantle the buildings quicker than  others with minimal expenditures. Americans promised to finance  the project. It is not clear, however, how much money will be  needed and in exactly what way the buildings will be dismantled.  The problem is being discussed with the participation of  officials from the U.S. Department of Defence.    The agreements signed in the Kremlin have not yet been  ratified by parliaments of the two countries. Latvian Prime  Minister Valdis Birkavs was asked: ""If the legislators do not  support the agreements, how will it affect the dismantling  process?"" He said that the facility already belonged to  Latvia, irrespective of the future of the treaty. Under the  agreements, the old radar will function for another four years.     "

According to the agreement on reducing conventional arms,  Belarus has to destroy 10 times as many tanks as Great Britain,  50 times as many as France, and 1.7 times as many as the United  States. The first stage of this agreement has already been  carried out; however, some difficulties are expected in the  implementation of future stages. According to Alyaksandr  Sychow, the aggravating economic situation in Belarus draws on  the increase in expenses for the dismantling of military  equipment. According to economic expert evaluations, Belarusian  expenditures will amount to about $8 million. According to  provisions for the first stage [of reductions], Belarus has  destroyed 645 tanks, 658 armored combat vehicles, and 50  aircraft. It is still necessary to destroy 1,212 tanks, 566  combat vehicles, and 80 aircraft. Due to the difficult economic  situation, the Republic of Belarus is not able to finance these  projects. Yet, as stated at the news conference, during its  visit, the Belarusian delegation did not receive any support for  the resolution of financial problems threatening the dismantling  of military equipment. The Belarusian delegation informed the  participants in the agreement on the reduction of conventional  arms in Europe that the term of this agreement may be broken by  the Belarusian side.    In the near future, a delegation of British, French, and  German experts is expected to arrive to Belarus to examine the  situation firsthand.     "

At least 100,000 US troops, he said, would remain in Europe 'not out of habit' but because the commitment was 'justified'. Proclaiming a 'new day for our transatlantic partnership' in a speech at Brussels town hall, the president declared that the US depended on the security of a free and democratic Europe. Mr Clinton said that the 'new security' would rest on three pillars - military strength, to be discussed at the Nato summit beginning today; economic security (Mr Clinton also announced that the long-delayed 'jobs summit' would be held in March); and the growth of democracy, which could prove effective in preventing another Bosnia. Mr Clinton commended to European attention the US Partnership for Peace proposals, to be endorsed at the Nato summit which would allow eastern European states gradually to strengthen their links with Nato. Alluding to fears aroused by the rise of Russian nationalism, Mr Clinton maintained it would be wrong 'to draw a new line between east and west that could create a self-fulfilling prophecy of future confrontation'. While 'the statements of some Russian political figures have given us all genuine cause for concern', the 'staggering' recent developments in Russia had to be kept in perspective. 'Our road to Europe's integration will be wider, smoother and safer' if Russia could be helped to evolve into 'a market democracy at peace with its neighbours', he said. It was vital that what might prove to be a 'fleeting' opportunity to bring the former Soviet bloc on should board not be missed, he said. Integration might prove 'gradual and often difficult', as Germany's experience had shown, but 'the Iron Curtain must not be replaced by a veil of indifference'. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, echoed Mr Clinton's theme yesterday, saying fears of a new 'threat from the east' would be dispelled by a strategy of partnership with the democratic forces in Russia, in spite of the success of the ultra-nationalist and communist parties in last month's elections. In particular, Mr Clinton urged western Europe to open its economic doors to the east. The success of eastern Europe 'will ultimately depend more on trade than aid', given the shortage of money in western government coffers. This meant continuing to reduce barriers to trade and investment, a message he will reinforce at a session with European Union leaders tomorrow. He is due to travel on to Prague, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva but that itinerary could change should a satisfactory agreement be reached over the dismantling of the nearly 1,800 former Soviet nuclear missiles based in Ukraine. A senior US official last night said 'a great deal of progress' had been made in negotiations involving Ukraine and Russia to resolve the question of the warheads. But he refused to speculate on whether Mr Clinton would fit in a meeting with Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk to initial any agreement, which would still be subject to ratification by the parliament in Kiev. A US offer to buy up to 500 tons of uranium extracted from Russian and Ukrainian missiles remains on the table.

The minister, speaking during a hastily convened press conference following news of the allied attack on Iraq, also said that Kuwait police had returned fire at three Iraqis he described as intelligence officers who had crossed at least 5km into Kuwait. The Kuwait police had killed one of the men, arrested another and injured a third who escaped back into Iraq, he added. Sheikh Nasser did not indicate if Iraq had begun dismantling the police posts before last night's allied raid on Iraq, but said: 'We hope that by tomorrow they will be removed altogether.' The six posts, which were manned by 46 Iraqi policemen, lay within what since last November's UN border demarcation is now Kuwaiti territory. Iraq had previously ignored a UN Security Council demand to dismantle and evacuate the six posts by January 15. Iraq's dismantling of the posts would amount to the country's first acknowledgment of the UN-demarcated border. This was drawn up by a special UN commission under the terms of Gulf war ceasefire resolution 687. Baghdad has previously rejected the border commission's findings, which moved the frontier north into what had become accepted as Iraqi territory, embracing five Iraqi oilfields and naval installations at Iraq's Umm Qasr port. Sheikh Nasser said that earlier yesterday morning, three Iraqis dressed in civilian clothing had fired at Kuwaiti police south of the demilitarised zone which extends 5km into Kuwaiti territory. The Iraqis, he said, were 'intelligence officers coming in to see positions taken by the Kuwaiti forces'. Since Kuwait's forces were put on high alert earlier this week, a line of tanks has dug in just south of the demilitarised zone. Sheikh Nasser said that the detained Iraqi had identified himself as 'a military person with a military rank'. Sheikh Nasser said he was confident Kuwait had nothing to fear from any potential Iraqi retaliation against the Gulf state after last night's raid on Iraq and, clearly conscious of charges that the Kuwait government was unprepared for the 1990 invasion, added: 'All necessary precautions have been taken.' However, the minister said that he believed the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission should be reinforced from its present level of 249 unarmed officers. Sheikh Nasser expressed 'disgust' at President Saddam Hussein's 1 1/2 -hour speech earlier in the day. He called on the Iraqi people to overthrow their leader. 'We hope the Iraqi people will come to their senses and take things into their own hands,' he said.   Countries:-  IQZ  Iraq, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9221  Police Protection.

The Defense Ministry told MLADA FRONTA DNES that it had sold  over 20,000 pistols through selected commercial firms last year,  plus 13 combat planes, four armored vehicles, and two  helicopters.    The ministry declined to provide details on where and for  how  much the technology was sold because that is a trade secret.  According to Bretislav Gregr, director of the Ministry of  Industry and Trade Licensing Administration, the technology that  the Army sold is mostly nonfunctional.    The trading company Omnipol, for instance, sold two combat  planes to Austria. They were a Soviet-made MiG 21-F and an L-29  jet of domestic production. A MiG-15 from the Army arsenal was  sold to Britain, and two OT-65 armored transporters from Army  inventory were sold to the Netherlands. In all cases, the  buyers were collectors--reportedly.    Omnipol also wanted to sell, from the Czech Army surplus,  several thousand CZ-52 pistols to Canada and the United States.  The deal did not materialize, however.    Two helicopters that were sold last year were bought by a  domestic company, and the machines have not left the Czech  Republic.    Apart from the military material that was sold, the Army has  destroyed 583 combat armored vehicles, 28 aircraft, 606 tanks,  and 621 artillery systems. Combat technology has been destroyed  according to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe  and the Vienna Treaty on Conventional Arms Reduction since 1992.     "

This plant is known to be the source of radioactive  waste dumped into the Japan Sea last October, and we were  allowed to take photos of submarines being dismantled. The  plant was filled with about 300 containers of solid nuclear  waste, and it was obvious the plant's storage capacity was  reaching its limits.    Last month, Russia refused to accept the new London  Convention, which prohibits the dumping of any radioactive waste  into the sea. The submarine dismantling plant is facing  difficulties in continuing its operations due to a surplus of  radioactive waste. Therefore, the plant is calling for the  resumption of dumping of radioactive waste.    ""Zvezda (Star)"" plant is located in Borshoy-Kamen Bay, 120  kilometers east of Vladivostok. The plant was founded in 1954  as a dock for warships and submarines, but is currently  dismantling superannuated nuclear-powered submarines which were  scrapped one after another during the past several years.    Unauthorized entry to the plant is strictly forbidden, and  the gate is guarded by security authorities. The plant is  divided into A and B zones, and when this correspondent visited  the facility, a ""Delta-1"" class (displacement: 9,000 tons) was  being disassembled in A zone. Both the bow and the stern of the  Delta-1 were sliced off, and the body was placed in a dock as if  it were a huge sausage. Its missile launcher used to be a great  threat to the Western nations, but it has now been reduced to a  pile of scrap iron. Compared to the beautifully streamlined  shapes of Russian submarines, of which this correspondent is  familiar, the heap of scrap iron looked miserable.    Director Maslakov said that the Zvezda plant had already  dismantled five nuclear submarines. He added that the plant  currently has four submarines to dismantle, but two of them are  still untouched.    Since the Russian Pacific Fleet has discontinued its dumping  of solid nuclear waste from 1990, about 300 containers (with a  capacity of 1.5 cubic meters each) of solid nuclear waste have  been stored in the plant. The dumping of liquid nuclear waste  was also suspended last fall due to criticism from the  international community. The liquid waste tankers ""TNT-5"" and  ""TNT-27"" were moored at a pier near the plant, but they were  said to be full of liquid waste.    Explaining the seriousness of the current situation,  Director  Maslakov stated: ""This plant is just like a man without a  kidney. The dismantling of nuclear submarines cannot continue  without the disposal of nuclear waste.

ROME      The quickening arms race in the Middle East is raising concerns among nations  bordering the Mediterranean. Libya, Israel, Syria, Iraq and Egypt have acquired  new and dangerous military technology, dramatically increasing the dangers of  local confrontations.    Europeans, who welcomed the elimination of the SS-20, cruise and Pershing 2  missiles, are dismayed by the prospect of a proliferation of new  mass-destruction weapons at their southern doorstep.    The list of hardware creating ominous risks gets longer every month: chemical  weapons, missiles, nuclear arsenals and sophisticated bombers.    As for Col. Moammar Kadafi's chemical plant, strong U.S. pressures have not  prevented the continuing transfer of technology and basic materials from  industrialized countries to Libya, according to European sources. The Western  World will soon have to decide what to do about it, but in the meantime a new  dimension has been added to the Libyan threat: the Soviet supply to Tripoli of  high-performance bombers and an airborne refueler.    Allies on the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have  been puzzled by the Soviet move, which contradicts the Kremlin's claim that  Moscow wants to play a more conciliatory role in the Arab-Israeli conflict,  seeking to increase its influence in the region through policies that bolster  stability, rather than undermine it.    The international press has focused its attention on the threat that an  enhanced Libyan capability might imply for Israel. However, William H. Webster,  director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, recently told a congressional  committee that if Libya extended the range and performances of its warplanes,  the entire balance of power in the region could be altered. All the more so,  given Kadafi's unpredictability. A couple of years ago he substantiated his  threats against Italy by ordering two Scud missiles -- which fortunately missed  -- to be fired at the Italian island of Lampedusa. Kadafi claimed a U.S. Coast  Guard station on Lampedusa had guided American planes on their April, 1986,  raid on Libya. The Italian Ministry of Defense has pointedly announced that new  radar systems will be installed in the southern part of the peninsula,  acknowledging that the Soviet SU-24 bombers recently sold to Libya could, if  refueled in the air, reach all of Italy -- as well as parts of France and West  Germany.    While the chemical weapons situation is not encouraging, recent developments  concerning missiles and their potential payloads are no brighter. These weapons  appear to be more freely available in the international arms market than was  intended by the seven industrial nations (the United States, Britain, Canada,  France, Italy, Japan and West Germany) when they agreed to restrict access to  missile technology in April, 1987, with the Missile Technology Control Regime.  And now there is a growing risk that surface-to-surface medium-range missiles  will be armed with nuclear warheads and spread throughout the Middle East.    Israeli officials have alleged that Iraq is secretely engaged in a crash  program to build nuclear warheads for a medium-range missile under development  with technical and financial assistance from Argentina and Egypt. While the  missile project (called Condor 2 by the Argentines) has been confirmed, the  allegations about the Iraqi nuclear program have raised doubts. Both the news  and the unconfirmed allegations, nevertheless, offer Israel a good reason -- or  a good pretext -- for proceeding with its crash program on nuclear arms,  missiles and other sophisticated weapons.    Estimates on the number of atomic warheads Israel possesses vary considerably,  depending on interpretations given to data that Israeli technician Mordechai  Vanunu disclosed in his Oct. 5, 1986, interview with the London Sunday Times.  Israel might have an arsenal of 100 to 200 nuclear devices, according to  several specialists who analyzed the data and examined the photographs supplied  by Vanunu. Accepting the authenticity of his technical data, Theodore Taylor, a  former U.S. weapons designer, and Frank Barnaby, a British nuclear scientist  who debriefed Vanunu extensively, also believe Israel has produced weapons that  use nuclear fusion: H-bombs.    The consensus among U.S. officials who have access to the information provided  by intelligence sources is that Israel's nuclear arsenal contains no more than  50 to 70 devices. Yet even an arsenal of this size is much bigger than all  previous estimates and could enable Israel to develop a nuclear strategy based  on a panoply of tactical, medium range and strategic atomic weapons.    This is a distinct change in the Middle East scenario. France has been until  now the only medium-size power to have a totally independent nuclear deterrent,  the force de frappe -- striking force -- and an original doctrine for its  employment. Has the force de frappe concept proliferated? Israel is apparently  developing a missile that can reach the Soviet Union. Should we conclude that  Israel has a nuclear defense strategy?    If this is a plausible conclusion, then Gen. Charles de Gaulle's predictions  have been proved right. De Gaulle was utterly skeptical about the possibility  of preventing the spread of atomic weapons trough international constraints.  His nuclear doctrine was based on the assumption that every industrial nation  would, in time, possess its own nuclear arsenal composed of a panoply of  weapons adapted to its specific situation and needs -- its own force de frappe.    The importance of Israel's nuclear development has increased to a point that it  might constitute an Israeli force de frappe doctrine -- a doctrine playing a  vital role in Israeli defense and strategic thinking. This, in turn, gives a  powerful impetus to the arms buildup of the Arab and Muslim states in the  region. Something must be done to arrest this calamitous spiral.

Until recently, relaxing tensions between the United States and the Soviet  Union seemed to mean dismantling nuclear armaments. No longer. At this week's  summit meeting, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev must turn to the future, drafting  plans for a system of peace in Europe to replace the system of nuclear  deterrence of the past. No matter how proudly the two leaders may display new  arms treaties in the next few months -- or days -- peace in Europe now has more  to do with the reunited Germany question than with cuts in nuclear and chemical  weapons. So this summit is mainly about Germany's relations with its neighbors  to the East and West. It is the thorniest issue imaginable.    The summit would be a total triumph for Bush if he could persuade Gorbachev  that a unified Germany belongs in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, whose  sole purpose for more than 40 years was to stand off the Soviet Union. The  short version of Gorbachev's reaction is, ""No way."" Not an irrational reaction  at all, given how the Soviet people suffered in fighting Germany during World  War II.    But Bush needs to make his best pitch anyway. The most compelling argument is  that the 19th- and 20th- Century Germany that twice nearly destroyed Europe had  no philosophical anchor and no political commitment to a peaceful Continent.  Whatever Gorbachev thinks of NATO, it has such a commitment and would provide  such an anchor.    But without the United States as a member, it would not have enough clout to  counterbalance the behemoth of a united Germany. NATO is a good way to bind the  United States to Germany and the rest of Europe. Without some kind of NATO,  Washington would be hard put to justify a major presence in a Europe that will  merge to become a more challenging economic force in 1992.    Americans and Germans are not alone in pressing the case for keeping Germany in  NATO. Many of NATO's 16 member nations agree, as do Poland and Czechoslovakia  in Eastern Europe. For now, this reflects Europe's collective sense that it  needs to keep a close eye on Germany and its military plans more than it needs  to keep a weakened Soviet Union at bay.    Bush probably is in a better position to give up points than Gorbachev. Some  elements in Moscow accuse Gorbachev of giving away the store. Moscow may have  made all the easy concessions it can afford. If NATO were somehow reconfigured,  even the Soviet armed forces, some of whose leaders can remember the German  siege of Leningrad and leveling of Stalingrad, might see the appeal. After all,  they won't want to gamble that Germany will behave, and their army is perhaps  in as bad a shape as the civilian economy, with draftees refusing to show up  for service and nearly 200,000 soldiers and their families without decent  housing.    Still, until the German question is settled, Gorbachev will not rush to cut his  forces and may even balk at withdrawing more Soviet troops from East Germany.  The danger in agreeing to disagree for a month or a year is not great. Bush can  bide his time. But that time must be used to figure out the shape and mission  of the new NATO. Bush already plans to meet this summer with the West European  allies to discuss a new role for the alliance, less military and more  political. He and Gorbachev should use this summit to make certain that each  understands the other's needs for a role in the European future. If that  happened, it would provide a base for Bush's summer talks on NATO's new role  and make this summit memorable.

In the  city of Semipalatinsk, where a smoky-brown mushroom created by a  nuclear explosion rose above the horizon, young teachers led  children into the schoolyard, and said as they pointed their  finger in the direction of the test range: ""That, children, is  where the nuclear shield of our motherland is being forged!""

The Semipalatinsk test range is the property of  Kazakhstan, while several of the design offices are the property  of Ukraine, not to mention the radar stations and nuclear strike  early warning resources, which remain on the territory of small  but proud and independent Baltic states. And if we add to this  the numerous treaties on disarmament, cessation and  nonproliferation, the cases of misappropriation of nuclear  materials, and the absence of money for scientific developments  and to support any sort of subsistence minimum for our nuclear  scientists, the question that arises is quite simple, but  extremely unpleasant: Is Russia left with anything of the  nuclear shield, of what it was that made it a great power?    It is unpleasant all the more so because skeptical  voices are already being heard both from across the ocean and  from the ""vast expanses"" of the near abroad. ""If sufficient  concern is not displayed toward the arsenal of a superpower of  such dimensions during political and economic reforms, the  result may be historically unprecedented leakage of nuclear  technology, and a catastrophe as yet unwitnessed in the world,""  declared U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter a  month ago.    [Yakovlev] You can't really say that the situation at  enterprises of our nuclear complex is very bright. And of  course, the fact that radioactive materials are being stolen is  a bad symptom. But we mustn't forget that the number of such  cases is relatively small, and that the uranium that has  disappeared was enriched to 2-4, and rarely 30 percent. It has  no relationship to nuclear weapon components. And besides its  use in nuclear fuel assemblies, this kind of uranium isn't much  good for anything but fishing: It might be good bait for  frogfish in terms of its relative weight.    When in 1992, and in subsequent years as well, reports  appeared that Kazakhstan had sold some sort of warheads to Iran,  that the Chechen Republic had possession of two nuclear devices,  and that a nuclear weapon cropped up in Azerbaijan, all we could  do was laugh. There is, after all, an extremely strict system of  controlling the presence and state of nuclear ammunition. All  parts of such ammunition, even those not associated with  fissionable materials--automatic units such as sensors for  example--bear a plant number. There is a data bank that can be  used to easily determine where a device is located, when it was  made, and what work has been done with it. It can even tell us  how many milligrams of precious metals a particular part  contains. If any sort of work is done, written confirmation of  what was inspected, what parts were replaced, and so on is  transmitted immediately to the ministry's central administration.    Moreover there are also a number of organizational measures:  Whenever a storage site is opened, entry of less than three  workers is categorically prohibited, and when charges are  shipped, not only is security intensified but also an escort  system is established and so-called specialized back-up systems  are put into place. I can therefore state quite certainly that  it is impossible to lose not only a nuclear charge but even its  vehicle or any other nonnuclear part of it.    [Belyaninov] Vitaliy Nikolayevich, Western specialists are  especially alarmed at the situation involving our tactical  weapons: nuclear artillery devices, ammunition for aviation, and  short-range missiles. In contrast to strategic missiles, use of  which requires creation of an entire infrastructure, tactical  weapons may be used by practically any state of the world  without any special trouble. Moreover, as they assert in the  United States, the exact quantity of our tactical devices is  still unknown to them. Officials in Washington state a figure of  19,000, while independent experts such as, for example, Bruce  Blaire from the Brookings Institution cites a figure of 43,000.    [Yakovlev] It's true that we never cited a figure. Having  signed an agreement with the United States to eliminate tactical  nuclear ammunition for rocket forces and for ground forces  artillery prior to the year 2000, we regularly hold joint  consultative meetings. But no figures are thrown around in these  meetings. We report that as of the given day 17 percent of  such-and-such forces and resources were eliminated. And that's  all. Although I can say--these data haven't been made public  anywhere yet--that of the total quantity of weapons withdrawn  from Ukraine, we have already eliminated 1,500 units, or over  half.    And if we consider the potential danger of proliferation of  nuclear weapons.... Back during the time of perestroyka--and as  we know, perestroyka meant instability--we gave some thought to  this problem, and we began withdrawing weapons from Warsaw Pact  states and from USSR republics. We began with the Baltic and  Transcaucasian countries, such that by the end of 1991 we still  had nuclear ammunition only in Ukraine, Belorussia and Russia.  After the four-way treaty on elimination was signed in December  1991, in which Kazakhstan participated in addition to the  republics named above, we began withdrawing weapons from the  territories of these states as well.    In this case complexities arose, and are arising now, only  in  regard to Ukraine. The Republic's Supreme Rada began doubting  that we were really destroying the withdrawn weapons, rather  than placing them into combat duty in Russia, and they stopped  releasing our trains across the border. But we were able to find  a solution. Beginning at approximately July 1992 we began  eliminating these weapons under the observation of Ukrainian  specialists. The agreement is still in force, and it also  foresees the presence of specialists from Belorussia and  Kazakhstan. But to be honest, this isn't cheap. Money has to be  paid for the presence of specialists in Russia, for housing and  the like, not counting health services. Apparently understanding  this, neither Belorussia nor Kazakhstan sent their own observers.    As for Russia itself, all we are doing as far as tactical  weapons are concerned is dismantling them. Our enterprises have  not produced a single device since the time the agreement was  signed with the republics.    [Belyaninov] How much time does it take to dismantle a  single  unit of ammunition?    [Yakovlev] Not much. The Americans, for example, have two  main device dismantling ""points."" The main one of these--Panteks  [transliteration]--eliminates around 2,000 a year. Our rate is  not any lower.    But as with any other country, we are dismantling more than  just tactical weapons. Our ammunition has a shelf life, and a  guarantee period. Upon expiration of this period it is not only  unsuitable but also unsafe to store it: The charge becomes more  sensitive to mechanical effects, and the radiation background  may rise. This is why strategic weapons are also sent to the  dismantling enterprises.    [Belyaninov] Last year was marked by an entire series of  conflicts between the Ukrainian and Russian defense ministries.  Part of the strategic nuclear forces were transferred to  Ukrainian jurisdiction, Russian specialists developing  ammunition were deprived of access to weapons, and it became  impossible to carry out routine repairs and maintenance. As a  result several accidents occurred at bases in Ukraine.    [Yakovlev] It may sound somewhat cynical, but two factors  saved the day: a visit to Kiev by the American President and  Ukraine's economic difficulties. The Americans raised the issue  of granting economic assistance to Ukraine that would be  directly dependent on the timetable for withdrawal of missiles,  while the crisis in atomic energy and the shortage of fuel for  nuclear power plants, which was being produced only in Russia,  compelled Ukraine to sign a trilateral treaty with fewer  stipulations than before. This made our situation much easier.  In accordance with the agreement Russia supplied fuel assemblies  for reactors to the Republic, while our department was given  permission to withdraw all remaining weapons and do all of the  needed work at the bases. Such that we can now take  responsibility for the safety of the weapons. But I'm not about  to make any long-range forecasts: The situation changes so  frequently that it is simply impossible to talk about any kind  of stability.    [Belyaninov] Vitaliy Nikolayevich, the opinions of experts  regarding American assistance differ. Some assert that we don't  need this assistance at all, that while the Americans talk about  hundreds of millions of dollars, they are barely appropriating  hundreds of thousands, and that ultimately this is assisting not  Russia but the American economy.    [Yakovlev] This is true to a certain extent. Little of the  $400 million appropriated by the U.S. Congress this year has in  fact been spent, but the American side shouldn't be the only one  that is blamed. After all, each item in the agreements must pass  through a very long and complex system of consideration and  approval both there--in Congress--and here--in the Duma.    On the other hand any assistance of this sort consists not  of  cash transfers in the millions to the Central Bank, but of  materials and equipment valued at this amount. The United States  does place orders with American companies. But agreements to  provide such assistance are in effect, and some of them have  already been realized. As an example we have received so-called  ""Kevlar linings"" to be used in transportation of the devices.  They are unique in their properties: They offer good protection  against environmental effects, and several layers of Kevlar can  easily stop a bullet from an automatic weapon. We did not have  such a material before.    We also received special equipment for emergency teams, and  an agreement to produce special railcars to transport nuclear  ammunition is being implemented. These cars are being developed  in the United States, and they offer several levels of  protection. The Americans supply parts for these cars, but they  will be assembled in Russia. There are several agreements  between the Ministry of Atomic Energy and the U.S. Department of  Energy regarding construction of a new storage facility for  plutonium extracted from warheads, regarding delivery of  supercontainers to transport highly radioactive materials, and  so on.    It is evident at least from this list that the total volume  of American assistance already exceeds tens of millions of  dollars.    [Belyaninov] Vitaliy Nikolayevich, many in the United States  associate the volume of assistance being granted with access of  American specialists to Russian technology for dismantling and  destroying weapons. And during one of the sessions of the U.S.  Congress Defense Subcommittee its chairman, John Murtha,  declared that unless all Russian enterprises of the nuclear  complex are opened to the Americans, including military ones,  there will be ""no money at all.""    [Yakovlev] An agreement to deliver processed uranium  extracted from warheads to the United States was signed by the  Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy and the U.S. Department of  Energy. And naturally the American side wants to make sure that  the materials we are transferring are in fact coming from  weapons. The actual issue is at what stage American specialists  could be allowed in. We insist on the beginning of the  processing cycle--that is, when the warhead has already been  dismantled and the material has been extracted and delivered to  the corresponding enterprise. In the meantime the Americans want  to supervise the process from the very beginning, from the  moment the warheads are dismantled. This is a more sensitive  topic, this means access to weapon design, and access to our  military secrets.    When it comes to my own point of view, the problem is easily  solved: Weapon-grade uranium differs dramatically in its  characteristics from that used in the fuel assemblies of nuclear  power plants and nuclear submarine reactors. They're simply  impossible to confuse: The characteristics of a material with  this degree of enrichment are known to any specialist both in  our country and in the USA.    [Belyaninov] There is one other problem that troubles many  today: What is happening with the Russian nuclear program? The  test ranges are closed, tests are not being conducted, and  scientists are living on starvation rations.    [Yakovlev] Testing is in fact a difficult issue. A tombstone  placed over the Semipalatinsk test range long ago, and it will  never again be used to test nuclear weapons. Nor is there any  sense in talking about Novaya Zemlya, as long as we aren't  conducting tests there, and are supporting a policy of their  prohibition. But when we--I'm referring to the military  department--discussed the need for tests, what we had in mind  primarily was not improving nuclear weapons but improving their  safety. Only by conducting experiments, by conducting tests, can  we be certain of the safety of a device that is in storage. But  it would be useless to argue this now. World public opinion is  so negatively oriented, and specialists of all countries  possessing nuclear weapons are experiencing such problems. This  is one of those issues that will not be resolved as long as no  country violates the moratorium and conducts tests first.    As for the nuclear program, it existed before, and it exists  today, although many scientific directions have either been  curtailed or significantly reduced. We have weapon systems, the  design systems have been developed, several systems of nuclear  devices exist, and they have been tested and proven to be  reliable. Such that we aren't under the threat of falling behind  in this area as yet.    There are of course difficulties with specialists. Some of  them will switch to jobs in the International Center for Science  and Technology currently being established in Moscow. It is  being built with American assistance. Testers from the  Semipalatinsk test range will most probably work in one of our  scientific institutes. And as for creating new forms and systems  of weapons, that's something not worth thinking about today,  it's too expensive a pleasure. Such that we are concerned more  today with problems of disarmament.     "

The Energy Agency is now  moving ahead with ""technical confirmation tests of equipment for  shutting down reactors,"" to expand the development of  dismantling technology, and ""surveys of reactor shutdown  technology,"" to investigate waste disposal measures and the  legal system. In the steps that will be taken next time, reactor  shutdown measures will be carried out in three steps.    The basic policy in shutting down nuclear power plant  facilities is to seal off the facilities for a fixed period of  time, then to dismantle and remove them. The concrete scheduling  of such steps will be after the year 2000 because nuclear power  plants are normally in use for 30 to 40 years.    From now on the important thing is to work toward harmony  with local societies based on a premise of guaranteed safety.  Then, while promoting further technological sophistication,  there must be systems of safety regulations and measures for the  disposal of the resulting waste, as well as studies from a  social perspective that take into consideration the local people.    The Energy Agency is now concerned about the Tokai nuclear  power plant (166,000 kW; in operation since 1966), which is  expected to be shut down in the near future. At the same time,  the agency is heading toward providing governmental guidance so  that the government and private sector will cooperate in studies  for the purpose of formulating concrete procedures for shutting  down reactors. While the agency will continue to implement  conventional confirmation tests and technical surveys on reactor  shutdown measures, it will also begin the development of  technology for recycling the waste resulting from dismantling a  reactor.

Ultramodern  production facilities for the chemical and other industries are  being built in Bitterfeld on the site formerly occupied by the  chemical combines.    Bitterfeld/Wolfen Well Surveyed    The Federal Government and the Land of Saxony-Anhalt spent  270 million German marks [DM] on the environmental reclamation  of the Bitterfeld/Wolfen area up to the end of 1992 alone.  ""This is now probably the best surveyed area in the whole of  Germany,"" says Volker Eisewicht of Bisantech Chemical  Engineering and Reclamation Bitterfeld GmbH, the Preussag AG and  Chemicals AG Bitterfeld-Wolfen joint venture that has been  engaged in consulting and engineering work on the site since  1991. Its work also includes the planning of the  Bitterfeld-Wolfen municipal sewage treatment plant, which is  being built on the edge of the industrial estate.    The firm, which was formed from Chemicals AG in 1991,  employs  a staff with first-hand knowledge of the chemical works and  their former output, an advantage that has paid dividends.    The sewage works will not treat only the effluent from the  future industrial estate but will receive input from the sewers  of the 26 municipalities making up the Lower Mulde and Wolfen  sewage treatment consortia. Four high-level bioreactors of  sealed tank design will purify the water, and their compactness  means that considerably less space will be taken up than is  usually the case. The new plant is designed in three stages,  including biological after purification and sludge draining. In  addition to a prepurification stage for effluent containing  dyes, the sewage works has a simultaneous activated carbon  adsorption system for substances that are not readily degradable  and a simultaneous phosphate elimination unit.    Reclaimed Areas for Redevelopment    Right next to the sewage treatment works, Bayer is building  a  total of five production facilities. Europe's largest  pharmaceuticals factory and one paint and one methylcellulose  factory are scheduled to go into production before the end of  the current year. However, the site had previously been cleaned  up at the state's expense. Bisantech played a major role in the  planning and supervision of this project as well.    The gigantic survey program carried out on the factory site  and in the surrounding area to locate the dumps immediately  after unification came in handy. As Eisewicht says, ""Sample  drillings and analyses were performed over the areas according  to a specific grid."" Old records were subsequently assessed in  the search for missed pockets or old dumps. The industrial  waste was then studied thoroughly, and aerial photographs were  evaluated as well.    Although only selected areas required reclamation on the  site  taken over by Bayer, redevelopment was no easy matter. ""The  mains that supply the whole complex with cooling and service  water from the Mulde water works ran straight across the  building site and had to be replaced with kilometers of pipes.  An old, open sewer also had to be cased,"" says Eisewicht.  Deposits of demonstrably nonhazardous waste were removed to a  regulation dump. The perimeter area bordering on the former dye  works also presented problems, as no detailed information about  it was available.    Interim Soil Storage    Analyses performed as the building work progressed ensured  that the work proceeded smoothly. ""Contaminated soil was  removed and is being stored pending completion of the planned  disposal and reprocessing center,"" says Eisewicht of the interim  solution. Leveling the site's irregular terrain and, above all,  the immense pressure of time, added to the problems.    Whereas the sewage works and the new Bayer buildings are not  being erected on areas on which production facilities once  stood, as many of the other incoming industrial companies as  possible are scheduled to occupy dismantled sites. The  buildings were tested both inside and out, and the surrounding  areas surveyed prior to demolition, after which Bisantech, in  conjunction with the Environment Office and Chemicals AG, drew  up a disposal and reprocessing strategy for the complex, laying  particular stress on the reprocessing of the demolition rubble.    Dismantling by Stages Possible    The chemical plants are currently being dismantled by  stages.  Eisewicht takes the lime-ammonium nitrate plant as an example to  describe the process: The production plant was first dismantled  up to the upper perimeter of the site, followed by the other  facilities, such as the warehouse, rail tracks, and roads. This  in turn is being followed by the complete dismantling of the  underground systems to a depth of 2.5 meters.    As much as possible of the hazardous waste that accumulates  during the reclamation work will be reconditioned or disposed of  on site, so it is planned to set up a modern disposal and  reconditioning center with physicochemical treatment and  hazardous waste incineration facilities on the reclaimed land  occupied by Chemicals AG. For the time being, an immobilization  process is being used to render heavily polluted soil reusable.    All this preliminary work on the site of the future  industrial estate is creating incentives for potential  investors. As a location, Bitterfeld-Wolfen is now offering  more and more facilities that will encourage further companies  to move in. In addition to Bayer, other famous names have  already taken up residence, including Heraeus Quartz Glass, a  company that produces optical fibers for telecommunication  cables. Ultraclean production conditions are absolutely  essential for the manufacture of optical fiber cables, so this  is yet another sign of the enormous improvement in Bitterfeld's  image.    Volker Eisewicht reckons that the bulk of the work on the  whole site will be completed in five years at the most, by which  time a gigantic mechanism combining dismantling and reclamation  will have completely changed the face and the character of the  area. It will be exciting to see if the costly efforts on the  part of the Federal Government, the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, and  the firms involved will not only benefit Bitterfeld itself as a  location but will serve as a model for other areas.

Speaking at the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow on Friday, he  said the new agreement would be make it possible to send the  Start-I treaty for parliamentary ratification because the  conditions set in a resolution by the Supreme Soviet have now  been removed.    Kravchuk says his country is given assurances of security  guarantees, territorial integrity, financial incentives for the  weapons and help in dismantling them, and no threat of economic  pressure.    For its part, Moscow is committed to supply fuel grade  uranium to Ukraine, minus the cost of dismantling the weapons  and reprocessing the nuclear warheads, Kravchuk told Interfax.    He said that experts on all sides are yet to estimate the  amount and form of compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons  to be withdrawn from Ukraine. One option is to write off the  Ukrainian debt for fuel imports from Russia, Kravchuk said.    IF [INTERFAX] Note: Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  told Interfax Friday that as a result of the dismantling of  Ukrainian missiles Kiev would receive nuclear fuel in the form  of rods for uranium reactors, but ""there is no question about  writing off the Ukrainian debt to Russia.""    In response to Kozyrev's statement his Ukrainian counterpart  Anatoliy Zlenko underlined in his conversation with Interfax  that this form of compensation is foreseen in the tripartite  Russian- American-Ukrainian agreement on the withdrawal of  nuclear missiles from the Ukraine's territory signed in Moscow.    The Ukrainian leader denied allegations that his country was  offered $1 billion as compensation for the withdrawal of its  nuclear weapons. He said the question was not on the agenda.    As a next step, said Kravchuk, Moscow and Kiev could try to  resolve the dispute over the Black Sea Fleet this year,  proceeding from the interests of Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea.  If the two problems are removed, he said, this will help to put  bilateral relations on a friendlier footing as befits partners  and good neighbors.     "

This is  apparent from the information made available to RUDE PRAVO by Z.  Borkovec, press spokesman for the Defense Ministry. He refused  to reply to questions on how many missiles there are on our  territory and where they will be dismantled. We found out from  other sources that the Research and Testing Institute in  Slavicin has looked into dismantling the missiles, and their  actual dismantling should be carried out by the military unit in  Bohuslavice nad Vlari near Zlin. According to Borkovec, the  metal parts of the missiles will be scrapped following their  removal, and the Army will offer the chemical compounds to  select organizations for further evaluation or ecological  elimination.

Today, a large measure of the initial enthusiasm remains      By EMMA TUCKER      BRUSSELS   HARMONISATION: Exporters welcome the more liberal trading environment, but slow progress is being made on harmonising key commercial areas Businesses in all 12 of the European Union's member-states are enthusiastic about the benefits that have stemmed from the dismantling of internal frontiers and the abandonment of customs controls. They report that delivery times have been cut sharply with delays at customs posts no longer part of a lorry driver's daily existence. Across the Union, exporters are taking advantage of the more liberal trading environment brought on by the 1992 initiative to ease trade moves into neighbouring markets. Nevertheless, much remains to be done. Recently, in a bid to speed up the single market's completion, the European Commission took a close look at those member-states that had been slow to adopt all the harmonisation legislation crucial for the free flow of goods, services and capital within the market's frontiers. Tables produced by the commission showed which member-states were helping to hinder progress. Germany, France and Holland, for example, had a poor record on adopting legislation on the harmonisation of pharmaceutical products from other member states: Greece, Spain and Germany were dragging their feet on insurance. There has also been little progress with plans to create a single market in intellectual property. In this area, half the member-states have delayed adoption of the relevant directives. In company law, Germany, France Greece and Spain still have a long way to go before they have put all the relevant legislation on national statute books. Secondly, the commission also decided to look at those areas where no harmonisation legislation applies but where the principal of 'mutual recognition' of technical standards is supposed to ensure that pressure cookers made in Italy, for example, can be sold without obstacle anywhere else in the Union. Their decision to do so went to the heart of a dilemma facing Europe's policy makers. In spite of the progress that has been made, countries are still blocking goods from other member states on the often spurious grounds that safety or technical standards do not match. When the single market was first dreamt up, it was deemed unnecessary to harmonise standards in all commercial sectors. Standards in sensitive areas such as medicine, chemicals, cars and toys would be harmonised under legislation agreed by all 12 member-states. But for the bulk of goods and services mutual recognition was supposed to ensure that prams, lollipops, and electric light bulbs, for example, would circulate freely. In practice, there have been endless hitches. A commission inventory of barriers to trade based on complaints from manufacturers shows that peas from Belgium, for example, came up against barriers in Denmark because of 'classification problems and quality standards.' The UK objected to radishes from Holland because of worries about a certain fly. Ceramic tiles from Greece have been barred from the French market because of 'difficulties in obtaining type approval.' Generally, the complaints tend to come from manufacturers in the EU's smaller member states who cannot get their goods circulated in the larger countries. A survey by the Danish ministry of finance produced a shockingly high number of complaints about remaining technical barriers to trade. As a result, the commission is coming under pressure to produce more harmonisation legislation, particularly from the less powerful EU members such as Denmark and Spain to deal with those areas where mutual recognition is failing. 'There have been a lot of concerns from caravan makers,' says a commission official from DG15, the directorate responsible for the internal market. 'We have had pressure to produce a directive over things like dimensions and the materials with which the caravans are made.' As a first step, a new commission proposal recommends a change to the way in which complaints are recorded. At present, the commission relies on manufacturers to keep it informed of what is happening at a grassroots level. Now it wants to switch the onus to the authorities who are doing the refusing. In other words, any national authority that refuses a product from one country will have to notify the commission thereby providing Brussels with a more complete record of where problems are arising and where more harmonisation legislation might eventually be required. But as one commission official explains: 'This rather simple proposal is running into all sorts of difficulties.' Some member-states - notably the UK - are very keen on the proposal. 'It is something that we think is very important,' says an official from the UK representation in Brussels. The French and Germans, however, have argued that there are so many examples of where one country is blocking another's goods that the proposal will spawn unnecessary bureaucracy. Whether or not the member-states can reach a consensus on the proposal will only be known in October when relevant ministers meet again to discuss the single market. Until then, and until the information has been gathered, the commission will continue to favour mutual recognition as a better, less cumbersome, route than legislation, partly because legislation is so costly, but also conscious of the fact that a directive on caravans, or peas would do nothing for the image of the meddling Brussels bureaucrat. But if mutual recognition continues to be flouted by the Union's biggest and most powerful states, some countries, and many manufacturers, will step up pressure for more harmonisation. At that point, Brussels will have to decide how best to tackle the grievances of traders and decide whether or not more legislation is required to maintain momentum behind the single market.

Poltov]    [Text] Vladivostok, 17 Apr -- While attention is being  focused on the Russian Pacific Fleet in connection with the  dumping of radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan, at least  four of its decommissioned nuclear submarines are tied to their  moorings while being in quite a dangerous condition, because it  is difficult to extract their nuclear fuel due to explosions or  problems they suffered while they were in service. This was  learned by a TOKYO SHIMBUN investigation on 17 April. In giving  warning, a high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer stated, ""The  failure to deal with nuclear submarines that have previously  suffered accidents is a more serious problem to safety in the  Sea of Japan than is the dumping of radioactive waste into the  sea.""    These nuclear submarines that have suffered accidents or  difficulties are three E-II class cruise missile submarines  which have been moored at the Pabrovsk [name as published] base  near Vladivostok, and one V-I class attack submarine which has  been moored at the Kamchatskaya base. Between 1979 and 1985,  all of them suffered difficulties with or explosions of their  nuclear reactors due to malfunctions of their cooling systems.  In August 1985, one of them suffered an explosion in its  nuclear reactor, which killed 10 of its crew, due to a sudden  rise in the temperature of its cooling water.    Decommissioned nuclear submarines usually are scrapped after  they have been dismantled. However, these four submarines have  been moored at their bases because it is difficult to remove  their nuclear fuel because of the fear of large-scale  radioactive leaks from their nuclear reactors. Although an  institute of the Russian Defense Ministry is currently studying  technology for the safe dismantling of nuclear submarines that  have suffered accidents, the development of this technology has  been greatly delayed due to the recent financial difficulties.  Therefore, the outlook for dismantling these nuclear submarines  is uncertain.    The high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer stressed: ""Because  the radioactive waste that is the focal point in the dumping  issue is very low-level radiation, it causes no actual problems  to human beings. However, troubles with nuclear submarines that  have suffered accidents may cause serious problems affecting  humans."" Also, he added, ""If we cannot speed up the development  of new technology for dismantling them through assistance from  Japan and other nations, this will have serious consequences.""     "

Arms trafficking was a booming business in Algeria in the  late 1980's. But it has increased to a dangerous extent in the  last two years, with proliferation of terrorist groups that are  the principal beneficiaries.    Transported to Algeria in a number of different ways, these  weapons, often in large quantities, have ended up at the same  drop points in almost every instance: Setif, Khenchela, M'Sila,  Medea, or (less frequently) Chlef and Batna. Witness the  numerous hauls made by the security services in the last two  years.    Undoubtedly most spectacular was the raid at Setif that led  to the dismantling, almost exactly a year ago, of the largest  clandestine network to appear since independence. No less than  100 individuals, including traffickers, ""fences,"" artisanal  weapons (fabricators) were arrested and 842 weapons captured.  And this was but the tip of the iceberg, since security services  went on several days later to make other arrests, as the  trafficking ring had branches in many other wilayas.    Altogether more than 500 traffickers were apprehended.  Investigation disclosed that the majority were black-market  operators.    A second large arms trafficking network was dismantled in  Setif. Beretta and Perfecta automatic pistols were among the  weapons seized.    Earlier on, the National Gendarmerie had neutralized 32  persons involved in a network formed in the Khenchela and Batna  regions.    In Central province, more specifically in Medea, the  National  Gendarmerie made another spectacular haul, not only dismantling  the network and seizing the weapons but also discovering and  destroying a laboratory for gun modification and artisanal bomb  fabrication. This dismantling of an international networking for  trafficking in weapons of war was a triumph for security forces,  but one that also vividly illustrated the current of arms  trafficking. The main leaders of this ring, 10 in number, were  arrested and imprisoned.    A number of other networks were also dismantled during this  two-year period, including those at Mila and M'Sila. But that  certainly does not mean all the networks in Algeria have been  shut down. There are still many others to continue provisioning  the terrorist groups--with the complicity, naturally, of certain  foreign countries that are always ready to provide traffickers  with facilities and support in this domain.

By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      MAMAIA, Romania      The drive from Bucharest to the Black Sea coast is a three-hour ordeal of  bumping over rutted roads choked with smoke-spewing trucks, horse-drawn carts  and wayward livestock.    Once there, Western sun seekers are treated to a low-cost vacation in hotels  where the coffee machines are idle for want of filters, the bathroom tiles are  crooked and crumbling, and bands of beggars and money-changers accost visitors  at every corner.    Tourism is one of two cornerstones the new government expects to prop up  Romania's sagging economy. The other, agriculture, is an equally dubious source  of rescue in view of Europe's already flooded food markets.    Romania has virtually no foreign debt, a wealth of natural resources and a  plentiful and ready work force that Western investors could employ at a bargain  rate. Nonetheless, despite what appear to be major advantages over other  westward-looking nations of Eastern Europe, Romania has the toughest road to  travel to pull itself back from the edge of economic ruin.    Leaders of the governing National Salvation Front have declared their intention  to steer the nation toward a free-market system. But they have made clear their  preference for a slow dismantling of the socialist system in hopes of softening  transitional blows for a population bruised by half a century of tyranny.    The late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's Draconian practice of exporting food to  pay off foreign loans drove the nation to the brink of starvation. His  bulldozing of villages to build agro-industrial collectives destroyed the most  productive farm sector -- the private plots tended by rural peasants.    Romania suffers the worst case of industrial gigantism in a region renowned for  prestige projects that wasted resources and polluted the environment. The  44-mile Danube-Black Sea Canal, vacant of ship traffic, and the nearly complete  House of the Republic, a Pentagon-sized palace that Ceausescu intended as his  government headquarters, stand out among the projects that robbed Romanians of  a bearable living standard.    Even by Eastern Europe's low standards, Romanians are poor. Only 1% of the  population owns a car. The nation's 23 million citizens use a quarter of the  electricity consumed per capita in Czechoslovakia. Overall per-capita  consumption is the equivalent of $67 per month at the inflated official  exchange rate, less than one-tenth the U.S. average.    Conditions were worsening even before last December's anti-Communist revolt  deposed Ceausescu and threw the nation into political chaos. Industrial  production fell more than 2% in 1989, farm output dropped 4.3%, and national  income plummeted by nearly 10%.    Even sharper declines have been reported this year because of the distraction  of the revolution and the volatile election campaign that culminated in an  overwhelming Salvation Front victory. Last week's rioting, in which six people  were killed and more than 500 injured, seems certain to have a negative effect  on the economy.    Perhaps the hardest-hit sector is the tourism industry, which officials in this  coastal resort claimed provided 75% of the nation's hard-currency earnings in  recent years.    ""Foreign bookings this summer are down 80% from last year,"" lamented Pompiliu  Dimancea, general manager of the state-run Litoral travel network that owns  Black Sea resorts like Mamaia, just north of the port of Constanta.    Another Litoral executive, Ion Nichita, says the cash crop of coastal visitors  has failed this year because of the revolution.    ""Romania has the same image as Beirut. People think there is gunfire in the  streets. It's only natural that they don't want to come here on vacation,""  Nichita said.    Officials are using the lull in Western traffic to reorganize in hopes of  catching the wave of Western visitors to the East next season. Most of the  hotels along the white-sand strip south of the Danube Delta need  air-conditioning, more modern plumbing and dependable food-service equipment.    Ice-cream makers, coffee machines, juice squeezers and other appliances  purchased during the 1970s buildup had to be sidelined for lack of spare parts  or regular supplies, Nichita said.    That situation could change, however, if the new government continues its  policy of selective application of resources.    As the interim governing force before the May 20 election, the Salvation Front  controlled all funds. It bought food and energy on credit to show immediate  improvement in the sorry lot of the Romanian consumer.    Interim Prime Minister Petre Roman contended in a recent interview that his  nation is well-positioned for recovery.    He said the front made no promises of a ""bright future"" but that Romania's rich  agricultural heritage and tourist attractions would be relied on to lead the  rescue.    Farm output suffered under Ceausescu's rule, but Romania was known as Europe's  granary before World War II. The soil was so rich in some regions that the  Nazis shipped it back to Germany by the trainload.    The rolling farmland north of the capital and the wheat fields that stretch  along the coastal plain are dotted with peasants from daybreak to dusk, a sign  that new incentives for increased output may be working.    Romanians can sell their privately raised produce at market prices, and the  government has made vast stretches of land available to those who want to plant  it. But the effect of that diversion of labor from the state collective farms  will not be known until fall.    Western diplomats based in Bucharest noted that the new government is under  pressure to show steady improvement in living standards and that a bad harvest  could spell political disaster.    Reflecting the ambiguity that afflicts the new government, Ioan Popescu, an  agronomist in Constanta, said farmers will be allowed to sell their produce at  market prices but that food costs will not rise for the consumer and subsidies  will be phased out.    Specific steps for economic recovery were never outlined during the election  campaign, as the candidates concentrated on ideological warfare. The result has  been a confusing array of declared intentions without credible statistics or  arguments to back them.    Front politicians have called for putting 30% of Romanian business in private  hands by the end of this year -- a feat their own economists scoff at as  unlikely even in five years.    A top official in the Agriculture Ministry, Victor Surdu, boasted that Romania  could produce enough food to feed 70 million people. But no one has undertaken  a close look at the hard-currency market for farm products, which the European  Community is struggling to keep afloat in an ocean of output.    Romania has enacted one of the more liberal foreign investment laws, ostensibly  allowing up to 100% foreign ownership while encouraging joint ventures over  outright sales. Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Draganescu has said Romania hopes  to retain at least a 25% share of most projects involving foreign investment.    Some prominent West German firms, such as Siemens electronics and the  Daimler-Benz automotive works, are negotiating major deals with Romania,  Salvation Front officials claimed. But completed contracts have been few  despite a fourfold increase in Western business visits this spring.    A British businessman in Bucharest to scout opportunities in agriculture said  the biggest argument against investment is the threat of further political  instability.    ""Who knows if there will be another revolution like the one in December?"" he  said. ""No one wants to put his money down in such circumstances.""    Officials also have predicted that as many as 50,000 privately run firms could  be in operation by year's end -- an equally questionable projection in view of  Romanians' dearth of cash to start their own businesses.    ""No one in the country has made enough money -- at least legally -- to buy into  the state tourist industry,"" observed Maria-Venera Coitu, a travel bureau  manager in Constanta. ""For now it will remain a state monopoly.""

Officials are using the lull in Western traffic to reorganize in hopes of  catching the wave of Western visitors to the East next season. Most of the  hotels along the white-sand strip south of the Danube Delta need  air-conditioning, more modern plumbing and dependable food-service equipment.    Ice-cream makers, coffee machines, juice squeezers and other appliances  purchased during the 1970s buildup had to be sidelined for lack of spare parts  or regular supplies, Nichita said.    That situation could change, however, if the new government continues its  policy of selective application of resources.    As the interim governing force before the May 20 election, the Salvation Front  controlled all funds. It bought food and energy on credit to show immediate  improvement in the sorry lot of the Romanian consumer.    Interim Prime Minister Petre Roman contended in a recent interview that his  nation is well-positioned for recovery.    He said the front made no promises of a ""bright future"" but that Romania's rich  agricultural heritage and tourist attractions would be relied on to lead the  rescue.    Farm output suffered under Ceausescu's rule, but Romania was known as Europe's  granary before World War II. The soil was so rich in some regions that the  Nazis shipped it back to Germany by the trainload.    The rolling farmland north of the capital and the wheat fields that stretch  along the coastal plain are dotted with peasants from daybreak to dusk, a sign  that new incentives for increased output may be working.    Romanians can sell their privately raised produce at market prices, and the  government has made vast stretches of land available to those who want to plant  it. But the effect of that diversion of labor from the state collective farms  will not be known until fall.    Western diplomats based in Bucharest noted that the new government is under  pressure to show steady improvement in living standards and that a bad harvest  could spell political disaster.    Reflecting the ambiguity that afflicts the new government, Ioan Popescu, an  agronomist in Constanta, said farmers will be allowed to sell their produce at  market prices but that food costs will not rise for the consumer and subsidies  will be phased out.    Specific steps for economic recovery were never outlined during the election  campaign, as the candidates concentrated on ideological warfare. The result has  been a confusing array of declared intentions without credible statistics or  arguments to back them.    Front politicians have called for putting 30% of Romanian business in private  hands by the end of this year -- a feat their own economists scoff at as  unlikely even in five years.    A top official in the Agriculture Ministry, Victor Surdu, boasted that Romania  could produce enough food to feed 70 million people. But no one has undertaken  a close look at the hard-currency market for farm products, which the European  Community is struggling to keep afloat in an ocean of output.    Romania has enacted one of the more liberal foreign investment laws, ostensibly  allowing up to 100% foreign ownership while encouraging joint ventures over  outright sales. Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Draganescu has said Romania hopes  to retain at least a 25% share of most projects involving foreign investment.    Some prominent West German firms, such as Siemens electronics and the  Daimler-Benz automotive works, are negotiating major deals with Romania,  Salvation Front officials claimed. But completed contracts have been few  despite a fourfold increase in Western business visits this spring.    A British businessman in Bucharest to scout opportunities in agriculture said  the biggest argument against investment is the threat of further political  instability.    ""Who knows if there will be another revolution like the one in December?"" he  said. ""No one wants to put his money down in such circumstances.""    Officials also have predicted that as many as 50,000 privately run firms could  be in operation by year's end -- an equally questionable projection in view of  Romanians' dearth of cash to start their own businesses.    ""No one in the country has made enough money -- at least legally -- to buy into  the state tourist industry,"" observed Maria-Venera Coitu, a travel bureau  manager in Constanta. ""For now it will remain a state monopoly.""      Map, Romania, Los Angeles Times      EASTERN EUROPE -- ECONOMY; ROMANIA -- ECONOMY; TOURISM -- ROMANIA; ROMANIA --  AGRICULTURE    "

Under the Russian-Latvian agreement signed in Moscow on  Saturday within the framework of a package of agreements on the  withdrawal of troops from Latvia, the Skrunda station will  function for the next four years. Then it is to be fully  dismantled within 1.5 years. The Latvian government received  guarantees that the U.S. government would grant $2 million and  the Swedish government - another $1 million to finance the  dismantling.    The radar station was built in 1967 for missile attack early  warning. The construction of the new facility of the station  started at the end of 1980s.     "

These 'very capable' nuclear scientists 'ought to be a valuable economic asset for commercial industry in western Europe or the US,' said the official, who was in Brussels to brief Nato allies after 10 days of US-Russian talks on dismantling nuclear weapons. 'It should not necessarily be the job of (western) governments to subsidise the use of these scientists' talents, though it might come to that,' he said. However, he dismissed stories that there was already a nuclear brain, or bomb, drain from the former Soviet Union. 'I know of no cases of weapons-grade material leaving the former Soviet Union,' he said. Any exports appeared to be of either depleted uranium, which is used in conventional warheads, or minute quantities of plutonium, used to detect alpha-radiation. 'Nor do I know of any (scientist) being approached to work elsewhere or leaving.' After the 24 talks in Moscow with the Russian general staff and the Atomic Power Ministry the US official praised their sense of reponsibility in proceeding with the dismantling of tactical nuclear weapons, promised by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev last October and re-confirmed since by Russia's President Boris Yeltsin. Fears that Soviet nuclear weapons could fall into the wrong hands centre as much, or more, on the 15,000-16,000 nuclear artillery shells, mines and short-range missiles spread around the former Soviet Union, as on the more tightly-held 11,000 strategic missiles. The US official said all of Russia's fellow republics appeared to be 'responsible and supportive' in returning the tactical weapons for storage and eventual dismantling. The US has offered to help Moscow with a range of tasks, the official said. These include help in 'providing secure transport of weapons from bases to central storage inside Russia, disabling weapons before transport, providing intermediate storage for weapons awaiting destruction, dismantling of weapons, transport of disassembled components and long-term storage of fissile plutonium and uranium.'

The report is to be compiled on 27 May by a working  panel on atomic energy under the Advisory Committee for Energy  [ACE], an advisory body to the Agency of Natural Resources and  Energy under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.  In the report, the panel recommends that a study be made on  developing a next- generation light water reactor which is safer  than existing models and requires fewer operators and workers;  the report suggests such a reactor would need to be ready for  use by the year 2010.    As some nuclear reactors are expected to have reached the  end  of their useful life by the beginning of the 21st century, the  panel also urges a prompt start to studies on developing  technology to handle the disposal of nuclear waste that arises  with the dismantling of reactors and on drawing up adequate  safety standards.    On the issue of plutonium use, the panel's report is in line  with the Long-Range Plan on the Development and Use of Atomic  Energy, the outline of which was announced earlier by the Atomic  Energy Commission.    Light water reactors account for about 90 percent of the  world's nuclear reactors used for generating electricity.  However, a great deal of trouble is involved in their  maintenance and repair.    The Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, manufacturers of  nuclear reactors, and power companies plan to jointly compile a  report on the results of their research over the next three  years on next generation nuclear reactors. Such reactors, it is  felt, must have ""a high degree of safety, dependability, low  impact on the environment, and low personnel costs."" On the  basis of such efforts, work will begin on making next generation  nuclear reactor technology practical.    Japan is to start work on finalizing specific safety  measures  for its next generation nuclear reactor. However, the United  States, which has already developed its next generation nuclear  reactor, plans to reduce its scale and simplify it by making  further improvements to a safety device that cools the reactor  core in case of emergencies.    Meanwhile, nuclear reactors which began operating in the  1970's will be getting too old by the 21st century. The ACE  working panel, in its report, stresses that in dismantling old  reactors ""it will be necessary to gain the understanding of  local residents for dismantling procedures, the disposal of  waste materials, and land use after dismantling.""    The panel, therefore, urges that detailed procedures and  standards first be drawn up.     "

The memorable Vladivostok explosion of two  years ago now looks like child's play -- on Saturday 14 May the  major arsenal of the fleet's air force thundered forth in  Maritime Kray. This was the equivalent of the blast from a  five-kilotonne atom bomb.    The mushroom that grew near the village of Novonezhino was  very similar to the familiar silhouette in textbooks on nuclear  security -- the height of a substantial hill, black and crimson,  it terrified the local inhabitants. It was a sunny day, and  people were digging in truck gardens. The shock wave bowled  them all over. They got up and ran to the houses. A second,  mightier blast caught them 40 seconds later. After the third  one they could enter the houses from any side: They had neither  windows nor doors, indeed some people had no walls left either.    Panic set in. For some reason mothers began pushing their  children under the beds. Grandmothers shouted ""It's war!"" and  started praying. Cats went crazy, dogs howled. A sickening,  acrid smell of burning hung in the air....    There were not, however, any nuclear or chemical charges in  this arsenal. Aerial bombs, missiles, and shells, brought here  from the Baltic region, were exploding. The dumps were very  well guarded, and the military took pride in them. The arsenal  was also located well from the safety viewpoint: The villages  were quite a long way off and were protected by hills. This  saved the inhabitants. So far there has not been a single  casualty. The fire was extinguished by the next morning.  Sappers, militia, and counterintelligence officers are working  there now.    From KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's File    Free-flight rocket -- based on tanks, aircraft, and ships.  Range -- 10-15 km. Explodes on impact by self-detonation.    Antitank guided missile -- based on aircraft, ships, and  infantry fighting vehicles. Equipped with self-destruct device.  Self-detonated, could hit chance target, i.e. function in line  with combat launch. Range -- 20-25 km.    The evacuation of people was organized professionally. The  military, the authorities, and the militia secured a lot of  buses amazingly promptly and evacuated five villages:  Smolyaninovo, Romanovka, Novonezhino, and two small  farmstead-railroad halts. All the locals had long known from the  military that if THAT blew up, everything would be destroyed for  30 km around. So they evacuated people beyond the 30km zone --  to Shkotovo and Bolshoy Kamen.    Fortunately it was not the entire arsenal that blew up. But  even what did was enough to cause a minor earthquake. Windows  were broken even in buildings in Vladivostok and in blocks at  the ""Okean"" children's camp, which are a good 50 km away as the  crow flies. There is scarcely a single building in the villages  that did not suffer.    A Vladivostok-Partizansk electric train was approaching the  ""Kilometer 53"" halt at the moment of the first explosion. When  the engineer caught sight of the mushroom from the explosion, he  stopped braking and took the train through the falling debris to  the next station. A couple of minutes later the railroad was at  a standstill -- the contact wires had been broken, and debris  and blocks were falling right onto the permanent way.    ""Not many people in the village were injured,"" Divisional  Militia Captain Viktor Bityuk said. ""Some were hit by bricks  from a falling chimney, some were cut by broken glass, and some  did not open their mouths or put their hands over their ears in  time and now cannot hear.""    On that day Viktor himself had only just finished his shift  and was getting ready for bed. Now it is 48 hours since he  slept. He was leading people out of their yards, and they were  stopping vehicles on the road until the buses arrived....    ""Imagine, there was not a single instance of a private  driver's refusing to take people in his vehicle further away  from the blast,"" he said in surprise. ""On the contrary, there  were volunteers who offered their help and first-aid kits. They  released the sailors locked up in the garrison guardhouse and  made them help me. I set them to guarding stores and the  savings bank. Believe me, there was not a single robbery!""    Just one case of looting has been recorded so far. Fish  protection inspector Vladimir Snurnik was leading people from a  danger zone by the river while his own village of Romanovka was  being evacuated. He found himself nearby and called at his  home. Everything there had been turned upside down, and the safe  had been opened. They had evidently been looking for his  pistol, which he had with him at the time.    Weapons, incidentally, have always drawn thieves and bandits  of various kinds to the arsenal. The small arms of all the  nearby military units were kept there. Last year a major  robbery occurred, for which a unit commander and six of his  accomplices were arrested. The investigation also links the  present disaster to the problem of weapons thefts.    Almost everyone is certain that this was no chance ignition.  There are eyewitnesses who say that the first fire broke out  right in the middle of one of the dumps. Rockets at once flew  in various directions and started a fire right around the  perimeter of the huge arsenal.    Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander in chief of  the Navy, who has arrived in Maritime Kray with a group of  experts, is still very cautious in his assessments of the cause  of what happened. He has said just one thing unequivocally:  The destruction is colossal, such as I have never seen before  in my life.    ...A friend and I were once collecting ferns in these  places.  There were so many of them on the slopes of the hills that we  could pick them without straightening up. These hills that are  turning green are now strewn equally thickly with unexploded  shells and debris. I walked with Anatoliy Panteleyevich  Shevchenko, head of Smolyaninovo Administration, through the  streets of the deserted settlement. There was still  intermittent rumbling, and he showed me which hill had taken the  most terrible blow and which one had saved 100-year-old  Romanovka, which has lived through two wars and now, so it turns  out, also a third one.    ""Where can I find that much window glass now?"" the head  grieved, looking at the gaping windows.    Yes, we will all need a lot more window glass. This Pacific  Fleet arsenal is not the last one....     "

Chinese businesses seem to understand the details of the  multi-billion-yuan trade better than most others.    After investing nearly 240 million yuan ($27.5 million),  China leads the world in the business of dismantling ships,  controlling half the market. Nevertheless, its industry sees  plenty of room for growth.    In fact, the China National Ship-Breaking Corp is joining  hands with other Chinese firms to build the country's largest  ship-breaking centre, in Zhoushan in Zhejiang Province.    Also signing an agreement last month to become partners in  the new China Jingtong Ship-Breaking and Washing Co Ltd are  Zhoushan Ship-Building Industrial Corp and Zhejiang  Ship-Breaking Corp.    First-stage construction will enable the complex to  dismantle  old ships for scrap metal and valuable machinery, especially  communications and navigation equipment. Work is expected to be  completed in a year and a half.    After that, China Jingtong will be capable of taking apart  retired ships with more than 2 million dead-weight tons combined  each year. It will also be equipped to clear greasy dirt from  ships' cargo holds and recycle more than 500,000 tons of oily  water annually.    Government officials say the centrally controlled Zhoushan  centre will dominate the domestic ship-breaking industry, which  now comprises more than 200 enterprises.    Since the early 1980s, China has bought more than 10 million  dead-weight tons of old ships from abroad for dismantling and  salvaging.    Chinese salvagers believe foreign ship owners will continue  to sell old vessels for scrap because keeping them operable is  expensive, especially during a recession like the one currently  gripping the shipping business.    Analysts say ship breaking is closely linked to the fortunes  of the world's shipping industry: Sluggish shipping means  hectic business for salvagers.    The central government is enthusiastic about boosting the  industry, official sources said. This way, they say, the  country gets scrap steel rather than having to rely on imports,  and foreign-exchange costs are cut by as much as a third.    But, they added, Chinese workers are not trained well enough  in the business of dismantling ships. Experts estimate that if  a ship of 10,000 dead-weight tons is taken apart scientifically,  an additional 600 tons of metal can be salvaged and 30 days'  work saved.    Shipping companies and factories that build and repair ships  should educate workers so that machinery and equipment that is  still usable is not wasted. These machines and equipment should  be examined by experts and assigned quality certificates so they  can be sold off.     "

The seizures were made possible by searches  conducted as part of an investigation into the theft of a number  of passports in the premises of the General Regulation and  Administration Directorate (DIRAG) at the High Commission of the  Republic in New Caledonia.    In a communique, the state prosecutor said that the  operation  stemmed from the arrest, in France, of ""two Caledonians in  possession of securities stolen in Noumea as well as forged  identity papers."" Investigations revealed ""the existence of two  caches supposedly containing merchandise of shady origin.  Investigators discovered the booty of several burglaries  committed in the territory.""    Most administrative documents stolen from the DIRAG, as well  as about 10 handguns, 50 rifles, and various explosive  substances, have been recovered during a flagrante delicto  procedure. Three people are being held for questioning and  investigations are in progress in order to ascertain the exact  origin of the seized items as well as the identity and motives  of the persons behind all this.    According to various sources and witness accounts from  residents of the area (the Ducos industrial area and Ouemo  residential community) -- including a video filmed unknown to  the investigators and broadcast by television station RFO --  there were also heavy weapons, two-way radios, and ammunition  among the weapons seized. Parts of the arsenal reportedly came  from the United States and were paid for through the sale of  passports which were part of the ""administrative documents taken  in DIRAG's premises"" (2,000 passports had been stolen there).  Worth pointing out however is the fact that the number of  handguns and rifles indicated in the state prosecutor's  communique match the number of arms stolen on 2 December 1986 in  a local department store.    The exact circumstances of the arrest of the ""two  Caledonians"" have not been divulged. Sources close to the  investigators say the two men were arrested in Metz on their way  back from Luxembourg, where they had attempted to negotiate a  400,000-French-franc treasury bill.    The bill came from a burglary committed in New Caledonia.  One of the two men quickly made a confession and, probably to  imbue his activities with a political dimension, reportedly  confessed having been party to bombings in Noumea and told  investigators about the two caches of weapons and war equipment.

BONN      It is time for Americans to get to know Karl Otto Poehl, president of West  Germany's Central Bank. As Bonn and Berlin rush to reunify, Poehl will oversee  his country's economic and monetary union. When a reunified and economically  dominant Germany emerges, Poehl will seal his place as the Continent's top  central banker.    Poehl is no mere foreign technician operating 8,000 miles away and providing  statistical fodder for economic pundits. He's an economic force to be reckoned  with, someone whose clout rivals that wielded by Japan, Inc.'s managers. Poehl  is added proof that the international economy is no longer an annex of the  United States, but one operating outside the control of any single country.  America must adapt or suffer the consequences.    Central bankers are a mysterious lot -- high priests of capitalism whose  magical mutterings only the initiated can divine. In world central banking, the  cardinal gets to be Pope-like -- not all powerful, but a global figure.  National monetary politics are intertwined; what happens to interest rates in  West Germany and Japan affects what happens to them in the United States, and  vice versa.    For most of the '80s, Paul A. Volcker was the dominant force in central  banking. When he stepped down as Federal Reserve chairman in July, 1987, his  successor, Alan Greenspan, took the throne, recognized by his peers, and with  the approval of the world's investors.    Now, however, Greenspan's influence shrinks, while Poehl's grows. As a result,  the president of West Germany's central bank is the Pope-apparent.    Working out of an office on the outskirts of Frankfurt, Poehl was appointed  vice president of the Bundesbank in 1977, becoming its president three years  later. His second eight-year term will not end until 1995, when he will be 66.    Poehl is protected, by law, from Bonn's meddlesome politicians. Greenspan  enjoys similar protection, but there are noises on Capitol Hill about clipping  the Fed's wings. (Japan's central banker can never be Pope; he has to do what  the Ministry of Finance tells him to.) Thus Poehl appears more securely  independent -- the first criterion of being central-banking Pope.    Poehl is also gaining control over more and more of the world's money. Before  1991, he is likely to be dictating monetary policy in East and West Germany. By  next year, he may be ruling the money flow in Eastern Europe. As the Soviets  retreat from Eastern Europe, so goes the ruble. As East Bloc nations distance  themselves from the Soviet currency, the obvious replacement is East Europe's  reserve currency -- the deutsche mark.    Finally, Poehl's central-banking star is rising ever higher because more and  more of the world's investors take their cues from him. The currency he manages  is riding high, gaining roughly 6.5% on the dollar, 25% on the yen since last  year.    But Poehl has another advantage: He attracts attention through the sheer force  of personality. Rascally, politically shrewd, a lover of good gossip, fine wine  and fast ski slopes who can hold his own in serious intellectual debate, Poehl,  like Volcker in the '80s, is a contradiction in terms -- a charismatic central  banker.    Germany's reunification poses problems for the Bundesbank, as investors assess  what it will mean for West German stocks and bonds. Frankfurt financial markets  are already in turmoil. But one theory holds that as East Germany and Europe  are reconfigured, Poehl will be shaping events, not submitting to them.    Some Americans may pooh-pooh such prospects. Cold War warriors will continue to  view the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and other dramatic political events as  evidence for America's triumph rather than Poehl's ascendancy. Even so,  distinctions between capitalist and communist -- eventually between industrial  and developing -- economies will break down in the emerging era. The static  economic hierarchies that jelled around the Cold War will dissolve into a  kinetic system embroiled in an economic free-for-all.    If the United States is to hold its own, it must do more than reduce its budget  deficit, boost its savings or even gird for competition against Japan. Volcker  and the days of the super-dollar are over. Now is the time to know Poehl -- and  a lot more about the international economy.

Tarasyuk said that Russia sent the first convoy of fuel to  be  used to run power plants to the southern city of Zaparozhnye  Monday after Ukraine threatened to suspend dismantling of its  nuclear warheads.    Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetsky told a news conference  during a visit to Germany earlier this week that Ukraine would  stop dismantling the weapons because of Russia's failure to  provide the fuel.    Tarasyuk, who returned from talks in Moscow, said he had  received assurances from Russian officials that they would  fulfill their obligations under the agreement signed by U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk.    ""Ukraine will not raise any obstacles in the implementation  of this trilateral agreement if all parties involved fulfill  their commitments,"" Tarasyuk said.    Ukraine was the last of the four nuclear states of the  former  Soviet Union to agree to dismantle its nuclear weapons under the  agreement that provided Ukraine with at least one billion  dollars in financial compensation and nuclear fuel shipments to  run the country's power stations.

The two presidents have reached an  agreement to end the targeting of their long-range nuclear  missiles at each other. Skeptics had been prompt to point to  the infirmities in the accord. Besides mentioning the  difficulties involved in carrying it out, they have pointed out  that the whole exercise could be easily reprogrammed to return  to the old position of aiming at each other. However, what is  being forgotten is that despite numerous problems afflicting  U.S.-Russian relations today, Russia as well as the other  constituents of the former Soviet Union have along with the  United States firmly set themselves on a course of nuclear  disarmament which is practically irreversible. Both the  intermediate nuclear forces treaty evolved at the  Reagan-Gorbachev summit in December 1987 in Washington and the  Strategtic Arms Reduction Treaty, START-II, arrived at in  January last year in Moscow during the last Bush-Yeltsin summit  have provided sufficient testimony of that course. In fact,  such a course signifies the final burial of the cold war,  conclusive evidence of which is offered by the latest accord.    Perhaps, more striking is Mr. Leonid Kravchuk, the president  of Ukraine, joining Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin in Moscow to  attest their signatures on an agreement envisaging the  destruction of the nuclear arsenal in Ukraine's possession.  This arsenal of 1,900 warheads is the world's third largest  after those of the United States and Russia. This accord too  has generated a lot of skepticism, fuelled as it is by the rise  of nationalist sentiments in the various republics of the  erstwhile USSR threatening to nullify the essence of whatever  has been achieved. Nevertheless, while not being blind to such  an eventuality, it is necessary to underline that these fears  are exaggerated, precisely when the public opinion in Russia and  other member states of the former Soviet Union is for protection  of their national interests alongside economic development and  national regeneration for which reinforcement of peace through  nuclear disarmament constituents an essential precondition. Mr.  Clinton has emphasized the U.S.-Russian role in promoting  European security.    The agreements about to be concluded in Moscow are of  far-reaching nature and would, therefore, actually exert a  powerful positive influence on global security in general, far  beyond the borders of the European continent. They are also in  full conformity with the Indian action plan for disarmament  spelt out by the late Rajiv Gandhi at the third special session  of the UN on disarmament.     "

A similar agreement between the EU and Russia is being drawn  up but has not been completed. It appears that partnership with  Ukraine will come first.    During the talks with Ukrainian political leaders (Foreign  Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Chairman of Parliament Ivan  Plyushch on Thursday and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on  Friday) the Troika made it clear to Ukraine that the EU is  serious about its ""Global Approach Strategy."" In other words,  technical and economic cooperation is exchanged for  denuclearization and signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty  [NPT].    Ukraine has started dismantling the 1,800 nuclear heads on  its territory. In exchange for this, the former Soviet republic  will also receive financial support from the United States.  However, cooperation with the EU goes even further than this.    The objective is to continue the denuclearization process in  Ukraine. Should this process come to a halt, then European  cooperation would also stop.    The European ministers in Kiev also insisted on  normalization  of relations with Russia and on compliance with all the  conditions of the IMF and the World Bank -- two institutions  that Ukrainian President Kravchuk visited last week in  Washington.    The relations between Ukraine and Russia are not very good.  In January, Kiev agreed with Moscow on the dismantling of  nuclear warheads in exchange for enriched uranium for Ukrainian  plants. Recently, President Kravchuk indicated that  denuclearization is underway as agreed. He made it clear that  dismantling of nuclear warheads would be conditional on gas  deliveries from Moscow. This month, Moscow suspended its gas  exports to Ukraine.    During a press conference following the negotiations,  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko told the international press  that when parliamentary activities resume (after the 27 March  elections), the Ukrainian Parliament would ratify the  Nonproliferation Treaty.    EU Commissioner van den Broek indicated that the success of  the cooperation agreement will ""largely depend on the success of  the economic reforms in Ukraine. If Ukraine benefits from the  macroeconomic conditions, foreign investors will be convinced.""    Belgian Foreign Minister Claes pointed out that the  cooperation agreement provided for import restrictions on, among  other things, Ukrainian steel and aluminium -- there are 70,000  posts at stake in the European steel sector -- as well as an  antidumping clause. ""There will be rules for both partners.  Ukraine and Europe will benefit from the treaty. The contract  is not based on full reciprocity: Ukraine has the advantage,""  Claes added.    Claes said that ""the priority was to establish a stable  monetary system in Ukraine to enable foreign investments.""    On Friday, the Ukrainian president confirmed to the troika  that he expects to gather the requested majority (and the  requested quorum) in Parliament to ratify the Nonproliferation  Treaty, Claes added.

The head of the Soviet delegation, arms control expert Viktor P. Karpov, told  reporters that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev plans to seek limits on the  military power of a reunified Germany when he meets with President Bush  beginning Thursday.    ""We need some guarantees that this new Germany will respect European security  and that the armed forces of the new state will be under some control,"" he  said.    U.S. officials said they are optimistic that the two sides can work through the  remaining issues in the nuclear strategic arms reduction talks (START) when  they begin meeting today. Bush and Gorbachev are scheduled to approve its terms  in a declaration this week.    ""We're just about there,"" said a senior Administration official, noting that  the remaining problems in the proposed START accord are ""not major policy  issues.""    On conventional arms, U.S. officials said they hope for a positive Soviet  response to several compromise proposals made by Secretary of State James A.  Baker III in Moscow two weeks ago.    The talks on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) have been at an impasse for  months while Moscow reconsidered its security posture after the collapse of  Eastern Europe's Communist regimes. The negotiations are intended to produce a  treaty under which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact  would make deep cuts in troops, aircraft, armored vehicles and artillery.    In Moscow, Baker took the Soviets a package of U.S. ""ideas"" intended to explore  Soviet flexibility and re-energize the negotiations, but he received no  concrete response.    Officials said the U.S. suggestions covered most of the issues on which NATO  and the Soviets are at odds in the talks: limits on aircraft and armored  forces, destruction of weapons that are withdrawn, manpower ceilings for each  alliance and verification procedures.    One major issue stems in part from Soviet worries that a reunified Germany  might become a major military power again. The Kremlin has proposed a troop  ceiling of about 750,000 on each alliance, a provision that would have the  effect of constraining German troop levels.    Previously, the United States had argued that no such limits were necessary.  But in his recent Moscow meetings, Baker hinted at a new, more flexible U.S.  position, according to one official. He said Baker told the Soviets that NATO  would attempt to ""accommodate Soviet concerns about German force levels in the  current (CFE) negotiations or later.""    In START negotiations, half a dozen ""second-order"" issues remain to be  resolved:    * Warheads on mobile land-based missiles. The United States has backed off its  longstanding proposal to ban all land-based mobile multiple-warhead missiles,  so now both sides are trying to set a limit on the warheads carried by mobile  launchers.    * Limits on the Soviet Union's modernization of its heavy SS-18 missile. The  United States had proposed banning production and flight tests of these  weapons. The Soviets already have agreed to halve their SS-18 force from 308 to  154; but during the eight-year course of the START negotiations, they have also  developed an improved version, called Mod 5. The new U.S. proposal is to limit  flight testing and end production of the Mod 5, but Moscow has shown no  interest in that.    * The Soviets' Backfire bomber. Moscow refuses to include these under the START  limits because it says they are medium-range aircraft, not long-range. The  United States wants them included but may drop the issue.    * Perimeter and portal monitoring. The two sides disagree on the kinds and  numbers of nuclear weapon facilities where on-site inspectors from each side  would police operations.    * Non-circumvention. START bans both countries from giving the weapons limited  by the pact to other countries, but the United States wants to maintain a  longstanding program to help Britain develop sea-based nuclear forces. The  Soviets are expected to agree.    * ""Follow-on"" negotiations. At the summit, Bush and Gorbachev are expected to  issue a joint statement promising to follow the START treaty with START-2  talks. But the two sides haven't agreed on what should be included in the next  negotiations. The United States wants to reduce the Soviet arsenal of SS-18s  and ballistic missiles with multiple warheads; the Soviets want more limits on  air- and sea-launched cruise missiles. Arms control experts predict the  statement will be vague, leaving the question of the START-2 agenda to be  worked out later.

Concerned that tremors in the  nuclear non-proliferation system will be an obstacle to the  peaceful use of nuclear energy, the white paper stresses that  Japan should take the lead in strengthening that system.    The White Paper raises issues such as (1) North Korea's  declared intention to withdraw from the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), (2) suspicions about Iraq's  development of nuclear weapons, and (3) Ukraine's possession of  strategic nuclear weapons; and it warns that ``these cannot help  but have a restraining effect on peaceful use of nuclear energy,  and are reasons for serious concern.''    The White Paper also expresses concern by stating that, as  nuclear disarmament in the United States and the former Soviet  Union advances, ``the problems of accumulation, storage, use and  disposal of plutonium and other nuclear materials from  dismantled nuclear weapons are expected to grow more serious.''  The White Paper cites an estimate of about 125 tons of plutonium  extracted from the dismantling of Russian nuclear weapons alone.    Based on this international situation, the White Paper  states  that ``It is crucial to get the full understanding of all  countries concerned about the use of plutonium,'' thereby  advocating full openness of information about Japan's plutonium  use policy. It also stresses that ``It is important for Japan to  contribute actively to strengthening the global nuclear  non-proliferation system.''    As a way of strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation  system, Japan is doing a full-scale study of the creation of a  framework for international control of plutonium. Science and  Technology Agency (STA) Director General Eda proposed the  concept of international control at the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) general session at the end of September.  The concept basically called for each country to reveal the  status of planning and use of plutonium for commercial purposes  and the status of the plutonium from the dismantling of nuclear  weapons. and for verification of this information by an  international organization.    Moreover, in October, Japan and Russia signed an agreement  concerning assistance to Russia in the fields of storage and  peaceful use of nuclear materials created from the dismantling  of nuclear weapons. Preparations are underway for the  establishment of an ``international science and technology  center'' by Japan, the United States, the European Community and  Russia aimed at preventing a brain drain of scientists and  technicians from Russia.    The White Paper states that the estimated amount of the  world's plutonium as of 1990, was about 257 tons for military  use and about 654 tons for civilian use. Of the plutonium for  civilian use, about 532 tons is in spent nuclear fuel, about 72  tons has been separated and stored, and the rest exists in the  nuclear fuel cycle. As of June 1993, Japan had about 1.6 tons of  crude plutonium.     "

It is  on its way to enterprises in Russia where this dangerous cargo  will be dismantled and subsequently reprocessed and destroyed.  An ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed of this by a  top-ranking expert who wished to remain anonymous.    The expert believes that the movement of the trains carrying  these nuclear warheads is being linked in a number of Russian  ministries with the start of the practical implementation of the  trilateral Russo-American-Ukrainian agreements on the  liquidation of nuclear weapons in the Ukraine, which were signed  in Moscow in January of this year.    Under the agreement, Russia has undertaken to deliver to  Ukraine fuel for its nuclear power stations in exchange for the  nuclear warheads, but not in the form of reprocessed nuclear  material from the missiles that have been removed. According to  the expert, it will take a long time to reprocess it, from  several months to a year. Fuel for the Ukrainian nuclear power  plants will be exchanged for fuel from Russia's reserves.    In reply to a question by the ITAR-TASS correspondent about  help to Ukraine from Japan in eliminating nuclear weapons, the  expert noted that international practice shows that nuclear  weapons should be dismantled by whoever stockpiled them. The  Russian side is capable of removing all nuclear warheads on the  territory of Ukraine in the course of a year for dismantling  subsequently at the enterprises where they were produced. The  expert said that what may be at issue is help from Japanese  specialists in secondary work, in particular, on dismantling  silos.    Acording to reports from ITAR-TASS correspondents from  Yekaterinburg, Cherlyabinsk, and Tomsk, a number of specialist  enterprises in these cities do not rule out the possibility that  they may get the Ukrainian consignment. They are ready to  receive it there. Russian nuclear experts also guarantee the  Ukrainian side that all work in the process of removing and  recovering strategic weapons will be carried out safely.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent has been told by a duty officer  at  one of the main directorates of the Russian Ministry of Railways  that, under the conditions of the tripartite agreement between  Russia, the United States, and Ukraine, the route of the trains  carrying the Ukrainian nuclear warheads is not to be disclosed.  According to him, special strict security measures are observed  on Russian railways when cargoes of this kind are transported.    According to the Russian Defense Ministry, there are about  1300 warheads for intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBM),  more than 600 warheads for air-launched cruise missiles and 176  IBM missile launchers, including 130 SS-19 and 46 SS-24  launchers, on Ukrainian territory. The state of nuclear safety  in Ukraine causes particular concern to specialists and delays  in withdrawing and dismantling them are fraught with  unpredictable consequences. In particular, the guarantee period  has expired for most warheads, and no maintenance is being  carried out. Some weapons are on the point of posing a danger.  The situation is being aggravated by the fact that there are  not enough specialists in Ukraine to monitor the safety of  nuclear weapons.     "

In exchange for this, Ukraine  will be financially compensated with aid of $175 million from  the United States and at the same time will be given a safety  guarantee. This is a major action that has been jointly  undertaken by Russia, the United States, and Ukraine concerning  the issue of nuclear weapons since the Lisbon Accord signed  between the United States and Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and  Belarus in May 1992.    All three parties have made positive assessment of the above  agreement. Clinton said that it was a ""breakthrough"" which has  reduced the possibility of nuclear calamities and has ushered in  a ""new era"" in the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship. Yeltsin  maintained that the agreement had intensified the nuclear  nonproliferation mechanism and pushed forward the process of  nuclear disarmament. Kravchuk said that the agreement was the  result of compromise made by all parties, which enabled Ukraine  to be more secure and obtain the right of equal partnership.    No doubt, the Moscow agreement has made significant progress  toward solving the nuclear weaponry problem in Ukraine, but many  problems have yet to be resolved. Moreover, whether the  agreement can be smoothly carried out will depend on the  development of Ukraine's domestic political situation and the  relations between Ukraine and Russia and between Ukraine and the  United States.    First, the issue of nuclear weapons has a decisive impact on  the stability of Ukraine's political situation. When Ukraine  proclaimed its independence, it declared that it would be a  nuclear-free country and promised to destroy all its nuclear  weapons. Over the past few years, however, there have been  different political propositions at home regarding the approval  of the treaty to reduce strategic weapons in the first stage and  the accession to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. In some  people's opinion, under the circumstances of enormous external  pressure and public territorial claims from certain Russian  forces, nuclear weaponry is Ukraine's ""trump card"" in defending  its national independence and territorial integrity. They were  even more worried about Russia's foreign policy after its new  parliamentary election. Therefore, they do not want to give up  their nuclear weapons but favor retaining them, at least for a  certain period. Other people are of the opinion that the  principle of becoming a nuclear-free country should not be  changed, but they should be compensated for giving away the  nuclear weapons, or the contents of the nuclear warheads should  be transformed into fuel for nuclear power stations to alleviate  the serious energy crisis. In addition, Ukraine found it  difficult to continue maintaining and managing the existing  nuclear missiles either economically or technically. If the  nuclear arsenal is preserved, several dozen billion U.S. dollars  will still be needed to set up a complete system of scientific  research and production. That will be beyond their ability,  even though they wish to do so. For this reason, the Ukrainian  parliament decided last year to approve the treaty with 13  conditions attached to it and called for the nuclear powers,  primarily Russia and the United States, to provide a security  guarantee and economic aid as compensation. Therefore, after  President Kravchuk signed the treaty in Moscow, he still has to  make painstaking efforts to persuade the parliament so that the  treaty can be endorsed and put into effect.    Second, the issue of nuclear weapons is a vital element that  has an impact on the relations between Ukraine and Russia and  between Ukraine and the United States. Since the disintegration  of the Soviet Union, nuclear weapons have all along been one of  the major disagreements between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian  side maintains that it should be the only successor of the  Soviet nuclear weapons, and that those in the Ukrainian  territory must be shipped to Russia. What is more, Russia tried  to force Ukraine to give in by suspending supplies of petroleum  and natural gas to the latter and pressing it to repay its  debts. As for the United States, it first tried to make Ukraine  submit to its pressure, threatening that, if Ukraine would not  settle the nuclear problem, it would not develop other aspects  of its relations with Ukraine. Later, it changed tactics by  promising to provide Ukraine with aid of $175 million and  increasing personnel contacts and consultations with a view to  urging Ukraine to hand over its nuclear weapons. As a matter of  fact, what Russia and the United States are worried about is the  emergence of another powerful and independent nuclear country,  apart from Russia, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  Hence, they insisted that they would not provide a security  guarantee to Ukraine unless it acceded to the treaty. Prior to  his current trip to Moscow, Clinton was the first to announce in  Brussels that Ukraine had consented to destroy the nuclear  weapons. He also made a short stay in Kiev, which was aimed at  demonstrating the progress made in nuclear disarmament so as to  remove the anxieties of Europe over the nuclear threats on the  one hand, and at manifesting the support he had won from NATO  members on the other.    The public maintains that the solution of the problem  regarding Ukraine's nuclear weapons is a major achievement that  has been scored through the coordinated position between the  United States and Russia. However, the principal purpose of  Clinton's current trip was to put his plan of a ""partnership for  peace"" into practice. He made no commitment to security in the  Eastern European region, and his promise of economic aid to  Ukraine was also much said but little done, which was far from  what Ukraine had expected. Judging from this, the changes of  political situation in Russia and the United States and whether  their policies toward Ukraine as well as the U.S. undertaking of  aid and compensation can be carried out will have an impact on  whether Ukraine will perform its obligations in a period of time  to come.

He named such former Russian military bases as Loksa,  Keila-Joa, Klooga and Tapa as being the first where similar  activities should be conducted.    Olesk said that besides the need to guarantee security and  order in Paldiski during the dismantling work of the nuclear  reactors of the training base, the registry was a good  experience for the authorities to test the new methods of  registering. Olesk added that after the census of 1989 the  number and structure of population in Estonia has changed  greatly, with no new census being in view before 2000.    According to the preliminary results of registering of  inhabitants in Paldiski, over six thousand people live there,  Olesk told ETA on Monday. In the course of registration that  lasted from March 22 to 25, 3,684 registration questionnaires  were fulfilled. In addition, a list of 892 Russian military and  their families from the submarine training centre and 69  military from Tallinn fleet headquarters is in the possession of  Estonian Government. Children up to 16 years were inscribed in  the questionnaires of their parents and their exact amount,  estimated at about one thousand, will be clear next week.  Another thousand people did not appear at the registration  mainly for being on a business trip.    Olesk added that people that did not register themselves  will  have difficulties in moving in the town when the dismantling  work of the nuclear reactor at the former military base will  start and people that do not have a registering inscription in  their documents or do not possess a special permission to be in  the town, will be detained until their identification is  determined.    Up to now the exact number and composition of population in  Paldiski, largely inhabited by non-Estonian population and  Russian military, was not known, for the former town  authorities, subject to Russian military authorities and  dissolved by a law adopted by Estonian Riigikogu [parliament] on  March 9, refused to hand over data on the subject.    Government's special representative in Paldiski Juri Tikk  told a press conference, on Tuesday, that the dismantling work  of the nuclear reactor, which will bring about a special order  to be enforced in the town, will start in the second decade of  April and last till the nuclear fuel is deported from Estonia at  the end of June or beginning of July.    Tikk said that at the first stage of dismantling, the  Russian  side will not allow anybody but ""his own men"" to observe the  process, for several allegedly secret mechanisms are situated at  the object. Later Estonian and international observers are  allowed to observe the liquidation process.    Tikk added that the possibility of a ""black scenario"", which  would mean a radioactive contamination of the environment, is  about zero but should not be excluded. In an emergency  situation Russian side intends to bring 200 chemical specialists  from Kaliningrad in an hour. In case there is a need to  evacuate local population, the Estonian side will pay the costs,  he added.     "

It looks like the two  countries will formally sign an agreement on aid in the  dismantling of nuclear weapons during President Yeltsin's visit  to Japan on 11 October, and a committee geared toward  implementing the aid plan will be started in Tokyo. Furthermore,  cooperation in surveying the problem of radioactive waste  dumping into the ocean and other such support will continue to  steadily expand to Russia. While proceeding with territorial  negotiations, it is essential that the Japanese government,  which takes the route of ""expanded equilibrium"" as the basis of  its dealings with Russia, makes an expression of aid to Russia  and implements that without any problems. Given that Japan has  no experience in the area of nuclear abolition aid, there is  increasing concern about the success or failure of such an  effort.    The agreement for aid in abolishing nuclear weapons that  President Yeltsin will sign when he comes to Japan is a part of  the voluntary aid to Russia that the government announced at the  G7 meeting in Tokyo last April. On this occasion, Japan is  declaring that it will provide about $100 million in gratuitous  funding to four former-Soviet nations that posses nuclear  weapons--Russia, Ukraine, Byelarus, and Kazakhstan--and is  negotiating separate agreements with the four countries. Russia  will be the first to receive this bilateral aid.    Japan's aid to Russia in the dismantling of nuclear weapons  comes later than other countries such as the U.S. and France,  which are already proceeding with bilaterally based assistance.  The prospect is for the aid plan to be implemented within the  year under a committee jointly created by Japan and Russia.    The main areas in which Japan will provide aid are the  construction of storage facilities for storing and managing  plutonium and other nuclear substances resulting from the  dismantling of nuclear weapons, the elimination of radioactive  pollution around nuclear facilities, and assistance in medical  treatment for radiation injuries. Japan will also send experts  to Russia for technical guidance and will provide needed  equipment such as radioactivity detectors.    Japan's policy is not to participate in the actual  dismantling of nuclear weapons because that would contradict the  ""triple nonnuclear principle."" Although the areas of assistance  are limited, the government's standpoint, according to a  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) source, is that ""there is the  way to make the most of Japan's unique character, because Japan  is second to none when it comes to technology and research on  the safe management and peaceful utilization of nuclear  substances."" A nonnuclear country, Japan's promotion of other  countries' peaceful use of nuclear materials ""is significant in  that it appeals to a position of contributing to the world's  peace and nuclear nonproliferation.""    Furthermore, Japan's technical and financial assistance in  the construction of nuclear storage facilities will also  contribute greatly toward halting Russia's dumping of  radioactive waste into the sea. Japan fears the marine pollution  and the effects on marine life due to the former Soviet Union's  and Russia's dumping of radioactive waste into the sea. Although  Japan wants an immediate stop put to the dumping of liquid  waste, Russia cannot comply with the request because of its lack  of preparedness, such as poorly equipped storage facilities.  Because of that, too, the need to speed up the aid is indicated.    Given such a background, both the Japanese and Russian  governments agree that the aid plan should be implemented soon.  At first, the two governments were expecting that the agreement  would be signed in June. That slipped more than three months  because of the confrontation between the Russian government and  parliament.    The fact is that negotiations between the two countries were  stifled because the Russian parliament showed disaproval in  response to Japan's request to include in the agreement the  removal of tariffs on aid goods. Nevertheless, an MFA source  says that ""the prospects for signing the agreement look much  better"" because of Yelstin's bold action in dissolving the  parliament on 21 September.    But, even if the agreement is signed, there is still a long  road to implementation. ""First, we ascertain what sort of  support can Japan provide that will not overlap with the other  countries already aiding Russia, and what sort of support does  Russia want. Everything will go from there,"" says an MFA source.  There are high hurdles to overcome before an outline of the  implementation is created, people are selected to carry it out,  and goods are sent.    Another thing that causes great concern is the situation  within Russia. The aid is largely premised on the progress of  Yeltsin's political and economic reforms, but, with the recent  bloody incident, the aid's good cause was damaged, and some  expect the brakes will be applied to the implementation of the  aid. An MFA spokesman says that he ""would like to move into  implementing"" the $100 million in voluntary aid that was decided  in a supplementary budget last June ""in some form or another,  within the fiscal year."" However, apparently that will be  affected by the political trends within Russia.     "

Tiiman said that the round discussed traditional issues of  military, economic, border and humanitarian spheres. The  military group dealt as usually with agreements on Russian troop  withdrawal, retired military social security measures and  dismantling of nuclear training base at Paldiski.    Tiiman said that the agreement of withdrawal of forces was  principally ready, only bilateral compensations demands had to  be still decided upon. All other articles of the agreement were  coordinated, including the troop pullout deadline of August 31,  1994, which should not be touched upon any more.    As it was announced yesterday Russia did not present a  detailed timetable of withdrawal of its forces from Estonia, as  it had repeatedly promised. The fact that the Russian  delegation failed to present the timetable proved that ""our  eastern neighbour searched pretext to drag on the negotiations,""  head of Riigikogu [parliament] state defence committee Rein  Helme told ETA on Thursday. Vassili Svirin, the chief Russian  negotiator said Russia did not present the timetable because of  Estonia's rejection of a Moscow proposal on retired military  social guarantees. Helme said that the argument was a ""searched  pretext"", showing that Russia used its responsibilities before  its citizens to ""shake Estonian political stability"" and Russia  was not interested in successful finishing of the negotiations.    Tiiman said that the agreement on military pensioners social  securities was in a difficult situation although all questions  that did not demand changes in the other side's laws were  solved. Russia pays (military) retirement fees to 10,570  persons residing in Estonia, 850 of whom are reserve officers,  Tiiman said, adding that he doubted Vassili Svirin's words that  former military personnel officers who are 55 or 60 years old at  present were no danger to Estonian security.    Tiiman said that the last round of negotiations was,  however,  not to be regarded as an entire failure. Work has been most  constructive on the issue of liquidation of the Paldiski nuclear  training base. The head of the Paldiski working group Mark  Sinisoo told a press conference, on Thursday, that the Russian  side had given its final consent to international experts  participation at the dismantling of the nuclear reactors,  stating, however, that no international or Estonian experts  could be present at the dismantling before the ""secret  components"" were taken out of Estonia. Russian delegation also  said that by September 1 the whole infrastructure of Paldiski,  still a Russian military town, will be handed over to Estonia.    Tiiman said that the greatest number of agreements were  prepared in the economic working group, but Russia was not  interested in concluding them, e.g. the investments' protection  agreement was ready already in June 1993, but Russia ""simply  does not want to conclude it"", the same being true about the  question of dividing former USSR property. Tiiman said that all  this pointed to an old Russian Supreme Soviet decision according  to which Russia will not regulate economic questions with  Estonia before all other demands i.e. concerning the retired  military and humanitarian issues, were not fulfilled.

They come from cities  like Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nijni Novgorod--among others.  Their passports say Vladimir, Ilia, Igor, Irina, and Olga. The  Russians are coming to town in an invasion as sweet as their  Slavic accents. The wave is swelling to such a point as to  constitute a new tourist boom, far from the prejudices of the  Cold War. But the invasion has not only sent tourists; it has  brought more than 30 scientists and high-tech researchers,  first-rate ""brains"" from the former Soviet Union, now settled  down and teaching at institutions like Rio de Janeiro State  University (UERJ) and the State University of Northern Rio de  Janeiro [UENF] in Campos.    ""For us in Rio, this is an occasion as important as the  arrival of 40 of Europe's brightest at the University of Sao  Paulo (USP) during the Second World War. It was that importation  of `brains' that gave USP the influence it has today,"" said  Senator Darcy Ribeiro.    Competition    As chancellor of UENF, Ribeiro has already sent three  delegations to Russia to compete--mainly with Israel, Germany,  the United States, and Japan--for the chance to transfer to  Brazil ""22 of the best and the brightest,"" who were orphaned by  the dismantling of Soviet scientific institutions. Not wanting  to be left behind in the seduction of Russian ""brains,"" UERJ  Rector Hesio Cordeiro has now brought five scientists to his  campus.    When it comes to tourism, it is also ""the Russians' turn""  now, said Olga Dalamarczuk, assigned by Hotur (Association of  Tourist Hotels of Rio) to take care of the visitors from that  country. In general, these are people from the middle class who  have benefited from the economic reforms begun in 1992. An  Aeroflot flight brings groups of 50 every week. That has led  Riotur and Hotur to invest in promoting Rio in the Russian  capital.    Salary Makes Move Worthwhile    ""They say that if you go to Salvador, you'd better not drop  anything on the floor because if it makes a noise the Bahians  will think it is a new rhythm and will start dancing."" The joke,  which conveys a feeling of intimacy with things Brazilian, is  told by Irina Potapenko, a Russian physicist and mathematician  who has been here for three months. Along with her colleagues  Arthur Elfimov, Vladimir Tsypin, Nicolay Grishanov, and Fedor  Nekrasov--all theoreticians in plasma physics (a scientific  field concerned with such things as making better use of solar  energy)--she works at the Department of Quantum Electronics at  the UERJ School of Physics.    Like her colleagues, Irina likes Rio, ""a city that combines  modern buildings, the sea, unusual mountain shapes, and  hospitable people,"" as she puts it. The Russian scientists earn  $1,000 (CR$700,000) a month at UERJ. In their own country,  researchers would earn only $80.00 (CR$56,000) a month. ""Russia  has no means of investing in science. But since scientific  knowledge is universal, it is better to do the work here than  sit idle back there. Later, we can take the results back home,""  said Elfimov.    Supply    The researchers recall that their country now has 1.5  million  researchers at the doctorate level, plus 200,000 scientists who  have attained the highest level of education--all of them  susceptible to becoming part of the ""brain drain."" Another  physicist, Sergei Ivanov, came to Rio to develop ""x-ray  equipment to measure tension inside metals."" He lives with his  wife Nina and daughter Maria in Leblon. ""Russia pays specialists  low wages. Some day I'll go back. Although my 9-year-old  daughter, who attends Saint Patrick School in Leblon, wants to  stay in Rio. You say there are criminals here? Well, there are  criminals in Russia, too,"" observed Ivanov.    At the State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro [UENF] in  Campos, says its president, Gilca Wainstein, an elaborate  process of transfer and absorption of technology is under way.  ""We sent delegations to the Russian Academy of Sciences and  reviewed more than 80 resumes from each scientific field. The  idea is that even if the Russians go back to their own country,  they will leave the technology here,"" said the university  president. At UENF, 22 Russian researchers are earning about  $3,000 (CR$2.1 million) each. They work in sophisticated  specialty fields of biotechnology, diamond technology, fracture  and corrosion engineering, and oil and gas.     "

In the area of atomic energy,  Japan and Russia will cooperate in research on the peaceful use  of the excess plutonium generated with the dismantling of  nuclear weapons, a security measure system, etc. In space  science and technology, the aim is to set up new joint research  projects using large-scale test facilities and the excellent  data that Russia has accumulated from global observations and  manned space activities. The idea is to further advance science  and technology cooperation between Japan and Russia that makes  the best use of Japan's technological strength and knowledge.

Malk said only the humanitarian issues working group made  some progress. The two parties agreed to resume talks at the  beginning of May.    Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation and head of  the military issues working group, claimed Estonia was prepared  for increased pressure on Russia's part, considering that Latvia  and Russia initialed an agreement on social guarantees for  military pensioners.    ""The course of the talks didn't alarm us, although the  Russian party demanded sharply and in the form of an ultimatum  that Estonia should sign an agreement on military retirees and  pay Russia 23 million U.S. dollars (to build housing for the  repatriated military in Russia),"" Tiiman said. ""Since the texts  of the initialed Latvian-Russian agreements are available to us,  we can say Russia made similar demands on us.""    Tiiman claimed Russia demanded that Estonia should issue  residence permits to all retirees and ""give them apartments in  perpetuity.""    Estonia put at the talks the question whether Russia  considers that Estonia's legislation concerning military  pensioners is inconsistent with international law, which the  Russian delegation failed to answer. The Estonian delegation  plans at the next round of talks to ask Russia to explain the  legal basis for retiring its officers on Estonia's territory.    Russia on Wednesday in Moscow officially backed off from the  Aug. 31 deadline for the withdrawal of its troops.    ""Russia itself proposed in November the Aug. 31 deadline.  Estonia agreed to it after serious deliberation. Now Russia  deleted the date from the text of the agreement without making a  new proposal. Thus, instead of the final deadline, there's a gap  in the text of the agreement. It shows that the work of the  delegations' military issues working groups has no prospects. I  don't understand what's the purpose of our meetings,"" Tiiman  said.    Tiiman told the press Estonia put forward an ""entirely new  idea"" for dismantling the Paldiski nuclear reactors, which  Russia is at present studying. He declined to disclose the  details of the proposal.    Tiiman said the humanitarian issues working group made some  progress in discussions about the maintenance of military  graveyards, exchange of prisoners, and citizenship problems.  Russia expressed willingness to present lists of Russian  citizens residing in Estonia, he stated.    Malk told the press the April 1 incident near Petseri when  two unidentified persons killed one and wounded two Russian  border guards cast a cloud on discussions in the border issues  working group.    ""The parties agreed that absence of a relevant agreement  complicates cooperation between the two countries' border  guards,"" Malk said. ""They discussed an agreement on cooperation  between border officials, and the Estonian delegation asked for  an explanation why Russia hasn't as yet ratified the agreement  on legal cooperation.""    Malk declared that so far no facts have come to light to  support the claims that the persons who murdered the Russian  border guard arrived on Russian-controlled territory from  Estonia or that they escaped to Estonia after the crime.    The economic issues working group reported no progress. The  questions it discussed included an Estonian-Russian agreement on  commercial and economic cooperation for 1994, questions of  ownership, payment of the former Soviet Union's foreign debt,  and compensation for the gold and foreign currency Russia  removed from Estonia in 1940.    Malk said Russia links economic issues with developments in  other spheres, and for that reason ""there was no progress in  this group, either.""    In reply to BNS' question whether Estonia will after the  failure of the 18th round of talks again consider suspending the  negotiations, Malk said a relevant political decision must be  made on the government level.    Foreign Minister Juri Luik said today at a press conference  that Estonian-Russian talks must continue. Europe's support for  Russia withdrawing its troops from Estonia by Aug. 31 is very  strong, he said.    The foreign minister claimed Russia could pull out its  troops  even sooner than by Aug. 31. ""There are no real obstacles to it,  it's only Russia's political incapacity,"" Luik maintained.

In addition, the government set up the country's delegation  for the April 30 Moscow summit and considered the amount for  rent for the radar facility at Skrunda.    The ministers decided that Russia should pay for Skrunda 130  million U.S. dollars per year but it could also remunerate the  worth of the sum in natural gas, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs  told reporters after the government session.    Latvian officials are now negotiating the proposal with  Russian counterparts in Moscow.    In another action, the Cabinet decided to announce a  competition for the dismantling of the new building of the  Skrunda radar compound. For the purpose, foreign countries have  already extended 3 million U.S. dollars.    Birkavs prognosticated the interest in the dismantling would  be large. The task, however, may pose technical problems  because the building was constructed safe against nuclear  attacks.    The government also ruled to form a working part to create a  repatriation fund for Russian war pensioners.    Birkavs said that the U.S. Government allotted for the fund  2.5 million dollars in housing vouchers. Consequently, the  officers won't be able to use the money for other purposes,  Birkavs noted.    Commenting on the agreement signature, Birkavs said Latvia  would propose that it is signed by two representatives of each  country.    Birkavs described Russia's commitment to submit Latvia a  list  of military retirees as the principal achievement of the  additional protocol.     "
0,FT932-11266 ,"FT932-11266 _AN-DEECIADRFT 930505   FT  05 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Nuclear rift over Ukraine   NUCLEAR disarmament was perhaps the most cherished fruit of the end of the cold war. Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin acknowledged as much when they signed the Start 2 strategic arms limitation treaty in Moscow last January. The rest of the world applauded the prospect of a further significant reduction in the US and ex-Soviet nuclear arsenals, and western policymakers began turning their minds to the next big disarmament challenge: that of renewing and strengthening the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Now it is beginning to look as if everyone relaxed too soon. The Russian parliament has yet to ratify Start 2. More worrying, neighbouring, newly independent Ukraine is embroiled in an increasingly acrimonious row with Russia and the west over the 176 Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles and 41 nuclear-armed bombers still on its soil. Without sensitive handling on all sides, the dispute risks upsetting the international disarmament process and becoming a serious irritant in efforts to renew the NPT. At worst, it could encourage something the west desperately wants to prevent: the emergence of a renegade power in the heart of Europe, clinging to nuclear weapons for lack of what it sees as reliable security guarantees, and perhaps seeking alliances with other would-be nuclear states in the Middle East or Asia. Insensitive handling Thus far, the west's - and in particular Washington's - handling of the issue has been anything but sensitive. The Clinton administration has issued a series of warnings to Ukraine that it will not discuss aid for its shattered economy or any other bilateral questions until Kiev has ratified the earlier Start 1 strategic arms treaty and acceded to the NPT. Ukrainian leaders have been promising to do this since 1991, but parliament has yet to deliver. The main result of US pressure has been to fuel the growth of pro-nuclear sentiment among legislators, making it decreasingly likely that Ukraine will agree to go non-nuclear in the foreseeable future. How is the impasse to be broken? In exchange for ratification, President Leonid Kravchuk is demanding substantial western assistance towards the cost of dismantling the weapons (the US has promised Dollars 175m); payment of the proceeds from sale of the nuclear fuel they contain; and cast-iron guarantees of Ukraine's security from Nato powers and from Russia. Western governments, though some have given security assurances, instinctively jib at what they see as a form of nuclear blackmail. But their failure to respond merely reinforces the Ukrainians' inclination to hang on to nuclear weapons either as a deterrent to Russian adventurism or simply as a means of ensuring they are taken seriously. Legitimate concerns On both these counts Ukraine has legitimate concerns. Russia has consistently refused to sign a comprehensive political treaty with Ukraine recognising the inviolability of its frontiers, except in the context of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the successor body to the USSR of which Ukraine has said it does not want to be a full member. Moreover, influential voices in the Russian parliament are frequently heard staking claims to Ukrainian territory. The potential for instability in Russia is such that Ukraine has no reason to lower its guard. This problem is compounded by the impression in Kiev that the west is so fixated on the need to give political and economic support to Russia that it is turning a blind eye to Moscow's handling of conflicts with its neighbours. In allowing that perception to take hold, western governments have committed a blunder which they may live to regret. Fortunately, it is not too late to correct the balance. To do so the US should couple continuing pressure on Kiev over nuclear weapons with equally firm efforts to persuade Russia to sign a treaty securing Ukraine's sovereignty and its borders. In addition, other interested parties - particularly Britain and France as Europe's other nuclear powers - could adopt a higher profile in the effort to soothe Ukraine's security concerns. Finally, all involved need to demonstrate convincingly that they are coming to terms with the emergence of a new European country larger than France, and that if Ukraine moves down the path of economic reform they are prepared to assist it as generously as they are helping Russia. That way, Ukraine will not feel it needs to retain nuclear weapons to hold the world's attention.   Countries:-  UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.     RUZ  Russia, East Europe.

Estonia today began registering the residents of the former  Soviet military base town located some 40 kilometers to the west  of the country's capital. The campaign is scheduled to continue  until Saturday [26 March].    Olesk in an interview with BNS warned that if the country  fails to get a record of Russia's active service military and  their family members in the town, a substantial part of Paldiski  residents will remain a secret for Estonia.    ""We must have on record how many active service military and  their family members are there in Paldiski, and who they are.  If we fail to learn this, it means one: the Russian side is  destabilizing security in Paldiski,"" he said.    The minister said talks on the issue had taken place between  the Russian military and the Estonian Government's special  representative in the area, Juri Tikk. Olesk said Russian army  representatives had promised to present lists of their military  in the town. But he added that this was not enough for Estonia.    To pass the procedure, Paldiski residents must answer a  questionnaire, after what they will get a special inscription  into their passports. Car owners must also present their  driver's license and car ownership document.    The questionnaires will be filled in by Estonian officials  and then signed by the respondent.    Estonian authorities will be entitled to deny working and  residence permits to non-citizens who have no passport  inscription on having passed the registration. The stamp will  also give the holder the right to enter Paldiski at the time  when special entry regulations are to be introduced. The  regulations will be effective during the dismantling of two  nuclear reactors at a Russian base in the area.    Olesk said the overwhelming majority of Paldiski residents  were in favor of the registering. The questionnaires are later  to be checked by officials at the Citizenship and Migration  Department.    ""It is clear that as the passport inscription is also a  certain kind of guarantee for movement in Paldiski during the  time of dismantling of the reactors, most Paldiski residents  want to get this inscription. Paldiski residents also  understand that the passport inscription and the special  regulations to be introduced for the time of dismantling of the  reactors are in their own interests,"" Olesk explained.    Government representative Juri Tikk has earlier said that  the  passport registration campaign which started today ""is only the  first stage that will give a picture of the town's residents and  their documents.""    ""Sooner or later also those who abstain from filling in the  questionnaire will have to bring their explanations. At the  time when nuclear fuel will be brought out from Paldiski and  controls are stepped up at the Pakri peninsula, those people  will start to get caught,"" Tikk said.    Tikk said about 250 Estonian citizens and some 4,000 loyal  residents and their children were currently living in Paldiski.  Those are the people that have received the Estonian  privatization documents. Estimates put the number of Russian  military in the town at 800-1,000, about 600 of whom must leave  the country by Aug. 31, 1994. Then only some 200 Russian  military specialists will remain in the town to dismantle the  nuclear facility.    ""Those people will be allowed to remain in Estonia only in  their status as civilians,"" Tikk added.     "

The scheduled second instance of dumping was canceled.  However, there are some decommissioned nuclear submarines which  have been left untouched at a submarine repair base in the  Russian Far East region. The base in is great need of facilities  at which radioactive waste produced during the process of  dismantling nuclear submarines can be processed and stored.  Officials of the Maritime Kray Government cannot conceal their  uneasy feelings about the possibility of ""instances of nuclear  pollution that can occur anytime."" Today, we will report on the  actual state of the dismantling of the nuclear submarines and  the treatment of radioactive waste.    We drove two and half hours from Vladivostok, where the  headquarters of the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet is located. A  harbor with repair and dismantling dock facilities came into  sight as we passed a checkpoint at the entrance to Bolshoy Kamen  city. Nuclear submarines were being dismantled in three dry  docks. Dark hulls which had been aged by many long voyages were  cut crosswise, and some people were working there to take out  radioactive waste.    According to military officials and people who work at the  Zvezda (meaning ""star"") dockyard, which is the largest submarine  repair factory in Russia, and at Stella, which is a Russian-U.S.  joint venture established last spring, jointly dismantle the  nuclear submarines. About 50 submarines have already been  retired from service. The submarines still possessing nuclear  reactors were being left out in the harbor and on beaches, for  the dockyard can dismantle only four submarines a year. About  50 more submarines are scheduled to be retired from service by  the year 2000. A simple calculation tells us that 25 years are  needed to dismantle all these vessels.    Radioactive wastes are being separated into solid and liquid  wastes. Solid wastes are buried underground, but many of the  solid wastes remain piled up in the open air because they are  being removed from the submarines faster than the workers can  bury them. Liquid wastes are stored in two storage tankers, the  Pechega (which has a 700-ton capacity) and the TNT (which has a  900-ton capacity). The TNT was used to dump radioactive waste  into the Sea of Japan. One thousand tons of radioactive waste  are stored on the two ships; their remaining capacity is only  600 tons.    According to reporter Pashko (age 30), who works for an  organ  of the same fleet, about five dumpings at sea were carried out  each year from the end of the 1980's to 1991. Reportedly, 373  tons of solid waste (with radiation levels of 6 trillion  Becquerels) and 3,000 tons of liquid waste (with radiation  levels of 925 billion Becquerels) were dumped into the Sea of  Japan. The radiation levels of these wastes are far higher than  that of the liquid wastes which were dumped last month.  According to an already-made announcement, the radiation level  of the liquid wastes dumped into the Sea of Japan last month was  about 40 billion Becquerels.    Assistant Commanding Officer Maksimov (43), who belongs to a  chemical unit of the same fleet, said, ""With our current storage  capacity, our facilities will be full in 18 months.""    On the other hand, Maritime Kray Deputy Governor Stegnyy  [name as published] (45) stated: ""We need to build processing  and storage facilities as soon as possible. This is the way to  safety. We will call on the Japanese Government for its  assistance.""     "

Despite a government decision dated 31 August 1992,  funding of the construction in Nikolayev of a technical floating  dock for dismantling submarines has been suspended. And that  despite the fact that the facility is more than 60 percent  finished. Construction of two specialized docks for overhauling  nuclear reactors at Kherson shipyards has also been put on ice.    At present Russia has no docks where nuclear submarines can  be dismantled and nuclear reactors removed. More than 200  submarines are waiting in the North and the Far East. The spent  nuclear fuel has not even been removed yet from more than  one-third of them. Despite the fact that the reactors have been  shut down, they must be constantly cooled. An accident at a  submarine graveyard could produce another Chernobyl.    Some time ago construction of two of the urgently needed  docks was started at Ukrainian shipyards. One is 30 percent  ready, the other is already 65 percent ready. Contractors are  owed 12 billion rubles. And yet, up to 80 percent of the  appropriations set aside by the government is due to return to  Russia, to the self-same contractors.    Perhaps the necessary resources should now be made available  not from funds for disarmament purposes, but from funds set  aside for environmental protection. Otherwise expenditure may  have to be incurred to deal with an emergency situation, or even  a catastrophe.     "

Perry made his remarks at a press conference here at the end  of a two-day visit to the former Soviet republic.    The U.S. secretary of defence did not elaborate on this new  strategic relationship, but it was reported that the two sides  signed a series of agreements during Perry's stay.    These included an agreement on Ukrainian participation in  the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and agreement on an additional  100 million U.S. dollars of U.S. aid to help Kiev dismantle its  nuclear arms and convert part of its military industry to civil  use.    Both sides also reportedly touched on the possibility of  holding joint military exercises and will set up a hot line  between military authorities of the two countries.    The U.S. reinterated its support for safeguarding state  sovereignty in Ukraine and maintaining territorial integrity.    They also expressed an understanding of Kiev's position on  the issues of Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet.    As for the security umbrella demanded by Ukraine, Perry said  that Washington will not provide the security guarantee for Kiev  after Ukraine joins the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and  would only offer a kind of pledge on the issue.    However, before Ukraine began dismantling its nuclear arms,  Washington had repeatedly pledged to provide a security  guarantee for the former Soviet republic.    Perry said that the dispute over Russia's delay in  compensating Ukraine for nuclear disarmament is expected to be  resolved in the near future.    Ukraine has threatened to reconsider the timetable for  shipping nuclear warheads to Russia for dismantling because  Russia has failed to compensate for the transfer. Moscow has  argued that the delay was caused by Washington's failure to  uphold its part of the disarmament pact.     "

There was no confirmation of the deal yesterday in Washington or Moscow. However, Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, said in Budapest: 'All sides will tell you that progress is being made.' If agreement on financial compensation for uranium is worked out in subsequent talks, it would remove one of the three main conditions Ukraine has imposed for giving up its remaining 176 strategic missiles and becoming a non-nuclear state. Ukraine's other demands are technical aid for dismantlement and security guarantees.   Countries:-  UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Col.  Gen.

The general said that this arsenal  causes most profound concern in Russia.    The point is that the state of these warheads is still  deteriorating. The warranty periods of most of the munitions'  components are expiring and they are not undergoing the  requisite technical maintenance, while maintenance personnel  lack the requisite level of both theoretical and practical  training.

THREE ARE ARRESTED.      By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      An arsenal of knives, grenades and machine guns was described by law  enforcement authorities Monday as the largest collection of weaponry ever  seized during a drug raid in Ventura County.    Police said they found 125 firearms and 100 bladed weapons -- along with  $750,000 worth of cocaine -- in an upstairs bedroom when they stormed a Simi  Valley house on Sunday and arrested Gardner Ernest Flockhart, 31, a suspected  high-level cocaine dealer.    ""This is incredible,"" said Sgt. Steve Bowman, supervisor of the Ventura Police  Department's narcotics division. ""I haven't found any policeman who's seen this  many guns in one place at one time.""    Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said it was the most extensive collection found  during a drug raid in the county.    The seizure culminated a six-month investigation by local law-enforcement  agencies into a ring suspected of distributing cocaine to residents of Ventura  and Los Angeles counties.    An investigation of Robert Dale Lloyd, 27, an alleged drug courier from  Ventura, led to Flockhart, who is believed to be his supplier, Bowman said.    On Sunday, Lloyd allegedly delivered one kilogram of cocaine to an undercover  officer in a parking lot in Simi Valley and was immediately arrested on  suspicion of sale of a controlled substance and possession for sale of a  controlled substance.    Police then served search warrants on Lloyd's Ventura auto-repair business and  his house on El Medio Street, where they found half an ounce of cocaine  packaged for sale and arrested his wife Sharon Lloyd, 32, on suspicion of  possession of a controlled substance for sale.    Police also raided Flockhart's house, where they found $50,000 worth of guns,  12 pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of $750,000 and more than  $500,000 in cash -- including Krugerrands, silver ingots and antique coins,  authorities said.    ""One room was a veritable arsenal and supermarket for cocaine dealing,"" Bowman  said.    When officers entered the residence, they found Flockhart in the upstairs  arsenal standing next to a hand grenade, Bowman said. Flockhart was arrested  without incident on suspicion of sale of a controlled substance, possession of  a controlled substance for sale and federal firearms violations.    Flockhart's girlfriend, Christine Lynn Helenick, 28, was arrested on suspicion  of possession of a controlled substance for sale. Brian Howard Mudge, 27, who  also lived in the house, was arrested on suspicion of possession of a  controlled substance for sale.    Robert Lloyd was being held in lieu of $20,000 bail in the Ventura County Jail,  a jail spokesman said. Sharon Lloyd, Helenick and Mudge have been released on  bail, police said. Flockhart remains in custody without bail.    Flockhart, who describes himself as an unemployed actor, was convicted of  possession of narcotics for sale in Los Angeles County in 1986.    As a convicted felon, it is illegal for Flockhart to possess any firearms,  Bowman said. If convicted in federal court, Flockhart could receive a 40-year  prison sentence, Bowman said.    Police believe that Flockhart, a gun enthusiast, traded drugs for the weapons.  Bowman said it appears Flockhart used the guns primarily for target shooting.    Among the 125 firearms were 12 illegal weapons. They included four  semiautomatic Uzi-type weapons, which had been converted to fully automatic  machine guns. Some guns had been outfitted with silencers, and five rifles were  fitted with illegally short barrels, Bowman said.    Flockhart also had Teflon-coated and armor-piercing bullets, which can  penetrate the bulletproof vests used by police officers.    Collectors' items such as two $5,000 miniature replicas of machine guns also  were found. The rest of the guns included pistols, semiautomatic assault  rifles, shotguns and hunting rifles, Bowman said.    Twenty-three of the 100 bladed weapons also were illegal, Bowman said. They  included six Shurikens, four-bladed weapons that are thrown like a Frisbee and  designed to stick in the target. Five brass knuckles and 12 gravity knives, in  which blades can be exposed with a flick of the wrist, also were found.    One of Flockhart's neighbors, who asked not to be identified, said others  suspected drug activity at the house but had no idea of the number of weapons  there.    ""It was a big surprise, everything they found,"" the woman said. ""None of us  thought all that was over there.""    She said Flockhart, who had lived there about four years, enjoyed jogging and  was an avid sportsman, going deer hunting and bringing home venison.    All the guns seized in the raid Sunday will be forfeited to the state through  asset-forfeiture laws if Flockhart is convicted, Bowman said. The knives will  be ground up, he said.    The departments involved in the investigation stand to gain $700,000 to $1  million through state asset-forfeiture laws from the house, guns, six vehicles  and other belongings.    About 30 officers from five agencies were involved in the investigation -- the  Ventura Police Department, Oxnard Police Department, Simi Valley Police  Department, Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's  office. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was called in to  examine the firearms.    Bowman said he is sure that there are others above Flockhart, but added that  there is nothing to indicate that Colombian drug cartels are involved. He said  he does not expect more arrests.    Also, authorities say there is no evidence that this case is linked to the  August, 1989, bust in which a Simi Valley police investigation led to the  seizure of more than a ton of cocaine in Newhall and Chatsworth. Ten M-60  machine guns were seized during a raid that followed the breakup of a Colombian  drug ring operating in the area.

""We have some possibilities of helping,"" Bild told the press  after visiting the reactors together with his Estonian  counterpart. Bildt said that prospective aid included both  technical and social assistance referring to aid to residents  who might want to leave Paldiski. He did not, however, specify  the amount of resources Sweden was willing to allocate for that  purpose.    Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar also said that technically  everything was ready for the removal and Russia only had to pass  a decision on starting dismantling of the reactors.    ""Technically, everything is ready and we could see that with  our own eyes,"" Laar said while adding that the date remained  uncertain as even the head of the Russian training centre in  Paldiski, Admiral Aleksandr Olkhovikov, could not tell the exact  date.    Bildt expressed hope that dismantling would be started  within  a couple of weeks adding that, fortunately, his fears on high  radiation near to reactors had proved groundless.    On answering the question on Russian military pensioners,  the  issue where Latvia made concessions to Russia, Bildt said he had  discussed it at his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev in St. Petersburg in early May saying Latvia and  Estonia were completely different and that Estonia could not  copy Latvia.    ""... any agreement that must be reached must be reached  within the framework of Estonian legislation,"" Bild said.    Talking on prospective troop pullout, Bildt said: ""That will  be a very important day to Europe, because the Russians will be  leaving Germany, they will be leaving Latvia and, of course,  they must leave Estonia as well.""    Bildt also met President Lennart Meri expressing his  country's support to unconditional troop pullout by August 31  deadline. Foreign Minister Juri Luik also attended the meeting.     "

He indicated a vote would not come until January, adding: 'We cannot be indifferent to the NPT's shortcomings.' Ukraine has been pressed by the West formally to declare itself a non-nuclear state under NPT, and President Leonid Kuchma was expected to ask parliament to vote on the treaty next month. But Mr Moroz's opposition makes that unlikely. Ukrainian leaders complain that the US has delivered less than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.4m) of Dollars 350m promised for dismantlement as part of a January agreement to deploy Ukraine's nuclear arsenal to Russia. They say the US keeps moving the target for smooth relations and economic aid, from the January agreement to the NPT.   Countries:-  UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.

The catch includes 45 kg of  Semtex explosives.    Six Dutchmen and two Belgians were arrested. From a  statement issued by the Dutch press agency ANP, it can be  concluded that the gangster Yves Otte was involved in the case.  Otte was shot by the state police in Hoogstraten [Belgium] on  10 December.    According to the police, which presented its investigation  in  Amsterdam on Thursday, the weapons, most of them from former  Yugoslavia, were hidden in a lubrication pit converted into a  hideout.    In addition to the plastic explosives, the catch also  included 81 detonators, 36 hand grenades, 25 handguns, 10  so-called Brisant missiles (antitank guns), and a few thousand  cartridges of 45 different calibers. Several kilograms of  cocaine, amphetamines, and XTC were also found.    The Dutch police arrested six suspects, all of them Dutch  citizens. The Belgian state police arrested two suspects, who  were wanted for a number of armed robberies.    One of the arrests resulted in a shootout, during which the  suspect was shot in the belly by a bullet from the state police.  The man turned out to be heavily armed. In addition, he had  escaped from the jail of Louvain [Belgium] last April, where he  still had to serve a sentence of several years, according to ANP.    This description corresponds to the events which occurred in  Hoogstraten on 10 December, at an exit of the E19 Antwerp-Breda  highway, where the state police shot Otte after having itself  been shot at. Otte had also thrown a hand grenade.    Otte got caught when the state police checked a car which  turned out to be stolen in Dunkirk. Two of the three passengers  offered no resistance, but Otte ran away.    The arms catch resulted from an investigation into an attack  on the regional police training school in Amsterdam on 29  September and into a shootout at Ede [Netherlands], where police  officers were shot at from a van.    During the attack on the police school, a so-called  fragmentation shell was thrown at the front door; the 3,000  steel bullets in the shell riddled the door. Two policemen  remained unhurt, thanks to the steel doorstep which cushioned  the force of the explosion.    The shootout at Ede took place after policemen had attempted  to halt two stolen vans. The passengers of the vans kicked or  shot out the vehicle's rear window and opened fire at the  pursuing police cars. The gangsters managed to escape. Later  on, a bag with hand grenades and a cap were found by the  abandoned van.    According to the police, most of the suspects, many of whom  have a criminal record, made partial confessions. According to  their statements, the attack on the police school was a  rehearsal for a robbery, which should have yielded millions of  guilders. What specific target the men had in mind is still  unknown.    Last Saturday, the police were informed of an imminent arms  transport. They followed the suspect van from northern  Amsterdam to Zwanenburg (Netherlands), where the arsenal and a  quantity of drugs were seized. Three individuals, including a  61-year-old man, were arrested on the spot. The police does not  rule out the possibility of more arrests.     "

The goals of this system  are appropriate control of nuclear materials that are being  generated by the dismantling of nuclear weapons and increased  transparency in their use. The study group on the international  control of plutonium (chaired by Hiroyoshi Kurihara, a member of  the board of directors of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel  Development Corporation (PNC)), a research committee for the  director-general of STA's Nuclear Energy Bureau, drew up a basic  framework for the system and presented it as an interim report  to the Japan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) at the end of last  week. STA wants to continue studies through exchanges of views  with other countries and then complete the system.    According to STA, countries participating in this system  will  in principle be (1) countries that are dismantling nuclear  weapons, (2) countries that have nuclear weapons and carry out  commercial reprocessing, (3) countries that are implementing a  nuclear fuel cycle, and (4) countries that are using plutonium  and highly enriched uranium for research on peaceful use of  these substances.    Participating countries will register with the system all  the  plutonium and highly enriched uranium (over 10 enriched)  in  each facility. They will report to the system their utilization  plans; and they will get confirmation from a committee composed  of representatives from all participating countries. Plutonium  in excess of the utilization plans will be controlled in a  storage and control facility to be established by the  participating countries. Withdrawal of excess plutonium will be  via request by the owner country and will be within the scope of  its utilization plan. Also, the secretariat of the proposed  system will be a function of the secretariat of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Additionally, the plan is to create a multilateral study  forum composed of the IAEA and interested countries to work on  the creation of this system.     "

This is the conclusion of a report by the British American Security Information Council, an independent research organisation which analyses defence policy in Europe and North America, George Graham writes. The report warns that the UK's plans to upgrade its nuclear arsenal with modified US-built Trident II missiles, fitted with British warheads, are a hostage of the US nuclear debate. Planned British purchases of Trident II missiles could be called into question as a result of pressure in the US Congress to end production of unneeded Cold War weapons, while the UK's production of warheads remains heavily dependent on the US both for design and testing, the council says.

0,FT944-6824 ,"FT944-6824 _AN-EK1C5ACXFT 941128   FT  28 NOV 94 / A chip or two off the old barriers: Michael Smith explains why progress in opening up Europe's energy markets has been slow      By MICHAEL SMITH   Five years after launching a campaign to liberalise Europe's energy markets, the European Commission has made only limited progress in increasing competition among electricity and gas producers. Amid concern over the effects on consumers of dismantling what are in many cases state-owned monopolies, many energy companies have stubbornly resisted attempts to open up the market. Liberalising markets will be high on the agenda when European Union energy ministers meet in Brussels tomorrow. The Commission regards the creation of a free market in power and gas as one of the most important elements in creating a single market for goods and services. 'How can you ask, say, the chemicals or metals industries to compete without access to energy on similar conditions?' asks Mr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, director-general of the EU competition directorate. 'What is at stake is the credibility of the internal market and the competitiveness of European industry.' One reason for the slow progress in liberalising European energy markets is the relative lack of competitive or public pressure. The need to deregulate parts of the telecommunications market was clear to most EU member states, as technological changes made existing national and European regulations less relevant. And consumer pressure for cheaper air fares encouraged progress in the airlines industry. In the absence of such pressures, there are powerful lobbies against greater competition. National energy monopolies have encouraged their customers to believe that change in gas and electricity markets might threaten safe delivery of supplies and push up prices. To many consumers, the scope for competition looks limited because it makes no sense to have rival electricity grids and gas pipe networks. There is also opposition to change from the workforces in the gas and electricity companies, which amount to 1m people in the EU. Concern about potential job losses is heightened by the experience of the UK electricity market, one of the first to be deregulated, where some companies have shed more than half their staff. A single energy market would not necessarily break up large integrated monopolies. But it would remove their monopoly rights to gen-erate power and supply it to the customer. The Commission argues that such competition would make utilities more efficient: prices would fall and become more uniform across the Union. It has adopted a two-pronged approach for achieving this. The first prong involved forcing countries to end statutory monopolies enjoyed by national utilities to import and export gas and electricity, which the Commission says are illegal under EU law. Several cases are progressing through the courts, though none has yet concluded. The second prong is legislation to improve competition within member states. A proposed directive, first drafted in 1992, would require energy companies to 'unbundle' themselves, by separating the financial accounts of their production, transport and distribution arms. This would make it more difficult for these companies to subsidise loss-making parts of their businesses out of the profits from their monopoly over distribution of energy. New companies would then find it easier to enter the market, if they could see that they were able to undercut the energy utilities in particular parts of the business. The main stumbling block to agreement on the directive is what is known as 'third party access', obliging energy companies to allow competitors to use their networks for an 'appropriate' charge. Thus PowerGen, the privatised UK generator, could supply electricity to French industrial companies through the French national grid. Currently, if it wants to export to France, PowerGen can do this only by selling power to Electricite de France, the monopoly power company. Third-party access is opposed by most European power and gas companies, with the support of many members of the European Parliament and some of the larger governments. They argue that energy needs special protection from competition, because of the size of investment needed in the industries. Long-term planning would be more difficult if they were subjected to full competition, endangering security of supply, at a cost to at least some customers. There are also fears of cherry-picking - that large energy users might be picked off by foreign energy companies, leaving the national company with the less profitable users. In Italy there are fears that if other countries were to supply large energy users in the north, the poorer south could be left to shoulder the costs of the indigenous system. And companies in countries such as Germany and Belgium fear they could not compete with their counterparts in, say, France, because of different regulatory, taxation and social regimes. Some German companies say they are not against third-party access in principle, and are as efficient as their foreign competitors. But their prices are higher as a result of an obligation to buy expensive German coal. Similarly, Mr Michel Loncour, a strategy manager at Tractebel, the Belgian energy company, says that competition will be unfair if companies operate under different national rules: 'Europe needs harmonisation on issues like environmental protection, the security of nuclear plants, taxation, subsidies and the cost of capital,' he says. The Commission is currently considering a common energy policy for Europe, but agreement is politically difficult and some years away. That offers little immediate help in creating a free energy market. The Commission could consider formulating a final directive around the concessions already made by opponents of more reform. For instance, most countries would probably agree to unbundling the accounts of electricity monopolies and introduce competitive tendering for new plants. In an attempt to win agreement on third-party access, the Commission has agreed the idea of a 'negotiated', rather than automatic, right to access to power networks. This would allow host companies to refuse access on the grounds that security of supply could be threatened, with an arbitration system for disputes - a compromise that most of those in favour of liberalisation would consider accepting. However, opponents to reform think even 'negotiated third-party access' goes too far. Some, including the French, want to introduce a concept of a 'single buyer' as an alternative to third-party access. Under this arrangement, deals between electricity users and foreign suppliers would have to be reached through the host country's transmission system operator, which would be the sole purchaser of electricity supplies within that country. Reformers, already concerned about the concession on 'negotiated' third-party access, believe the single buyer concept would lead to little change. 'If too much is conceded, the introduction of competition could be logjammed for a decade,' says Mr John Baker, chief executive of the UK's National Power generation company. 'It may be preferable to wait three or four years, since a delay might enable them to get the important principles through.' Free-marketeers like Mr Baker believe that liberalisation is inevitable: increasingly, countries such as Italy, Spain and the Netherlands are starting to deregulate their energy industries. In Germany, once a strong opponent of change, supporters of third-party access include Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister. In addition, the Nordic countries that will join the EU next year are likely to support liberalisation, since they have already deregulated their energy markets. Nonetheless, the scale of opposition means that real progress on liberalisation could take years rather than months.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Negotiations will then  be needed to set the terms for its renewal. Admiral Marcel  Duvan was kind enough to carry out an analysis of  nonproliferation, of the treaty, of the concerns of different  nuclear and nonnuclear states, and finally of the prospects for  the future, particularly for our country. We are most grateful  to him for this very complete study. [passage omitted]    Future Prospects    Having taken stock of nonproliferation, the term hitherto  used to describe the totality of measures to prevent the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, let us now examine  its future prospects on the eve of its expiry in 1995. As for  the NPT itself, its indefinite renewal, which naturally is  desired by the nuclear powers, would require an affirmative vote  by 83 countries, since it is estimated that 165 countries will  then be party to it. As the general assumption is that 45  positive votes are guaranteed, those of at least 38 developing  countries will also have to be secured. The Conference of  Nonaligned States, which met in 1992, set the following  conditions for extending the treaty: the cessation of nuclear  tests; an end to the production of nuclear weapons;  implementation of the START treaties; and the total elimination  of these weapons by a given deadline. Furthermore, during the  conference to prepare the revision of the NPT, which took place  in May 1993, it appeared that many nonnuclear states, not all of  which were nonaligned states, will oppose indefinite extension  and may even propose a two-year trial period, at the end of  which their demands would have to be implemented through  international treaties.    We have seen that the United States has now decided to meet  most of these demands by proposing the conclusion of a treaty  totally banning nuclear tests, and of another prohibiting the  production of fissile materials for explosive use. For its  part, the United States has already declared a moratorium on its  tests until 1995, and stopped its production of fissile  materials, while also accepting international monitoring of its  stocks. In addition, it has ceased modernization of its nuclear  arsenal, since, for the first time for 50 years, it is no longer  running a nuclear program now that it has ceased further work on  its mobile strategic missile, and it canceled both its light  strategic missile program and its programs for new nuclear  warheads for its Trident submarine missiles and for new nuclear  missiles for its B2 bombers. It has also undertaken the  dismantling required by the START treaties, even though these  have not yet been ratified by the other parties. In the face of  this voluntary disarmament, some have wondered, analyzing  statements by Americans in senior positions, whether this did  not amount to a delegitimization by the United States of nuclear  weapons so as to derive maximum advantage from its undisputed  conventional superiority over any possible adversaries anywhere  in the world.    Nevertheless, problems may still arise with other  protagonists involved in the renewal of the NPT and the adoption  of any other planned nonproliferation agreements linked to it.  First, take the chaotic situation in the former Soviet Union,  which particularly raises, as has been seen, the problem of  Ukraine's adherence to the NPT. There will then remain the task  of dismantling those nuclear weapons affected by the START  treaty, which will take over 10 years and will require  considerable financial assistance, not to mention the  difficulties arising from the international monitoring of its  implementation. To these concerns we should add, mindful of the  Chernobyl catastrophe, those over the safety of nuclear plants  for peaceful purposes and over the possibility of subjecting  these plants to the controls which will inevitably be required  by a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for  weapons use. Finally, it is obvious that the degree to which all  these proposals are welcomed in 1995 will be primarily  influenced by the actions taken before this expiry by China, the  most ""proliferating"" state whose actions frequently differ from  its statements and which has the right of veto. It will also  depend on the behavior of the undeclared nuclear powers. In  other words, it will depend on Iraq's respect for its commitment  to accepting long-term monitoring of its disarmament; on the  outcome of the present confrontation over monitoring North  Korea's installations; regarding Israel and Iran, on the peace  process presently under way in the Middle East; while it may be  hoped that the mutual deterrence between India and Pakistan will  prevent their dispute over Kashmir from degenerating into open  war. History teaches us that disarmament of all kinds is far  more often a consequence of peace than the necessary  prerequisite for it. This means that the struggle to prevent  proliferation is undoubtedly far more of a political process,  particularly at a regional level, than a matter of preventive  technocratic measures. This does not imply that the latter have  no effect, even if it is only to do everything possible to avoid  the use of nuclear weapons in haste or in error, since, once the  ""nuclear taboo"" has been breached, they have failed in their  peacekeeping purpose.    Consequences for France    We now have to consider the consequences of all the above  for  France, which for the past 35 years has based its defense policy  on the peacekeeping effect of nuclear weapons, and has largely  based its foreign policy on the independence of its deterrent.  Thus, the ""French exception"" in this area will be particularly  challenged by the nonproliferation measures to be submitted in  1995 to the international community.    Of these, the major concern is obviously the total cessation  of nuclear tests, since this not only poses both for ourselves  and for others a threat to the safety of existing weapons, but  would also prevent us from developing new programs, even though  we presently have at least one major one under way, the M5,  which, by considerably increasing both range and performance, is  intended to give our ""new generation"" of nuclear-missile  launching submarines (SNLE) ""all-out"" capabilities. To this  technological constraint is added the psychological, and hence  political one, which is bound to challenge the two super powers'  previously announced renunciation of mobile strategic missiles  and multiple warheads, and of terrestrial and naval tactical  nuclear weapons. In contrast, the cessation of production of  fissile materials for explosive use would not appear to have any  major consequences for our defense, at least over the medium  term.    The increase in ""denuclearized zones"" would also seriously  limit the freedom of action of our nuclear submarines, as they  presently carry almost 90 percent of our nuclear deterrent  capability. If this process were to extend to Europe, following  the apparently conceivable withdrawal of U.S. airborne nuclear  capacity still deployed there, then this would put an end to the  possibility of eventually establishing a European deterrent.  For this reason, and also to finally frame a common policy in  this matter, it would be desirable to discuss all these  nonproliferation measures within the European Union, or, failing  this, on a Franco-British basis, as allowed by the recent  establishment of a Joint Commission on Nuclear Policy and  Doctrine. At the national level, it would also appear desirable  to reactivate the Council on Exterior Nuclear Relations, set up  in 1976 to respond to the concerns then beginning to be aroused  here by proliferation.    The survival of our national deterrent, together with the  need to consider establishing such a deterrent at the European  level, must be justified in terms of the effectiveness to be  expected of them in the face of threats which can be foreseen  over a fairly long term. In this respect, the threat emanating  from the still considerable nuclear arsenals located in the  territory of the former Soviet Union has in no way disappeared,  however unlikely any aggression by them appears at present. The  greatest danger is probably that of the possibility of these  nuclear weapons falling into the hands of groups of varying  degrees of responsibility, for whom the exercise of our  deterrent, backed up by the threat of massive reprisals, would  run the risk both of being unacceptable to international public  opinion, and of being ineffective. The same would apply, we  believe, to any ""troublemaker"" located outside Europe who, armed  with a few primitive weapons and suitable ballistic vehicles,  would hide in some kind of ""aggressive sanctuary,"" or even  perpetrated nuclear blackmail.    In the face of such possible threats, two schools of thought  are taking shape here. The first holds to the above doctrine,  restricting it to the instance of major aggression, actually  directed against our national territory, for which it feels the  present arsenal is adequate. The second considers there is a  need for a limited ""nuclear counterthreat,"" capable of  deployment overseas and intended to ""inhibit"" the destructive  capacity of a terrorist state, and if need be to ""decapitate""  it. This would require, in the view of this school, very  accurate mobile weapons with reduced collateral effects, with  adjustable power, and the capability to penetrate the ground,  and would thus mean new programs, and hence the need to carry  out tests. In contrast, a rapprochement seems to be emerging  between the two schools over the possible benefits, in the face  of these new threats, in possessing a system based on ballistic  theater antimissiles, or in other words a mobile system, even  though during the Cold War France was opposed to any global  system. Some consider that the disadvantage of establishing  such a system is that it could give the ""South"" the impression  that it is about to replace the ""East"" as the Western world's  enemy.    The expiry in 1995 will therefore force us to formulate a  view on all these matters. As for doctrines, we do not feel it  is desirable to specify too closely the future conditions in  which our nuclear deterrent could be used, or particularly to  say what will not be done, so as to keep all our options open.  It appears obvious that this deterrent will not be able to  remain the absolute priority it was during the Cold War; but, as  is amply proved by the present debates over nonproliferation and  also those over the future course of the Security Council, it  will certainly retain its political dimension. As it is no  longer possible to ""disinvent"" the nuclear weapon, France must  protect itself from its human know-how and its technical  capabilities in this area, as these are largely what will ensure  its future status as a ""major medium power,"" and, if necessary,  its survival if it were to be the object of any major aggression.

There is no need to  explain what a delay in transporting them to Russia for  dismantling and processing into nuclear fuel would lead to.  This was the subject discussed at a news conference in the  Russian Federation Defense Ministry. Colonel-General Yevgeniy  Maslin, Major Generals Anatoliy Lukyanov and Anatoliy Svetikov,  and also Boris Gorobets, spokesman for the Ministry of Atomic  Energy, spoke about the prospects of the agreement with Ukraine  on questions of dismantling nuclear weapons reached during the  meeting between Presidents Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, and  Leonid Kravchuk.    There are 176 missile-launchers currently deployed in  Ukraine  and around 40 heavy bombers, accounting for around 2,000 nuclear  weapons. Some of them are in a potentially dangerous  [predavariynom] state. It is vital to transport them to Russia  in the immediate future for dismantling.    Russia is prepared to do this. Although the relocation of  certain nuclear weapons is dangerous, it will carry out all the  commitments it assumed at the summit. By way of compensation  Russia will supply uranium for nuclear electric power stations  to Ukraine for 10 months.    What if the Ukrainian Supreme Council suddenly refuses to  ratify the Moscow agreements? This question was raised at the  news conference. The answer that was given maintained that the  agreement between the three presidents theoretically does not  need ratification.    Furthermore, the people in Ukraine who are involved in  handling [obsluzhuvaniye] nuclear munitions understand the full  danger of the prevailing situation and will take the necessary  measures to implement the agreement. However, there are  politicians in Ukraine who will oppose the implementation of the  agreement for the sake of achieving their own ends or to keep  their long-occupied posts. What may the non-implementation of  the agreements lead to? If Ukraine wants to become a nuclear  power, the UN Security Council must ratify this decision. It  will scarcely come out in favor of the expansion of the world  nuclear club. Clearly its expansion would have a domino effect.  It cannot be ruled out that the DPRK and other states prepared  to make nuclear weapons would want to join Ukraine.    So we will trust in the sensible attitude of the people who  decide the state's future.     "

Negotiations will then be  needed to set the terms for its renewal. Admiral Marcel Duvan  was kind enough to carry out an analysis of nonproliferation, of  the treaty, of the concerns of different nuclear and nonnuclear  states, and finally of the prospects for the future,  particularly for our country. We are most grateful to him for  this very complete study. [passage omitted]    Future Prospects    Having taken stock of nonproliferation, the term hitherto  used to describe the totality of measures to prevent the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, let us now examine  its future prospects on the eve of its expiry in 1995. As for  the NPT itself, its indefinite renewal, which naturally is  desired by the nuclear powers, would require an affirmative vote  by 83 countries, since it is estimated that 165 countries will  then be party to it. As the general assumption is that 45  positive votes are guaranteed, those of at least 38 developing  countries will also have to be secured. The Conference of  Nonaligned States, which met in 1992, set the following  conditions for extending the treaty: the cessation of nuclear  tests; an end to the production of nuclear weapons;  implementation of the START treaties; and the total elimination  of these weapons by a given deadline. Furthermore, during the  conference to prepare the revision of the NPT, which took place  in May 1993, it appeared that many nonnuclear states, not all of  which were nonaligned states, will oppose indefinite extension  and may even propose a two-year trial period, at the end of  which their demands would have to be implemented through  international treaties.    We have seen that the United States has now decided to meet  most of these demands by proposing the conclusion of a treaty  totally banning nuclear tests, and of another prohibiting the  production of fissile materials for explosive use. For its  part, the United States has already declared a moratorium on its  tests until 1995, and stopped its production of fissile  materials, while also accepting international monitoring of its  stocks. In addition, it has ceased modernization of its nuclear  arsenal, since, for the first time for 50 years, it is no longer  running a nuclear program now that it has ceased further work on  its mobile strategic missile, and it canceled both its light  strategic missile program and its programs for new nuclear  warheads for its Trident submarine missiles and for new nuclear  missiles for its B2 bombers. It has also undertaken the  dismantling required by the START treaties, even though these  have not yet been ratified by the other parties. In the face of  this voluntary disarmament, some have wondered, analyzing  statements by Americans in senior positions, whether this did  not amount to a delegitimization by the United States of nuclear  weapons so as to derive maximum advantage from its undisputed  conventional superiority over any possible adversaries anywhere  in the world.    Nevertheless, problems may still arise with other  protagonists involved in the renewal of the NPT and the adoption  of any other planned nonproliferation agreements linked to it.  First, take the chaotic situation in the former Soviet Union,  which particularly raises, as has been seen, the problem of  Ukraine's adherence to the NPT. There will then remain the task  of dismantling those nuclear weapons affected by the START  treaty, which will take over 10 years and will require  considerable financial assistance, not to mention the  difficulties arising from the international monitoring of its  implementation. To these concerns we should add, mindful of the  Chernobyl catastrophe, those over the safety of nuclear plants  for peaceful purposes and over the possibility of subjecting  these plants to the controls which will inevitably be required  by a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for  weapons use. Finally, it is obvious that the degree to which all  these proposals are welcomed in 1995 will be primarily  influenced by the actions taken before this expiry by China, the  most ""proliferating"" state whose actions frequently differ from  its statements and which has the right of veto. It will also  depend on the behavior of the undeclared nuclear powers. In  other words, it will depend on Iraq's respect for its commitment  to accepting long-term monitoring of its disarmament; on the  outcome of the present confrontation over monitoring North  Korea's installations; regarding Israel and Iran, on the peace  process presently under way in the Middle East; while it may be  hoped that the mutual deterrence between India and Pakistan will  prevent their dispute over Kashmir from degenerating into open  war. History teaches us that disarmament of all kinds is far  more often a consequence of peace than the necessary  prerequisite for it. This means that the struggle to prevent  proliferation is undoubtedly far more of a political process,  particularly at a regional level, than a matter of preventive  technocratic measures. This does not imply that the latter have  no effect, even if it is only to do everything possible to avoid  the use of nuclear weapons in haste or in error, since, once the  ""nuclear taboo"" has been breached, they have failed in their  peace-keeping purpose.    Consequences for France    We now have to consider the consequences of all the above  for  France, which for the past 35 years has based its defense policy  on the peace-keeping effect of nuclear weapons, and has largely  based its foreign policy on the independence of its deterrent.  Thus, the ""French exception"" in this area will be particularly  challenged by the nonproliferation measures to be submitted in  1995 to the international community.    Of these, the major concern is obviously the total cessation  of nuclear tests, since this not only poses both for ourselves  and for others a threat to the safety of existing weapons, but  would also prevent us from developing new programs, even though  we presently have at least one major one under way, the M5,  which, by considerably increasing both range and performance, is  intended to give our ""new generation"" of nuclear-missile  launching submarines (SNLE) ""all-out"" capabilities. To this  technological constraint is added the psychological, and hence  political one, which is bound to challenge the two super powers'  previously-announced renunciation of mobile strategic missiles  and multiple warheads, and of terrestrial and naval tactical  nuclear weapons. In contrast, the cessation of production of  fissile materials for explosive use would not appear to have any  major consequences for our defense, at least over the medium  term.    The increase in ""denuclearized zones"" would also seriously  limit the freedom of action of our nuclear submarines, as they  presently carry almost 90 percent of our nuclear deterrent  capability. If this process were to extend to Europe, following  the apparently conceivable withdrawal of U.S. airborne nuclear  capacity still deployed there, then this would put an end to the  possibility of eventually establishing a European deterrent.  For this reason, and also to finally frame a common policy in  this matter, it would be desirable to discuss all these  nonproliferation measures within the European Union, or, failing  this, on a Franco-British basis, as allowed by the recent  establishment of a ""Joint Commission on Nuclear Policy and  Doctrine."" At the national level, it would also appear  desirable to reactivate the ""Council on Exterior Nuclear  Relations,"" set up in 1976 to respond to the concerns then  beginning to be aroused here by proliferation.    The survival of our national deterrent, together with the  need to consider establishing such a deterrent at the European  level, must be justified in terms of the effectiveness to be  expected of them in the face of threats which can be foreseen  over a fairly long term. In this respect, the threat emanating  from the still considerable nuclear arsenals located in the  territory of the former Soviet Union has in no way disappeared,  however unlikely any aggression by them appears at present. The  greatest danger is probably that of the possibility of these  nuclear weapons falling into the hands of groups of varying  degrees of responsibility, for whom the exercise of our  deterrent, backed up by the threat of massive reprisals, would  run the risk both of being unacceptable to international public  opinion, and of being ineffective. The same would apply, we  believe, to any ""troublemaker"" located outside Europe who, armed  with a few primitive weapons and suitable ballistic vehicles,  would hide in some kind of ""aggressive sanctuary,"" or even  perpetrated nuclear blackmail.    In the face of such possible threats, two schools of thought  are taking shape here. The first holds to the above doctrine,  restricting it to the instance of major aggression, actually  directed against our national territory, for which it feels the  present arsenal is adequate. The second considers there is a  need for a limited ""nuclear counterthreat,"" capable of  deployment overseas and intended to ""inhibit"" the destructive  capacity of a terrorist state, and if need be to ""decapitate""  it. This would require, in the view of this school, very  accurate mobile weapons with reduced collateral effects, with  adjustable power, and the capability to penetrate the ground,  and would thus mean new programs, and hence the need to carry  out tests. In contrast, a rapprochement seems to be emerging  between the two schools over the possible benefits, in the face  of these new threats, in possessing a system based on ballistic  theater antimissiles, or in other words a mobile system, even  though during the Cold War France was opposed to any global  system. Some consider that the disadvantage of establishing  such a system is that it could give the ""South"" the impression  that it is about to replace the ""East"" as the Western world's  enemy.    The expiry in 1995 will therefore force us to formulate a  view on all these matters. As for doctrines, we do not feel it  is desirable to specify too closely the future conditions in  which our nuclear deterrent could be used, or particularly to  say what will not be done, so as to keep all our options open.  It appears obvious that this deterrent will not be able to  remain the absolute priority it was during the Cold War; but, as  is amply proved by the present debates over nonproliferation and  also those over the future course of the Security Council, it  will certainly retain its political dimension. As it is no  longer possible to ""disinvent"" the nuclear weapon, France must  protect itself from its human know-how and its technical  capabilities in this area, as these are largely what will ensure  its future status as a ""major medium power,"" and, if necessary,  its survival if it were to be the object of any major aggression.

(JAIF) (Chairman, Takashi Mukaibo) held in Hiroshima  ended on 15th. During the three-day conference, it became  obvious that Japan and Europe are anxious and the United States  is critical toward commercial use of plutonium. Both Japanese  and European officials involved in nuclear power activities  countered with evidence of inadequate non-proliferation measures  in the U.S. The JAIF emphasized non-proliferation issues  through the meeting which was held at the site where the first  atomic bomb was dropped. The meeting also produced reassurance  of `cooperation' between Japan and Europe in the use of  plutonium, an issue which has become critical with the  achievement of criticality at the prototype `Monju' fast breeder  reactor.    The meeting featured a session on `Nuclear Power Generation  and Plutonium' during which the pros and cons of the commercial  use of plutonium were vigorously debated.    C. E. Paine, a senior staff member of the American Natural  Resources Protection Association stated, `It is a fact that  nuclear bombs can be produced with plutonium generated by  nuclear reactors.' He objected to the separation of plutonium  from spent nuclear fuel by saying, `If plutonium stockpiles  increase, it is difficult for nuclear inspectors to keep up with  their job.'    On the other hand, Atomic Energy Bureau' s Nuclear Fuel  Division Director Yasutaka Moriguchi of the Science and  Technology Agency, criticized the direct disposal of spent fuel  by the U.S. saying, `Plutonium mines will be created.'    Cogema Vice President J. L. Rikoh [phonetic] from France was  obviously displeased with the U.S. Government and said, `If the  U.S. does not like the separation of plutonium, they should stop  exporting uranium.    Belgium nuclear fuel company Cynatom [phonetic]'s Special  Advisor P. Felbeek [phonetic] indicated inadequate U.S.  non-proliferation measures saying, `Japan and Europe are not the  cause for concern. The problem lies in the United States which  lacks definite safety measures for its militarily used  plutonium.' He insisted that the plutonium gained as a result  of dismantling nuclear weapons `should be mixed with uranium  fuel and burned in reactors, from the economic perspective.'    Mitsubishi Materials Vice President Isami Akimoto said,  `there are neither facilities nor personnel left in the U.S.'  even if they wanted to burn the plutonium obtained through  dismantling of nuclear weapons. He also stated, `The  traditional policy of the U.S. for elimination of plutonium for  use in peaceful nuclear power generation has failed.'    In response to these comments, U.S. Nuclear Management  Research Insistute Director P. Rebensol [phonetic] (general  participant), who opposes the use of plutonium by Japan  proposed, It is not necessary to use plutonium if enriched  uranium obtained through dismantling of nuclear weapons is  reserved for later use. However, Tokyo Electric Power Company  Vice President Makoto Ikegame arugued, `Uranium is a buyers'  market. Therefore, it is not necessary to create reserves. It  is not even worth considering such a proposal unless there is  some specific measure planned (after the uranium researve is  used).'    STA' s Moriguchi also opposed the uranium reserve proposal  saying, `It represents short sighted thinking.' Differences in  focus between Japan, where plutonium has a place in their  long-term energy strategy, and the U.S., which is most concerned  with the negative impact of what they consider the immediate  threat of nuclear proliferation, were obvious.    Hiroshima Declaration of Non-Proliferation Treaty    On the 15th, the final day of their annual meeting, the JAIF  adopted the `Hiroshima Declaration' which appeals for the  elimination of nuclear weapons. The declaration included the  statement that `indefinite extension without any general future  perspective on the elimination of nuclear weapons is  problematic' for extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  . The declaration contrasted with the Japanese Government' s  position in support of indefinite extension of the NPT. It may  have some impact on future discussions of the NPT extension  issue.    During the press conference after the meeting, JAIF Chairman  Takashi Mukaibo said, `Our main objective is to eliminate all  nuclear weapons. We cannot agree to indefinite extension of the  NPT while those who own nuclear weapons do not eliminate them.'    Former Prime Minister Hosokawa supported indefinite  extension  of the NPT at the UN General Session in September 1993. He  obviously tried to eradicate the `groundless suspicion' of Japan  owning nuclear arms. The JAIF reiterated their demand that  nuclear weapon owning countries eliminate them.     "

He highly assessed an agreement on the removal of nuclear  weapons from the Ukrainian territory, signed by the three  presidents. Maslin reminded of the fact that talks on this  problem had been going on since 1992 and it was only now that  the talks came to a logical end.    Maslin informed journalists that currently, there are 176  launching installations of intercontinental ballistic missiles  (IBM) in Ukraine, including 130 installations of SS-19 type and  46 of SS-24 type. There are also around 40 heavy bombers Tu-160  and Tu-95 capable of launching air-based long-range cruise  missiles. The overall number of warheads stationed in Ukraine  includes 1,300 warheads for IBM and over 600 warheads for  air-based cruise missiles.    In the opinion of the military expert, nuclear safety in  Ukraine causes permanent concern of experts. According to  Maslin, ammunition depots are overloaded with warheads and  nuclear ammunition removed from combat alert, which resulted in  a considerable increase of the radiation level. This was  confirmed by experts of the Russian nuclear centre ""Arzamas-15""  who visited Ukraine in September, 1993.    The designed life of the majority of warheads has expired,  while maintenance preventive checks had not been carried out and  some missiles are currently in a critical condition. As an  example, Maslin mentioned three nuclear warheads which had to be  hastily removed from the Ukrainian territory as they were in a  critical condition. It is difficult to say how many hazardous  warheads are in Ukraine yet because there is a lack of experts  exercising control over the safety of nuclear weapons, Maslin  said.

He highly assessed an agreement on the removal of nuclear  weapons from the Ukrainian territory, signed by the three  presidents. Maslin reminded of the fact that talks on this  problem had been going on since 1992 and it was only now that  the talks came to a logical end.    Maslin informed journalists that currently, there are 176  launching installations of intercontinental ballistic missiles  (IBM) in Ukraine, including 130 installations of SS-19 type and  46 of SS- 24 type. There are also around 40 heavy bombers  Tu-160 and Tu-95 capable of launching air-based long-range  cruise missiles. The overall number of warheads stationed in  Ukraine includes 1,300 warheads for IBM and over 600 warheads  for air-based cruise missiles.    In the opinion of the military expert, nuclear safety in  Ukraine causes permanent concern of experts. According to  Maslin. Ammunition depots are overloaded with warheads and  nuclear ammunition removed from combat alert, which resulted in  a considerable increase of the radiation level. This was  confirmed by experts of the Russian nuclear centre  ``Arzamas-15'' who visited Ukraine in September, 1993.    The designed life of the majority of warheads has expired,  while maintenance preventive checks had not been carried out and  some missiles are currently in a critical condition. As an  example, Maslin mentioned three nuclear warheads which had to be  hastily removed from the Ukrainian territory as they were in a  critical condition. It is difficult to say how many hazardous  warheads are in Ukraine yet because there is a lack of experts  exercising control over the safety of nuclear weapons, Maslin  said.    The expert pointed out that any delay in removing and  dismantling nuclear weapons is inadmissible since it is fraught  with unpredictable consequences. However, there are still  people in the republic who either do not realise this or are  deliberately playing out ``the nuclear card,'' he said.    Maslin pointed out that Russian experts can give ukraine  guarantees of safety of all operations in the process of removal  and utilization of strategic weapons.     "

Last year US aid to Kazakhstan was Dollars 91m. Mr Clinton, at a news conference with Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, promised the aid after Mr Nazarbayev presented him with papers documenting his country's decision in December to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. He said he was prepared to extend another Dollars 85m this year and in 1995 to help Kazakhstan dismantle a nuclear arsenal left on its territory after the collapse of the Soviet empire two years ago. Mr Nazarbayev told Mr Clinton his country wanted to join Nato's Partnership for Peace, which offers former Soviet satellites military ties to the western alliance but not full membership. Senior US officials lauded Kazakhstan as doing more toward market reform than any of the former Soviet republics.   Countries:-  KZZ  Kazakhstan, East Europe.

Deadline for Their Destruction May Not Be Met""]    [Text] Saratov Oblast -- Around now a terminal was to have  been built on the banks of the Volga in Saratov Oblast to strip  out [peretarivaniye] chemical agents from their containers  [yemkosti] and subsequently detoxify them. That at least is  what the draft first stage of the state program for the  destruction of chemical weapons envisages. However, local  residents, worried by leaks at stores that have been here a long  time, have sounded the alarm and are objecting to new  installations with this kind of specialism.    Russia's president signed the Paris Convention on the  Prohibition of Chemical Weapons a year ago, in January 1993.  According to the Convention, the first installation for the  destruction of chemical agents must be tested within two years  at most. Half this time has already elapsed and Russia still  has no laws, no concept, no approved state program for chemical  weapons destruction. Meanwhile leaks of poisonous substances  from containers that have eroded have been recorded at the  arsenal sited on the territory of Saratov Oblast.    The village of Gornyy, where 690 tonnes of mustard gas, 225  tonnes of lewisite, and 210 tonnes of their compounds are  stored, is not far from the Volga. The chemical weapons that  have been here for ages, packed in metal barrels and railroad  tankers, pose a potential danger.    The strength of the harmful chemicals will be reduced by a  factor of 1,000-10,000 when the chemical agents are stripped out  at the new terminal. The plan is to reprocess the reactive  matter obtained in Shikhany, 100 km from Gornyy, where the  top-secret State Institute of Organic Synthesis Technology  [SIOST], which developed chemical weapons in the recent past, is  located.    Doctor of Sciences Aleksandr Kochergin, the institute's  director, said that several technologies have been developed for  the destruction of the stocks from the arsenal in Gornyy.  Whereas the situation is clear with regard to the mustard gas,  a choice has not yet been made with regard to the lewisite and  its compounds. In the opinion of SIOST scientists, the most  preferable option is for this kind of chemical agent to be  recycled [utilizatsiya] since it contains costly arsenic used in  microelectronics, laser technology, optics, and pharmaceuticals.  In other words, the recycling technology presupposes not only  expenditure on chemical weapons destruction but also  considerable income from the reprocessing of chemical agents  into particularly pure arsenic, which Russia does not currently  produce.    This technology can also be used to recycle  arsenic-containing adamsite -- an irritant chemical agent  produced early this century, which has been shipped to Shikhany  from throughout the former Union -- of which more than 8,000  tonnes have been buried straight in the ground at the testing  range of the military institute next to SIOST. The huge Russian  adamsite dump is a source of great worry not only to the public  but also to scientists, who are voicing misgivings over the  possible environmental contamination from these stocks.    It may seem to the uninitiated that there are no particular  problems with the destruction of the Saratov arsenal. It is  only the choice of technology and the construction of a terminal  and recycling installations that are holding things up.  However, one must not forget that we are talking about chemical  weapons, which are to be destroyed in densely populated areas  right next to the Volga. This is a very sensitive subject for  the residents of the area since the environmental background  here is unfavorable enough as it is. In the city of Volsk, for  instance, which is no more than 5 km from Shikhany as the crow  flies, the arsenic content in the soil is already several times  in excess of the maximum permissible concentrations owing to  three local cement plants using so-called pyrite cinders, which  contain arsenic, in their manufacturing process.

0," LA071889-0105   83631    July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 1; Foreign Desk      965 words      BUSH WELCOMED BY DUTCH, CALLS FOR EAST-WEST UNITY      By JAMES GERSTENZANG, Times Staff Writer      LEIDEN, the Netherlands      President Bush, given a fond, friendly welcome Monday in the Dutch town that  sheltered the Pilgrims before they reached America, saluted the lessening of  tensions across Europe and said the West now has the opportunity ""to integrate  the Soviet Union into the community of nations.""    ""The challenge we face is clear: We must work together toward the day when all  of Europe -- East and West -- is free of discord, free of division,"" Bush said,  speaking from the pulpit of the Pieterskerk, a towering brick church dedicated  in 1121.    In an address to the citizens of Leiden, a storybook town of small shops,  narrow streets and the ubiquitous canals of coastal Holland on the North Sea,  Bush offered an optimistic view of East-West relations on the next-to-last day  of a 10-day trip to Poland, Hungary, France and the Netherlands. He is due back  in Washington today.    ""We will play a constructive role in Eastern Europe's economic development, in  the development of political pluralism -- and in creating an international  climate in which reform can succeed,"" the President pledged, to an audience  that included Queen Beatrix and her husband, Prince Claus.    ""Improved relations with the U.S.S.R. reduce pressure on the nations of Eastern  Europe -- especially those on the cutting edge of reform,"" Bush said, adding:  ""The new world we seek is a commonwealth of free nations working in concert, a  world where more and more nations enter a widening circle of freedom.""    He said that ""the Soviet Union has nothing to fear from the reforms that are  now unfolding in some of the nations of Eastern Europe."" He pledged to follow  ""a carefully calibrated approach"" in addressing the needs of the political and  economic reform that has been the focus of his journey.    The visit to the Netherlands, during which Bush also conferred in The Hague,  the seat of government, with Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, was the first by an  American President.    It was viewed as an opportunity to thank the Dutch for the political support  they have provided in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, supporting U.S.  efforts to build up NATO military hardware at a time when much of Western  Europe has balked.    The President's arrival turned Leiden, the birthplace of the Dutch master  Rembrandt, into a well-mannered carnival, with the blue-, white- and  red-striped Dutch flag displayed with the American flag throughout the town,  local residents lining the streets and small knots of demonstrators mixing  their protest signs with less-political messages.    Thus, one group attacked funding for the anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua,  another criticized the President's anti-abortion stand and another banner  stretched across his motorcade route read ""Buy Your Wood Shoes Over Here, Mr.  President.""    ""We are a small country, but we do occupy ourselves with a lot of problems in  the whole world,"" said a Dutch tourist office aide.    Leiden, which its mayor, G. H. Goekoop, said lies ""in the middle of the world  -- between Amsterdam and Rotterdam, London and Berlin, Washington and Moscow,""  has a history to match the message of the President's address.    In 1609, the Pilgrims settled here in their flight from religious persecution  in England. They remained until 1620, when they sailed to the New World.    ""We believe that the American reality began right here, began when the Pilgrims  asked for refuge,"" the mayor said in his introduction of Bush.    It was in Leiden that the United Provinces of the Netherlands were founded in  1579, becoming the first democratic form of government here. And its bill of  rights, written in 1609, led it to become a haven for political refugees -- a  reputation it holds to this day.      Refuge From Nazi Occupiers    During World War II, Bush pointed out, ""behind these walls above the rafters,  Resistance fighters, university students, took refuge from the forces of (Nazi)  occupation and found safe haven in this church.""    The dramatic history of the church fed the emotion of the moment, as did the  brief recital by the Bach Chorus of Holland and the Amsterdam Chamber Orchestra  of the J. S. Bach cantata ""Softly flow with gentle murmurings, you rippling  waves,"" a unique introduction for a presidential speech on East-West relations.    The President, who has grown increasingly optimistic in his remarks about  Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union as his trip progressed, told his audience  here that ""today, as when the Pilgrims left this city, a new world lies within  our reach.""

""The challenge we face is clear: We must work together toward the day when all  of Europe -- East and West -- is free of discord, free of division,"" Bush said,  speaking from the pulpit of the Pieterskerk, a towering brick church dedicated  in 1121.    In an address to the citizens of Leiden, a storybook town of small shops,  narrow streets and the ubiquitous canals of coastal Holland on the North Sea,  Bush offered an optimistic view of East-West relations on the next-to-last day  of a 10-day trip to Poland, Hungary, France and the Netherlands. He is due back  in Washington today.    ""We will play a constructive role in Eastern Europe's economic development, in  the development of political pluralism -- and in creating an international  climate in which reform can succeed,"" the President pledged, to an audience  that included Queen Beatrix and her husband, Prince Claus.    ""Improved relations with the U.S.S.R. reduce pressure on the nations of Eastern  Europe -- especially those on the cutting edge of reform,"" Bush said, adding:  ""The new world we seek is a commonwealth of free nations working in concert, a  world where more and more nations enter a widening circle of freedom.""    He said that ""the Soviet Union has nothing to fear from the reforms that are  now unfolding in some of the nations of Eastern Europe."" He pledged to follow  ""a carefully calibrated approach"" in addressing the needs of the political and  economic reform that has been the focus of his journey.    The visit to the Netherlands, during which Bush also conferred in The Hague,  the seat of government, with Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, was the first by an  American President.    It was viewed as an opportunity to thank the Dutch for the political support  they have provided in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, supporting U.S.  efforts to build up NATO military hardware at a time when much of Western  Europe has balked.    The President's arrival turned Leiden, the birthplace of the Dutch master  Rembrandt, into a well-mannered carnival, with the blue-, white- and  red-striped Dutch flag displayed with the American flag throughout the town,  local residents lining the streets and small knots of demonstrators mixing  their protest signs with less-political messages.    Thus, one group attacked funding for the anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua,  another criticized the President's anti-abortion stand and another banner  stretched across his motorcade route read ""Buy Your Wood Shoes Over Here, Mr.  President.""    ""We are a small country, but we do occupy ourselves with a lot of problems in  the whole world,"" said a Dutch tourist office aide.    Leiden, which its mayor, G. H. Goekoop, said lies ""in the middle of the world  -- between Amsterdam and Rotterdam, London and Berlin, Washington and Moscow,""  has a history to match the message of the President's address.    In 1609, the Pilgrims settled here in their flight from religious persecution  in England. They remained until 1620, when they sailed to the New World.    ""We believe that the American reality began right here, began when the Pilgrims  asked for refuge,"" the mayor said in his introduction of Bush.    It was in Leiden that the United Provinces of the Netherlands were founded in  1579, becoming the first democratic form of government here. And its bill of  rights, written in 1609, led it to become a haven for political refugees -- a  reputation it holds to this day.      Refuge From Nazi Occupiers    During World War II, Bush pointed out, ""behind these walls above the rafters,  Resistance fighters, university students, took refuge from the forces of (Nazi)  occupation and found safe haven in this church.""    The dramatic history of the church fed the emotion of the moment, as did the  brief recital by the Bach Chorus of Holland and the Amsterdam Chamber Orchestra  of the J. S. Bach cantata ""Softly flow with gentle murmurings, you rippling  waves,"" a unique introduction for a presidential speech on East-West relations.    The President, who has grown increasingly optimistic in his remarks about  Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union as his trip progressed, told his audience  here that ""today, as when the Pilgrims left this city, a new world lies within  our reach.""    ""Our hope is that the unnatural division of Europe will now come to an end --  that the Europe behind the wall will join its neighbors to the West, prosperous  and free,"" he said.

0,FT922-8436 ,"FT922-8436 _AN-CEMBDADZFT 920513   FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (13): Much illness linked to pollution - After decades of environmental abuse, drastic reforms are needed      By JUDY DEMPSEY   EDWARD CRANKSHAW once published a set of essays entitled: 'Putting Up with the Russians.' But perhaps now, since massive military-industrial cities have been opened to the outside world, a subtitle could be added to the book: 'What the Russians put up with.' Apart from the appalling state apparatus of fear and coercion which kept this vast country together, the Russians endured decades of ill-health, not only caused by malnutrition, but by the pollution and radio-active waste which devastated large parts of Russia. A visit to any large city in the Urals confirms what independent-minded scientists knew for many years. Compared to west European levels where the average life expectancy is 76 years, Russia's level has fallen to 69 years over a period of 20 years. Experts, including Prof. Alexey Yablokov, President Yeltsin's advisor on ecology and public health policy, says over 40 per cent of illnesses are connected with the environment. In Chelyabinsk, a city earmarked by Stalin in 1929 to forge ahead with the arms race, people constantly complain of headaches. The most common operations performed by the local hospital are for heart-related diseases. The military-industrial complex is one of the roots of the country's enviromental problems. There are many others. The absence of public accountability meant that enterprise managers, regardless of fictional legal penalties, could dump radio-active waste in the rivers and lakes. Indeed, in the suburbs of Moscow, scientists say the dumping of radio active waste has, and will continue, to affect the health of the capital's citizens. These same scientists are hoping that the revolution affecting the economy will also have a beneficial affect on the environment. But in addressing the problems of the environment, where does one start? The accident at the power plant in Chernobyl, April 1986, provided the first tentative step towards galvanising public opinion against the poor safety standards of these RBMK reactors. Mr Yablokov believes that all sixteen of the RMBK reactors which are of the Chernobyl-type, should be closed down, immediately. The problem is that since these reactors provide about 12 per cent of Russia's total energy needs, any immediate shut-down would lead to a shortfall in energy supplies. But Mr Viktor Danilov Danilan, Russia's ecology and resources minister, admits that his country's use of energy is inefficient. Not only are prices still low; waste is phenomenal. 'We lose between 10 and 15 per cent of our oil and gas in the pipes, of which many are leaking. We lose about 25bn cubic metres of gas a year. I am sure the real losses are more considerable. They could amount to 30 per cent of our total energy supplies,' he explains. He and other energy specialists also bemoan the fact that households cannot monitor their own energy consumption. Not only is the idea of a thermostat non-existent in most Russian homes. But energy supplies to the domestic consumer are centrally-controlled - normally by the local district council. Mr Danilov-Danilan's office had its own, if not uncommon, thermostat: the window. The ministry estimates that a sum of Dollars 10bn could enable Russia's energy supplies to become more efficient, and modernised. This could also allow the sixteen RBMK plants to be closed down. But in a country committed to holding down public expenditure, Mr Danilov-Danilan is not optimistic. 'I asked the Russian government to allocate to our ministry 2 per cent of the credits we will receive from the international community,' he adds. He is still waiting for a reply. Mr Yablokov, a ceaseless campaigner on the environment over the years says he is in a more fortunate position because he has the ear of Mr Yeltsin. He says that Mr Yeltsin, since coming to office, has already issued six decrees related to the environment. In practice, this means very little. The giant engine of the military-industrial complex, particularly in the Urals, is not yet, nor will it, grind to a halt. So any reductions in arms production will not have an immediate affect on the environment. Moreover, a committment to dismantling Russia's vast arsenal of tactical and nuclear weapons offers nightmares as well as hope for the environment. Defence experts in Moscow recall how, as part of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed between the US and the former Soviet Union, dozens of tactical weapons were exploded in Kazakhstan. 'I dare to ask what this did to the environment,' commented one senior Russian defence analyst. In the meantime, Mr Yablokov is campaigning for three things: identifying 'zones of ecological disaster,' creating national parks; and making the water in Moscow and other cities clean enough to drink. The many maps on his office wall - a splendid room overlooking the Kremlin - bear testimony to many of these zones which are scattered throughout Russia and the republics of the former Soviet Union. Mr Yablokov wants all nuclear testing, and other experiments, stopped. Setting up national parks, he believes, would give the earth time to overcome the decades of abuse. His account of the pesticides and chemicals which have destroyed Russia's forests and lakes are well-known. That fact also explains the sorry nature of the water supplies. 'For us, the ozone layer is academic. The big issue is the quality of our drinking water,' said Mr Yablokov. Some western financial institutions are carrying out studies on ways to clean up Moscow's water system. A new water network would, among other things, involve ripping out the worn 19th century sewerage pipes and replacing lead pipes. But the root of the problem would not be resolved: stopping waste from being poured into the republic's rivers and lakes. 'We do not expect miracles overnight,' said Mr Yablokov, adding: 'it will take years to improve our environment - maybe 20. But we have to start today, otherwise the next generation will have nothing to inherit.'  The Financial Times   London Page IX  "

0,FT921-11322 ,"FT921-11322 _AN-CBBAAAAPFT 920201   FT  01 FEB 92 / Superpowers move the winning post: The arms race may have gone into reverse, but more nations think they need a nuclear deterrent      By EDWARD MORTIMER   The nuclear arms race, as we knew it, between the superpowers is no more. In fact, it has gone into reverse. This renders obsolete the process of arms control as we knew it, since that was concerned essentially with regulating the arms race. Arms control started from the assumption that there were two superpowers, mutually hostile and suspicious, whose only common interest lay in avoiding the destruction or irremediable pollution of the planet on which both were obliged, until further notice, to live. Only in 1987, with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, did arms control produce an agreement requiring the actual destruction of existing weapons: in fact, of an entire category of missiles. What made that possible was the discovery made by the Soviet Union, when it found the arms race running beyond what its economy could sustain, that security is not a zero-sum game. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev recognised that the Soviet Union's security problems were at least partly of its own making, since its military preparations had made Nato countries feel insecure and prompted them to respond in kind. This discovery reversed the assumption which drives all arms races, namely that whatever one side does to increase its own security makes it easier for it to contemplate an attack on the other. Followed to its logical conclusion, Mr Gorbachev's discovery makes arms control unnecessary: if each side realises that it can best enhance its own security by dismantling those weapons which most threaten the other, then it will do so without having to be constrained by detailed agreements. All it needs is a general conviction that the other side has got the message and is behaving similarly. In the end the very concept of 'sides' becomes irrelevant. That is precisely what is now happening. The upward spiral in nuclear weapons has been replaced by a downward one. It has not yet gone down to the point where smaller nuclear powers like the UK and France are obliged to join in. Their forces, as Russian President Boris Yeltsin admitted after a tutorial on the subject at 10 Downing Street on Thursday, are still 'not comparable' with those of the superpowers. But Mr Yeltsin was perhaps too generous in adding that 'therefore the matter is not really worth any discussion'. There is already discussion in Washington, no longer regarded as purely academic, about the floor level at which US nuclear weapons should ultimately be stabilised. In this discussion it is assumed that Russia is now willing to match any cuts that the US decides on. Therefore the size of other countries' forces become a relevant consideration. One school of thought holds that the US should not allow its arsenal to fall below 5,000 warheads, on the grounds that it must, in order to maintain its superpower status, have a larger number than Britain, France and China combined. Every nuclear power is obliged to rethink its position in this new strategic context. What does it have nuclear weapons for? How many does it need, and of what type? How many nuclear powers will there be, and what kind of threat will they pose? Probably no political or military leader, since General Douglas MacArthur in the Korean war, has wanted actually to fire nuclear weapons at an enemy. Their usefulness, if any, is as a deterrent. The 'war-fighting strategies' which caused so much alarm in the early 1980s were not expressions of desire or intent. They were contingency plans, designed to make nuclear deterrence more credible - the theory being that the adversary will not be deterred unless he believes the danger of nuclear retaliation is real; that he will not believe so unless the putative retaliator has a credible plan of retaliation; and that no such plan is credible unless it provides for the survival, in some shape or form, of the society on whose behalf it is made. Even Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is unlikely to have been developing nuclear weapons with a positive determination to use them. It is now known that, in the late 1970s, he took trouble to procure and study the writings of General Andre Gallois, theoretician of France's nuclear force de frappe. The essence of General Gallois's theory is that possession of nuclear weapons enables a state to make its national territory an invulnerable 'sanctuary', which no one will dare to attack. Mr Saddam probably hoped to achieve this for Iraq, thereby enabling him to wage conventional war against his neighbours at relatively low risk. It is fortunate for those neighbours that in the end he found himself unable to wait until his nuclear umbrella was in place before launching his attack on Kuwait. The example of Saddam Hussein is useful because it illustrates both the reasons why a state may wish to deploy nuclear weapons, even though it has no desire to use them. It may want to deter an attack on its own territory by superior conventional forces; or it may want to counteract the advantage gained by another state which has nuclear weapons. Whatever Mr Saddam's real intentions, his public justification for having a nuclear programme - a valid one in the eyes of the Arab public - is that Israel should not be allowed a nuclear monopoly in the Middle East. Again, this does not mean that Arabs generally believe Israel would use nuclear weapons against them for the fun of it, so to speak. No matter how callous one imagines the Israelis could be, it is clear that they could expect no positive benefit from nuclear war. But the fact that Israel is universally believed (despite its occasional pro forma denials) to have nuclear weapons does put it at an advantage vis-a-vis the Arabs in conventional war, and hence also in diplomacy. Israelis would see that as necessary to ensure their survival, given Arab numerical superiority. But Arabs see it as enabling Israel to humiliate them, notably by holding on to occupied territory, with impunity. No state likes to be at that kind of disadvantage in a dispute with its neighbour. Now consider the case of western Europe. The historic justification for having nuclear weapons there has been the need to deter an attack by superior conventional forces, specifically those of the Soviet Union. This applied to Nato, and also to France's independent strike force. Nato's 'flexible response' doctrine meant, in essence, that it sought always to maintain a credible option of nuclear retaliation if its conventional forces seemed about to be overfore Nato always firmly rejected suggestions that it should make any kind of pledge, even a reciprocal one, not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, replying simply that it would not be the aggressor. France disliked 'flexible response', not because it implied being the first to use nuclear weapons but, on the contrary, because it implied that a nuclear war might be survivable. While Nato strategy sought to make the nuclear deterrent more credible by limiting its initial impact, French strategy sought to make it more awesome by stressing its apocalyptic character. It was based on a simple syllogism: nuclear war is unthinkable; any war in Europe will be a nuclear one; ergo, war in Europe is unthinkable. Thus French literature on the subject tends almost to deify nuclear weapons as a phenomenon which has saved Europe from the demons of war which so ravaged it in the past. That was broadly also the view of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, although less dithyrambically expressed. The Americans were always more ambivalent on the subject, since for them the proposition that Armageddon was worth risking to avoid conventional defeat in Europe had less obvious attractions. A non-nuclear world was one they could more comfortably contemplate. Indeed, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed it as his objective when he launched his Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), and came close to agreeing on it with Mr Gorbachev at Reykjavik in 1986. Now that the Soviet Union has disintegrated, and the fear of Russian conventional forces overrunning western Europe has vanished, it has become much harder for Nato to justify retaining an option to use nuclear weapons first. Nato's New Strategic Concept, published at last November's Rome summit, does still assert that nuclear weapons 'demonstrate that aggression of any kind is not a rational option', and that they are therefore 'essential to preserve peace'. But those words were included at French, and to a lesser extent British, insistence. UK politicians, unlike the French, have tended to explain their national deterrent as a necessary response to the existence of other nuclear powers, rather than as something good in itself. In the post-Cold War world, superior conventional force is no longer the main threat that west Europeans have to worry about. But it may still be the main threat for Israel; for some of the ex-Soviet republics, such as Armenia (which may fear invasion from Turkey), or Kazakhstan and Ukraine (whose fears are directed at Russia); and for any number of third world states. The temptation for these states to emulate France, hoping that nuclear weapons will make their national territory invulnerable, is likely to be strong whether or not they themselves harbour any aggressive intent towards their neighbours. For Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine - republics on whose territory parts of the Soviet strategic arsenal are located - this question is an immediate one. Belarus and Ukraine, traumatised by the Chernobyl disaster, seem for the moment eager to do without their own nuclear deterrent: they have committed themselves to signing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as non-nuclear weapons states. But that position could change if the fragile Commonwealth of Independent States, with its cumbersome arrangement for joint control of strategic forces, falls apart. Kazakhstan in any case is taking a more cautious line. Its leaders have talked of retaining strategic weapons on their territory until the year 2000. Meanwhile, thousands of ex-Soviet nuclear technicians are reputedly looking for jobs abroad, and it is almost inevitable that some of them will end up in the service of would-be nuclear powers in the third world. It is this process of nuclear proliferation, rather than any conventional threat, which is now most worrying for Nato countries. France implicitly recognised that when it agreed to sign the NPT last year, reversing a long- held national position. Doing so does not require France to renounce its own nuclear deterrent, since it is one of the five states which qualify as nuclear weapons states under the treaty, having exploded a nuclear device before January 1 1967. But there is an apparent contradiction between the logic of the NPT and the French, or indeed the Nato, doctrine, that nuclear weapons are essential to deter aggression and preserve peace. Why, the would-be proliferator can reasonably ask, do some states require their own national deterrent for these purposes, while others are expected either to seek a nuclear guarantee from their allies or (if that is not available, or comes at an unacceptable political price) simply to rely on some vague notion of collective security and 'new world order'. As they seek to maintain and strengthen the NPT (which comes up for renewal in 1995) and to persuade new states to adhere to it, the five recognised nuclear weapons states are likely to find that question more and more difficult to elude.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NUCLEAR ARRAY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Number of warheads in arsenals of declared                       nuclear powers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               US     CIS     UK     France     China  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Intercontinental   ballistic missiles       2,450   6,600      -          -       40?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Submarine-launched   ballistic missiles       5,200   3,600    100        400       30?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aircraft bombs and   missiles                 8,300   5,400+   200        120      200+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other land-based   missiles, shells         2,840   5,000+     -         90      100?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other sea-launched   missiles and torpedoes     350   1,500      -          -         -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Surface-to-air missiles        -   3,300      -          -         -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: SIPRI, IISS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 6 Map (Omitted).

0,FT921-11348 ,"FT921-11348 _AN-CA4AUAGRFT 920131   FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Disarmament service offered      By MARTIN DICKSON      NEW YORK   THREE leading US armaments contractors, seeing a profits opportunity in the ending of the Cold War, have formed a new company with the grandiose title of International Disarmament Corporation to specialise in the dismantling of former Soviet nuclear weapons systems. The three are Lockheed, Olin and Babcock  Wilcox, a unit of the energy services company McDermott International. Each will have a 33 per cent interest in IDC. The US defence industry as a whole faces a severe contraction over the next decade as the ending of the Cold War has produced a sharp drop in defence spending by the Pentagon. Companies have been pursuing a wide variety of different strategies to find new business, but this is thought to be the first company offering a disarmament service of this kind. IDC plans to offer its services to the four Commonwealth Independent States which hold weapons that previously made up the Soviet nuclear arsenal. Mr Troy Wade, president of IDC, said yesterday that the former Soviet Union was clearly capable of dismantling nuclear weapons, but it was unlikely that all of the four successor states had this expertise. The company does not see significant commercial opportunities in the US, where the government already has a well-organised weapons destruction industry, although it could bid for some of this work in future. Mr Wade said that while the scope for Soviet work was extremely uncertain, the kind of disarmament discussions taking place between President George Bush and Russian leader Mr Boris Yeltsin could lead to the destruction of 'thousands of warheads and a business worth billions of dollars over many years'. One of the spurs to the company's formation was a bill passed by the US Congress last year authorising the US to spend up to Dollars 400m to help Russia'a disarmament efforts. Lockheed, one of the largest defence contractors in the US, has great experience in the systems integration and the management of high technology programmes, including the US navy fleet's ballistic missile programme. Olin Ordnance specialises in high explosives and ammunition production and destruction, while Babcock has expertise in the manufacture and assembly of nuclear components, and nuclear materials processing. Mr Wade was formerly the senior career civil servant at the Department of Energy in Washington dealing with defence systems, and has experience of international weapons treaty verification.

By ROBERT C. TOTH and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      WASHINGTON      Critics of arms control have long complained that ""when it's important, it's  not do-able, and when it's do-able, it's not important."" But President Bush and  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took a significant step Friday toward  proving the critics wrong.    The agreements that they signed on strategic nuclear weapons, chemical weapons  and nuclear testing, along with a joint statement advancing prospects for  conventional force cuts in Europe, mark the beginning of the critical task of  dismantling the ""over-armament"" of both nuclear and conventional weapons that  accumulated during four decades of confrontation.    ""The START treaty will signal a turning point in U.S.-Soviet arms control  efforts toward a more rational, open, cooperative, predictable and stable  relationship,"" the two leaders said in a statement accompanying the agreement.    Said Bush: ""The world has waited long enough. The Cold War must end.""    The START pact, in particular, will cut in half the number of missile warheads,  the most dangerous weapons on both sides, and the reductions will be verified  by 13 different types of on-site inspection. Also, it switches the weight of  the arsenals from fast-flying ballistic warheads to slow-flying cruise missile  warheads.    ""No one is going to start a war by using cruise missiles,"" said former arms  negotiator Paul C. Warnke.    Beyond that, START could significantly increase political stability between the  two countries, according to Harvard Prof. Joseph S. Nye, Jr.    ""The basic objective of arms control,"" he said, ""has been to promote stability,  with reduced risk of conflict and some money saving. START, as it emerges, does  advance those goals and thus sets the stage for the next steps in the process,  including deeper cuts in nuclear weapons.""    ""Maybe this disarmament process is a victim of its own success,"" said Soviet  Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, tacitly acknowledging the  grumbling of critics over Friday's arms agreements. ""We used to talk a lot  about disarmament, and now when we have disarmament we talk less.    ""It doesn't mean that it has less significance,"" Gerasimov added, referring to  the anticipated START pact. ""It's extremely significant. It also gives you and  us a peace dividend.""    Certainly critics can argue that there is room for improvement in the accords:  The cuts could have been deeper, negotiations less protracted. But they set the  stage, militarily and politically, for the next steps in slowing down the arms  race.    The START agreement will cut offensive nuclear arsenals by one-third overall,  not by the flat 50% once promised. And it will take seven years to get the  weapon stockpiles back to roughly their size when the strategic arms reduction  talks began in 1982.    But even some who are disappointed at the ""modest"" size of the cuts, like  Warnke, a former arms negotiator, see the treaty as a ""useful"" step.    The anticipated treaty to cut conventional forces in Europe (CFE) has generally  drawn less criticism. The Warsaw Pact countries would cut four times more  weapons from their arsenals than the North Atlantic Treaty Organization: 15% to  60% of various weapon categories, compared to 7% to 15% for NATO.    Instead of taking eight years to negotiate, CFE promises to be finished in only  two. But here, too, critics complain that history has moved faster than arms  control and that the weapon and troop ceilings set by the agreement could  become the floors that the Soviets will insist upon retaining in East Europe in  the future.    Barring some drastic reversal of the present flow of events, however, there  seems little realistic prospect that any significant Soviet presence will  remain in the former Soviet Bloc countries by the end of the treaty's  seven-year reduction period.    Hungary and Czechoslovakia will be rid of the Soviets by mid-1991. Poland may  or may not allow small contingents of Soviet logistic troops to stay to service  Soviet forces in East Germany. But with German unification imminent, Soviet  troops can only be marking time on East German territory before they depart.    The CFE treaty, further, will require the destruction of massive amounts of  weapons -- over 100,000 tanks, artillery and aircraft by the Warsaw Pact.  Reconstituting them in order to go to war would be very costly and  time-consuming, and probably could not be done without alerting the West.    So the CFE accord should largely blow away the specter of a big conventional  war in Europe for decades. As such, it will have more immediate impact on the  Continent than will the START pact.    But the superpowers will still be overstocked with nuclear weapons whose use,  while far less likely, can obliterate the world. Hence new negotiations, to  quickly follow completion of the START treaty, will seek ""to enhance stability  and reduce the risk of war,"" Bush said at Friday's White House signing  ceremony.    Arms control experts have a more specific list than that already prepared.    A primary goal should be to reduce the weapon totals further, to 3,000 or 4,000  weapons, according to Harvard's Nye. The START treaty now anticipated will  permit 6,000 ""accountable"" weapons, but it will actually permit 9,000 or  slightly more because of liberal counting rules for cruise missiles. The next  treaty should set a limit that will have no loopholes, Nye said.    The new talks are certain to seek strict limits on the number of land-based  intercontinental missiles with multiple warheads. Both U.S. and Soviet  officials agree that such missiles are destabilizing: They are the best weapons  to launch a surprise attack, and also the most attractive targets in a surprise  attack.    Another goal will be further cuts in the very large Soviet ICBM missiles, the  SS-18s, whose power and accuracy are the most threatening to the United States.    Curbs on nuclear weapons in naval forces will be a topic pushed by the Soviets  in future talks, because they fear that nuclear weapons on U.S. submarines and  ships can circumvent the START treaty.      COUNTING NUCLEAR WARHEADS    The goal of the START agreement under negotiation is to reduce the nuclear  arsenal of each superpower below 6,000 warheads.

State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the funds would be given  to a commission composed of United Nations and Organization of American States  officials. The commission, known by its Spanish initials CIAV, was set up  partly to oversee the dismantling of the Contras, most of whom are based in  Honduras.    ""We have explained our intentions to the government of Honduras and the  Nicaraguan resistance,"" Boucher said. ""Both have reacted favorably. The U.N.  and OAS secretaries general have also been informed.""    The commission, Boucher said, will be asked to submit proposals for use of the  funds.    The disclosure was part of what appears to be an increase in diplomatic  activity concerning the fate of the rebels as Nicaraguan elections draw closer.  President Daniel Ortega will be running in the Feb. 25 election against an  opposition slate led by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.    Sources close to the Sandinista government said that Nicaraguan officials would  meet today with Contra representatives in Tegucigalpa. CIAV officials also will  attend.    Amnesty for rebels willing to return in peace to Nicaragua will be discussed,  sources said.    In addition, State Department officials are expected to confer with CIAV  officials at an undetermined location next week on the peace process.    Most of the Contras are at camps in southern Honduras. The five Central  American presidents have called for the demobilization of the Contras, but the  rebels, with U.S. support, have said they should remain intact until after the  elections.    Boucher's announcement of a conditional U.S. commitment to fund the  demobilization of the Contras was in response to a communique approved by the  five Central American presidents last month.    According to some interpretations, the communique required the immediate  transfer of all U.S. aid funds for the Contras to the CIAV. However, the State  Department disputes that interpretation.    U.S. aid to the rebels consists of food, clothing, shelter and medical services  and is due to run out at the end of February.    The Sandinistas have given high priority to promoting the dismantling of the  Contras, but the rebels have insisted that demobilization must be voluntary and  in the context of a free and fair electoral process in Nicaragua.    The biggest setback occurred in early November when the Sandinistas, contending  that the rebels engaged in terrorist activities, suspended a cease-fire that  had been in effect informally with the Contras during the preceding 19 months.

In addition, State Department officials are expected to confer with CIAV  officials at an undetermined location next week on the peace process.    Most of the Contras are at camps in southern Honduras. The five Central  American presidents have called for the demobilization of the Contras, but the  rebels, with U.S. support, have said they should remain intact until after the  elections.    Boucher's announcement of a conditional U.S. commitment to fund the  demobilization of the Contras was in response to a communique approved by the  five Central American presidents last month.    According to some interpretations, the communique required the immediate  transfer of all U.S. aid funds for the Contras to the CIAV. However, the State  Department disputes that interpretation.    U.S. aid to the rebels consists of food, clothing, shelter and medical services  and is due to run out at the end of February.    The Sandinistas have given high priority to promoting the dismantling of the  Contras, but the rebels have insisted that demobilization must be voluntary and  in the context of a free and fair electoral process in Nicaragua.    The biggest setback occurred in early November when the Sandinistas, contending  that the rebels engaged in terrorist activities, suspended a cease-fire that  had been in effect informally with the Contras during the preceding 19 months.

At a news conference joined by visiting U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry, Chernomyrdin told reporters that Russia  has accepted the NATO's partnership proposal without putting up  any preconditions.    The U.S. defense secretary also pointed out that the  partnership for peace plan would not be practical until the end  of March, when Russia formally applies for the partnership, the  first step toward the full NATO membership.    The two ministers have worked on the issue of nuclear  weapons  and discussed specifically the disarmament of the nuclear  arsenal in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, reportedly the  world's third largest.    Cooperation on the conversion of military industries into  civil business and destruction of chemical weapons were also  among the subjects they discussed, said the Russian prime  minister.    Before leaving Moscow for Alma Ata, Perry and Russia's First  Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Kokoshin signed an agreement  on military conversion this afternoon.     "

After having won World War III  without firing a shot, the United States and its allies, the  winners, are hastening to collect the booty, especially the  political booty. They are leaving the economic loot for later.    The problem for them at present is to keep the process  taking place in the countries of the former socialist bloc --  that is, the transition to capitalism -- from backsliding; to  channel relations with these countries along particular lines;  and to diminish these countries' defensive capabilities,  especially nuclear, as much as possible.    One of the NATO agreements reached at the recent summit in  Brussels was to create a so-called Partnership for Peace --  proposed by the United States -- to receive the former members  of the Warsaw Pact interested in strengthening ties to NATO,  establish military cooperation, and participate in peace-keeping  missions -- preventive interventions, to call them by their true  name. But without a timetable for new members to join NATO, it  is a formula for commitment that commits to nothing.    Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic received the news  with satisfaction. Russia, to which the Partnership for Peace  could also extend, reacted with caution because it does not know  to what extent such an association is in its national interests.    The Russian Government's caution is understandable when we  bear in mind Lithuania's request also to join NATO, and the  not-to-be- dismissed possibility that an anti-Russian bloc could  be formed in central Europe and the Baltic republics in the  future.    With the creation of the Partnership for Peace, the United  States and its allies subordinate the former socialist countries  in military matters without offering them anything. That is,  they place them in a kind of transitional period with no set  limit, a period during which they are guaranteed consultations  and cooperation but not security. On the other hand, that  intermediate position is an invitation to comply with whatever  orders they are given, so as to win entry into NATO.    Another sign of the times is the policy designed to disarm  the former enemies. The entire nuclear arsenal of the former  USSR is concentrated in four former Soviet republics: Russia,  Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The objective of the United  States and its allies is that Russia alone maintain a limited  nuclear capability. They have promised the others economic and  technical aid if they agree to destroy their arsenals. In a  statement on 11 January in Brussels, U.S. President Bill Clinton  announced that his country, Russia, and Ukraine would be signing  an agreement under which Ukraine relinquishes its nuclear  arsenal of 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and (?1,500)  nuclear warheads. Indeed, Clinton visited Kiev yesterday before  going to Moscow for three days of meetings with Boris Yeltsin.  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is invited to participate.  The agreement is to be signed tomorrow [14 January].    As will be recalled, the Ukrainian Parliament conditioned  ratification of the strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty,  known by its U.S. acronym ""START I,"" to the attainment of  certain guarantees of security and economic compensations.    If what has been agreed on is accomplished, Ukraine would  cease to be a nuclear power, which the western nuclear powers --  the United States, France, and Great Britain -- would like very  much. These nations seek disarmament for everyone but themselves.    I cannot fail to recall the second half of the decade of the  forties, the post-war period, when the United States had a  monopoly on nuclear weapons and blackmailed the whole world with  it. Will the same thing happen again? I don't doubt it. The  United States will do so if it furthers its hegemonic interests.    This 13th NATO summit was a big success for the great  powers,  especially for the United States. Simply put, the world moved in  a single direction and they are now reaping the fruits. This is  a sign of the current period. I wonder: for how long?     "

The 144th motorized rifle division turned over the remainder  of the Aegviidu polygon, roughly 300 hectares. Since the rest  had been received before, Aegviidu is now fully turned over.    The Piirsalu storage facilities were taken over from the  navy, making LÆaÆanemaa the 13th district that is  `clean.'    One third of the fuel terminal at Tallinn's North Harbor has  been taken over. Documents to be signed are with the commander  of the Northwest sector, as are those for the Hydrographic  Service of the Baltic fleet.    During the last week of the year just ended, roughly 40  armored vehicles were taken out by rail from the Klooga and  Tallinn units of the 144th motorized rifle division.    The Mines of Naissaare    Out of the previously determined number of 330 newer type  sea  mines at Naissaare, 282 had been removed by December 25. Only 48  mines are left that can be put on one ship of the `Girocompass'  type. There were also 1,454 mines of the older type. Out of  those 828 have been destroyed by burning, leaving a balance of  626. However, the pace of work has slacked off a bit lately,  because out of the 37 navy personnel, only 18 are left.  According to authorities at the Tallinn naval base, mine  clearing at Naissaare should be completed by April 1, even  though experts think the job could be completed within a month.    Packing Noted at the Radio Reconnaissance Station    Packing is also going on at the radio reconnaissance center  at Vana-Aaviku, near JÆuri, in the Harjumaa district. At  one  time, this object belonged to KGB, but was later turned over to  the navy. Its operating reach covered the coastal areas of the  United States and Canada, and the Mediterranean region, not to  mention the continent of Europe. The center itself did not pose  any particular danger to Estonia but, since it was aimed from  our territory against other states, it was that much more  troublesome politically.    Now, the dismantling of receivers has begun. The senders are  still in place, but the station as a whole is no longer  operational. Local commanders think that dismantling will be  completed in February. After that, the buildings and antennas  will be turned over to Estonia. (The equipment is obsolete and  Estonia does not need it). In contrast to many others, this  object is in good order, nothing has been broken.    In summary, one could say that foreign troops are leaving,  indeed, but at a very slow pace. In tomorrow's paper, we shall  try to analyze why this is so.     "

This advantage is so recent and surprising that  it seems incredible.    Assuming that the Bush-Gorbachev agreement to limit the number of American and  Soviet soldiers, respectively, in Central Europe to 195,000 is enshrined in a  treaty, NATO troop strength will be: 195,000 Americans, 400,000 West Germans,  70,000 British, 50,000 French and roughly 12,000 Belgians, Dutch and Canadians.  Facing them will be the 195,000 Soviets troops. The armies of Poland,  Czechoslovakia and Hungary follow the orders of center-right or Christian  Democratic governments, hardly knee-jerk communist allies.    The Vienna negotiations to reduce conventional forces, moreover, aim to  severely deprive those and other Soviet soldiers up to the Urals of military  hardware. Under such restraints, who could honestly expect a sudden Soviet  conventional attack? How could NATO forces be surprised when the nearly  signature-ready Vienna Protocols identify more than 140,000 pieces of offensive  military equipment, from the Atlantic to the Urals, subject to international  verification and inspection?    The Soviets, to be sure, will have their huge arsenal of more than 25,000  nuclear warheads.

This is precisely the reason why the Soviet  leader should not be faced with such challenges as a militarily stronger NATO.    On this side of the Atlantic, more and more people think that ""security"" should  be divorced from a balance of military power. Rather, it should be hinged to a  consensus that military power is irrelevant. This belief is reflected in the  views of several West European leaders who have stressed -- most recently  during the NATO meeting in Brussels on May 3 -- that the Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe, not NATO, is the best vehicle for maintaining  security on the Continent.    At the heart of European thinking is the idea of ""security areas,"" a  geographical zone in which people share loyalty to the principles of democracy,  the renunciation of the military force, peaceful settlement of disputes and  cooperation.

0,FT932-11144 ,"FT932-11144 _AN-DEFCSAIQFT 930505   FT  05 MAY 93 / Ukraine says Russia is violating CIS accord on nuclear weapons: The struggle over control of parts of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal and ownership of the Black Sea Fleet      By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and ANDREW GOWERS   UKRAINE's defence minister has accused Russia of violating an agreement among former Soviet republics on the control of nuclear weapons and of using its forces stationed in his country to subvert Ukrainian independence. In a rare interview, Gen Konstantyn Morozov said the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus were now under the direct control of Russia's defence ministry rather than under the joint command of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the ill-defined successor body to the Soviet Union. This, he said, was contrary to an agreement signed by members of the CIS in Alma Ata, the Kazakh capital, when the USSR collapsed in December 1991. Gen Morozov's comments mark a significant worsening in Ukrainian-Russian relations. They raise the prospect of an intensifying struggle between Kiev and Moscow both over control of parts of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal and over the ownership and location of the Black Sea Fleet, which have been in dispute for nearly two years. The tenor of his comments also confirms that Ukraine is becoming increasingly unwilling to give up the 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles and nuclear-armed strategic bombers on its territory while its conflict with Russia is unresolved. Ukraine's delay in ratifying the Start 1 strategic arms limitation treaty and in acceding to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has soured its relations with the west and threatens to upset the entire international disarmament process. 'Currently the Russian ministry of defence controls all the nuclear weapons in all the former Soviet republics,' said Gen Morozov. 'We are the only republic that is sticking by the CIS agreement.' The defence minister said this arrangement was plainly unsatisfactory and that western security would be better served if Ukraine had the practical capacity to block the use of nuclear weapons on its soil, rather than the purely political veto it is permitted under its accord with Russia. 'For a long time these weapons have been aimed at the US. In my view it would thus be convenient for the world if Ukraine had technical control over the non-use of these weapons,' he said. It would be 'technically possible,' he added, for Ukraine to acquire such capacity unilaterally, although it had no current intention of doing so. President Leonid Kravchuk has consistently vowed that Ukraine will ratify Start 1 and accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear state. But parliament has yet to hold a formal debate on these issues, and pro-nuclear sentiment is growing as Ukraine comes under increasing pressure from the west and Russia. The Russian parliament insists it will not ratify the Start 2 arms control accord signed by Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin in January until Ukraine fulfils its commitments. On the Black Sea Fleet, Gen Morozov said negotiations were going 'very badly'. He accused Russia of using the fleet, stationed in Sebastopol in Crimea, to siphon off Ukrainian assets and politically to destabilise the region, to which Russia has asserted territorial claims. 'By politicising the Black Sea Fleet issue, it (Russia) is making the situation in the entire Crimean peninsula more acute,' he said. 'It is my view that Russia is trying to use its presence in Crimea to exert pressure on the government in Kiev over Ukrainian independence.' Gen Morozov said if Russia would not agree rapidly to a division of the fleet, then he would demand that Moscow remove it in its entirety from Ukraine. 'If Russia insists on maintaining a presence in Sebastopol, Ukraine cannot accept this position,' he said. 'I will demand the withdrawal of all ships of the Black Sea Fleet as a foreign army, and we will build our own fleet, although this would be a great loss. We cannot give part of our territory to another power under any circumstances.' Editorial Comment, Page 13   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.     UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.

In an unprecedented interview clearly timed to coincide with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's mission to the United Nations, Professor V. Mikhailov revealed that 100,000 people produced atomic weapons in the former Soviet Union. The head of Russia's military nuclear programme said that 10,000-15,000 had access to classified information, with 2,000-3,000 people holding vital secrets. While it was possible 'a few adventurists' could go abroad, Prof Mikhailov said that the nuclear arsenal was built by 'patriots, responsible people.' He complained that their monthly salaries of around Rbs1,200 (Pounds 6 at the market rate) were 'not money' but said Russia did not need western help to pay them more. He also pointed out that legislation banning his people from leaving the country for between five to 10 years was still in force - even though the former Soviet Union's borders are no longer as tightly sealed as they were. Regardless of financial problems, Russia would have to find the money to dismantle excess nuclear weapons 'if we don't want to turn the country into one big Chernobyl.'

This  information has been confirmed by Chief of the General Staff  Major General Jiri Nekvasil.    Representatives from the Pardubice-based enterprise,  however,  do not want to divulge anything about this new system, which  should be called Borap. ""We will not discuss the things under  research; they are taboo,"" declared Rudolf Barak, president of  the HTT Group company. Nevertheless, he indicated that special  enhancements to the current Tamara system are involved.    Tamara can reveal aircraft against which current radar  systems are ineffective. It is similar to the U.S. AWACS early  warning system. However, as opposed to active radar systems,  which emit radio waves and assess their reflection, Tamara only  receives radio impulses from the atmosphere.    So far, the Army has refused to purchase more Tamara systems  for its arsenal because it is waiting for the completion of the  more advanced system. The Defense Ministry currently has at its  disposal one Tamara radar and two of its antecedents, the Ramona  system.     "

Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, banned a second neo-Nazi organisation, the German Alternative (DA), and the federal prosecutor arrested two members of a self-styled militia group, called the 'Werewolf Hunting Unit'. The moves came as Chancellor Helmut Kohl led the German parliament in its strongest and most united condemnation of the rash of racist attacks on foreigners and asylum-seekers' hostels. The number of attacks on foreigners has risen from 2,462 last year, to 4,587 recorded so far this year, according to the federal criminal investigation office. Mr Kohl said the country was facing a 'terrifying increase in violence', in which there was no justification for anyone to indulge in violence. Mr Seiters denounced the DA as a neo-Nazi organisation particularly active in eastern Germany. Police immediately launched raids on the homes and offices of an estimated 300 members in Berlin, Brandenburg, and Saxony, in the east, and Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and the Rhineland-Palatinate in west Germany. The organisation was to contest local elections in east Germany, and propaganda documents, as well as a motley arsenal of weapons such as a sawn-off air rifle and a starting pistol, were seized in the raids.

By ROBERT C. TOTH and NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      WASHINGTON      In an effort to resolve a key impasse before the superpower summit in three  weeks, the Bush Administration has offered to move up the date for ending  poison gas production as part of a proposed U.S.-Soviet chemical weapons  treaty, officials said Tuesday.    A senior State Department official said Secretary of State James A. Baker III  hopes to wrap up details of a chemical weapons pact when he visits Moscow next  week for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. A reply to  the U.S. offer is expected at that time.    The U.S.-Soviet poison gas agreement is thought to be much closer to completion  than any other arms control pact now under consideration by the two countries.  President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have made it clear  that they want to sign at least one arms control treaty at their May 30-June 3  summit in Washington.    Another official said the Administration is ready to compromise on its earlier  insistence that the United States continue to produce modern chemical weapons  until all nations capable of manufacturing war gases agree to a global ban.    The official said the exact date for ending production remains to be  negotiated. But non-government experts said that the Administration appears  ready to end production either within three years or when the U.S.-Soviet  agreement takes effect.    The new proposal is intended to remove a Soviet objection to a plan outlined by  Bush in a speech to the United Nations last September calling for the United  States and the Soviet Union to begin at once to destroy most of their existing  stockpiles of chemical weapons.    Bush suggested that both nations cut their arsenals to 5,000 tons. That would  reduce the U.S. arsenal by 80% and the Soviet arsenal by about 95%. Moscow  accepted the Bush proposal in principle but insisted on an immediate end to  U.S. chemical weapons production.    The United States originally wanted to continue production so that the 20%  remaining after the cuts would consist entirely of modern binary weapons --  chemicals that only become deadly when combined. Such weapons are safer to  store than the existing stocks of poison gases.    Another potential obstacle to the chemical weapons agreement, however, is a  Soviet schedule for destruction of its chemical weapons stocks.    The United States could begin destruction in about a year at eight facilities.  In contrast, Moscow has only one such facility, which is now inoperative. The  Soviets contend that destruction at the pace proposed by the United States  would be unsafe.    In a related development, Soviet Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev denied Tuesday  that Moscow has backtracked on earlier concessions in talks on reductions of  long-range nuclear weapons and has jeopardized early completion of the  strategic arms agreement.    Akhromeyev, who is Gorbachev's chief arms control adviser, told a Senate Armed  Services subcommittee that Moscow's position on sea-launched cruise missiles  (SLCMs) is consistent with a statement at the U.S.-Soviet 1987 summit. The  statement committed the two nations to establish ceilings on these weapons that  could be verified if possible.    U.S. officials believed the Soviets had moved away from that demand in  February, however, by agreeing to deal with SLCMs by issuing ""politically  binding declarations."" But last month, the Soviets returned to their demand for  ceilings, which connote legally binding limits, and with verification  provisions.    ""We're not backtracking,"" Akhromeyev insisted. ""We are pushing both statements.  We're still prepared to confirm (SLCM force size) in parallel, politically  binding declarations. But they (the declarations) must limit deployment. If  not, the (strategic) treaty could be bypassed with deployment of many thousands  of SLCMs. The treaty would be nonsensical.""    The Pentagon had planned to build about 4,000 long-range SLCMs, most of them  conventionally armed but about 750 with nuclear warheads. The Soviets have  proposed a nuclear ceiling of half that amount.    The primary purpose of Akhromeyev's visit was to explain Moscow's longstanding  call for new negotiations to reduce tactical nuclear arms, including cruise  missiles, torpedoes and depth charges carried by ships and submarines at sea.    Akhromeyev warned that these tactical nuclear arms ""are less protected"" against  unauthorized use than the nuclear weapons of the other armed services ""because  of unavoidable autonomous sea patrols of every ship carrying out  training-combat tasks.""    Akhromeyev appeared to be suggesting that because ships operate far from port  and reliable communications, naval commanders have greater authority to use  nuclear weapons.

In recent years the European economy has lost a lot of  ground  in the technologies of the future. Japan's leadership in the  high-tech sector seems almost unstoppable, and a similar lag in  genetic and biotechnology compared with the USA is also taking  shape.    While the European share of the world market in high  technology was still around 25% in 1970, today it is less  than  20%. In contrast, during the same period of time, Japanese  companies have increased their share from 15% to  25%. It is  therefore not astonishing that the number of Japanese patent  registrations in the USA today is greater than those of all the  countries of the European Union put together. Does this mean we  are on our way to second class status in technology?    That is surely an exaggeration. European industry is still  the world market leader in many areas, and no other industrial  region has at its disposal such a highly developed industrial  culture. But it cannot be overlooked that the trump cards of the  past such as steel, automobiles, and chemistry are no longer,  and new ones are not in sight. This leads to the question of  where the new jobs will come from which are so urgently needed  to compensate for the increasingly rapid dismantling of jobs in  the old industries.    In this situation it is not enough just to appeal to  European  businesses and demand of them greater efforts in research to  make European industry competitive. The most important thing is  the creation of a climate favorable toward innovation, since  throughout the European Union a whole series of complicated  administrative and procedural provisions prevent private  investments in the area of research. Therefore, it is completely  understandable that increasingly more European firms are moving  their research activities to countries where there are no such  limitations.    There is a peculiar ambivalence in the public debate. On the  one hand, the decline in jobs and growing unemployment are  loudly lamented. On the other hand, technological innovations  are resisted, and researchers are discouraged from translating  the results of their work into competitive products. Those  attitudes are not very compatible, but the political strength is  lacking to expose the obvious contradictions and develop  strategies which point to the future. Here we just talk too many  things to death without thinking about the economic consequences.    We have to support technology and research policies in  Europe  more strongly than we have in the past. Our competitors on the  world market are fully aware of the importance of federal  policies on technology and research. While, for example, in 1991  the total expenditure for research and development in the  European Union was only 2.1% of the gross domestic product  (GDP) of the EU, the USA and Japan spent around 2.8% and  3.5%  of their GDP to fund research and development. The amount of  money spent is not in itself decisive in the results which are  achieved. But it would be a mistake to deny any connection  between investment capital and demonstrable success.    Therefore, with the Fourth General Program for Research and  Technology we want first of all to strengthen the technological  competency of the European economy. The continuing increase in  the share of research expenditures within the Union's total  budget indicates what importance we place on policies for  research and technology--incidentally, in contrast to the member  states which are more likely to be cutting back their research  budgets as a whole.    There is a fateful tendency, especially in times of economic  crisis, to use a great deal of money to support old industries  which are no longer competitive. How many new jobs could have  been created in recent years in Germany if the billions used for  coal had been invested in research? Today this money is gone,  without an end in sight to the coal subsidies--on the contrary.  On 1 January 1994, the coal pfennig will actually be increased.  An estimated 6.1 billion German marks will then be being spent  just to preserve unprofitable German coal mining. We can  certainly not improve the position of research in Germany in  this way.    With the Fourth General Program we are gathering all the  research efforts of the Union together in a single program,  where we have to concentrate on fewer lines of research because  of the relatively smaller share of our resources to all public  research resources. This does not mean that we primarily want to  support large individual projects as we did in the past. This  action was not successful, as the example of the high-definition  television shows. We are rather concentrating on supporting  generic technologies. These are technologies which have an  important overlapping effect on various branches of industry. So  the first area of activity for implementing programs for  research, technological development, and demonstration forms the  main focus of the program. The total budget for this area is to  be around 17 billion German marks, the 7.5 billion mark bulk of  which will go to support new information and communications  technologies, and 2.5 billion marks will go to support  industrial technologies.    The Fourth General Program for Research and Technology  carries through an important change in the paradigm. While,  previously, individual technologies were specifically promoted,  especially those from which large companies profited, the  emphasis now is on technologies which overlap multiple fields.  This requires a different sort of implementation. The goal is no  longer to identify tomorrow's winner, which due to the  increasingly greater market dynamics and the increasingly  swifter decline of technological competence, is also no longer  possible. The point is much more to encourage technological  innovations which conform with pubic priorities, innovations  which make an effective contribution to strengthening the  competitiveness of European industry.    One important focus must lie in the development of  environmentally sound products and production processes as well  as of intelligent transportation and communications systems.  There can be no doubt that these are important problems for the  future whose solution will be of decisive significance for  competitiveness. Until now we have just been lacking  comprehensive technological approaches which link strategically  important goals with appropriate technological means in the  solution of problems.    Our research activity will continue to be concentrated on  the  economically pre-competitive stage. We thereby take into account  the demand from trade and industry itself which wants to avoid a  distorting effect on competition as much as possible through  market-oriented research. Yet research may not limit itself to  basic research if it is supposed to lead to quickly practical  results. It must become by and large ""closer to the market"",  since it is only with new products and new production processes  which reach the market quickly that we can maintain the  competitiveness of the European economy. We can no longer afford  to be world leaders in basic research while leaving it to our  competitors in the world market to bring the results of our  research to the marketplace. We are only wasting our resources  by doing this.    We first need stronger networking to develop new  manufacturing processes or to deal with public tasks more  efficiently with the most modern information technologies. The  new conceptualization of our support for research thus  fundamentally concerns the development of ""networks of  excellence"" among industry, science, and end-users, so that more  and more information in word, picture, and sound can be  exchanged with ever increasing speed and accuracy. The common  priorities for research must be determined in close dialog with  business and industry and above all must contribute to the  purposeful dissemination of the results of research. The small  and mid-sized businesses in particular will also profit from  this, companies which often do not have sufficient means at  their disposal to participate directly in our research plans.  Only in this way can we make a contribution to reducing  structural unemployment.    European policies on research and technology are making an  important contribution to the structural industrial change in  the Union. They cannot, however, bring it about alone. It first  depends on society's ability to make a systemic change. Still,  modern policies on research and technology can contribute in  substantial measure to keeping jobs which are endangered and  recovering those already lost. However, it is decisive here that  the goals of our policies are shared by the majority of our  citizens. For this we need information and solutions which are  free of taboos. That is the prime task of the state in a highly  developed industrial society.     "

In closed session, deputies voted 254-9 to destroy 42 per cent of the country's 1,656 warheads immediately, but to dismantle the rest of the weapons 'gradually' after certain conditions had been met. Parliament did not set a time-frame for total disarmament. Ukraine is looking for Dollars 2.8bn in western aid for dismantlement, western security guarantees and financial compensation for the short-range tactical weapons it transferred to Russia last year. On Wednesday, Mr Kravchuk stressed the need to ratify the nuclear arms treaty - to fulfil his October assurances to Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state - ahead of his forthcoming visit to Washington. Ukraine is the world's third largest nuclear power with 176 inherited long-range strategic weapons, a larger arsenal than those of France, China and the UK combined. Earlier yesterday, Ukrainian deputies adopted a Soviet-style election law, which is likely to favour the Communist majority in voting next March. After weeks of contentious debate, insults and scuffles on the floor, parliament approved the right of influential labour collectives to place their factory bosses on the ballot and rejected a plan to reserve a portion of the seats for political parties. Moderates and liberals denounced the law as another throw-back to the Soviet era.   Countries:-  UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

0,FT934-11368 ,"FT934-11368 _AN-DKACHAC8FT 931101   FT  01 NOV 93 / Economics Notebook: Hungary builds capitalism without capital      By NICHOLAS DENTON   Surprises have lurked behind every corner of eastern Europe's tortuous transition from a planned to a market economy - many of them unpleasant. Often, the first to encounter unexpected difficulties has been Hungary, which has pioneered reform since the late 1960s. So the recent survey of Hungary published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and especially its focus on the critical role played by credit markets, contains a broader message for the post-communist states. The OECD found that Hungary's early, albeit hesitant start, did little to ease the pain of reform. 'Despite Hungary's status as the most Western-market oriented of the centrally planned economies, the post-1989 economic transition still came as an abrupt and wrenching shock.' Hope for recovery has been vested in the privatisation process, but dismantling the state economy is taking longer than expected. In Hungary's case the OECD cites estimates that 18 per cent of state enterprise assets were under private control by the end of 1992, well short of the government's target of privatising half the state sector by 1994. Privatisation of state assets is not the whole story. Start-ups and greenfield investments have boosted the private sector to about 30 per cent of GDP, but even that has been far from enough to offset the contraction of state-owned industry and avert recession. Up to now Hungary has relied the most on foreign investment to flesh out the private sector, attracting more than Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.64bn) since 1988, over half the total for central and eastern Europe. But foreign investment alone cannot transform the economy. Most Hungarian consumer goods companies attractive to multinationals have been sold and foreign economic penetration has come close to its political limits. Increasingly foreign investors are looking to Poland which has four times the population of Hungary or the Czech Republic - and an economy stimulated by the dynamism of home-grown Polish entrepreneurs. The growing stress on home-grown capitalism means closer attention must be paid to solving the dilemma of how to build capitalism without capital. One recourse is to distribute ownership through voucher schemes like the Czech Republic or Poland's investment fund -based mass privatisation programme. Hungary is belatedly implementing a more modest 'small investor share buying programme'. But its conversion to the virtues of mass privatisation has been half-hearted. Distribution cannot in itself provide enterprises with the capital injection most desperately need. An obvious solution is to mobilise household savings which were negligible under communism but have since surged. In Hungary the savings ratio rose to 15.8 per cent in 1991, dropping slightly to 13.2 per cent in 1992. But higher savings alone cannot stimulate investment in the absence of functioning banks and capital markets. This was the conclusion of a recent World Bank internal aide-memoire which stated that Hungary's financial sector was 'unable to finance the transition to a market economy'. The OECD's survey was more circumspect, but the urgent need for financial sector reform runs like a thread through the report. The financial sector effectively means the banks. The OECD, for example, dismissed the Budapest stock market as of 'minor importance', although this year's boom in the Polish stock market indicates that equity markets do have a future. But the banks risk seizing up. In Hungary real lending rates remained above 10 per cent in 1991 and 1992. Despite growing liquidity, banks curtailed their lending to the enterprise sector in 1992 while the spread between their deposit and lending rates rose from about 4 per cent to a gaping 11 per cent. Behind this phenomenon lies Hungary's status as the first east European country to implement western-style bankruptcy, accounting and banking acts. The new laws have forced many Hungarian companies and banks to face their real, and previously hidden, financial plight. One in six registered companies, producing about 14 per cent of GDP, have been affected by the bankruptcy legislation, according to the OECD. To finance provisions against non-performing loans and rebuild capital, banks increased spreads. But high lending rates make default more likely as only the most desperate enterprises apply for loans. This process led to a 'credit crunch' in Hungary last year. Throughout the region government hunger for higher revenue is compounding the difficulties of the banking system. Until 1991, taxation of banks' paper profits was an important source of revenue, equivalent to about 2 per cent of GDP in Hungary's case. Despite the current plight of financial institutions, governments continue to drain their liquidity. Recapitalisation of the banks would reduce spreads and help stimulate lending to the corporate sector. But here again, the OECD says, budgetary economy has conflicted with bank consolidation. Hungary's effort last year to shore up balance sheets was conducted on the cheap. Budapest, supported by the promise of a World Bank credit of Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m, is now planning another, more comprehensive attempt. But the government has warned of a rise in the budget deficit to Ft350bn (Pounds 4.41bn)next year, around 9 per cent of GDP. This would exceed targets set by the International Monetary Fund, so the temptation to cut corners on bank consolidation remains. Lest Hungary despair, however the OECD notes: 'The visible size of the problems does not mean that the difficulties in Hungary are bigger than elsewhere in central and eastern Europe; rather it may be a sign that things are coming into the open earlier than elsewhere. This could mean that solutions are found more quickly, as issues are recognised in public discussion and measures are being debated and implemented.' That may console Hungary. It is less heartening for its east European neighbours.   Countries:-  HUZ  Hungary, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

0,FT922-10792 ,"FT922-10792 _AN-CD2BIADYFT 920429   FT  29 APR 92 / Kravchuk wants western surety on missiles disposal      By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and JOHN LLOYD      KIEV, MOSCOW   UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk, facing what he sees as an increasingly hostile Russia, said yesterday he was seeking security guarantees from the west in exchange for dismantling Ukraine's strategic missiles. The republican leader, who visits the US next week, said he would link guarantees to 46 inter-continental ballistic missiles in Ukraine not covered by last summer's Start treaty between the US and the former Soviet Union. 'This question has become particularly acute because some of our neighbours are making territorial claims on us, especially our big neighbour, Russia,' he said. Meanwhile, Kazakhkstan's president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, said his country must be regarded as a nuclear state, if only 'temporarily.' His statement advances the much-feared possibility that all four nuclear republics  - Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan  - would continue to hold them indefinitely. Mr Nazarbayev said he wanted a 'strategic alliance' with guarantees from the US against nuclear attack from Russia, China or the US itself. In return, Kazakhstan would show 'flexibility' on signing the non-proliferation treaty. Both men's remarks drew a response last night from Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, who said that the US had already offered a limited, standard security guarantee. Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine's pledge last autumn to become nuclear-free 'set a good example for the world' but 'we are also weakening ourselves'.  Ukraine would also require compensation to defray the cost of dismantling warheads. Since Mr Kravchuk's announcement last month of a temporary freeze on the shipment of Ukraine's 1,000 tactical weapons to Russia, their fate has been clouded by contradictory statements. Mr Kravchuk yesterday held out the hope that the troubled Start treaty, which covers 130 intercontinental missiles in Ukraine, would soon be ratified. He said the four nuclear republics would soon sign a protocol with the US clearing the way for ratification by all four. Mr Nazarbayev said he wanted his republic to sign the Start treaty as a separate state. Russia has insisted that it alone should ratify it, as successor to the Soviet Union. In a bitter comment on relations between the republics, Mr Kravchuk said the US had adopted a more favourable attitude to Ukraine, and that it was easier for him to reach an agreement with Mr Baker than with republican leaders. The tension between Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States dominated by Russia, was emphasised yesterday when the CIS navy commander dismissed officers who had sworn allegiance to Ukraine. His action followed a telegram from Colonel General Konstantin Morozov, Ukrainian defence minister, to Marshal Yevgeni Shaposhnikov, CIS commander in chief, requesting that all CIS officers serving on Ukrainian territory who had not taken an oath of allegiance to Ukraine be suspended and transferred. Gen Morozov also asked that Ukrainian officers serving outside the republic be sent home.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

It was 'senseless' for the west to provide humanitarian aid and help rebuild the economies of former Soviet republics if at the same time they were debating setting up forces 'which would disturb the European balance, and tie up financial and technical resources which could be used more sensibly in other fields'. Mr Kohl was addressing the chiefs of the general staffs of all nine member states of the Western European Union (WEU), who gathered for the first time yesterday in Bonn as part of the process of building a stronger European defence identity. His remarks coincided yesterday with a decision by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, to appoint three commanders loyal to the republic, in a further step towards creating a Ukrainian national army. The new commanders, whose predecessors refused to swear an oath of obedience to Ukraine, will head the military districts situated in Ukraine. The move is likely to cause consternation in Moscow where military chiefs are strongly against dismemberment of the Red Army. Ukraine has been largely successful in its effort to form its own army, securing the loyalty of nearly 300,000 soldiers by the end of last week. Mr Kohl yesterday called for the dismantling of tactical nuclear weapons in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), successor to the Soviet Union, and gave his backing to moves to provide peaceful occupations for former Soviet nuclear scientists, to prevent them exporting their knowledge abroad. David White adds: Britain said it would make concrete proposals for helping to ensure the security of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union in talks later this week between Mr Tom King, UK defence secretary, and Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the armed forces chief. The talks are to take place on Thursday in London during the planned visit of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to Britain. Mr King said UK technical help might include containers for shipping nuclear arms due for destruction. It was essential that weapons be made safe and that materials from them be safeguarded. Discussions would also focus on the future of Soviet nuclear scientists to ensure they had work and did not become 'idle hands'. Reuter adds from Moscow: Fighting raged in different parts of the Caucasus yesterday, with dozens killed in one of the bloodiest battles in a longstanding territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Armenian mission in Moscow said 45 Azeris and 15 Armenians had been killed over the weekend in Nagorno- Karabakh.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Top of the agenda will be the promised departure of Russian troops from the former Soviet republic by the agreed date of August 31. Russian diplomats yesterday talked down expectations of a breakthrough on another contentious issue, the residence and pension rights for 10,000 former Soviet military and security officers. But one told the news agency Interfax that the meeting 'may give an impetus to resolving many controversial issues'. These include the dismantling of the nuclear submarine training base at Paldiski and Estonia's claim to two strips of territory recognised as Estonian by the 1920 Tartu treaty with Russia and now under Russian control.

From Associated Press      MONTREAL      Masked Mohawks on Wednesday helped soldiers tear down barricades set up seven  weeks ago near the Mercier Bridge, avoiding a bloody confrontation.    But other Mohawks said the original dispute remains unsettled and barricades at  nearby Oka will remain.

Mohawk spokesman Jack LeClaire said: ""The decision was taken to avoid  bloodshed. We have reached an honorable settlement between the military and the  community of Kahnawake.""    The moves in Chateauguay caused confusion among Mohawks in both Oka and at a  suburban hotel at Dorval where Kahnawake leaders were negotiating with army and  government representatives when news came that the barricades at the bridge  were being destroyed.

A Mohawk operated a mechanical shovel on one side of the barricade while two  army bulldozers worked on the other side to bring it down. About 20 masked but  unarmed Mohawks helped with the dismantling.    At the same time, the army began filling in a large trench in front of the  barricades.

Enriquez  Morales, who was part of the presidential entourage, said the  possibility that the URNG supports the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN) has not been ruled out. According to what  was said in Mexico, other movements with similar tendencies also  advise the EZLN.    The general added that it is no secret that the URNG used  Mexican territory as its sanctuary and he pointed out a  guerrilla arsenal had been discovered in Mexico, which was later  identified as belonging to the URNG. Enriquez Morales added: We  do not have hard evidence that the URNG participated in the  conflict. Nevertheless, according to conversations with the  Mexican defense secretary, when the issue was discussed, this  possibility has not been ruled out.    Border security problems were also discussed, and in this  case, Mexican authorities expressed their willingness to  cooperate with Guatemala to set up immigration controls and  security on the almost 1,000 km Mexican border. The general  added that this issue was given top priority because there is  still a rebel presence in the border areas which facilitates the  smuggling of fine wood from the Peten forrests. Mexican  cooperation would involve establishing customs and immigration  posts to protect the southern border, particularly because of  the importance this has in context with NAFTA.     "

This sensational allegation appears in a new Bellona report  published yesterday concerning the nuclear situation in  northwest Russia. The environmental foundation has had access to  hitherto unknown documents showing how and where Russia intends  to dismantle 150 nuclear submarines.    The documents show that all future decommissioning of  nuclear  submarines, including vessels from the Pacific fleet, will take  place in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk on the White Sea,  southeast of the Kola peninsula. According to the START II  agreement, Russia will decommission 150 nuclear submarines  carrying 278 reactors in the next few years.    So far only two nuclear submarines, with four reactors, have  been completely dismantled. The fuel rods have been removed from  another 34 vessels, of which 16 come from the Northern fleet.  According to the Bellona report, nuclear submarines with a total  of 206 nuclear reactors and 45,000 used fuel rods will be  dismantled at Severodvinsk.    In the Bellona report, which is the first comprehensive  report concerning the nuclear situation in the region, a  detailed overview will be published for the first time  describing how the two enormous submarine yards in Severodvinsk  will be upgraded in order to handle the huge dismantling job.  The plan includes, among other things, the building of new dry  docks, a new installation intended for the removal of fuel rods,  improvements of the railroad from Severodvinsk to the nuclear  city of Mayak in Siberia, and the construction of docking  facilities for the storage of nuclear submarines.    ""The upgrading of Severodvinsk was to have been carried out  between 1993 and 1998 in order to receive the many submarines  that will be decommissioned. However, several of the projects  that should have been started last year are still in the  planning stage. The uncertainty as to the responsibility and the  financing might result in the postponement of the dismantling  and destruction of the submarines. In the meantime the  submarines are being stored in bays and fjords along the Kola  peninsula, among other places,"" says the two authors of the  report, Thomas Nilsen and Nils Bohmer.    Full Storage Facilities    The definite plans for the improvement of the Severodvinsk  docks that Bellona has had access to include only pure dock  functions per se and a small increase in the capacity for the  interim storage of nuclear waste. As all storage facilities for  nuclear waste in the Kola region were filled to capacity a long  time ago, new solutions must be found. The used fuel that is  most radioactive will be carried to the nuclear city of Mayak  according to the plan. But there is no place to send the  reactors, the reactor sections and other solid radioactive waste.    ""From the documentation we have received and from the talks  we have had with different people, it has become clear that  Russian authorities are considering two alternatives. One is to  dump the waste in the Kara Sea as was done up through 1991. The  other possibility is to build a new regional storage facility  for solid waste,"" Nilsen and Bohmer say.    The two men express a great deal of worry over the nuclear  situation up north:    ""In addition to the 150 nuclear submarines that will be  destroyed in accordance with the START II agreement, it is  assumed that 80 Russian nuclear submarines will be taken out of  operation because of their age over the next 30 to 40 years. As  all storage facilities are full and there is no money to build  an expensive new long-term storage facility, we fear that  dumping will again become the only alternative. Maybe that is  why Russia has refrained from signing the final London  convention against such ocean dumping,"" Nilsen says.    It can be clearly seen from the Bellona report that the  nuclear waste crisis in northwest Russia in no way has improved  during the last year.    However, Bohmer and Nilsen say that what they fear most is  the social [repercussions of the] nuclear crisis.    ""Workers in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk, at the  nuclear  power plant, at Atomflot, and at the military Northern fleet are  paid only rarely. It is not uncommon for them to go three to  four months without being paid. The result is that they are  careless with security. I fear that human error might lead to an  accident long before the technical equipment actually fails,""  Bellona's nuclear physicist Bohmer says. Discarded nuclear  submarines with intact reactors that are stored in the various  fjords around the Kola peninsula need just as careful  maintenance as nuclear submarines that are in operation.    [Box, p 3]    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thanks Bellona    ""Bellona has access to channels of communication and  information that we do not have. That is why they compliment our  work,"" Thorbjorn Norendal, the assistant director of the  Department of Foreign Affairs, says.

This sensational allegation appears in a new Bellona report  published yesterday concerning the nuclear situation in  northwest Russia. The environmental foundation has had access to  hitherto unknown documents showing how and where Russia intends  to dismantle 150 nuclear submarines.    The documents show that all future decommissioning of  nuclear  submarines, including vessels from the Pacific fleet, will take  place in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk on the White Sea,  southeast of the Kola peninsula. According to the START II  agreement, Russia will decommission 150 nuclear submarines  carrying 278 reactors in the next few years.    So far only two nuclear submarines, with four reactors, have  been completely dismantled. The fuel rods have been removed from  another 34 vessels, of which 16 come from the Northern fleet.  According to the Bellona report, nuclear submarines with a total  of 206 nuclear reactors and 45,000 used fuel rods will be  dismantled at Severodvinsk.    In the Bellona report, which is the first comprehensive  report concerning the nuclear situation in the region, a  detailed overview will be published for the first time  describing how the two enormous submarine yards in Severodvinsk  will be upgraded in order to handle the huge dismantling job.  The plan includes, among other things, the building of new dry  docks, a new installation intended for the removal of fuel rods,  improvements of the railroad from Severodvinsk to the nuclear  city of Mayak in Siberia, and the construction of docking  facilities for the storage of nuclear submarines.    ""The upgrading of Severodvinsk was to have been carried out  between 1993 and 1998 in order to receive the many submarines  that will be decommissioned. However, several of the projects  that should have been started last year are still in the  planning stage. The uncertainty as to the responsibility and the  financing might result in the postponement of the dismantling  and destruction of the submarines. In the meantime the  submarines are being stored in bays and fjords along the Kola  peninsula, among other places,"" says the two authors of the  report, Thomas Nilsen and Nils Bohmer.    Full Storage Facilities    The definite plans for the improvement of the Severodvinsk  docks that Bellona has had access to include only pure dock  functions per se and a small increase in the capacity for the  interim storage of nuclear waste. As all storage facilities for  nuclear waste in the Kola region were filled to capacity a long  time ago, new solutions must be found. The used fuel that is  most radioactive will be carried to the nuclear city of Mayak  according to the plan. But there is no place to send the  reactors, the reactor sections and other solid radioactive waste.    ""From the documentation we have received and from the talks  we have had with different people, it has become clear that  Russian authorities are considering two alternatives. One is to  dump the waste in the Kara Sea as was done up through 1991. The  other possibility is to build a new regional storage facility  for solid waste,"" Nilsen and Bohmer say.    The two men express a great deal of worry over the nuclear  situation up north:    ""In addition to the 150 nuclear submarines that will be  destroyed in accordance with the START II agreement, it is  assumed that 80 Russian nuclear submarines will be taken out of  operation because of their age over the next 30 to 40 years. As  all storage facilities are full and there is no money to build  an expensive new long-term storage facility, we fear that  dumping will again become the only alternative. Maybe that is  why Russia has refrained from signing the final London  convention against such ocean dumping,"" Nilsen says.    It can be clearly seen from the Bellona report that the  nuclear waste crisis in northwest Russia in no way has improved  during the last year.    However, Bohmer and Nilsen say that what they fear most is  the social [repercussions of the] nuclear crisis.    ""Workers in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk, at the  nuclear  power plant, at Atomflot, and at the military Northern fleet are  paid only rarely. It is not uncommon for them to go three to  four months without being paid. The result is that they are  careless with security. I fear that human error might lead to an  accident long before the technical equipment actually fails,""  Bellona's nuclear physicist Bohmer says. Discarded nuclear  submarines with intact reactors that are stored in the various  fjords around the Kola peninsula need just as careful  maintenance as nuclear submarines that are in operation.    [Box, p 3]    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thanks Bellona    ""Bellona has access to channels of communication and  information that we do not have. That is why they compliment our  work,"" Thorbjorn Norendal, the assistant director of the  Department of Foreign Affairs, says. He is heading the  preparation of a white paper on nuclear safety in northwest  Russia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given financial  support to Bellona's work in Russia.

0,FT934-15068 ,"FT934-15068 _AN-DJMCRAGGFT 931013   FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (1): Global trade on the brink - David Dodwell argues that failure of the Gatt talks to reach agreement could damage exporters' order books as early as 1994 and leave a 'Fortress Europe' on the sidelines of international trade / Comment      By DAVID DODWELL   THE Uruguay Round of world trade talks, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), may seem far removed from the daily concerns of small and medium-sized exporters across the UK and the continent of Europe. But this will not be the case over the coming two months, as make-or-break negotiations ahead of a December 15 deadline seek to cut tariff barriers, and boost world trade. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of these talks, focused on the Gatt headquarters on the edge of Lake Geneva. Failure of the negotiations could lead to a rapid escalation of trade conflict, with higher tariffs, a blizzard of anti-dumping actions, and countervailing duties against subsidised exports. The risk of failure is high, in part because time is running short, and in part because recession and high levels of unemployment have made governments baulk over the last, difficult compromises. Unhappily for European companies, there is also a considerable risk that Europe - and in particular France - would be blamed for the failure of the talks, because of a refusal to stand by an agreement made a year ago to cut back on Europe's exports of subsidised farm products. Some in Europe may argue that the cost of failure would be small. After all, European companies on average sell two thirds of their exports to other European Community countries. Planned growth of the EC would embrace the Efta countries of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Austria and Switzerland and establish special relationships with the liberalising economies of eastern and central Europe, leading to a wider European market of around 400m people. As such, some will argue that EC companies will be able to turn further inward without paying any particularly high price for the loss of export opportunities outside Europe. But others would argue that such a retreat behind the walls of 'Fortress Europe' would be catastrophic. First to suffer would be transnational companies which spread production across the globe: obstacles to the free flow of components from one subsidiary to another could force them to relocate outside Europe, or trim operations to serve Europe alone. This danger cannot be overestimated, since intra-company trade accounts for over 40 per cent of all trade. Europe's companies account for 52 per cent of the world's stock of international direct investment - totalling Dollars 956bn at the end of 1991 - with almost half of this invested outside Europe. With such deep roots in the world economy, thoughts of retreat behind Europe's fortress walls are nothing short of naive. This is starkest of all for Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands - Europe's leading foreign investors - although it is possible that the negligible reliance of France or Italy on inward investment from countries outside Europe could distort public perceptions there. Behind the multinationals, small and medium-sized companies would quickly suffer in their wake, since many have developed in order to supply them with components and other products and services. Declining competitiveness would almost certainly follow, as companies inside Europe were protected from the international competition that ensures the highest possible levels of efficiency, and the exploitation of new technologies. European competitiveness is already a mounting problem, because of the high price paid across Europe for subsidies to the farm sector, and to loss-making state-run enterprises such as those in the steel sector. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents the world's leading industrial nations, says farm subsidies alone cost Dollars 354bn last year, with Europe's share by far the largest at Dollars 156bn. It is self-evident how heavy a burden this is on Europe's consumers and manufacturers - with the inevitable danger that export opportunities to the world's fastest-growing economies in Asia would be lost because Europe's products are uncompetitively expensive. There are without question immense opportunities in the Asia Pacific region, in spite of increasing self-reliance, and Japan's obvious geographic advantages. After a decade of economic growth averaging between 6 and 10 per cent, countries such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are becoming significant consumer markets in their own right. Even though they have industrialised rapidly, and have comparative advantages linked to low labour costs that make it difficult for exporters to supply anything except high-technology goods, these countries have a virtually insatiable need for foreign investment and high-tech imports in the decade ahead. This has been well realised by the US which has just launched an export promotion programme targeted hard at Asia which aims to lift exports from Dollars 700bn last year to Dollars 1,000bn by the year 2000. Also notable, President Bill Clinton has given high priority to a summit in Seattle in mid-November of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping. At the very least, this is intended to forge closer trade and investment links across the Pacific. At worst - if Uruguay Round negotiations are going badly, with blame being laid at Europe's door because of intransigence over liberalisation of farm trade - it could be used to discuss trade reforms excluding Europe, and possible trade sanctions against European companies in retaliation against the continued export of subsidised farm products. It is perhaps this danger that prompted John Major, the British prime minister, to write recently: 'Only our joint interest in success in the Geneva negotiations has kept Europe and America back from trade war. Breakdown in those talks would threaten a repeat of the protectionism and isolationism of the 1930s, when production fell by one fifth, and investment by half. 'Failure would lead to an immediate crisis within the EC in its relations with the US, countries of the Cairns group (of farm exporting countries), and the whole developing world.' For an average managing director in a small company in the EC, this may all seem heady and remote. But failure could mean damage to order books quite early in 1994. Success on the other hand is forecast to lead to net gains in world income of Dollars 213bn by the year 2002, when the full force of Uruguay Round reforms would be in place.

Mr Giovanni Bisignani, chairman of the Association of European Airlines (AEA) and chief executive of Alitalia, attacked Europe's failure to establish a single harmonised system of air traffic control. Europe's 54 air traffic control centres use 31 different technical systems, none compatible with the others. The computer hardware for the systems comes from 18 different manufacturers and employs 70 different programming languages. At an AEA forum in Brussels, Mr Bisignani said the fragmented system of national jurisdiction over European airspace had doubled delays over the last six years. Overloading of the European air traffic control (ATC) network has already meant that dozens of flights have been delayed or cancelled this summer. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) and Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based government backed air traffic control centre, are developing an improved ATC scheme for Europe. But the new system will not be ready until 1995 at the earliest and Iata warned last month that a serious failure of Europe's ATC might occur this summer, leaving hundreds of aircraft and crews stranded at the wrong airports. Mr Bisignani yesterday launched a pan-European information campaign aimed at shifting the blame for flight delays and cancellations to the national and European authorities. Transport ministers from the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) met in March to consider ways of improving the air traffic control system. But the AEA says ECAC's harmonisation programme will still lead to 'a complicated and very inefficient managerial structure' because it will try to preserve national authorities' sovereignty over their airspace.

Cutting wages and pruning welfare payments to price Europe's unemployed into jobs would be 'socially unacceptable and politically untenable', and would 'only worsen the crisis by depressing domestic demand', according to the Commission white paper on growth and jobs. This strategy document, circulated yesterday to member governments, is intended to be the centrepiece of the summit. The Commission's approach contrasted sharply with the call yesterday from Unice, the EU employers' confederation, for a comprehensive reduction in labour costs and the privatisation of welfare systems. Unice's report, Making Europe more Competitive, is timed to gain employers a prominent voice in the summit debate. The report wants: To reduce Europe's high non-wage labour costs, especially social security contributions for the low-paid and young workers. Real wage increases to be kept below rises in productivity. Higher wage differentials, especially by cutting minimum wages and marginal tax rates. The Euro-employers also want relaxation of rules on working hours, easier hire-and-fire laws, lower unemployment benefit and more limited access to the social security system. Unice also wants a general roll-back of the public sector and a review of EU legislation with a view to scrapping regulation which implies costs for industry. The central employment section of the white paper emphasises lifelong training, lifting non-wage costs off low-skilled work, job-sharing and more part-time work within companies rather than as a national scheme. It envisages a push to develop services for work-seekers. 'Unemployment benefits can only be reduced so far before the poverty line is reached,' the white paper says, adding: 'These limits have already been reached in several countries.'

But he declared that this would 'very quickly' become a significant issue in the building of a European defence. This kind of talk, which is both provocative and evasive, challenging but enigmatic, is a classic Mitterrand strip-tease. The president is manifestly suggesting the opening-up of the long-guarded treasure of French national independence in nuclear policy. Yet he makes the suggestion so obliquely and moves on so quickly, that the casual observer is not sure whether the diaphanous veil fluttered aside for a moment or two, nor, if it did, whether what was revealed was worth seeing. On the face of it, the suggestion is a reckless provocation at the heart of the French body politic. More than 25 years ago, France walked out of the integrated structure of Nato, and for an even longer period it has proclaimed that its nuclear arsenal is independent from those of its allies. This insistence on independence may have played a key role in maintaining popular support for France's nuclear role; it has been a constant feature of the stock-in-trade of all mainline politicians for a generation. Deliberately to suggest the development of a European nuclear doctrine, therefore, would seem foolhardy and premature. Mr Mitterrand's immediate need is popular support and formal ratification for the Maastricht treaties on economic and political union. These treaties already call for far-reaching shifts of national sovereignty between France and the emerging federal structures in Europe. They do not explicitly require any early change in French nuclear doctrine; so it seems gratuitous to give the national nuclear consensus an extra shake before it is absolutely necessary. That, at least, was what I thought when I read his speech; it appears I was wrong. Since he spoke, there has been almost no reaction from the political establishment in France. One choleric protest came from Mr Jacques Baumel, an unreconstructed Gaullist politician of the old school; but it turned out that he had misunderstood what President Mitterrand had said. By contrast, Mr Bernard Bosson of the pro-European centrist CDS party, had not misunderstood and warmly approved. For the rest, President Mitterrand's tease did not stir up France's leading politicians at all - not even the top brass of the Gaullist party. Of course, the Cold War is over, and nuclear deterrence no longer makes the headlines as it once did; so perhaps the French are less sensitive to the question of nuclear independence. Whatever the reason, it looks as though France's national nuclear deterrent may be on its way to being de-sanctified. This is all to the good. There has long been a deep contradiction at the heart of France's European policy, between the active pursuit of integration in political and economic affairs, and the doctrinaire refusal of integration in defence. The contradiction has become even more stark during the past year, after France (with Germany) openly started pressing the case for a European defence policy, without abandoning the traditional Gaullist rhetoric at home in relation to French national defence. These Gaullist hang-ups are now being discarded in a fairly systematic way. In November, Nato endorsed the development of a European defence role, through the creation of 'integrated and multinational European structures'. It was a historic compromise: the US has stopped asking the French to rejoin Nato, and the French have stopped objecting to military integration. That removed the last obstacle to an agreement at Maastricht on the objective of a European defence. The unresolved question was where French nuclear weapons fitted in with Europe's defence. It is easy to argue, like Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, that French (and UK) nuclear weapons should be handed over to a strong European federal authority; but such an authority will not exist for decades. President Mitterrand's proposal, for the development of a European nuclear doctrine, is bolder, because it could start to happen more quickly. So what does he have in mind? Officials smile and shrug. If Mr Mitterrand has something precise in mind, he must be keeping it to himself. They say his main objective is political, not technical: the central fact is that he has, for the first time, placed the question of French nuclear weapons on the European table. 'The nuclear question is posed,' says one. 'We need to ask what is the future of nuclear deterrence in Europe, after the dissolution of the Soviet enemy? There is no longer a French taboo. This reinforces the credibility of our approach to European defence; we shall be seeking the reactions of the British and the Germans.' It will take more than a few oblique phrases to wipe out 30 years of Gaullism, however. A senior German diplomat was sceptical: 'This is new; but I'm not sure it means a lot. It is hardly likely that Mitterrand will offer to discuss nuclear targeting.' A senior UK diplomat was even more dismissive and smug: 'Mitterrand is simply signalling that he is aware of the contradictions in the French position; we do not know if there is anything more behind it. The French have a problem; we do not.' My hunch is that Mr Mitterrand wants to start serious political discussions. The Germans and British therefore need to decide what they think and what they want. Scepticism will not be enough.  The Financial Times   London Page 26 Illustration (Omitted).  "

Concern about Ukraine's stance is expected to figure prominently at Nato defence ministers' talks in Brussels. Mr Pavel Grachov, Russia's deputy defence minister, said yesterday he had told the US that the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia from other republics would be completed by July 1, despite apparent Ukrainian opposition. Mr Grachov, who met Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, on the eve of the talks, said hundreds of warheads now in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan as well as those in Russia would be stored carefully until destroyed. The one-day meeting is the first of its kind bringing together defence ministers from Nato and what used to be the Warsaw Pact, including 13 former Soviet republics. Mr Cheney said he would press for the fulfilment of pledges to place the entire nuclear arsenal in Russia. Tactical nuclear arms are due to be transferred to Russia by July 1 under an agreement reached last December. Ukraine is also pledged to the removal of strategic weapons by the end of 1994. Other strategic weapons are based in Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. The talks are also expected to focus on the share-out of the military equipment entitlements which were allocated to the Soviet Union under the 1990 Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.

Establishment of the institute in Bilbao, Spain, will be announced today. It will focus on software processes and the rules and procedures for writing effective software. The aim, according to Mr George Grunberg of France's Groupe Bull, acting chairman of the new institute's board, is to exploit Europe's software expertise: 'Modern industrial society relies more and more on the availability and quality of software systems of ever-increasing size and complexity,' he said. Difficulties in specifying and writing large software programmes are recognised as a barrier to the greater use of computerisation in business and industry. While a number of blueprints or methodologies for software construction have been created, no universal method of guaranteeing effective software development has yet been found. The members of the group include Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa of Spain, British Aerospace, Sema Group, Logica and Lloyds Register of the UK, Groupe Bull and Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, Olivetti and Finsiel of Italy, and Siemens Nixdorf of Germany. Each has subscribed Ecu100,000 (Pounds 82,600) to launch the project. Membership is open to any company with European operations interested in software development. New members would pay significantly less a year than the founders, Mr Grunberg said, but would have access to all the research and results. A managing director is being sought for the institute, which is expected to begin work in the summer. The institute, which will operate on a non-profit basis, has the blessing of the European Commission although it is wholly an industry-led initiative. It is expected to employ up to 50 software experts when fully staffed. Bilbao was chosen after a number of European cities had expressed interest in hosting the institute. It has a well developed high-technology infrastructure and close links with US academic research in software development.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

0,FT931-10022 ,"FT931-10022 _AN-DBKB3AAFFT 930211   FT  11 FEB 93 / Brussels may set steel production targets in move to rescue industry      By LIONEL BARBER and ANDREW HILL      BRUSSELS   THE European Commission is considering a new role as EC steel market supervisor, setting guidelines on future production levels. The plan, aimed at tackling Europe's steel industry crisis, is under review in Brussels. But the Commission will stop short of dictating prices and production levels to individual companies, like the 'crisis cartel' set up by Viscount Etienne Davignon, then industry commissioner, during the early 1980s, EC officials stressed yesterday. Under the proposals, Brussels would lay down recommendations on production and delivery levels within the EC for each quarter. EC officials maintained yesterday this would not encourage a cartel. Another measure under review is for the steel industry to pool 'crisis funds' for the restructuring of each individual sector. The Commission is anxious to place the burden of decisions about restructuring on the steelmakers, and avoid being accused of manipulating the market. But Brussels believes it has a vital role to play as broker between steelmakers and governments. EC officials said the Commission would make clear it was willing to support an industry-wide restructuring plan only if Europe's steelmakers produced a 'definite' closure programme by the end of September which could be carried out by end-1994. A rescue plan is also dependent on the support of EC member states which would have to bear a portion of the EC funding of up to Ecu900m (Pounds 730m) to cover redundancy costs. The overall cost of restructuring could be more than Ecu6bn, according to a report by Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's special steel envoy. The Braun report warns that, without a rescue plan involving some early price rises, some of Europe's largest steelmakers will see their cashflow dry up or turn negative by year-end. The report includes a range of potential cuts in capacity suggested by some 70 managing directors of EC steel companies in the past four months. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, has begun canvassing fellow Commissioners' support and will present formal proposals next Wednesday. The EC will discuss the steel industry crisis at a special meeting on February 25.   Countries:-  EuZropean Economic Community (EC).   Industries:-  P331  Blast Furnace and Basic Steel Products.

The Brussels appeal is the first step towards the EU goal of total telecommunications liberalisation by 1998. It is contained in a 228-page green paper adopted by the Commission yesterday after two years of research. The paper is unusually prescriptive for a consultative document, and takes clear aim at the barriers holding back the potential of what the Commission and market research forecast will be the fastest growing area in telecommunications. The paper states the pan-European GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) is establishing itself as a main reference technology for digital mobile systems, and could become the global standard. Europe's mobile telephony infrastructure suppliers have an international comparative advantage, it says. But nationally orientated and technology-based licensing has resulted in parallel national systems, with no consistent approach to provision of compatible, cross-border services. This 'failure to adjust to market requirements could jeopardise Europe's current strong position,' the green paper warns. Mobile communications experts point out, however, that both the US and Japan are likely to use different technology from the GSM standard which the Commission is endorsing. By 1995 the US will have 20m cellular telephones but the move from existing analogue systems to digital ones is being complicated by a Federal Communications Commission requirement that new digital technologies like GSM must be compatible with existing analogue services. The Brussels green paper advocates five main changes: Abolition of all remaining exclusive or special licensing rights in the sector. Removal of all restrictions on the provision of mobile services across the EU. Full freedom for mobile operators to develop their own infrastructure networks, whether by providing their own or sharing another company's infrastructure. Full freedom to offer combined services via both fixed and mobile networks, which implies the right of independent operators to bid for licences on the fixed networks. Mutual recognition of standards and equipment type approval, coordination of licensing and award procedures, to boost trans-European mobile networks. The Commission predicts there will be 40m mobile communications users in the EU by 2000, and eventually more than 200m.   Countries:-  BEZ  Belgium, EC.

Finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in  Athens clashed over how the European Monetary System [EMS]  should be put back on track, and how to progress towards  European Monetary Union [EMU]. ""I think I am in the mainstream  of finance ministers from the bigger countries who make the  running,"" the Chancellor told BBC radio afterwards.    Germany and France oppose moving rapidly back to narrow  bands  in the EMS after last year's crisis which nearly destroyed the  system. Belgium and Denmark have led some of the smaller  countries in pushing for a return to the tighter disciplines of  the EMS. But Mr Clarke said ""I don't think they were major  players here today.""    French sources said a return to narrow bands would have to  await lower inflation in Germany. Hans Tietmeyer, the  Bundesbank president, said that inflation was still too high at  3.2 per cent.    The Chancellor said that despite Britain's recent European  problems, opinion on monetary matters was moving in the  Government's favour. ""The whole tenor of the discussion has  changed,"" he said. ""I am totally in the mainstream of discussion  here.""    Britain's scepticism about the timetabled path to a single  currency through the disciplines of the EMS is now shared by  France and Germany, but opposed by other smaller states. The  dispute is likely to intensify as the year goes on and public  discussion on monetary union and the EMS resumes.    Alexandre Lamfalussy, head of the European Monetary  Institute, wants the convergence of Europe's economies to be  given pre-eminence rather than a timetabled approach. But the  smaller states want to push the pace by giving Europe's  embryonic central bank new powers over monetary policy and  tightening co-ordination.    Officials in Athens said there had been tough talking  including a mini-revolt by the governors of the larger central  banks, especially Mr Tietmeyer. The Bundesbank president  underlined that countries were responsible for their own  monetary policy, reaffirmed the German central bank's  independence and resisted pressure for interest rate cuts.    The Chancellor also announced that the Channel tunnel rail  link will be one of the first schemes to be funded under new  European Union [EU] transport plans. It is one of lO projects  to be given priority in the construction of Trans-European  Networks, large-scale infrastructure connections.    Ministers discussed how the EU could work with private  capital for these projects, with estimates that a total of ECU20  billion (15 billion pounds) a year will be needed from European  funds. Of this, ECU8 billion has yet to be found.    However, Mr Clarke continued to resist the idea of allowing  the European Commission to borrow money so that it could lend  cash itself. ""There was"", he said, ""continued doubt about the  need for any new financial instrument and for the union to raise  extra money through bonds."" But Britain's resistance to the  Commission's infrastructure plans, contained in a white paper  presented last year by Jacques Delors, is much reduced. ""Now  we've got down to the detail, we're making more sensible  decisions,"" Mr Clarke said.    The informal meeting was meant to discuss measures to  promote  European growth through infrastructure projects, funding for  Central and East Europe, as well as the new European monetary  institute. But debate over monetary and interest rate matters,  including behind the scenes discussion about how to resurrect  the EMS, dominated the gathering.    In the past few weeks there has been increasing debate about  what steps need to be taken to put Europe back on track for a  single currency by 1997. But the monetary disasters of the past  two years have instilled caution in Europe's biggest monetary  players, France and Germany, and views about the Maastricht  treaty's route to a single currency have shifted.

In testimony to the Senate foreign relations committee, Mr Baker said the treaty was vital to build stability between the US and the Commonwealth of Independent States by 'locking in' agreements to slash each sides' arsenal of long-range nuclear weapons. Mr Baker also appealed to senators to support the administration's plans for acting collectively with other countries to help the former Soviet republics make the break from seven decades of communism and central planning. 'It is a once in a century opportunity,' said Mr Baker. These words appeared aimed at staving off criticism at home and abroad that the administration has been too timid in offering help to the republics. In his testimony, Mr Baker rejected suggestions that the administration should incorporate the latest nuclear arms reductions proposed by President George Bush and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, in an amended and updated version of the Start treaty. The Start treaty - negotiated over nine years - was signed last summer. It would cut US offensive nuclear weapons by almost 30 per cent to about 9,000 warheads; Soviet strategic weapons would drop by almost 40 per cent, to about 8,000 warheads. Mr Baker also told the committee that China might be about to commit itself to observing the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international pact to block the spread of ballistic missiles. He said such a move would be a 'major step forward' on US proliferation concerns.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Mr Schlumberger said that if the current level of investment in Europe was not reversed, scientific talent would be unable to renew itself. He told delegates at the second day of a Financial Times biotechnology conference in London that the consequence would be an erosion of the competitive strength of Europe's research-dependent industries. 'Europe will become a net importer, not a producer and exporter of products of modern biotechnology,' he said. His argument was countered by Mr Jurgen Drews, president of international research and development at Roche, the Swiss drugs company. Mr Drews said that European governments spent more than the US on funding basic research, which forms the foundation for the next series of medical advances. This meant that the present US lead in biotechnology could be 'eroded over the long term', said Mr Drews. In a lively debate, Mr Schlumberger said this was like having a modern luxury limousine parked outside one's home, but the regulatory constraints in Europe meant 'its fuel is of low quality and it cannot fulfil its potential.' In an earlier session, Mr Carl Feldbaum, head of the Washington-based Biotechnology Industry Organisation, said that Mr Newt Gingrich, Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, had stated his intention to dismantle the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA controls which drugs are approved to sale in the US, the world's biggest medicines market. The FDA has been criticised in the pharmaceuticals industry and among conservative politicians for its slowness and bureaucracy. 'Many in the biotechnology industry hope it (the dismantling) comes true,' said Mr Feldbaum. But Mr Feldbaum, a former chief-of-staff for Republican senator Arlen Specter, advised caution. He said there was only a small window of opportunity for substantive legislation before politicians' attention turned to the 1996 presidential elections. In his opening address, Mr Drews forecast that gene therapy, which uses DNA as a medicine, would take the place of many conventional drugs. He held out a vision of a drug which need only be taken once a year rather than daily for diseases such as Parkinsonism and Alzheimers.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.

The anti-terrorist unit of the French police yesterday took custody of an Algerian arrested last Friday in eastern France. He was said to have with him an arsenal of weapons in his car, including, apparently, 129 sticks of explosive, 99 detonators, 5,000 rounds of ammunition, three automatic pistols, one assault rifle, night-sights and walkie-talkies. He was suspected of smuggling the arms from Germany to Algeria, probably to Islamic militants there. But so far the French interior ministry remains convinced that the Islamic Salvation Front's hold over the large Algerian community is relatively slight.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

The UK, which uses test facilities in Nevada, would be bound by the US ban. A bill signed into law this month imposed an immediate nine-month moratorium on nuclear testing in the US, followed by a limited programme up to September 1996. The US is understood to have allocated three out of the 15 tests permitted in the limited programme to Britain, which is anxious to test new safety features in warheads for its Trident nuclear deterrent. The temporary moratorium followed similar measures by France and Russia. speaking after a Nato ministerial meeting, but said President George Bush had felt he had no alternative but to sign it. A limited number of tests was necessary to ensure the reliability of weapons. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said it was highly desirable to continue testing. The US law allows for the ban to be lifted if other nuclear powers undertake tests after 1996. The Nato ministers approved new consultation and planning guidelines for the use or threatened use of the alliance's remaining nuclear weapons. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, said the new guidelines reflected a reduced reliance on nuclear arms for the alliance's security. Nato's stockpile of non-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe has been cut to less than 1,000 warheads, a fifth of the level of six years ago. Withdrawal of warheads from all ground-based short-range weapons and from naval tactical weapons was completed ahead of schedule this summer. The remaining arsenal of aircraft bombs is also being cut.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

I have met commercial users of electricity who, having secured lower prices through supply competition in Britain, wonder why their outlets in other parts of Europe are not allowed a similar choice between electricity suppliers. Competition between producers and the right to choose a supplier will drive down electricity prices and help to make Europe more competitive. Unfortunately, that prospect does not appeal to many of Europe's electricity monopolies, which are resisting liberalisation. There is no shortage of companies waiting to provide competition - many of them British - but it will not come about until more of Europe's electricity customers insist on choice.

In the meantime, he said, Ukraine was dismantling part of the arsenal. He told Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, he hoped for rapid agreement on staging parliamentary elections following Mr Leonid Kuchma's resignation as prime minister on Tuesday after a no-confidence vote. Ukraine is to transfer nuclear arms to Russia in exchange for nuclear fuel for power stations, under an agreement three weeks ago. But prospects for doing so remain blocked by difficulties over parliamentary ratification. Mr Kravchuk told Mr Rifkind Ukraine had already removed the warheads - 60 in all - from 10 of its older SS-19 strategic missiles and had rendered them virtually impossible to use. Ten more would be dismantled, starting later this month. Ukraine holds 130 SS-19s, including those it says it has dismantled, as well as 46 SS-24s with 10 warheads each, and about 30 nuclear bombers.   Countries:-  UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.

The 42p a share cash bid values TIP Europe at Pounds 71m, a premium to its recent share price but well below its trading level before a refinancing crisis in 1991. GE Capital is the largest trailer rental company in the US and has been looking to expand in Europe since 1991. Mr David Callear, chief executive, TIP Europe, said the price offered was 'reasonably healthy'. He said UK business was improving, but the outlook on the continent was poor. The offer 'brings an immediate confidence to the business', he said. TIP Europe's shares jumped from 25 1/2 p to 40 1/2 p, their highest level since last year. The shares collapsed from 175p in 1990 when the company was hit by the UK recession. GE Capital's offer price is pitched just above a 1991 five-for-six rights issue at 40p, which followed the refinancing. The company's largest shareholder, the Dutch investment company HAL Investments (UK) which holds 9.9 per cent, has said it will accept the offer unless a higher bid is made. TIP Europe's directors, who hold 0.6 per cent, have accepted the offer and recommended it to shareholders. Mr M van der Vorm, a director in both companies, has expressed no view because of potential conflicts of interest. However, a large proportion of the shares are held by individuals and it is unclear whether they will accept. Tiphook, Europe's largest trailer rental company, holds a 5.4 per cent stake in TIP Europe, which it took in 1991 when it feared GE Capital was about to bid. Mr Robert Montague, chairman, Tiphook, said he was not surprised by the offer. He said a rival bid from Tiphook would raise monopoly questions. TIP Europe yesterday announced a fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.3m in the six months to January 31. UK profits rose, helped by higher rental rates, but continental profits were hit by falling volumes. Mobiel, a modular building supplier, performed poorly. Turnover fell from Pounds 54.9m to Pounds 52.7m while earnings slipped 43 per cent to 1.01p. The interim dividend was cut from 0.64p to 0.4p, which shareholders will still receive under the offer.

In his quest for this magical device that might turn base domestic manufacturers into gold-winning exporters, William Nothdurft calls on fellow US alchemists to look to Europe's practitioners of export promotion to discover 'the way'. The breathless voyage across Europe that he charts in Going Global is fascinating, of immense value to exporters, export organisations and bureaucrats attempting to define their role in export promotion. But, as with the original alchemists, he is probably searching in vain. He is no doubt correct to berate successive US administrations for leaving export promotion in a muddle. He is also probably right to suggest that European governments have messed with export promotion strategies more than the US. But he is probably wrong to suggest that Europe's government's have in contrast got things notably right. His pages detail how small and medium sized companies - the principal targets of export promotion effort - play as marginal a part in Europe's export effort as they do in the US, suffering the same limitations, and the same myopias. As he tracks the immense diversity of programmes tried across Europe, and reveals how short-lived so many of them are, he unwittingly shows a picture as riddled with contradictions, as littered with wasted efforts, and as limited in its success, as he complains of in the US. A British reader must suspect naivety when Mr Nothdurft opens his book with a eulogy about London's Docklands, where 'one of the world's great trading centres is being reborn'. Regular visitors to Docklands will puzzle at when he stumbled across the 'din of an international airport from which a new generation of merchants commutes to the trading capitals of a soon-to-be-integrated European market.' Mr Nothdurft seems to discern order in Europe where most others see a chaos not unlike that which he complains about in the US. But this is not to rob the book of its value. Governments have shown a remarkable inability over the past decades to discover how best to help exporters, and Mr Nothdurft's comparison of schemes from the length and breadth of Europe provide valuable food for thought.

Results of Kazakhstani President's Visit to  Japan""]    [Text] Tokyo -- The first $120 million of Japanese  Government aid and a ""high assessment"" of Kazakhstan's efforts  in dismantling the nuclear arsenal, establishing market  procedures, and democratizing society -- that was the chief  result of President Nursultan Nazarbayev's first visit to Japan.    ""Russia without the territorial issue"" -- this is the  frequently heard unofficial Japanese view of Kazakhstan, hinting  at the country's immense natural resources and industrial  potential. The two years that have elapsed since the  establishment of Japanese-Kazakhstani diplomatic relations have  been marked by a rapid blossoming of mutual contacts. Alma-Ata  [Almaty] has become a Mecca for Japanese businessmen. The red  carpet has been rolled out regularly for Kazkah visitors to  Tokyo, where they have been given a very attentive hearing in  the highest reaches of the business world. This is all boils  down to the fact that between 20 and 30 percent of the world's  entire stocks of many valuable types of fuel, chemical raw  materials, and nonferrous and rare-earth metals, largely  undeveloped, are on Kazakhstan territory.    But almost immediately there energed some intractable  problems, although bilateral trade has actually increased,  reaching the as yet not very impressive figure of $37 million.  The first and biggest obstacle is that Kazkahstan has no  independent access to the sea and transit communications are  difficult. The second problem is the quality of deliveries. It  is still well short of world standards. According to one  Japanese businessman, who had already failed in that area of  business, the future of trade with Kazakhstan remains illusory  until these two problems are resolved, and this requires massive  capital investment in the infrastructure and in the renovation  of enterprises.    But President Nazarbayev was optimistic when he reported to  journalists on the results of his three days of meetings and  conversations in Tokyo. There will be Japanese investment. The  Kazakhstani leader was able to secure in a very short time  credits worth $220 million from the Japanese export-import bank  -- they will finance numerous private joint projects on the  territory of Kazakhstan. The biggest of them is the  construction of the West Kazakhstan oil refinery, costing $1  billion. A consortium involving the Mistubishi, Mitsui, and  Toya corporations won the construction contract. Agreement was  also reached on the free financing of geological surveys of gas  deposits in the Aral Sea area by the Japanese national oil  corporation. In the future, the president announced, we are  talking about laying a gas pipeline to the shores of Japan.  Finally, there was a promise of comprehensive financial  assistance to develop railroad transport, including the laying  of a ""Friendship"" track passing through China and terminating at  the East China Sea.    As far as one could judge from the president's words and  from  pronouncements by high-ranking hosts, another contributory  factor in Japan's very favorable attitude toward business  cooperation is Kazakhstan's specific steps to shed the burden of  nuclear weapons. Japan intends to allocate an immediate $110  million for the dismantling of the nuclear arsenals that have  built up over the past 40 years, following hard on the heels of  the United States.    We have never made a secret of the fact that we came here to  resolve the main questions, economic questions, Nazarbayev said  at the final news conference, and we are very satisfied with the  accords that have been reached, since they ""pave the way ahead""  and impart ""powerful new impetus to our relations in all  spheres.""    Should Japan switch to helping the former republics of the  USSR in view of Russia's recent great-power behavior toward its  former dominions? -- a question from the floor. ""Russia must be  helped, not for what individual politicians say, but in order to  support the process of reforms and democratization. This is  necessary not only for Russia but for us too, and for you, who  are Russia's neighbors.""     "

Saturday night at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, Dolce cranked up his right arm  for 316 yards, and as a result, the El Camino scoring machine, which had been  in the doldrums of late, got a jump start as well. Dolce and his fleet of  talented receivers led El Camino to a 40-15 victory over host Long Beach.    Saturday night, Dolce dipped into El Camino's aerial arsenal for these gems:    * A first-quarter strike over the top of the Long Beach defense that was tipped  by cornerback James Brown into the hands of El Camino's Khevin Pratt, who  tucked the ball away for a 34-yard touchdown play.    * A 41-yard bullet to Pratt in the second quarter that set up Louis Perez'  32-yard field goal to give El Camino a 17-7 lead.    * A tight spiral to flanker David Blakes, who sprinted with the ball to the end  zone for a 35-yard TD play with 11 seconds left in the first half. A 41-yard  completion to Blakes set up Perez's 22-yarder at the start of the third  quarter.    With the victory, the Warriors improved to 8-0 overall and 7-0 in the Mission  Conference. El Camino, ranked first in the state and third in the nation by JC  Grid-Wire, They also took another stride toward their hopes of another  undefeated season.    The victory also extended the school's nation-best winning streak to 15 games.    Dolce completed 21 of his 30 passes.

Saturday night at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, Dolce cranked up his right arm  for 316 yards, and as a result, the El Camino scoring machine, which had been  in the doldrums of late, got a jump start as well. Dolce and his fleet of  talented receivers led El Camino to a 40-15 victory over host Long Beach.    Saturday night, Dolce dipped into El Camino's aerial arsenal for these gems:    * A first-quarter strike over the top of the Long Beach defense that was tipped  by cornerback James Brown into the hands of El Camino's Khevin Pratt, who  tucked the ball away for a 34-yard touchdown play.    * A 41-yard bullet to Pratt in the second quarter that set up Louis Perez'  32-yard field goal to give El Camino a 17-7 lead.    * A tight spiral to flanker David Blakes, who sprinted with the ball to the end  zone for a 35-yard TD play with 11 seconds left in the first half. A 41-yard  completion to Blakes set up Perez's 22-yarder at the start of the third  quarter.    With the victory, the Warriors improved to 8-0 overall and 7-0 in the Mission  Conference. El Camino, ranked first in the state and third in the nation by JC  Grid-Wire, They also took another stride toward their hopes of another  undefeated season.    The victory also extended the school's nation-best winning streak to 15 games.    Dolce completed 21 of his 30 passes.

0,FT932-5881 ,"FT932-5881 _AN-DFBBWAABFT 930602   FT  02 JUN 93 / Britain faces Pounds 18bn nuclear bill: NAO report on decommissioning cost raises fear of burden on taxpayer      By BRONWEN MADDOX and MICHAEL SMITH   THE TOTAL cost of scrapping the UK's civil nuclear facilities could approach Pounds 18bn, according to a National Audit Office report to be published on Friday. The report - the most comprehensive study of UK decommissioning costs to date - will raise fears of a heavy burden facing the taxpayer and will deepen the controversy surrounding the future of Britain's nuclear industry. Whitehall officials are worried that the Public Accounts Committee, which will assess the report on June 30, could judge that not enough money will be available to pay for decommissioning on present plans. Nuclear plants have a limited lifetime and safely dismantling them and storing the radioactive waste is one of the industry's biggest future costs. The nuclear industry is likely to use the report to argue that it needs more new stations to provide revenue for decommissioning those going out of service. Nuclear Electric hopes to start building a Sizewell C nuclear station in Suffolk next year for commissioning early in the next century. Nuclear Electric may also use the report to lobby against a reduction in the nuclear levy, paid by electricity consumers and worth more than Pounds 1.2bn a year. The industry also wants to persuade the Department of the Environment that it should be allowed to take at least 135 years to decommission nuclear facilities instead of 100 years, a move that will provoke fierce opposition from environmental groups. The report comes just months before the government's nuclear industry review. Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, says in a report this week that it fears the review may not consider who picks up the bill for decommissioning. It believes the full costs could be Pounds 30bn, although it has no detailed projections. The NAO's report says the cost of decommissioning Nuclear Electric's eight Magnox power stations and five advanced gas-cooled (AGR) stations makes up some Pounds 7bn of the Pounds 17.9bn total, in 1992 money values. Scottish Nuclear's Magnox station and two AGR stations make up just over Pounds 1.5bn. British Nuclear Fuels' fuel treatment and reprocessing facilities contribute about Pounds 6bn and the Atomic Energy Authority's research and reprocessing facilities about Pounds 3.5bn. It is understood that about a third of the estimates of BNF's costs represent work carried out for the Ministry of Defence - a tiny fraction of the cost of dismantling missiles under anti-nuclear warfare treaties. The nuclear industry is likely to argue, however, that the figures are not discounted to reflect the fact that much of the spending will not take place for decades and that the true amount needed will be much lower. The industry is also likely to welcome the report's suggestion - based on an independent engineering assessment - that nuclear companies have estimated the costs prudently and that technological improvements may bring estimates down further. However, the report throws a spotlight on the thorniest of the decisions facing the government's nuclear policy - the timing and method of decommissioning. This is central to the question of whether cashflow from the industry will be adequate to cover decommissioning. The nuclear industry has been pushing for months for a 'deferred safe storage strategy' which would spread decommissioning over 135 to 150 years, instead of the 100 years assumed in the NAO report. The first stage - stripping out the highly radioactive fuel rods - would still happen immediately. The facility would then be left - supervised - for 35 years, when a concrete shell would be built around it. After another 100 years, when much of the radioactivity had declined, the site would be razed.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

Europe's five largest markets - Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Spain - have all announced or enacted reforms over the last 15 months. Sales in the seven largest markets, which include Belgium and the Netherlands, fell from Dollars 51.6bn (Pounds 34.6bn) in 1992 to Dollars 45.97bn last year, according to IMS International, a market research group. In the German market, Europe's biggest, sales dropped to Dollars 12.66bn from Dollars 14.82bn in 1992 - a fall of 9 per cent in local currencies. Italy, the third largest market, also declined, from Dollars 11.06bn to Dollars 8.45bn. The rate of sales growth fell in every therapeutic category in Europe. The cardiovascular market, which expanded at 7 per cent in 1992, grew only 2 per cent last year to Dollars 10.13bn. The growth rate for treatments for alimentary and metabolism disorders, the second most important category, also fell, down from 8 per cent in 1992 to only 1 per cent last year. The anti-infectives market which include anti-virals, antibiotics and anti-fungal drugs, posted the strongest growth, up 8 per cent last year compared with 9 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile, the US market, the world's largest, expanded only 5 per cent from Dollars 42.95bn to Dollars 45.22bn. Companies operating there have suffered from both political pressure aimed at moderating price rises and the negotiating of discounts by bulk purchasers. The Canadian market grew by 7 per cent in local currency, and rose from Dollars 3.5bn to Dollars 3.514bn measured in US dollars. The Japanese pharmacy market - excluding hospitals - increased by 6 per cent in yen terms, up from Dollars 16.6bn in 1992 to Dollars 20.2bn last year. But the Japanese ministry of health and welfare is implementing a 6.6 per cent price cut and other reforms aimed at limiting drugs spend-ing. Sales of cardiovascular drugs in the 10 largest markets - the US, Canada, Japan and the seven European countries - rose by only 1 per cent in local currency value, although in dollar terms they actually fell from Dollars 21.98bn to Dollars 21.2bn. Among the largest categories, anti-infectives were the best performers, up from Dollars 11.02bn to Dollars 11.7bn, a rise 9 per cent in local currencies. Worst performing were musculo-skeletal treatments - mostly anti-rheumatics. This was the only category to register a year-on-year local currency decline in the 10 markets. Sales fell by 1 per cent, as a series of patents expiring around the world undermined the market, which dropped from Dollars 7.13bn to Dollars 6.91bn.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

In a speech to the European Parliament at the start of a tour of EC countries, Mr Menem said that by failing to agree to compromise proposals on farm trade the Community risked sparking a trade war. 'The reluctance of certain European governments to accept a progressive dismantling of agricultural subsidies will bring with it serious consequences for international trade,' the Argentine leader said. 'Can the principle of free trade, which should govern trade relations, be subordinated in the area of agriculture to the diktat of a definitively minority sector?' Argentina is a member of the Cairns group campaigning for a liberalisation of farm trade in the current round of talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

0,FT944-6775 ,"FT944-6775 _AN-EK1C5AEAFT 941128   FT  28 NOV 94 / Markets: The point of maximum danger - Global Investor      By BRONWEN MADDOX   If you take the word of 40 leading European industrialists, the region's manufacturing companies are now at the 'point of maximum danger' in the economic cycle. The report, prepared by the European Round Table ahead of next month's European summit in Essen, also argues that it is an illusion to believe that economic recovery signals an end to Europe's competitiveness crisis. The authors are right to draw that conclusion. Nine-month trading figures from Bayer and Hoechst, the German chemical and drug giants, which are expected today and Wednesday respectively, are likely to confirm many of the points raised. Pre-tax profits are expected to have rebounded from last year's depressed levels, but margins in some product areas are expected to show the effects of growing competition. In chemicals and petrochemicals in particular, the breathing space which margins have enjoyed recently may be shortlived. Competitors' new capacity which comes onstream shortly in Asia and America is expected to increase competition both in those countries and within Europe. The authors are right to point out, too, that one of the threats to profits is that wage settlements will edge upwards. They argue that at this stage in the economic cycle manufacturers often 'let loose' on costs, especially wages. Given the current backdrop of continent-wide industrial unrest, investors would be wrong to dismiss that threat. The authors may, though, make rather too much of this factor; it is too early to conclude from the current disputes that Europe's historically rigid wage structures have persisted through recession intact. The report's gloominess about Europe's high costs of energy, telecommunications and transport may also be warranted. When such markets are deregulated, the reduction in costs can be rapid: the liberalisation of European voice telephony, combined with privatisation of many of the telecommunications operators, is a case in point. Siemens, the German industrial group, says that European prices for switching and transmission equipment have fallen in real terms by about 7 per cent in each of the last three years, and by even more in Germany. The cause is partly recession and partly the increasingly open procurement policies adopted by its customers, including Deutsche Telekom, Germany's state-owned telecoms monopoly, whose privatisation is forthcoming. But while companies across Europe will eventually benefit from lower telephone charges, the liberalisation puts great pressure on the margins of suppliers, such as Siemens. Last year it reported a fall in new orders, and analysts are concerned that, despite spending 15 per cent of revenues in its communications divisions on research and development, it will struggle to hold margins and market share within Europe. The paradox is that European companies want the benefits of liberalisation - such as lower utility costs which will enable them to compete better abroad  -but resent such measures when they stimulate competition on those companies' home turf. Similarly, while the 40 companies represented in the Round Table have called for cuts in public spending, much of the European pharmaceutical industry has been threatening governments that if public spending on drugs continues to be squeezed, great damage will be done to research and development, and so to the competitiveness of some of Europe's largest companies. In some sectors, the opposition of Europe's largest companies to such cost-reduction measures may stall them completely. Tomorrow's meeting in Brussels of European Union energy ministers will serve to highlight the obstacles to the Commission's drive to liberalise Europe's energy markets. The proposals to allow rival energy companies access to countries' power distribution networks has met with ferocious complaints from power companies. Given such opposition, investors may well be sceptical that European institutions will in the end be willing to make the changes necessary for competitiveness. That should not, though, distract investors from concern they should also feel about the prices paid for investments outside Europe. Not least, European chemical and pharmaceutical companies have made a string of forays in the past year into healthcare in the US, Asia and Eastern Europe. Hoechst, for one, has spent heavily on moving into emerging east European markets, and is negotiating several joint ventures in China. Mr Jurgen Dormann, Hoechst's chairman, has said that he aims to double sales in Asia to 20 per cent of group turnover. But the concern for investors is whether that is an adequately profitable escape from competition at home, given the ferocious competition already present in non-European markets. Mr Dormann acknowledged earlier this month that Hoechst had 'perhaps' paid too high a premium in last year's Dollars 546m purchase of 51 per cent of Copley, the US generic drugs maker. Moreover, despite Hoechst's anxiety to add several more mid-sized pharmaceuticals companies to its recently-acquired US interests in generic drugs, it says that it is waiting until acquisition multiples become more reasonable. It may have a long wait, however: there is little sign that they are doing so. Meanwhile, as investors brace themselves to hear the price paid in the sector's next takeover, they cannot afford to take too much comfort from the recovery of core earnings. While this week's results should confirm that picture, that is no guarantee that profit margins will be intact five years from now.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 24/11/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  % change over period                        US    Japan    Germany   France    Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 0.11    0.04      0.09      0.10      0.16   0.09 Month                0.42    0.19      0.41      0.45      0.70   0.46 Year                 3.69    2.06      5.31      5.82      8.63   5.19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                  0.48   0.65      0.73      0.79      0.37   0.61 Month                -0.04   1.08      1.35      1.35      1.48   2.19 Year                 -2.32  -0.35      0.98      0.28      3.44   0.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                  0.32   0.91      1.47      1.69      0.52   1.26 Month                -0.19   1.44      2.80      2.40      1.86   3.32 Year                 -6.31  -1.44     -2.56     -5.02     -2.20  -2.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                  -2.8   -2.8      -2.0      -2.5      -1.6   -2.8 Month                 -1.9   -5.6       1.2       4.6       0.3    0.6 Year                   0.7    1.4      -0.1      -2.6      21.4    3.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash  Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

""Europe -- its present, its so-called `expansion' and its  future -- were high on the agenda of the forum,"" says Klaus. ""I  must admit that I had to oppose a bit the ideas regarding the  expansion since I am convinced that no one can ever extend (or  narrow) it (Europe).""    ""Our experience says that Europe's success (or failure) does  not depend so much on the existence, extent and activities of  multilateral European institutions, but to a much greater degree  on the type and structure of the political, social, and economic  systems that exist in European countries,"" Klaus says.    He notes that ""we know very well that the reason we lag  behind (Western Europe) and for our not quite happy life in the  past four decades was not the existence of the (now defunct)  Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), but the  communist regime (toppled in Czechoslovakia in November 1989).  Symmetrically, this is true also in the opposite direction:  Western Europe's success did not depend on institutions of the  European Community but on a free society, private ownership, and  a free market,"" Klaus says. He adds that ""this was true in the  past, is true now, and will be true in the future, too.""    ""These days, it is being decided whether or not Eastern  Europe will preserve this system and will not let it degenerate  into a new form of collectivism.... The success of Europe is  dependent on the degree of freedom of the individual, free  market and trade, on the ability to get rid of the state's  useless interference in the lives of people and their economic  activities, on the elimination of bureaucratic manipulation with  all of us, on our resolve and courage to suppress the strength  of the powerful ... lobbying groups and on our ability to put  in order fundamental economic attributes, especially our work  with awards which we get for it,"" Klaus says.    ""In these attributes it is necessary to carefully specify  the  conditions of a potential favorable impact of multilateral  European institutions on our future,"" Klaus says. However, he  fears that ""the careful formulating of these conditions is being  forgotten due to the simplified and a priori accepted argument  that without Europe's unity we shall be 'small' and 'weak' and  'unable to compete' with other regions in the world.""    ""The Czech Republic claims that Czech lands have always been  part of Europe and therefore they do not want to be deprived of  various advantages ensuing from partnership in European  institutions. We wish to be an 'equal partner' who does not  only seek to obtain something, but we are also ready to give,""  Klaus says.     "

They said the EC's executive complained to the European  Court  of Justice that France, Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Italy and the  Netherlands were retaining the monopolies in contravention of  the EC's principles of free competition.    The move is an attempt to pressure the six countries into  accepting a directive from the Commission that they should make  their state-owned utility networks available to power companies  from other countries.    The directive has been blocked for nearly two years. The  Commission is targeting France for its electricity and gas  monopolies, Denmark for gas, and Spain, Italy, Ireland and the  Netherlands for their electricity monopolies.    Commission officials said the liberalisation of the power  and  gas markets was essential if the EC's single market was to work  properly.

Local projects to  treat the waste are unrealistic and the Japanese assistance is  hanging in the air.    It is precisely for this reason that the interdepartmental  commission working at the Zvezda Works made a sensational  decision on the necessity to discharge the liquid radioactive  waste into the Sea of Japan, as was done before, because nothing  else can be done. Ahead is the dismantling of a further number  of nuclear submarines, more than 40.     "

He was announcing the death of the Commission's steel restructuring plan, created two years ago to help restore the beleaguered industry to health during Europe's deep recession. Mr Van Miert said industry's failure to stick to the plan had left it with overcapacity in the EU of some 20m tonnes. 'It is unfortunate that in this plan not all the actors did what needed to be done,' he said. Under the plan, Europe's steelmakers were required to make minimum cuts in capacity of 19m tonnes, but fell short of this target by around 3.5m tonnes. Enthusiasm for the capacity cuts wore off as international steel prices began to recover steadily. Disbandment of the plan means that there will be no more discussion between the commission and industry over the state of the market, with the Commission dropping its quarterly guidelines for production and delivery volumes. In addition, measures to restrict imports from eastern Europe - in particular from Slovakia and the Czech Republic - will be dropped. 'Normal competitive conditions will apply,' said Mr Van Miert. The German Steel Federation criticised the decision, saying that its members had done their part to cut capacity, 'trusting that the European Commission would continue its efforts for market stabilisation until a successful conclusion'. Since 1992 German companies had made decisions to cut 6m tonnes of crude steel and almost 3m tonnes of hot-rolled products, it said. Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann has said the EU industry was wrong to put off needed restructuring because of a temporary recovery in the market. 'They'll be knocking (on the door) again in three years time,' said a Commission official. The recovery is in part due to increased exports to the US and Asia, said Mr Alan Coats, a steel analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London. He said the industry cannot depend on exports for continued health, especially since imports from eastern Europe and Russia were likely to grow. Despite the collapse of the rescue plan, a package of social subsidies, designed to ease the impact of steel plant closures, will continue to apply until the end of 1995, the Commission said yesterday. The Commission has also decided to recommend to member states that they accept the German government's bid to rescue Eko Stahl, east Germany's largest steel mill, through a hefty state subsidy.

The revised strategy for the slimmed-down bank, now headed by Mr Jacques de Larosiere, former managing director of the IMF, was drawn up after the resignation of Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's first president. This followed a stormy annual meeting in London last year and attacks on over-spending, excessive bureaucracy and neglect of the needs of fledgling entrepreneurs. The new focus has already upgraded the merchant banking aspect of the bank's activities, headed by Mr Ron Freeman, a former US investment banker, at the expense of the development banking side. The EBRD was always intended to focus at least 60 per cent of its spending on private projects, not to replicate traditional infrastructure projects financed by the World Bank and EIB. The bank's potentially strategic role in financing the reconstruction or clos-ure of eastern Europe's dangerous Soviet-designed nuclear power stations has also been frustrated by legal delays.

0,FT933-3319 ,"FT933-3319 _AN-DINC7AGQFT 930914   FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (3): It's a shame there aren't any trains - Spotlight on Waterloo International Terminal / Andrew Taylor on London's latest railway station, built on time and to budget      By ANDREW TAYLOR   BY NOW, up to 5,500 Channel tunnel passengers an hour should be entering and leaving London's newest railway station. Right on time, and on budget, Waterloo International station opened on Monday, May 17 1993. Unfortunately, although the new ticket offices were ready for business, the trains and the Channel tunnel were not. The 50km tunnel, which has been plagued by disagreements over payments to contractors, is not now due to open until March next year, 10 months later than originally planned. Delays in providing engines and rolling stock mean that the first international passenger trains linking London and Paris and Brussels are not expected to start running until next summer. Then, passengers will be able to take the three-hour journey from the centre of London to the Gare du Nord in the heart of Paris, providing competition to the airlines. Construction of the new Waterloo station has been a remarkable success, proving that large-scale, complex engineering projects can be completed in Britain to time and within budget. The main factor has been the close co-operation between the client, in this case a state-owned railway, and private sector designers, contractors and engineering consultants. This has enabled the project team to overcome unexpected problems and accommodate late-breaking design changes without triggering large numbers of claims for extra payments. John Brown, the engineering arm of Trafalgar House, which together with British Rail, managed the project, says that the level of claims has been half that it would normally expect 'on an inter- national job of this scale and complexity'. It has been no easy task to build a modern international station, astride crumbling 100-year-old Victorian brick arches in the middle of one of Europe's busiest capitals, without disrupting traffic at the domestic Waterloo mainline station next door, handling up to 10,000 commuters an hour at peak travel times. At one stage concrete lorries were arriving every two minutes, 12 hours a day, say the project managers. The roof of the terminal alone is composed of two acres of glass and 1,000 tonnes of steelwork. The construction team spent Pounds 250,000 erecting and dismantling a 50 metres by 25 metres section of the roof at a test site in Yorkshire before giving the go-ahead for assembly to start. 'The roof was a critical part of construction,' says John Brown. 'It was a difficult shaped site and the roof required glass panels to over-lap, like scales of a fish. We needed to ensure that everything would work and that sub-contractors could cope before beginning work. It was some of the best money we spent on the project.' A lot of the credit for its success belongs to architects Nicholas Grimshaw which designed the station which snakes along the top of the old railway arches for 400 metres, tapering at one end to satisfy the tight confines of the site. Adding to the problems of contractors was the fact that they were excavating part of the site within 12ft of the roof of the Bakerloo line. There was a danger that the underground track would float upwards, distorting and cracking the walls of the tunnel as layers of heavy sticky London clay were removed from above. Sir Alexander Gibb, which prepared the design brief for the civil engineering works, calculated that only small sections of clay should be excavated at any one time. These holes were filled with the concrete foundations and the base of the terminal's car park before moving on to construct the next section. The work was so successful that the diameter of the tube line increased by only 7mm on one 10-metre section during the excavation, well within the tolerances calculated by the international engineering consultants. Another problem was to prevent damage to the brick arches caused by the lateral force of 400-metre-long express trains braking as they arrived at the station. The solution was to install concrete cross braces, about 15 metres high and 10 metres broad under the track bed. Constructing the terminal alongside the existing domestic station created another tricky engineering problems. One end of the century-old wrought iron roof had to be dismantled to allow the construction of the glass and stainless steel roof of the adjoining international terminal. The old roof was beautifully constructed, says Gibb, incorporating large numbers expansion joints to accommodate movement caused by heat and wind. 'We had to be extremely carefully how we braced this structure to prevent it collapsing once part of the roof had been been removed.' The station had originally been expected to handle 7m passengers a year with immigration and customs controls, similar to those at airports, incorporated within the complex. By the time it was completed the station was capable of taking 15m passengers a year, double the capacity of Terminal Four at Heathrow Airport, London, though that is several times larger than than the railway station. It has also been decided that passport checks will be conducted on trains rather than at Waterloo to avoid delays. Contractors, engineering consultants and architects have had to be flexible to accommodate the changing brief of the project. The project team gave a lot of credit to Bovis which organised the placing of the construction contracts with sub-contractors so as to minimise problems which might have been caused by changes to the design of the building. Regular scheduled meetings at director level were held between all the senior members of the project team to ensure that any problems were solved quickly and did not have a knock-on effect on other works. John Brown says the management team established a command structure and lines of communication similar to those used on successful North Sea oil and gas projects. This created a tight-knit team and ensured that information about design changes flowed quickly to those who needed to know so that construction schedules could be reorganised accordingly. The project team, therefore, was able to respond quickly when it was decided late in the project that full meals for first class passengers would be provided on trains after all. The change in policy meant that the station design had to be altered to accommodate catering facilities for loading meals. The result is a modern, international passenger terminal, gleaming in glass and steel, that has been built to time and budget with a minimum of fuss and disruption next door to one of London's busiest railway stations. It is just a shame that the trains are not ready yet.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Waterloo International Station  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cost: pounds130m                           Construction time: 30 months Project managers: British Rail/John Brown  Architect: Nicholas Grimshaw Design consultants: Sir Alexander Gibb, YRM, Anthony Hunt, Cass Hayward, J Roger Preston       Construction manager: Bovis Construction  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

But after what has  happened in Hebron there can no longer be any postponement.  Yitzhaq Rabin must choose: peace or the settlements."" This is  what Ahmad al-Tibi maintains. He is currently the most  authoritative individual among the Palestinians in the  territories: He is in charge of relations with PLO headquarters  in Tunis. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres met with  al-Tibi on 27 February to discuss the measures adopted by the  government to put a stop to the actions of extremist colonists.    [L'UNITA] How do you judge the measures taken by the Israeli  Government against the extreme right-wing Jewish movements?    [Al-Tibi] The measures adopted by Rabin can perhaps reduce  the pain but they do not extirpate the disease. The disease  that can terminate the peace process is represented by the  Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank.    [L'UNITA] But is the disarmament of the more extremist  faction of the colonists not a first step to reopening the issue  of the future of the settlements?    [Al-Tibi] I would not be so confident. I think that the  measures currently adopted represent the maximum ""concession""  that Rabin is willing to make, not only to the Palestinians but  also to the left wing of his party and the government. Rabin  talks of disarming the extremist elements among the colonists  but it is precisely on the concept of ""extremists"" that we  disagree with the Israeli prime minister.    [L'UNITA] Do you think that there are extremists in the  settlements?    [Al-Tibi] Certainly, and not only the ""Kakh"" activists. In  the meeting held Sunday evening with Peres, I asked a question  and am still waiting for a response: How does the Israeli  Government judge the head of the Kiryat Arba settlement who  refused to condemn the massacre at the Tomb of the Patriarchs:  Is he an extremist or not? There are extremist groups that have  not yet committed crimes like the one in Hebron, but their  militants play an active role in the Arab manhunt, attack  Palestinians in the streets, destroy their cars, and impede any  productive activity. My question to Rabin is: Are these not  extremists who should be disarmed? As far as we are concerned,  the answer is yes. Even these elements, and there are thousands  of them, should be disarmed. Before returning to the  negotiating table, we want to verify the criteria that the  Israeli authorities will use to determine who is extremist and  must be disarmed and who instead has the right to go about the  Occupied Territories with a machine gun and pistols.    [L'UNITA] The ""Meretz"" leaders, who also have never approved  the colonization of the territories carried out by right-wing  governments, maintain that Israel could not support a sudden  turnabout on the settlements.    [Al-Tibi] I understand their concern, but they must also  realize that the politics of always postponing, and delaying,  the issue of dismantling the settlements to ""a later date,"" has  only produced hate, violence, and death in the territories. On  the other hand, we did not ask that all the settlements  disappear as of tomorrow. Our request is simply to place this  topic first on the negotiations agenda. In view of what  happened in Hebron, quite frankly this does not seem to be an  ""extremist"" request.    [L'UNITA] In concrete terms, what do you Palestinians  consider as being the best way to solve the problem of the  settlements?    [Al-Tibi] Our principal concern today is that of protecting  the population in the territories from the violence of the  colonists. We feel that the best solution is to reconcile the  schedules for the evacuation of the settlements with the  withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza and Jericho. This  being for a reason that Israel cannot refuse to acknowledge: If  another massacre like the one at Hebron were to take place after  the entry into effect of the independence of the two  territories, the Palestinian population would accuse the PLO of  being jointly responsible for that crime, for having accepted  that the settlements remain standing. And this would mean  playing the game of the Hamas integralists.    [L'UNITA] 'Arafat in Tunis has once again asked the United  Nations to guarantee international protection for the  Palestinians in the territories, but Israel has rejected this  proposal.    [Al-Tibi] I find this rigidity by the Tel Aviv government  entirely unjustifiable, and I am saying this precisely on the  basis of what is sanctioned by the additional protocol of  Article 3 of the Declaration of Principles set out in Oslo. The  appendix reads: ""A temporary international presence may be  provided for in the area of Gaza and Jericho to guarantee the  implementation of the accords."" This is what we are asking for  today. Nothing more.    [L'UNITA] Among the decisions adopted by the Israeli  Government is the establishment of a commission of inquiry into  the Hebron massacre. What do you expect from this commission?    [Al-Tibi] The verification that the military authorities  were  responsible for not having guaranteed safety in holy places. It  is not sufficient to punish the soldiers who fired at the exit  of the mosque. The Israeli Army is called upon to guarantee  safety to all inhabitants of the West Bank. But up to now it  has interpreted this mandate in a unilateral sense: For the  Israeli military commandos, the Palestinians are the potential  terrorists and not people to be protected from the violence of  the colonists.    [L'UNITA] But the Israeli Government is claiming that  disarming all the colonists would be the same as handing them  over to ""Hamas.""    [Al-Tibi] It is the opposite: It is the presence of the  colonists, with their charge of violence that is helping Hamas  to justify their armed battle. Because those settlements,  together with the massive presence of the Israeli Army, are the  living symbol of an occupation that is still present, despite  Washington. The only way to save peace is by separating the two  communities.    [L'UNITA] And now, Dr. al-Tibi, what will happen?    [Al-Tibi] The future of the talks is hanging by a thread: It  is up to Israel and the United States not to break it. More  than five months have passed since the signing of the accords on  Gaza and Jericho, but life in the territories has not improved:  People continue to suffer and die. What has been promised must  be implemented, and it must be done as soon as possible. Today  the restart of talks passes necessarily through Kiryat Arba,  Ariel, and the other Jewish settlements in the territories.  Peace is incompatible with this presence. Rabin must take note  of this. But if the colonists are not disarmed, if Israel once  again refuses to discuss the times and the ways for dismantling  the settlements, then we will be obliged to tell our people to  pick up their weapons, because this would be the only way of  protecting ourselves.

Contract Signed to This Effect. Everyone Should be Pleased,  Including Ukraine""]    [Text] An executive contract between Russia and the United  States on deliveries of Russian weapons-grade uranium to the  United States was signed at 1000 yesterday in the secluded  atmosphere of Collegium Hall of the former Ministry of Medium  Machine-Building (now the Ministry of Atomic Energy). Making a  short speech before the signing of the document, Viktor  Mikhaylov, Russian Federation minister of atomic energy, pointed  out that the ceremony was taking place in a historic room: All  decisions on the creation of nuclear weapons in Russia had been  made right there, and foreign visitors were present there for  the first time.    One should think that in citing this fact the minister  wished  once again to emphasize the historic importance of the event.  Indeed, this contract (from the Russian side it was signed by  Albert Shishkin, president of the ""Tekhnosnabeksport"" foreign  trade company of the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic  Energy, and on the American side by the director of the U.S.  Enrichment Corporation -- USEC -- William Timbers) signals the  start of real disarmament. In line with its provisions, 500  tonnes of weapons-grade uranium are supposed to be sold to the  United States over 20 years (Russia's aggregate stocks of  weapons-grade uranium are 1,250 tonnes). Thus, more than 20,000  nuclear warheads will be destroyed. During the first five  years, 10 tonnes will be sold each year, and 30 tonnes a year  will be sold during the following years. This schedule is  explained by the fact that neither Russia nor the United States  has the production facilities at the moment for the depletion of  enriched uranium (from 90 to 5 percent). Nonetheless the level  of such technology in Russia proves to be higher than in the  United States.    To implement the contract, the world's largest joint  Russian-  American uranium company is being created. It should be  stressed in this connection that the United States controls 50  percent of the world uranium market today; Russia controls 5 to  6 percent of the market while having the same uranium production  facilities. The contract that was signed means in fact that the  United States is letting Russia use one of the segments of its  market.    Answering a question from your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent on how it had become possible to resolve within  the framework of the contract the question that proved to be a  stumbling block while the document was in preparation (the U.S.  Government insisted on sharing profits from the sales of uranium  between Russia and Ukraine), Mikhaylov said that there too it  became possible to find a mutually acceptable option. Profit  from the sales of weapons-grade uranium from strategic nuclear  warheads, if any, will be partially returned to Ukraine in the  shape of fuel compacts for its nuclear electric power stations.  As for battlefield nuclear weapons, according to the minister,  experts of Russia and Ukraine are yet to determine whether any  profit is possible there at all. Russia is already spending  millions of dollars on the dismantling and transportation alone  of battlefield nuclear weapons from Ukraine. (Incidentally, the  dismantling and storing of one nuclear warhead in the United  States costs between $30 and $100,000; in Russia the cost is a  tenth of the amount because our personnel are paid less).    Viktor Mikhaylov also stressed that, in his opinion, Ukraine  should be pleased with the signed Russian-American document:  ""Unless this problem is solved today, Ukraine itself in a couple  of years would have to pay someone who would undertake to  dismantle its nuclear missiles.    Neither will the United States come out a loser: during the  first year alone of the implementation of the contract, weapons-  grade uranium from Russia will provide fuel for 15 American  nuclear reactors. Energy generated by them would provide  electricity for 10 million homes.    At the same time, despite the substantial sum of the  contract  -- nearly $12 billion -- the Russian Federation Ministry of  Atomic Energy will only be able to pay part of its nuclear  warhead recycling costs out of it.

Veterans from the Pacific  Fleet and the city of Vladivostok have come to the commander's  support, along with the Council of Soldiers' and Sailors'  Mothers....    Grachev's telegram to the Pacific Fleet stated that Adm.  Gurinov had been dismissed for ""...serious shortcomings in his  organizational activity relating to leadership of the Fleet.""  The accusation was formulated in the relatively classic way --  it can be used to remove any commander, including a flag  officer. And at any time, if we proceed on the Dostoyevskiyan  basis that ""...absolutely anyone can be blamed for anything.""  Just how far does Gurinov's guilt square with this very severe  punishment? Why have Pacific Fleet sailors been taking a moral  stand in defending their senior admiral en masse -- going  against the unwritten list of bans that prevents people speaking  up for their commander before his superiors?    In order to understand this, we need to compare the  situation  in the Pacific Fleet a year ago, before Gurinov arrived, with  the way things are now.    Difficult Inheritance    Last May, when IZVESTIYA was introducing Adm. Gurinov to  readers as the Pacific Fleet Commander, we noted that he was  inheriting a lot of naval problems. We need only recall the  monstrous neglect and complete chaos at the Fleet's training  schools on Russkiy Island, where four sailors died of  starvation, cold, maltreatment, and illness. The then command  was very much involved in commerce. Pacific Fleet auxiliaries  suddenly turned up off foreign shores in the hands of very  dubious firms. The Fleet was constantly rocked by accidents and  people would be killed. The combat training indicators were  very low....    The Pacific Fleet is the kind of cumbersome organization  that  takes years to get to know and get to grips with its problems.  Gurinov managed to change a lot in one year. This is not my  opinion -- it is the view of prestigious military and naval  specialists (around 100 of them) who, on the instructions of the  Defense Ministry and the Naval High Command, recently carried  out comprehensive checks of all the local services and combined  units. Speaking at the time at a press conference on the results  of the checks, Igor Kasatonov, Deputy Commander in Chief of the  Navy, made a high assessment of the Fleet's combat readiness,  had some warm words to say about its commander, and referred  approvingly to the morale climate in combined and other units....    Military matters are a subtle area -- they are not something  you discuss with ""all and sundry."" But here is, for us, an  important and accurate piece of information -- under Adm.  Gurinov's command the Pacific Fleet significantly improved all  the main objective indicators of its activity (its  operational-tactical and headquarters training), strengthened  military discipline, reduced its accident rate.... Ships that  had been languishing offshore finally put to sea, and the combat  training plan was completely fulfilled.    We would note that the current command is steering the Fleet  through the turbulent maelstroms and deadly shoals of our common  life -- which is by no means improving. We should ponder on the  fact that since the start of the year the Pacific Fleet has not  been allocated even 25 percent of the minimum amount of  appropriations it had requested. There is not even enough money  to pay wages. There are no funds to deliver provisions and fuel  to remote Fleet centers scattered around the coastline and  islands. Ships return from combat standby duty and the crews  should be sent on leave, but it is impossible -- there is no  money to buy tickets from Aeroflot. Housing construction for  officers has virtually ground to a halt -- in May, for instance,  only 350 million rubles [R] of the R18.5 billion required for  these purposes were allocated....    Despite these and many other circumstances beyond its  control, the Pacific Fleet is, to use military language,  ""fulfilling its mission"" and carrying out its difficult job,  which has now lost all its romance.    So what exactly happened between April and early May to make  Pavel Grachev suddenly describe the Pacific Fleet as the worst  in the Armed Forces and call its commander unsuitable? That is  a puzzle not only to the men of the Pacific Fleet. Why, they  ask, are some people keeping their commands when performance and  morale are plummeting, while others lose their jobs at a time  when, despite everything, they have the situation ""under  control""?    Since not the slightest attempt was made to offer a reason  for the Pacific Fleet commander's removal, this gave rise to a  lot of assumptions. The usual intrigues -- including military  intrigues -- are suspected in Moscow's corridors of power. But  more often people say that the reason for the admiral's  dismissal is connected with the explosions at the Novonezhino  arsenals.    Special Danger Zone    Every morning I turn on the radio in suspense to hear what  has blown up where. If there is no such report, I breathe  easier -- we have gotten away with it. But in general, there  are so many accidents, particularly here in the Far East, that  it sometimes seems as though they are being churned out by some  diabolical factory with a view to depriving us of our spiritual  peace. It would be better not to know what kind of dangerous  stuff is hidden away from view in the harmless-sounding  ""prohibited areas"" that are scattered across all parts of the  Far East, even to be found in cities shaded by nearby woods.  About a year ago a retired military man who had ""nothing to  lose"" -- since he was emigrating that very day to live in one of  our nearest-neighbor countries -- came into the IZVESTIYA  correspondents' center and said that there was a chemical  weapons arsenal in Khabarovsk behind a green-shaded corner as  you turn toward the Krasnaya stream. One faulty bomb is all it  would take to do away with this city of 700,000.    We who live here would like to know how reliably these most  dangerous weapons are guarded and by whom. But unfortunately,  when we are talking about arms, particularly of such a dangerous  type, social forces become socially impotent. We find ourselves  in servile dependence on Defense Ministry generals and we are  forced to reassure ourselves with the mantra: ""They have a  clearer picture."" Admittedly, in this instance the people of  Khabarovsk can be reassured: In preparing this article, I  phoned Lieutenant General Valeriy Samsonov, chief of staff of  the Far East Military District, who told me that the chemical  weapons arsenal had been removed from Khabarovsk. But how many  other arsenals are left?    The military told me that, when the thousands of tonnes of  bombs went off at Novonezhino, they prayed that the missile fuel  dumps nearby would not go up by accident or (it does not bear  thinking about!) some smoldering rocket would not fly off to  Bolshoy Kamen and hit a submarine with a nuclear reactor. As is  now clear, the sheer chance that the explosions in Vladivostok  and Novonezhino happened on the same day -- 14 May -- two years  apart is seen by many people as neatly preordained, and even the  possibility of sabotage is not being ruled out. Our usual lack  of organization has been evident in our investigation into the  cause of this latest disaster. But more of this later; for now  we will try to see how many weapons and munitions have been  amassed in the Pacific Fleet alone, who guards them, and in what  way.    I have obtained the document -- a submission from the  Military Prosecutor's Office -- ""On Eradicating Violations of  Legislation on the Storage of Weapons, Ammunition, and  Explosives."" This is the fruit of a two-month (February-March  last year) investigation into the Pacific Fleet's arsenals  carried out not only by prosecution personnel but also by  specialists from the Navy High Command's Missile and Artillery  Armaments Directorate. Here are some selected extracts from the  document:    ""...The bulk of the arms checked do not accord with the  requirements of the guidance document on ensuring the  safekeeping of weapons and ammunition. The premises in which  they are stored are not made of reinforced concrete or of brick  with reinforced concrete roofs and floors. Many dumps are too  full and the ammunition is not stacked safely. Appropriations  for the construction of new dumps are not being allocated. Not  a single paragraph of the long-term plan for the construction of  technical security facilities in 1991-1995 has been carried out.  As a result, most of the installations checked have homemade  alarm systems which cannot provide reliable security. Almost  half of the wooden boxes in which the weapons and ammunition are  stored are unsuitable, stacks of shells of different calibers  have collapsed, shells are scattered around and many of them are  rusty, yet they are not being written off or destroyed....""    We would note in passing that these outrages were happening  before Adm. Gurinov even arrived to command the Fleet, so that  according to normal logic he should not be held responsible for  them. As a rule, the arsenals were replenished irrespective of  the real needs of the Pacific Fleet or of what its commanders  wanted. There are plenty of examples of this, but we will take  the most immediate -- the Novonezhino arsenal. Rear Admiral  German Ugryumov, Pacific Fleet chief of military  counterintelligence, told me that at the time of the explosion  around 2,000 standard carloads of aviation ammunition of various  yields and calibers had built up there -- almost three times  more than the potential storage norm. A considerable proportion  of this dangerous cargo was dispatched here, on the orders of  the Defense Ministry leadership, from...the Baltic. Maybe the  shores of the Pacific were in particular need of bombs,  missiles, and shells that were superfluous to the Baltic? It  turns out that they were transported across the entire country  so as to be...destroyed here. It is ideas like that, not a lack  of ideas, that constitute real stupidity.    Ammunition to be recycled accounted for more than 70 percent  of what was stored in the Novonezhino dumps. How much is at  other dumps? This is a big secret, but people in the know have  told me that Defense Ministry officials have long regarded the  Russian Far East as a huge dump for radioactive material and  explosives. The local authorities are stubbornly trying to  ensure the adoption of a national program for the destruction of  unnecessary armaments. The government assures us that there are  no funds available at the moment, while...throwing away much  bigger sums on endlessly ""overcoming obstacles."" For instance,  Svetlana Parinov, chairman of the Maritime Kray Economics and  Planning Committee, reported that the Novonezhino explosion  would cost the treasury at least R31 billion. This amount does  not include the losses suffered by the Fleet. Add to this the  colossal expenditure on the clear-up operations after the  explosions at the Vladivostok arsenal two years ago and  innumerable ""trivial"" accidents of which Russian readers are no  longer informed because they are considered so routine....    Who has worked out how much money will be needed to guard  and  maintain ""dead"" -- decommissioned -- nuclear submarines? Their  missile launchers are removed, but their nuclear reactors remain  in place. These need to be constantly monitored by highly  skilled specialists in order to prevent a disaster. These craft  have been waiting to be recycled for years, and they are being  joined by new submarines all the time.... Their crews,  disbanded on paper, have been forced to continue their now  simply stupid, although extremely responsible service.    If such fabulous expenditure is to be avoided, the  government  should clearly come up with the funds to set up facilities to  destroy unnecessary arms. But clearly we should start by  organizing reliable security at the arsenals. The way this is  currently organized is graphically visible from the same  prosecution submission:    ""...Weapons and ammunition dumps in the Pacific Fleet are  mainly guarded by squads of paramilitary security force riflemen  which, owing to their low pay, are not fully staffed and  experience considerable manpower turnover. Absences without  leave and drunkenness are widespread among the security  staff....""    Now let us imagine the old men and women compelled out of  great necessity (who would agree to guard weapons dumps far from  home, without any uniforms or normal food, for a miserable  salary?) to guard things on which not only human life but the  continued presence on the map of entire cities depends. And  this is happening at a time when criminal structures are doing  everything to get their hands on weapons.    The Boys Wanted a Little Silver...    Let us return to the Novonezhino explosion. It is now clear  that it was not the result of an agricultural fire, as all the  press had initially reported. The accident was caused by two  sailors from the arsenal's security subunit. The motives and  circumstances of the incident were set out in such a  contradictory way by the newspapers that I turned for the most  accurate information to Boris Larichev, Pacific Fleet deputy  military prosecutor, who is conducting the criminal case. Here  is what he said:    ""That day Seamen D. and A. were not on patrol. D. had heard  that aircraft missile battery units contained silver, and, after  he had whispered the information to his comrades, they  infiltrated the dump. They found the missile stacks and, not  knowing where the battery units were located, started unscrewing  something with a bayonet. This turned out to be a tracking  flare -- it ignites when the missile is fired and burns for  around 20-25 seconds. Ignition can be triggered by friction or  a blow, which is what happened -- D.'s blade cut through the  foil covering the tracking flare and it ignited right in D.'s  hand. The sailor was burned, and then the whole rack caught  fire. The guys were scared, ran to the guardhouse, and then  took cover with the entire guard behind some mounds....""    This is what the Fleet got from these stupid young men who  had reinforced their untoward tendencies at vocational and  technical college. Now they face Article 251 ""footnote"" of the  Russian Federation Criminal Code -- ""violation of the  regulations governing the handling of weapons and items and  substances posing a heightened danger to those in the  vicinity...."" This article provides for terms of imprisonment  ranging from three to 15 years. The courts will probably  consider the fact that, thank God, nobody died during the  explosions to be an extenuating circumstance. This time we got  away with it.    Now let us enquire just what sort of order reigns in that  security detachment if the sailors could ""fumble about"" in the  arsenal entirely unmolested. The fact is that there was hardly  any security provided at all for a huge number of terrible  weapons. There were only 16 guards on duty instead of the 64  there should have been. No observation was being carried out  from guard towers and no checks were being done at checkpoints.  Contrary to regulations, these measures were replaced by  patrols of sailors armed only with bayonets around the four-km  perimeter of the arsenal. Yet it was storing not just aviation  ammunition but various small arms, which are so attractive to  the criminal world and those connected with it. Here at the  Novonezhino dumps forged documents had recently been used to  steal 41 Kalashnikov assault rifles, 31 Makarov pistols, 140  grenades, and over 20,000 rounds.... The crime was committed  with the participation of Major Votinov, former chief of the  arsenal, and other officers and staff from law-enforcement  organs. These weapons are now being confiscated from the mafia  and hired killers....    The Fleet and the people of the Far East know that Gurinov  had begun to seriously restore order at Pacific Fleet arsenals.  He issued a stern order to shoot to kill anyone who attempted  to infiltrate military arms dumps. The decision to dismiss him  leaves people confused and bitter.     "

The Dutch company had sales of Dollars 1.12bn, just Dollars 16m ahead of Intel, the world's largest merchant semiconductor manufacturer with worldwide sales in excess of Dollars 5bn. Intel's success is built on its best-selling microprocessors, including the 386 and 486 chips used in the majority of personal computers of IBM design. In Europe, the company's revenues grew 45 per cent, taking it from fifth to second place. Its US competitor, Motorola, moved to third with sales of Dollars 976m, a 26 per cent advance on the year before. European companies Siemens and SGS-Thomson slipped to fourth and fifth places respectively. INTEL, the US chipmaker, became the world's largest semiconductor supplier in 1992, overtaking NEC and Toshiba of Japan, according to a market survey published yesterday by Dataquest, the US market research group, writes Louise Kehoe. Intel's revenues grew by 26 per cent in the year, a rise of over Dollars 1bn. NEC and Toshiba, ranked two and three, showed a modest 4 per cent growth.   Companies:-  Philips Electronics.

0,FT934-3590 ,"FT934-3590 _AN-DLHC7AEIFT 931208   FT  08 DEC 93 / Delors fights work deregulation: Brussels believes unemployed cannot be 'priced into jobs'      By DAVID GARDNER      BRUSSELS   Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, will tell European Union leaders at their summit starting on Friday that cutting wages and wholesale labour market deregulation are not the ways to beat the jobs crisis and strengthen Europe's competitiveness. Cutting wages and pruning welfare payments to price Europe's unemployed into jobs would be 'socially unacceptable and politically untenable', and would 'only worsen the crisis by depressing domestic demand', according to the Commission white paper on growth and jobs. This strategy document, circulated yesterday to member state governments, is intended to be the centrepiece of the two-day Brussels summit. The Commission's approach contrasted sharply with the call yesterday from Unice, the EU employers' confederation, for a comprehensive reduction in labour costs and the privatisation of welfare systems. Unice's report, called 'Making Europe more Competitive', is timed to gain employers a voice in the summit debate. It wants: To reduce Europe's high non-wage labour costs, especially social security contributions for the low paid and young workers. Real wage increases below rises in productivity. Higher wage differentials, especially by cutting minimum wages and marginal tax rates. The Euro-employers also want relaxation of rules on working hours, easier hire-and-fire laws, lower unemployment benefit and more limited access to the social security system. In a manifesto that only the UK among the 12 would feel altogether comfortable with, Unice also wants a general roll-back of the public sector and a review of EU legislation with a view to scrapping regulation which implies costs for industry. The central employment section of the white paper emphasises lifelong training and retraining, lifting non-wage costs off low-skilled work, job-sharing and more part-time working within companies rather than as a national scheme. It envisages a big push to develop services for those seeking employment. 'Unemployment benefits can only be reduced so far before the poverty line is reached,' the white paper says, adding: 'These limits have already been reached in several countries.' A senior Commission official described the approach as 'not deregulation, but readjusting regulation to fit the present situation . . . social engineering that goes with the market.' The paper maintains that restored growth might deal with cyclical job losses, and advocates a big investment drive in information technology and pan-European rail, road and energy networks to raise competitiveness. But Mr Delors and Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner whose department designed the jobs strategy, say structural unemployment requires government and industry to promote more employment-intensive work patterns.

0,FT942-4139 ,"FT942-4139 _AN-EFLAKAAVFT 940611   FT  11 JUN 94 / Beijing defies west with N-test      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   China yesterday conducted its second underground nuclear test in less than a year in defiance of a US-sponsored informal international moratorium. The White House said it 'deeply regrets' the test and urged China to refrain from future testing, while Japan called the test 'regrettable'. China's foreign ministry, anticipating international criticism, said Beijing fully supported a comprehensive nuclear test ban, but reserved the right to continue testing in the meantime. 'China has all along exercised great restraint in conducting nuclear tests and the number . . . is extremely limited,' the statement said. The US conducted its last test in 1992. President Bill Clinton recently extended the US ban on testing until 1995. China's latest test is consistent with its desire to develop a defence capability commensurate with its growing economic and political importance. Yesterday's detonation was conducted at China's Lop Nor test site in remote Xinjiang province. Preparations, detected by Western 'spy' satellites, had been under way for weeks. China provided few details but in London the Verification Technology Information Centre said the test was estimated to be of medium yield at between 10 and 60 kilotons. The foreign ministry statement repeated China's call for 'nuclear weapons states to give up their policy of nuclear deterrence and commit themselves in explicit terms to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons'. China is among 38 nations involved in the Conference on Disarmament which began in January negotiating a comprehensive test ban treaty. China yesterday urged that the treaty be concluded by 1996. But Beijing has made no secret of its suspicion of the motives of the US and 'nuclear club' allies in seeking a moratorium on testing. China's arsenal of nuclear weapons is said to number between 250-300 warheads - the smallest among the five declared members of the nuclear club, including the US, Russia, Britain and France. Israel, India and Pakistan are also believed to possess a nuclear capability.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0," LA103190-0094   300694    October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition      View; Part E; Page 1; Column 3; View Desk      1198 words      FUTURIST TAKES STOCK OF THE PRESENT      By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      It was a busy morning for futurist Alvin Toffler. He sped through Los Angeles  like an electronic circuit rider, barely pausing for breath as he made the  rounds promoting his new book ""Powershift.""    In a two-hour span he polished off visits to KTWV Radio on Sunset Boulevard for  David Hirsch's ""The Wave Window,"" Cable News Network's television studios and a  live interview with Sonya Friedman, and KABC Radio for host Michael Jackson's  call-in show. The pace was appropriate for Toffler, whose specialty is  accelerated change and how we adapt to it.    ""We are living during one of the greatest turning points in history,"" maintains  the writer who made ""Future Shock"" a household phrase.    With his wife and collaborator, Heidi Toffler, he has monitored societal change  for the last 40 years, circling the globe, meeting with world leaders,  lecturing, consulting, researching and writing. (Although his preface  acknowledges his wife's ""intensive"" participation, and describes their work as  a partnership in research and conceptualization, Alvin Toffler, as the writer,  gets the author's credit).    Their role, he emphasizes, is not to make predictions about the future (""That  sounds like a fortuneteller""), but to clarify the present. And what he sees,  looking around the world today, is a top-to-bottom shake-up of unprecedented  proportions.    ""We are in for some very turbulent times,"" he said. ""The power systems that  held countries and institutions together are disintegrating -- not just  governments, but banks, trade unions, and the media.""    Eastern Europe's overthrow of Communist regimes and the dismantling of the  Berlin Wall have made part of the tumult obvious. But below that global  surface, the Tofflers identify manifold changes that affect the lives of  everyday people, as traditional institutions and authority figures start losing  their clout. For instance, the wide-ranging ""Powershift"" describes such  phenomenon as:    * The dethroning of medical doctors in the United States from ""white-coated  gods"" to a profession besieged by malpractice suits, insurance companies,  militant nurses, health-care conglomerates and patients who ""talk back.""    * The demise of banks as money nearly disappears as a medium of exchange,  replaced by a Video Age world of multiple ""designer currencies.""    * The growing interest of large corporations in acquiring small mom-and-pop  businesses to let them continue within the larger organization as ""fam-firm""  units valued for their flexibility.    * The weakening of the three television networks that now face so much  competition that their futures are in doubt.    These institutional shifts are only a sampling of an elaborate kaleidoscope of  change Toffler has incorporated in ""Powershift"" (Bantam Books, $27.95), an  ambitious, 550-page attempt to synthesize what the author describes as the  ""dawn of the Powershift era.""    ""It is about the crescendoing struggles for power that still face us as the  industrial civilization loses world dominance and new forces arise to tower  over the Earth,"" he writes. Essentially, the book expands on the information  explosion of the 1980s, and Toffler's own earlier writings, describing a world  moving from an industrial (or smokestack) society to a new computerized Age of  Information in which, says Toffler, power is directly linked to knowledge.  ""Knowledge has become central to economic development,"" he said. ""It's the new  raw material, taking the place of brute labor. That's what's new.""    In the Information Age he describes, power can be as simple as one person using  a fax machine to send information across the globe. Or it can be as complex as  global guerrilla groups utilizing satellites, lasers, computers, briefcase  weapons, precision targeting and a choice of viruses with which to attack  people or computers.    And that, he contends, is changing all patterns of relationships.    ""Powershift"" is being promoted by Bantam Books as the third in a trilogy  ""describing the emergent civilization of the 21st Century."" Toffler, a writer  and social analyst who carved out the specialty of trying to make sense of  ""accelerant change"" early in his career, also describes the books as a series,  noting that he first warned of the racing pace of change in ""Future Shock,"" his  1970 book, which sold an estimated 7 million copies around the world. A decade  later, Toffler's ""The Third Wave"" also became a worldwide bestseller, valued  for analyzing the direction of change from an industrial to a high-tech world.    And now, says the author, ""Powershift"" focuses on the control of changes still  to come -- who will shape them and how -- and questions that are still  unanswered.    The Tofflers, who maintain homes in Los Angeles and Connecticut, are voracious  readers and global travelers who have met with world leaders from Mikhail  Gorbachev to the late Indira Gandhi. ""Powershift"" is being published  simultaneously in Spain, Latin America, Germany and the Netherlands.    And in Japan, which Toffler describes as their ""next most important readership  after the United States,"" a television documentary is being prepared in  connection with the new book.    ""Japan is a very future-oriented culture,"" Heidi Toffler noted. ""They've been  onto the Information Age idea since we started talking about it.""    Added her husband: ""They glommed right onto it.

He sped through Los Angeles  like an electronic circuit rider, barely pausing for breath as he made the  rounds promoting his new book ""Powershift.""    In a two-hour span he polished off visits to KTWV Radio on Sunset Boulevard for  David Hirsch's ""The Wave Window,"" Cable News Network's television studios and a  live interview with Sonya Friedman, and KABC Radio for host Michael Jackson's  call-in show. The pace was appropriate for Toffler, whose specialty is  accelerated change and how we adapt to it.    ""We are living during one of the greatest turning points in history,"" maintains  the writer who made ""Future Shock"" a household phrase.    With his wife and collaborator, Heidi Toffler, he has monitored societal change  for the last 40 years, circling the globe, meeting with world leaders,  lecturing, consulting, researching and writing. (Although his preface  acknowledges his wife's ""intensive"" participation, and describes their work as  a partnership in research and conceptualization, Alvin Toffler, as the writer,  gets the author's credit).    Their role, he emphasizes, is not to make predictions about the future (""That  sounds like a fortuneteller""), but to clarify the present. And what he sees,  looking around the world today, is a top-to-bottom shake-up of unprecedented  proportions.    ""We are in for some very turbulent times,"" he said. ""The power systems that  held countries and institutions together are disintegrating -- not just  governments, but banks, trade unions, and the media.""    Eastern Europe's overthrow of Communist regimes and the dismantling of the  Berlin Wall have made part of the tumult obvious. But below that global  surface, the Tofflers identify manifold changes that affect the lives of  everyday people, as traditional institutions and authority figures start losing  their clout. For instance, the wide-ranging ""Powershift"" describes such  phenomenon as:    * The dethroning of medical doctors in the United States from ""white-coated  gods"" to a profession besieged by malpractice suits, insurance companies,  militant nurses, health-care conglomerates and patients who ""talk back.""    * The demise of banks as money nearly disappears as a medium of exchange,  replaced by a Video Age world of multiple ""designer currencies.""    * The growing interest of large corporations in acquiring small mom-and-pop  businesses to let them continue within the larger organization as ""fam-firm""  units valued for their flexibility.    * The weakening of the three television networks that now face so much  competition that their futures are in doubt.    These institutional shifts are only a sampling of an elaborate kaleidoscope of  change Toffler has incorporated in ""Powershift"" (Bantam Books, $27.95), an  ambitious, 550-page attempt to synthesize what the author describes as the  ""dawn of the Powershift era.""    ""It is about the crescendoing struggles for power that still face us as the  industrial civilization loses world dominance and new forces arise to tower  over the Earth,"" he writes. Essentially, the book expands on the information  explosion of the 1980s, and Toffler's own earlier writings, describing a world  moving from an industrial (or smokestack) society to a new computerized Age of  Information in which, says Toffler, power is directly linked to knowledge.  ""Knowledge has become central to economic development,"" he said. ""It's the new  raw material, taking the place of brute labor. That's what's new.""    In the Information Age he describes, power can be as simple as one person using  a fax machine to send information across the globe. Or it can be as complex as  global guerrilla groups utilizing satellites, lasers, computers, briefcase  weapons, precision targeting and a choice of viruses with which to attack  people or computers.    And that, he contends, is changing all patterns of relationships.    ""Powershift"" is being promoted by Bantam Books as the third in a trilogy  ""describing the emergent civilization of the 21st Century."" Toffler, a writer  and social analyst who carved out the specialty of trying to make sense of  ""accelerant change"" early in his career, also describes the books as a series,  noting that he first warned of the racing pace of change in ""Future Shock,"" his  1970 book, which sold an estimated 7 million copies around the world. A decade  later, Toffler's ""The Third Wave"" also became a worldwide bestseller, valued  for analyzing the direction of change from an industrial to a high-tech world.    And now, says the author, ""Powershift"" focuses on the control of changes still  to come -- who will shape them and how -- and questions that are still  unanswered.    The Tofflers, who maintain homes in Los Angeles and Connecticut, are voracious  readers and global travelers who have met with world leaders from Mikhail  Gorbachev to the late Indira Gandhi. ""Powershift"" is being published  simultaneously in Spain, Latin America, Germany and the Netherlands.    And in Japan, which Toffler describes as their ""next most important readership  after the United States,"" a television documentary is being prepared in  connection with the new book.    ""Japan is a very future-oriented culture,"" Heidi Toffler noted. ""They've been  onto the Information Age idea since we started talking about it.""    Added her husband: ""They glommed right onto it. As a matter of national policy,  their government helped smokestack industries like shipbuilding wind down and  convert to telecommunications and computers and robots.    ""In contrast, our politicians still think of the Information Age as a 'little  Silicon Valley thing.' ""    It is their feeling that not only our political systems but most of our  institutions are headed for major revamping before they are able to deal with  the new realities.

The International Campaign for Tibet also claimed people living near a top-secret nuclear facility had developed cancers because of careless handling of radioactive material. Chinese officials had no immediate comment on the Tibetan claims. Last year China firmly denied a charge by the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, that it was jettisoning radioactive waste in the Tibetan region. The ITC claimed that China had deployed nuclear missiles in at least three sites on the Tibetan plateau. It said that forced prison labour had been used to build the sites. 'China's positioning of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons on the Tibetan plateau has put many of India's major industrial and military facilities within striking distance of short-range missiles,' said the report entitled Nuclear Tibet. The report said the waste from a facility known as the 'Ninth Academy' in Qinghai province north-east of Tibet had been dumped in a 'roughshod and haphazard' manner. ITC also resurrected claims that China was planning to build a nuclear reactor near the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. Beijing rejects the claims. The US-based organisation, formed in 1988 to monitor human rights in Tibet, said its report was based on interviews with Chinese nuclear experts, government officials, and two ITC fact-finding missions. 'China's nuclear programme is only a fraction the size of those in the United States and the ex-Soviet Union. . . but in areas of nuclear proliferation, lack of worker safety and irresponsible waste disposal, China's record is as poor or even worse than those of other nuclear powers,' said the report. The Ninth Academy was used to design China's nuclear arsenal through the 1970s, and continues to be Beijing's primary nuclear arms research facility, the ITC report stated.

An extension of Nato up to, but not beyond, the borders of Russia would be a gross provocation to Russia and inimical to European security. It is true that, at an earlier stage, European security survived an analogous provocation in the shape of West Germany's rearmament and entry into Nato's military structure. But that change did not involve a shift of Nato's eastern frontier. The logic of Ruhe's position is that the collapse of communism and the dismantling of the Warsaw Pact is a pure external retreat by Russia, with no concomitant internal transformation of its values and ambitions. Some of us, to the contrary, are impressed by signs of fundamental change in Russia's political priorities. In particular, the country has shown itself able to accomplish a significant degree of transition from authoritarianism to democracy by its own internal volition.

In practice,  this means that stability on the continent -- and, more broadly  speaking, its fate -- will be the upshot of cooperation between  two powers ensconced outside Europe itself. It was confirmed  that our continent has ceased to be the arena of a possible  clash between them, but that -- as far as their interests are  concerned -- it remains divided between them in accordance with  the outcome of World War II. Compared with past decades, the  only difference now is that the two super-victors are moving  away from confrontation, with its risk of mutual destruction,  toward cooperation. Central Europe should now also infiltrate  into this concept for cooperation made possible by the collapse  of the Soviet regime.    Of course, as is becoming ever more obvious, the interests  of  the Central European countries -- until recently, part of the  so-called Soviet bloc -- are not completely safeguarded by this  global plan for U.S.-Russian cooperation. This disharmony is  due to the fact that their post-war ""discomfort"" was caused not  only by Soviet-U.S. nuclear rivalry, which is now being  eradicated but also by these Central European countries being  forced to subordinate themselves to unorganized development as a  result of Europe's partition after 1945, development that ran  counter to their historical, cultural, and economic existence.  This pitched them into backwardness from which they now want to  extricate themselves by a return to the community that  corresponds to their interests. The possibility of such a  return is also a crucial condition for their favorable future,  for their newly open historical perspective. An inconsistency  between the most intrinsic interests of former Soviet Central  Europe and the Partnership for Peace plan, which -- a little in  the style of consultations with Central American republics --  President Clinton came to Prague to explain, is foreshadowed  here. Partnership for Peace gives the Central European countries  the theoretical possibility of being selectively admitted into  NATO, an organization guaranteeing their security, only this  same possibility is also being offered -- without limits -- to  the whole of the Euro- Asian region, right up to Vladivostok.  This is the intention of Partnership, because it eradicates the  mutual Russian-U.S. challenge and creates a basis for strategic  cooperation.    However, as far as the Central European countries are  concerned, it is obvious that such a broadly proposed plan may  problematize, if not stymie, their development prospects,  because it preserves the former Soviet empire in a region  stretching from Prague to Vladivostok. These countries'  life-saving trek toward their original European ties, so  different from their Euro-Asian ones, makes them uncertain.  This is also at the heart of their anxiety about ""the fate of  the small in the game of the large,"" which President Lech Walesa  -- a politician of refined instinct -- expressed so emphatically  prior to the Prague meeting. Czech policy's solo journey -- in  this context -- seems more like shortsightedness than foresight.  If it reckons that the Czech Republic will escape from the cage  of global power interests thanks to its declared advantages,  then this is reminiscent of the tragic ingenuity of Edvard  Benes. Many things imply that the new era of cooperation  between America and Russia is not evolving merely to allow these  two powers to rid themselves of the phantom of mutual  destruction, but also because the two -- not Europe -- have  analogous, if not identical, interests in relation to the rest  of the world, first and foremost, Asia, against which they will  have to measure themselves more and more explicitly.    In view of all these circumstances, Central Europe's  strategic interest is defined differently. It cannot have only  a U.S. or a Euro-Asian dimension -- except in a tactical context  -- but just, and only just, a pan-European dimension. Only the  reassurance of being in its original European environment and a  thorough reintegration into it can offer the Central European  countries -- including the Czech Republic -- a suitable  development perspective. Of course, this presumes that their  inhabitants will be clear about this aim, that they will take it  into consideration, and that they will not overshadow it with  obsolete historical reminiscences.    Central Europe, and the Czech Republic in it, cannot now, or  in the future, function like an uncertain weld in U.S.-Russian  special-interest cooperation but must concentrate on returning  to the locus of its historical definition: to the center of the  European continent. Only in this regenerated unit will it feel  safe and only here will it be able -- within the framework of  the European defense, economic, and cultural institutions -- to  fulfill its own destiny.

There was no confirmation of the deal yesterday in Washington or Moscow. However, Mr Al Gore, US vice president, said in Budapest at the weekend that 'all sides will tell you that progress is being made.' If a concrete agreement on financial compensation for uranium is worked out in subsequent talks, it would remove one of the three main conditions Ukraine has imposed for giving up its remaining 176 strategic missiles and becoming a non-nuclear state. Kiev's other two demands are technical aid for dismantlement and security guarantees. Ukraine's presidential foreign affairs adviser, Mr Anton Buteiko, also reported in an interview with the Financial Times that during trilateral talks, which lasted until midnight, experts were finalising agreements on technical assistance and progress was being made in negotiations on guarantees. According to the government press service, Mr Valery Shmarov, deputy prime minister, said: 'The idea of compensation for tactical weapons was accepted.' He was referring to the 2,760 short-range nuclear warheads Ukraine transferred to Russia last year. Mr. Shmarov hoped that compensation for these warheads would offset Ukraine's Dollars 2.5m energy debt to Russia. 'As part of compensation for strategic weapons, agreement was reached to supply uranium for Ukrainian nuclear power stations for five years.' Trilateral discussions between the US, Russia and Ukraine have been going on since early autumn. Ukraine's announcement followed two days of talks on Thursday and Friday. Kiev's public posture seems to be an attempt to take advantage of the west's possible new sympathy for Ukraine's security concerns in the wake of the nationalist victory at the Russian polls. While the west is reassessing its relations with Russia, Ukraine may be hoping create some rapid momentum to get the best deal it can.   Countries:-  UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.

'Will there be a European computer industry in the year 2000?' Mr Gavin Kirkpatrick, chief executive of the British Computer Society, the UK organisation for data processing professionals, has asked in a series of international lectures. That is a serious question which many industry observers are pondering. Europe's large, indigenous IT suppliers - Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, Groupe Bull of France and Olivetti of Italy are losing money and putting in place strenuous restructuring measures. So serious are the problems that Mr Carlo de Benedetti, Olivetti chairman, has questioned publicly whether the Italian computer manufacturer - which lost Pounds 276.3m last year - can survive. Naturally enough, he believes the company's turnaround strategy will prove successful but it is an anxious time, not helped by Italy's political difficulties. Siemens Nixdorf (SNIS) is taking far longer to return to profits than its managers predicted at the time of the merger of Germany's largest electronics manufacturer and its best-known computer company. While Siemens' senior executives defend SNIS's position in the group, there is no doubt it is a heavy drag on Siemens' resources, raising speculation that the electronics giant might welcome a partner or buyer for the computer company. Groupe Bull, under Mr Bernard Pache, its new managing director, is continuing the transformation started under Mr Francis Lorentz, his predecessor, with further rounds of job cuts - 3,000 or 8 per cent of the workforce this year alone. The group lost FF4.72bn (Dollars 863m) last year. Mr Michel Carpentier, director-general for the IT industries at the European Commission, believes the European industry is at a crossroads. Writing in the European Information Technology Observatory, a new overview of the market, he notes: 'Europe's competitive position has declined from 1985 to 1991 with its IT trade balance dropping from minus Ecu 9bn to minus Ecu 27.2bn and with high technology for less than one fifth of European exports compared with 31 per cent and 27 per cent in the US and Japan respectively.' Mr Carpentier says the key weakness in Europe is its inability to integrate research and development and innovation in an overall strategy which both exploits and orientates them. To which must be added a cautious attitude on the part of its major customers. European companies are less likely to spend heavily on IT without obvious cost justification. While this protects them from the wasteful use of IT seen in many US companies, it can also act as a dampener on imaginative projects. Europe's strength, on the other hand, is its ability to innovate, albeit in a comparatively small number of industry sectors. The value of the European market is considerable. In 1992, the IT business in the 12 EC countries and the five European Free Trade Association partners amounted to some Ecu 225bn, of which Ecu 128bn went on data processing and office equipment - the traditional IT areas - and the rest on telecommunications. Europe's bid to maintain a separate identity in IT may be helped by the profound structural changes which are transforming the industry. Downsizing, moving from mainframe based operations to data processing based on client-server systems, for example, may prove easier in Europe where there are perhaps only a fifth as many very large mainframe sites as in the US. The technical and managerial choices involved in downsizing are never easy; European computing services companies capable of advising and supporting a customer through a downsizing decision are equal to the best and have the advantage of local knowledge. Computers: very large and very small ones will characterise tomorrow's data processing business. Europe has skills in building both. Advanced Computer Research International, a new company set up in France under the guidance of Mr Jacques Stern, former head of Groupe Bull, is developing a commercial supercomputer based on Digital Equipment's Alpha chip. DEC has agreed to take a stake in the new company. Acorn Risk Machines, a joint venture between Acorn Computers (owned by Olivetti but based in the UK), Apple Computers and VLSI of the US has developed tiny, high-powered microprocessors which consume very little power and are well suited to consumer products. Apple will use an ARM microprocessor in its 'Newton' personal digital assistant. Software: fast, effective and economical production remains a global problem. Europe's computer companies are as advanced as any in software development. Earlier this year a group of companies including Sema Group and Logica of the UK, Groupe Bull and Cap Gemini Sogeti of France and Siemens Nixdorf of Germany established a software research institute in Bilboa, Spain, to seek better ways of writing computer software. The idea is not to compete with packaged software suppliers such as Microsoft or Lotus, but to develop better methods of creating very large pieces of bespoke software. Mr Kirkpatrick of the BCS has no doubt there will be a European computer industry at the end of the century but he questions what kind of an industry it will be. Will it be dominated by software and services rather than hardware development and manufacture? Will Europe's research initiatives be pursued in isolation or in collaboration with with the rest of the world? Who will be the majority shareholder in Europe's industry? ICL of the UK points to answers to all three questions. Based in Europe, it is owned by Fujitsu of Japan and now derives most of its revenues from software and services. It collaborates with companies worldwide in research, though most of its activities are European-based. Mr Kirkpatrick emphasises that the future of the European industry depends on a change of attitude rather than technological prowess. 'If we in Europe want to be world leaders in this business, we have to be far more ambitious for the business opportunities that informatics offers and rather less interested in the abstract culture that is one of its endemic distractions.'

Since the summer the US has shifted its approach towards Ukraine to conditional economic assistance, encouraging Ukraine's nuclear disarmament through small carrots of financial aid and high-level diplomatic contacts. Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world with 176 strategic missiles and 1,656 nuclear weapons. Inherited from the former Soviet Union, this is larger than the arsenal of Great Britain, France and China combined. Though President Leonid Kravchuk has already obliged Ukraine to accede to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1) and become a non-nuclear power according to the 1992 Lisbon protocol, Ukraine has not ratified or implemented these agreements, which would transfer all its nuclear weapons to Russia. Instead Ukraine has been hanging on to them as bargaining chips with the west for economic aid, security guarantees and international attention. Only last week Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine should keep its 46 modern SS-24 missiles because the west is not doing enough to help Ukraine. Kiev is asking for Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to dismantle their nuclear arsenal. In addition Ukraine is looking to the west for security guarantees to protect its borders, and membership in Nato. Kiev is wary that Nato might expand into eastern Europe to include former Warsaw Pact neighbours, such as Poland, but leave Ukraine to fend for itself within Russia's sphere of influence. During Mr Christopher's one-day stop in Kiev on the tour of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, he is expected to announce a Dollars 330m aid package of agricultural credits and technical assistance. Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow: On his way to Ukraine, Mr Christopher stopped in Almaty, the capital of Kazakhstan, where he received assurances from President Nursultan Nazarbayev that the republic would stick to commitments to dismantle its nuclear weapons.

It takes only a few statistics to show how far Japan and the US have pulled ahead and how rapidly they are increasing their lead. While high technology products account for nearly a third of US exports and more than a quarter of Japan's, they make up less than a fifth of those from western Europe. Figures from the European Patent Office show that Europe is falling behind the US and Japan in registering new inventions. Mr Paul Braendli, the EPO's president, finds it alarming that initial patent filings in Europe have not increased at all since 1987, while those in the US have risen by 30 per cent and in Japan by 8 per cent. 'That is already a good indication that in Europe we are lazy in innovating or do not exploit our innovations,' Mr Braendli says. 'Something must be wrong.' Yet comparing national strengths in science and technology is a hazardous exercise, bedevilled by incompatible definitions. In principle, the inputs - resources devoted to research and development - are simple to assess. It is far harder to measure the quantity and quality of different countries' scientific output. Input data from the OECD in Paris show that Europe fell behind the US and Japan in overall RD spending during the 1980s. The European performance was held back particularly by the UK - the only industrialised country that devoted a smaller proportion of gross domestic product to RD in 1991 than in 1981 - and Germany, where there was only a marginal increase. France and Italy pushed up spending more rapidly, from a lower base. In 1991, the 12 EU countries devoted 1.96 per cent of GDP to RD, compared with 2.74 per cent in the US and 2.87 per cent in Japan. Only Germany (2.66 per cent) came close to the American and Japanese levels. Stripping out the high levels of military RD in the US and some European countries, Japan takes a clear global lead. It spends 2.8 per cent of GDP on civil science and technology, compared with 2.1 per cent in the US and 1.8 per cent in the EU. There are many possible ways of assessing the output of RD. Its industrial impact can be measured indirectly by the export/import ratios of science-based industries. These show Europe's weakness in computers and office machinery, with a ratio falling from 0.54 in 1985 to 0.39 in 1990 (compared to 3.96 for Japan and 0.95 for the US) - and its strength in pharmaceuticals, where the ratio in 1990 was 1.78 (compared to 0.32 for Japan and 1.65 for the US). But success in manufacturing industries depends on many factors besides RD, such as management and sales skills and quality control. A more direct technique for assessing strength in science and technology is to measure the quantity and quality of patents and scientific papers produced by a company or country. Europe's total share of US patents - seen as the most reliable measure of competitive strength - has declined since 1980, due to a dramatic expansion by Japan and more recently by the newly industrialised Asian countries. But again, the decline is far from even. 'The figures clearly show European countries going down the tubes in electronics but continuing to hold their own in areas where they have traditionally been strong, such as drugs, medicines and biotechnology,' says Dr Francis Narin, president of CHI Research, a consultancy based in New Jersey, which tracks patents issued in the US. In drugs and medicines, the combined share of US patents held by Germany, France and the UK slipped from 22.7 per cent in 1982 to 18.1 per cent in 1992. In electrical equipment, the corresponding European share fell from 16 per cent in 1982 to 10.1 per cent in 1992. However, there are bright spots in Europe's science-based industries - even in electronics. Siemens of Germany, the largest European electronics group, is investing DM2.4bn (Pounds 900m) in Dresden, eastern Germany, to develop and make powerful memory chips for the telecommunications and vehicle markets. And Philips, the second largest, is challenging the Japanese dominance of liquid crystal displays for portable computers, with a Fl200m (Pounds 70m) plant next to its RD centre in the Netherlands. In Sweden, Ericsson is investing 22 per cent of its turnover on developing advanced new telecommunications products. It decided boldly in 1991 to spend 15 times as much on RD as on dividends, although some investors were horrified. Now Ericsson has 60 per cent of the world market for digital mobile phone systems and more than a third of its total orders are for products that did not exist two years ago. But on the whole Europeans are less willing to take risks with RD than Americans - both at the corporate level and at the level of the individual researcher. The Japanese may be conformists as individuals but they move boldly as companies, as Sony showed when it created the Walkman market. Reluctance to take risks is one of many factors - social, cultural, political, educational and financial - blamed for Europe's failure to translate basic research more effectively into faster economic growth. Although there is no consensus about the relative importance of these reasons, few doubt that Europe's continuing fragmentation is an important handicap in the race with the relatively homogeneous US and Japan. In general, therefore, Europe's strongest suit is pure science. The further away a field lies from potential commercial application, the more likely it is that Europe will be ahead. The latest example is high-energy physics: Cern, the particle physics laboratory near Geneva on which 19 European countries spend Pounds 400m a year, will have an undisputed world lead for at least a generation, following last year's cancellation of the US SuperConducting Supercollider (SCS). The next discoveries about the fundamental forces and particles that hold the Universe together are likely to be made in Europe - which may provide some intellectual consolation to Europeans if the coming decades bring economic decline.

By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The negotiations with the United States on reducing the two superpowers'  strategic arsenals have been difficult, but Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev will face an equally tough task selling that agreement at home.    Already, his countrymen are asking why the Soviet Union will give up more  weapons than the United States, why the United States will have more nuclear  warheads than the Soviet Union, and why Moscow dropped its demand that  sea-launched cruise missiles be fully covered by the prospective treaty.    The questions are coming not only from Gorbachev's critics on the right, but  also from some of his supporters. And it appears likely that the agreement  signed Friday by Gorbachev and President Bush will provoke the Soviet Union's  first full-scale foreign policy debate.    ""The gap in the numbers makes one stop and think,"" Alexander Bovin, a political  commentator for the government newspaper Izvestia, said before the two leaders  approved the agreement, which sets out basic principles for a treaty reducing  strategic arms. ""Why are we agreeing to have considerably fewer warheads in our  strategic offensive arsenal than the Americans?""    Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov, the Soviet defense minister, complained in print last  month that the country's negotiating style seems tilted more toward making  concessions than toward winning compromises from the other side. The collapse  of the Warsaw Pact, he warned, made it too risky to yield much on strategic  arms without offsetting reductions by the United States.    And Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, Gorbachev's own military adviser, a  consultant on the strategic arms negotiations and a member of the Soviet  delegation to the summit talks here, argued publicly in advance of Gorbachev's  trip that the country needs a modernized, more powerful army and must be wary  about reducing its defense capabilities.    ""The danger of war has not been eliminated for the Soviet Union -- I am  convinced of this and I speak of it frankly,"" Akhromeyev wrote in a lengthy  attack on another Gorbachev adviser, Georgy A. Arbatov, director of the U.S.A.  and Canada Institute in Moscow. ""The United States continues to act largely as  before in the military sphere. . . .""    With such questions being raised by his own supporters, Gorbachev will find it  difficult to justify making any concessions that are not matched by U.S.  concessions.    ""If the United States wants an agreement, and I know it does, then the American  negotiators will have to take into account our public opinion,"" Vitaly I.  Goldansky, a leading Soviet scientist and an adviser to Gorbachev on arms  control, said of the prospective treaty. ""We are used to tailoring agreements  to meet American political needs, but now you must take our needs into  consideration.    ""This is really new. In the past, the leader made a deal, and that was it. Now  we have a real diversity in opinion, we have open criticism of the leadership  and its policies and, yes, we have a political opposition that is emerging.  Neither foreign policy nor defense will be exempt from political debate,"" he  said.    Gorbachev's conservative critics have recently focused on foreign policy as an  area of vulnerability.    One foreign policy specialist, writing in the weekly newspaper Literaturnaya  Rossiya in April, said that all of Gorbachev's international achievements had  come by yielding the gains made by the Soviet Union over the past 50 years.    Yegor K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative within the Communist Party  leadership, has publicly questioned Soviet policy in Eastern Europe.    ""People speak with great alarm about what is happening in Eastern Europe,""  Ligachev said in a television interview two weeks ago. ""In particular, many  people say they are very disturbed that there is a dismantling of socialism in  some of those countries.""    And the growing public feud between Akhromeyev and Arbatov has brought into the  open the deep cleavage among Gorbachev's own advisers over substituting  political agreements for military readiness and over his concept of ""defense  sufficiency"" -- that is, ensuring the country's defense against any conceivable  threat but without seeking to compete weapon for weapon with the United States  in a ruinous arms race.    ""The debate that we will have over the START treaty will range over all our  foreign policy initiatives under Gorbachev,"" a member of the Soviet delegation  commented. ""But it is impossible to predict the outcome. This is the first such  fundamental debate we will have had, and our legislators are distinguishing  themselves by their independence.""    Under Soviet law, treaties must be ratified by the Supreme Soviet, the  country's legislature, but the process will no longer be the mere formality  that it was two years ago when the treaty eliminating intermediate-range  nuclear forces was reviewed and approved in an afternoon.    The three parliamentary committees that will review arms control agreements are  filled with foreign policy specialists, generals, managers of the country's  defense industries and others certain to probe for any weaknesses. Elected in  the nation's first contested parliamentary elections last year, they have  already shown their independence from the government and Communist Party and  openly questioned some of Gorbachev's policies.    Talking with U.S. congressional leaders here Friday, Gorbachev compared the new  role Soviet legislators were playing.    ""It is a really a mirror image (of Washington) now,"" he said. ""We have come  here, and before coming here, we had contacts with our Supreme Soviet members,  and we will have contacts with them when we return.""    But the framework agreement for the strategic arms treaty, signed by Gorbachev  and President Bush on Friday, already has drawn criticism from both the right  and the left in Moscow.    ""The progressives, the radicals are saying that the cuts are not large enough  and certainly do not reach the 50% levels we were promised,"" Andrei Kortunov,  an arms control specialist at the U.S.A. Institute now in Washington,  commented. ""We are not going to get the savings we need from the defense budget  because we will have to rebuild our strategic triad to match that of the U.S.  Their criticism is that we have been trapped into playing the U.S. game once  again.    ""From the right, we hear very strong criticism that we are giving up more than  the U.S. is, that we have not held fast on such critical points as the  inclusion of the sea-launched cruise missile where the U.S. enjoys an  advantage, but we have been all too ready to 'split the difference' with the  Americans in ways that weaken us.""    The next six months of negotiations, as the final treaty is prepared and the  basis is laid for a second agreement, will be crucial for Gorbachev, according  to Kortunov and other Soviet foreign policy specialists.    ""Even as we celebrate this framework agreement, we must remember that a lot of  work still needs to be done to produce a treaty that can be ratified by both  the U.S. Senate and our Supreme Soviet,"" a member of the Soviet delegation  said. ""To produce a treaty that either body would refuse to ratify would be  disastrous for the whole process of arms control and for the overall  relationship.""      THE SUMMIT     What kind of arms control agreements would help Gorbachev with his domestic  problems? Can they be sold to the Soviet military and other Soviet  conservatives?    There is a big limit to the help he can get from arms control agreements. What  the Soviet people are focusing on politically is the internal problems. And the  climate has become less favorable for selling arms control to the military.    For both the political and military leadership in the Soviet Union, the changes  in Eastern Europe have led to a desire to put things on hold. What would be  most important to Gorbachev would be for the United States and the West to cut  back their forces unilaterally. That would demonstrate to his rivals that  Gorbachev's policies are being reciprocated.    The strongest thing Gorbachev has going for him at home is that he is an  internationally recognized leader. He is seen as dealing on equal terms with  the President of the United States, and that was not true of his predecessors.  Beyond that, it's not clear that the average Soviet citizen -- the person  standing in line waiting to buy bread -- is likely to pay much attention to the  specifics of an arms control agreement.    But there are certain things it would be imprudent for him to do at this stage.  The military would not have supported the (U.S.-backed) proposal to exclude  medium-range cruise missiles from the agreement. And it would be hard for him  to sell the military on any deal preventing modernization of the remaining  SS-18s (ballistic missiles). If the United States persists in such a course,  that might be very imprudent.

Deputy Premier Valeriy Shmarov also confirmed that Ukraine  had already removed 17 of the 46 modern SS-24 missiles it  possesses from their silos and had disconnected their nuclear  warheads. Each has 10 warheads.    Shmarov, the government's point man on nuclear disarmament,  told AFP the United States had proposed that Ukraine receive  free fuel for its nuclear power stations for the next five years  as compensation for giving up the 176 strategic missiles it  possesses.    ""This is a big step by all sides towards reaching a  compromise,"" Shmarov said.    He stated that the United States had also proposed that  Ukraine's estimated two billion-dollar debt to Russia for energy  supplies be erased to compensate for the smaller tactical  nuclear weapons withdrawn from Ukrainian territory by May 1992.    Shmarov said Russia had agreed to the scheme. Russian  officials declined to comment.    He said that within 10 days another three SS-24s will have  been deactivated as a ""goodwill gesture"" by Ukraine.    Shmarov stated that Kiev may consider the deactivated SS-24s  as among the missiles it agreed to get rid of under its  qualified ratification of the 1991 START treaty.    ""We retain the view that the missiles representing the  biggest ecological danger must be destroyed first,"" Shmarov  said, referring to 130 older SS-19 long-range missiles.    Ukraine signed agreements last year in which it pledged to  respect the START treaty, accede to the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty and get rid of all the nuclear weapons  on its soil.    The Ukrainian parliament however ratified START earlier this  year with the stipulation that it only applied to 42 percent of  the 176 strategic nuclear missiles from the former Soviet  arsenal based in the country.

The agreement falls short of the federal government's aim of dismantling the plethora of non-tariff curbs maintained by the provinces but business groups have welcomed it as an important first step. Yesterday's signing ceremony in Ottawa was also designed to send a message to Quebec, where the ruling Liberals are about to embark on an uphill election campaign against the separatist Parti Quebecois. Mr Daniel Johnson, Quebec's outspokenly federalist premier, needs to show voters that the francophone province will fare better as part of Canada than by breaking away. Mr Johnson is expected to call an election later this week for September 12. The PQ leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, has scoffed at the inter-provincial trade agreement, noting that it falls short in many respects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and multilateral trade pacts to which a sovereign Quebec would be a signatory. Among areas covered by the package are government procurement, labour mobility, transport licences and product standards. The deal also includes a weak dispute settlement mechanism. However, Ottawa and the provinces were unable to agree on contentious areas such as energy, alcohol and agriculture.   Countries:-  CAZ  Canada.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT941-4933 ,"FT941-4933 _AN-ECICYACPFT 940309   FT  09 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Balance of economic power begins to shift - David Marsh sees opportunities in Europe's lagging performance      By DAVID MARSH   Europeans are no strangers to periods of lagging economic performance. The fortunes of ancient Egypt waxed and waned over 2,000 years, while most of Europe was a barbaric wilderness populated by goatherds. The cycles of world history have since accelerated and become interconnected, to a degree barely conceivable even a generation ago. As it tackles the problem of fading dynamism, Europe must weather a phase of unsettling political and economic transition. 'Europe can be under no illusion that it faces very strong competition from the US and Asia,' says Mr Ernst-Antoine Selliere, vice-president in charge of economic affairs at the French Patronat employers' organisation. 'But, provided we loosen constraints on our competitiveness, this can be an opportunity.' The European nations that launched the manufacturing revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries ceded industrial leadership to the US after the first world war. Now, as a result of global upheavals in technology and communications, another shift in the balance of economic power may be imminent - this time, towards the rapidly expanding economies of the Pacific Rim. Using World Bank data and its own assumptions about future growth, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) projects that, in the first decade of next century, purchasing power income per head in Singapore and Korea will exceed that of the US. Incomes in Singapore are already close to the west European average. According to similarly derived projections by UK accountants Coopers and Lybrand, the share of world GDP taken by Asian developing countries (including both China and India) could rise to 28 per cent in 2010 from 18 per cent in 1990. Western Europe's share would fall to 17 per cent from 22 per cent, while the US's would fall to 18 per cent from 23 per cent. This projection assumes annual growth in both western Europe and the US of 2.5 per cent, against 6 per cent in Asia. Even if the growth differential is less, Europe will drop down the economic rankings. But Europe's likely decline needs to be put into perspective. First, it is natural that less well-off countries move closer to wealthy ones. Over the past 20 years, the gulf between many rich and poor countries has widened. Where gaps have narrowed, they normally remain large. According to World Bank figures (based on constant dollar exchange rates rather than purchasing power parities), by 2000 the ratio between average GDP per capita in western Europe and east Asia will be an 18 to 1, compared with 48 to 1 in 1970. Second, as living standards rise in less developed countries, wealth should flow back to Europe through increased trade and investment. Provided European companies match international advances in management and technology, Europe can maintain a strong competitive advantage in goods and services the rest of the world wants. This requires that borders remain open and protectionist pressure is resisted. Professor Richard Portes, director of the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research, believes a narrowing of the wealth gap between Europe and the rest of the world need not be disastrous. 'I'm very sceptical about the views of the doomsayers.' Differences in real wages between western Europe and other manufacturing regions will narrow, he says, in the same way that US wages, relative to those in Europe, have fallen since the 1950s. This need not stop European living standards rising. According to UBS's projections, western Europe's growth rate will pick up early in the 21st century, as the continent benefits from the 'catch up' phenomenon, under which countries that lag adopt innovations from the leaders. A striking example of 'catch up' has been US success in the 1980s in reacting to the competitive threat from Japan by importing 'just-in-time' Japanese production technology, says Mr Bill Gasser, UBS's senior international economist. But, as it tries to adapt, Europe has one big disadvantage. The fast-increasing share of GDP taken by government spending in the past decade  -a rise well under way before the onset of the European recession in 1992-93 - has imposed a growing burden on business. Social spending is the biggest single portion of these outlays. The OECD says social security transfers in the EU will account for 21.5 per cent of GDP in 1994, up from 16.4 per cent in 1989 - double the percentage rise in the last downturn in 1979-1982. In relation to GDP, EU social transfers exceed US and Japanese levels by 50 per cent and 78 per cent. As a community of nation states, western Europe faces greater difficulties than the US did a decade ago in adopting common policies to recover dynamism. But Europe's diversity is also a trump card. Different parts of the continent can draw upon varying strengths and specialisations. There is little disagreement on the diagnosis of Europe's core problems. The task is to implement corrective measures: Growth of public spending on welfare is placing intolerable strains on budget deficits - one reason for high taxes and interest rates. Beyond simply cutting benefits, governments need a new balance between public and private sector social security provision. The number of old people in Europe could outstrip resources to care for them. Imaginative solutions will be required, returning the elderly to family environments and using technological advances to moderate medical costs. More flexible labour markets are needed, including improved possibilities for part-time work and less rigid wage-bargaining mechanisms. The collapse in demand for unskilled labour creates the potential for an integrated tax and welfare system allowing low-paid workers to be paid partly by employers and partly by tax credits. Europe must overcome its technological lag. Companies at the forefront of scientific advance must improve links both to the markets they serve and the education establishments on which they draw. Europe needs a better balance between the costs and benefits of environmental regulation. Environmental rules have not yet been a significant spur to innovation or competitive advantage. Plans for further integration, including widening (early next century) to central and eastern Europe, need to be based on liberal, open-market principles. Governments know Europe can prosper only if companies think globally. This can lead to some sharp modifications. Pointing to the large number of German companies shifting production abroad to escape high domestic costs, Mr Ludolf von Wartenberg, general manager of the Federation of German Industry, says companies are moving away from a 'Made in Germany' towards a 'Designed in Germany' concept. German industry will regain competitiveness, he says. But he admits doubts on how German society will cope with the strain. This type of corporate reaction can be painful, but the absence of adjustment would have still more disturbing consequences. If European enterprises and employees can muster the flexibility to manage change and the flair to master it, salvation is assured.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

He reviewed the argument that Europe needs to concentrate on technological development, but pointed out that this will not necessarily reduce unemployment. He cited an economist's view that 'what is causing Europe's problems is structural unemployment caused by technological change'. The following article by Eva Kaluzynska examined the European problem of an ageing population and a low birth rate which implies a future shortage of labour. She quoted a number of experts who suggest a variety of solutions, ranging from later retirement to increasing the rate of female participation in the workforce. The problem of a small workforce having to support an ageing population is a real one and the tide of technological change is unlikely to change. Moves to expand the total workforce, assuming Europe does not follow the US route of creating more unskilled and low-paid jobs, would be unhelpful. The solution must lie in improving the education and skills of the reducing numbers coming into employment and encouraging those already in employment to make greater provision for their retirement.

0,FT944-13955 ,"FT944-13955 _AN-EJYD1AGZFT 941025   FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (6): Years of painful negotiation - The steel industry      By ANDREW HILL   When European Union industry ministers agreed last December on a package of aid and capacity cuts for Europe's subsidised steel companies it looked like years of painful negotiation, in which the Italian authorities had played a leading role, had come to an end. In Brussels, Italy - and in particular the heavily subsidised state-owned producer, Ilva - had been painted as the villain of the piece, accused of prevarication, stubborn refusal to reduce capacity and, at one point, of having deliberately concealed a blast furnace from European Commission inspectors. Rival producers warned they would be unable to subscribe to the EU plan to reduce capacity and rescue the whole European industry from a slump in demand, if the Italians did not fall into line. But Mr Paolo Savona, then Italy's industry minister, managed to win what looked at the time like a surprisingly good deal from his European counterparts. This envisaged a reduction of 2m tonnes in overall steel production in Italy. Under the original calculations, some 1.2m tonnes of capacity would be lost at Ilva's Taranto plant in southern Italy; 500,000 tonnes at plants owned by the eventual buyer of the Taranto flat products division; and a further 300,000 was accounted for by the dismantling of Ilva's Bagnoli plant, a hot rolled steel mill which was already lying dormant. Strict Commission surveillance was supposed to ensure that the terms of the package were observed. The Commission was particularly pleased with Rome's commitment to privatise Ilva by the end of 1994, meaning that the Ecu2.6bn subsidy allowed under the December agreement would be the last state aid for Ilva. Mr Savona estimated that the break-up and sale of Ilva could raise some L4,100bn for the state. Part of the privatisation process has already been completed, most notably with the sale of the more attractive special steels division of Ilva - Acciai Speciali Terni (AST) - at the end of June, bought by a German-Italian consortium for L600bn. But with the December deadline fast approaching the most important part of the Ilva privatisation - the sale of the flat products division, Ilva Laminati Piani (ILP), centred on Taranto - has yet to be carried out. Mr Vito Gnutti, who has been industry minister since Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government took office in May, is still confident that a sale will be made, but he admits that the pressure is increasing. 'It's clear that if there is only one buyer, and he knows we have to sell before December 31, this buyer will hold on until December hoping to put pressure on the seller,' he says. Other observers are even more pessimistic about the prospects for ILP. Mr Hayao Nakamura is the former representative of Nippon Steel in Italy, who took over as chief executive of Ilva in February last year. He inherited an extraordinary range of problems - debt was at the same level as turnover, for example, with interest rates at 13.5 per cent - and believes that the Italian state-owned steel industry was badly treated by Brussels. 'We're closing the Bagnoli hot steel mill - the latest hot steel mill constructed in Europe. From the point of view of rationalisation in Europe we should be closing the older ones, but Italy is closing the newest, which was built at a cost of L1,000bn,' points out Mr Nakamura, now an adviser to what remains of Ilva. He adds that Italy is having to import more than 50 per cent of its flat products from Germany and France, two of the countries which pressed hard for Italy to close down capacity. Mr Nakamura is also sceptical about the feasibility of offers made so far for the ILP division. G William Miller, the US merchant bank, is supposed to be linking up with a consortium of steelmakers and local enterprises in one offer, while Lucchini, the private Italian steel producer, is also said to be interested. Recent reports suggest that Riva, another private producer which was also part of the victorious consortium to buy AST, has come under pressure to join the bidding. But Mr Nakamura believes there is a risk that these offers will be too low, or based on the future sale of attractive parts of the business, and closure of the rest - an option which would lead to further job losses in some of Italy's most depressed regions. Mr Gnutti says, however, that strict conditions will be imposed on any buyers, preventing them from simply stripping the best ILP assets. Further job losses in the industry would only add to the suffering of the past few years of restructuring. In 1987, for example, Finsider, the state steelmaker which was Ilva's predecessor, produced a job reduction plan which would cut the workforce from 79,000 to about 55,000 in three years. Subsequently, some jobs have been transferred to the private sector, but Mr Nakamura believes that ILP will have to cut its workforce by a further 10,000 or more to 18,000 before 1996. There is perhaps even greater concern in Italy's private steel industry, which is also the subject of EU plans for capacity reduction. In June, the Commission agreed to allow capacity cuts of 5m and 6m tonnes in the so-called 'Bresciani' mills in northern Italy, backed by state aid, even though some of the cuts will be achieved through partial closure of plants rather than a complete shutdown as required under a strict interpretation of EU rules. The cuts are considered vital to the success of the EU's plan for overall capacity reductions in the European industry. The industry federation, Federacciai, has estimated that more than a quarter of the 25,000 jobs in the private sector would be lost as a result of the capacity cuts. More than 80 separate plans for closure have been submitted, and a formal decree has been passed by the Italian government, but the process of capacity reduction has not yet got under way. Mr Gnutti, himself a native of Brescia, is likely to discuss the detail of the plan with fellow EU industry ministers in Brussels next month. Unfortunately for these fragmented Italian companies, there is no sign of the improvement in demand which has made larger competitors - for example, in Germany - wonder aloud whether there is any longer a need for an EU-wide steel industry rescue plan. Mr Enrico Badiali, director of Federacciai, says demand, particularly among clients in the Italian building sector, has yet to pick up. 'There are still problems for those private companies which are committed to closure,' he says.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.   Industries:-  P331  Blast Furnace and Basic Steel Products.

Speaking after talks with President George Bush at the White House, Mr Kravchuk denied reports in Moscow that all Ukraine's tactical - or short-range - nuclear weapons had been removed to Russia to be destroyed. But he promised they would be moved by the agreed July deadline. Mr Kravchuk said the US and Ukraine had worked out a protocol by which Ukraine, which inherited some of the Soviet Union's long-range missiles, would endorse Start. The US wants the former Soviet republics with nuclear weapons - Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan - to commit themselves to the treaty, signed by Washington and Moscow last year but not yet ratified by either side. The confusion over the withdrawal of tactical missiles follows months of shadow boxing between Moscow and Kiev over this and other military issues dividing the two most powerful members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Earlier this year Ukraine held up the transfer of tactical nuclear missiles, arguing that once in Russia it was not clear they would be dismantled. This objection was overcome by an agreement to do it under international supervision. The two republics have also been arguing over dividing the Black Sea naval fleet and control of the Crimean peninsula. The transfer of all tactical weapons would be widely welcomed in the west as a step towards ensuring a stable outcome for part of the vast nuclear arsenal inherited from the Soviet Union. The Crimean parliament yesterday took a big step back from a declaration of independence approved a day earlier and proclaimed the peninsula to be part of Ukraine.

0,FT943-11114 ,"FT943-11114 _AN-EHAC8AEMFT 940801   FT  01 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Investors stay cool on Ecu sector - International      By GRAHAM BOWLEY   The fortunes of the Ecu bond market have risen and fallen as the prospects for European monetary union, with the Ecu as Europe's single currency, have grown and then receded. The market was dealt a severe blow when the Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty at their first referendum in June 1992, and then again three months later when sterling and the Italian lira were unceremoniously dumped from the European exchange rate mechanism. A year on, in August 1993, the French franc's woes and the widening of the ERM's bands which occurred as a result precipitated a further sell-off in Ecu bonds. Suddenly the market that promised so much had collapsed and it has remained in the doldrums ever since. Today, issuers and investors alike are scarce. In June, the yield on the 10-year Ecu bond climbed to 46 basis over its theoretical counterpart. The theoretical yield is the yield which would result from constructing a synthetic Ecu bond from the underlying constituent markets. The actual yield is that earned from Ecu bonds trading in the market. The comparison of the two is a good measure of the Ecu bond market's health. However, 'it is wrong to be too pessimistic about the Ecu bond market', says Mr Steve Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. 'The performance in absolute terms has been poor but it must be viewed in context. Government bond markets and other eurobond markets have also had a disastrous year.' Certainly, Ecu bonds have been one of the hardest hit as confidence in Europe's bond markets has evaporated over worries about the size of government borrowing, inflation and the direction of European interest rates. 'Two factors have kept the market in the doldrums,' said Mr Philip Cadiz, of Paribas in Paris. 'One is the fact that EMU seems to have become less of a political likelihood; the other is this year's protracted and vicious bear market which has meant that investors have concentrated on their own domestic markets.' The bear market looks set to continue for a while yet. With political troubles in Italy adding to the uncertainty, and the wranglings over choosing the successor to Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission presenting the picture of an increasingly divided Europe, the prospect for the Ecu market would not seem to be a bright one. Nevertheless, some analysts have recently become more optimistic. 'We have begun to see some buying interest in the last few months, from institutions in particular but also from retail investors with money to spend, both attracted by the relatively high yields,' said Mr Major. Since its peak in mid-June, the gap between the actual and theoretical yields has closed. Actual Ecu bonds are now trading two basis points below their theoretical counterpart. 'Between 75 per cent to 80 per cent of Ecu debt is issued by governments or organisations such as the World Bank and European Investment Bank, which means that this is a high quality market with little risk for the investor,' said Mr Danny Peeters, head of the Ecu desk at Kredietbank in Brussels. The biggest buyers of Ecu debt are the Benelux countries, Switzerland and, more recently, German banks have been attracted by the high yields on offer. 'If I were in their position, I would also be tempted,' said Mr Major. 'There is about DM180bn worth of German debt to be issued this year, which represents a huge supply. The Ecu market does not have those supply concerns.' However, there has been some disappointment that less than half of the Ecu funds currently being freed as many old Ecu bonds come up for redemption, estimated to be about ECU1bn each month, are not being reinvested in Ecu bonds. In addition, the market continues to suffer from a lack of aggressive marketing of the debt, which has been the case ever since several of the large investment banks pulled many of its resources out of the Ecu bond market. The largest issuer of Ecu debt continues to be the French government, but even it is limited to small offerings by the expensiveness of current yields. 'Most recent issues have been small, which means that investors are not focusing on the Ecu bond market,' said Mr Cadiz. 'If it is to be resuscitated, we need to begin to focus again on the Ecu and on EMU. At the moment, these are the last things on people's minds.' Even if there is a recovery in Europe's bond markets, until monetary union and the adoption of the Ecu as Europe's single currency become more than a distant dream, a reversal in the Ecu bond market's fortunes will be difficult.

The choice of the more flexible digital terrestrial system undoubtedly gives HDTV its greatest chance of success and marks a considerable technological achievement for the Americans. All is, however, not lost for Europe's beleaguered consumer electronics industry. One must, for example, remain sceptical about the size of HDTV's potential market. It is not clear how much the viewer will value improved picture definition. HDTV is, in the short to medium term at least, likely to be confined to niche premium markets, such as film and live-sport channels. Our own estimates for this niche suggest a worldwide receiver market of Dollars 5.53bn by 2004 - considerably less than dedicated HDTV advocates would have you believe. Rather more significant is the impact that digital technology will have on normal definition services. Digital TV is more efficient; it uses less band-width. This means viewers will be able to receive many more channels. Since viewers value programme choice and quality above picture quality, it is to normal definition digital television that Europe's consumer electronics industry should now turn its attention.

""We achieved all objectives,"" said Russian team leader  Nikita  Smidovitch, who told reporters his 10-day mission to Iraq had  been ""successful.""    Smidovitch was inspecting Iraq's military arsenal under UN  Security Council Gulf war ceasefire resolutions.    ""The Iraqis had a forthcoming attitude,"" Smidovitch said.

The surveillance program is the next UN step following the  destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf  war of January-February 1991.    Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting  it for three years and has been lobbying hard for an end to the  embargo.    On Wednesday, the UN's deputy disarmament chief said  long-term monitoring of Baghdad's weapons program was still some  way off despite Iraq's efforts to have sanctions lifted.    American Charles Duelfer, deputy head of the UN Special  Commission (UNSCOM) disarming Iraq under the Gulf war ceasefire  resolutions, spent five days in Iraq preparing a visit there  this week by his boss Rolf Ekeus.    Ekeus is due to arrive in Baghdad on Tuesday to discuss  monitoring, but has said he is unlikely to recommend a lifting  of sanctions before the end of the year.     "
0,FT942-9115 ,"FT942-9115 _AN-EEQDYAG7FT 940517   FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (5): Newcomer with a strong base - Profile, AssiDoman is Sweden's fourth largest forestry group      By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES   AssiDoman has just joined the branks of Europe's top ten forestry groups, and Lennart Ahlgren, its president, is clearly relishing every minute of the experience. Not only does he display an ebullient confidence in wood as a raw material - 'I firmly believe this is a product for the future' - but he has a clear strategic vision of the group's development. 'Our objective is to be Europe's leading company in the fields of packaging paper, paper-based packaging and sawn timber,' he states. Lest anyone should doubt him, Mr Ahlgren has been busy even in the few weeks since AssiDoman emerged in its current form, following a state-orchestrated merger and privatisation. It has made a successful bid for Ncb, a partially state-owned forestry group, and acquired a Swedish saw-milling operation. Further acquisitions would seem only to be a question of time, not least because the company wants to make good use of its financial strength to back its strategic ambitions. A lot has happened in a short time. A few months ago, AssiDoman did not even exist. It was formed at the start of the year from the merger of two wholly state-owned forestry groups, Assi and Doman. In March it gained new 590,000 shareholders when the state sold out 49 per cent of its holding, garnering SKr7.6bn in Sweden's largest ever privatisation. When shares in the group began trading last month, its market capitalisation amounted to SKr16bn. With 1993 sales of SKr14.6bn, AssiDoman is Sweden's fourth largest forestry group after Stora, SCA and MoDo. It claims to be the world's largest private forest owner, with 3.4m hectares of productive forest land. It also ranks as Europe's fourth largest producer of sawn goods, with annual output of 950,000 cubic metres, and one of Europe's five biggest producers of corrugated board. Operations span nine European countries, with 5,000 of the group's 12,000 employees based outside Sweden. Mr Ahlgren says the emphasis on packaging and large forest holdings provide the group with considerable resilience in an industry notorious for its cyclical peaks and troughs. But this is just one aspect of a strategy based on high-quality products, added value, and greater material processing. The starting point for the strategy is virgin fibre, which is hardly surprising given the company's extensive forestry reserves. 'We will concentrate on virgin fibre and will invest in existing mills in Sweden to upgrade production,' says Mr Ahlgren. In fact, the Ahlgren philosophy can be summarised by the word 'concentration' - concentration on virgin fibre, concentration on sawn goods, concentration on packaging and packaging material. 'We won't get involved in printing and writing papers or tissue,' he stresses. The other priority is financial stability. The group has a healthy cash flow, and an equity-to-assets ratio which, at around 50 per cent, is surpassed by few forestry groups worldwide. Results are on rising trend, with a profit of between SKr1.2bn and SKr1.5bn expected for this year, after last year's SKr876m. Without the strong financial base, it is unlikely that the group would be emphasising its expansion strategy so forcefully. The programme can be summarised as follows: In Sweden, the company will continue to build up its saw-mill operations, both by investment and acquisitions, aiming to reach an annual production level of 1.1m to 1.2m cubic metres in the next two years. In Europe, where many of the packaging operations are based, the group wants to be close to its markets and is looking to bolster its position in segments like corrugated board. Although it has a relatively strong market position in the UK, Danish and Swedish markets, its share in countries like France and Germany is low. The acquisition of Ncb - a packaging company - will not leave much of a dent in AssiDoman's finances, as the bid only valued the company at some SKr1.4bn. But most analysts believe Mr Ahlgren is hatching something bigger, including, possibly, a strike at his former company, Korsnas, where he was managing director for seven years. Though coy on the subject, Mr Ahlgren admits there would be a 'natural overlap' with Korsnas, which is also strong in packaging and sawn timber. There have also been suggestions that the group might be interested in buying MoDo Packaging from MoDo.   Companies:-  AssiDoman.   Countries:-  SEZ  Sweden, West Europe.

Until now MTV has declined to give any financial numbers for its European television network which is available in 43m homes in 32 countries. 'MTV Europe's revenues have been increasing at 70 to 80 per cent a year although it will be tough to keep that up', Mr Biondi said. The revenue figures are at least double that suspected by analysts. 'We (MTV Europe) will be available in 50m homes by the end of this calendar year,' Mr Biondi forecast. He stuck to a previous formula to describe MTV Europe's profits. 'It is marginally profitable.' In fact all the signs are that the company is being conservative in its public statements and after 5 1/2 years on air MTV Europe is comfortable profitable. Viacom recently announced that it was bringing its American children's channel Nickelodeon to the UK in a joint venture with British Sky Broadcasting. Mr Biondi said the aim was to take Nickelodeon to other European countries through joint ventures with local partners.

0,FT933-9678 ,"FT933-9678 _AN-DHIDBAAHFT 930809   FT  09 AUG 93 / Major revives 'hard Ecu' as route to union      By DAVID OWEN and JAMES BLITZ   MR John Major, the prime minister, yesterday entered the debate over the future of European monetary union by reviving his proposal for a 'hard Ecu' currency unit to trade alongside Europe's national currencies. A spokesman for Mr Major said a proposal for a hard Ecu would be considered as 'one of a number of options' for improving economic co-operation in the European Community. The move appears designed to ensure that the recent turmoil in Europe's exchange rate mechanism does not trigger an attempt by an inner core of EC states to accelerate progress towards monetary union. During negotiations on the Maastricht treaty in 1991, Mr Major lobbied strongly for the hard Ecu concept as an alternative route towards European monetary union. The idea was rejected by Britain's EC partners. But last weekend's agreement to widen the fluctuation bands for most ERM currencies has raised strong doubts about whether the current Maastricht plan for Emu remains valid. There was no reaction to the proposal from European officials yesterday. But the finance ministers of France and Germany reiterated their confidence that the existing timetable for Emu was valid and that the ERM could return to narrow bands in the near future. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, told German television that the widening of the ERM bands did not compromise the move to stage two of the Maastricht treaty at the start of 1994, which involves the setting up of a European Monetary Institute to act as a model for an EC central bank. Mr Edmond Alphandery, his French counterpart, commented: 'People have underestimated the strength of our collective European commitment.' The credibility of the ERM may be tested again this week as France, Denmark and Belgium continue to keep their currencies closely tied to the D-Mark by maintaining overnight interest rates in their domestic money markets at very high levels. Some dealers believe the high interest rate policy will not be sustainable because of high unemployment. Senior Tories have continued to bicker over Europe in the wake of the ERM crisis. But there was immediate support for the hard Ecu from Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that the idea was 'attractive'. However, Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, told BBC TV's Breakfast With Frost he did not think it would work. However, he thought the timetable for monetary union set out by Maastricht was 'too slow.' The hard Ecu project envisages the launch of a pan-European currency which would keep pace with the strongest European currency at all times. If the new currency became popular, it would gradually replace national currencies as legal tender. If not, it would be allowed to die. However, economists were sceptical as to whether Britain's EC partners would adopt the idea. Mr Brian Hilliard of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said the project would involve considerable costs because central banks would have to pledge to buy the Ecu in exchange for Europe's strongest currency.

Tarasyuk said the first convoy of fuel, which will be used  to  run power plants in the southern city of Zaparozhnye, arrived  Monday.    Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetsky told a news conference  during a visit to Germany earlier this week that Ukraine would  stop dismantling the weapons because of Russia's failure to  provide the fuel.    Tarasyuk, who returned from talks in Moscow, said he had  received assurances from Russian officials that they would  fulfill their obligations under the agreement signed by U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk.    ""Ukraine will not raise any obstacles in the implementation  of this trilateral agreement if all parties involved fulfil  their commitments,"" Tarasyuk said.    Ukraine was the last of the four nuclear states of the  former  Soviet Union to agree to dismantle its nuclear weapons under the  agreement that provided Ukraine with at least one billion  dollars in financial compensation and nuclear fuel shipments to  run the country's power stations.

New Start for Europe's Space Flights"";  first paragraph is an introduction]    [Text] ESA is pinning its future hopes totally on the  launching capacity of the Ariane 5. The space laboratory is to  be adapted for this and a capsule is to be developed as a taxi.  But what Europe's ultimate contribution to a global space  station is to look like continues to be disputed.    The persistent economic difficulties in its member countries  and the latest developments concerning the American space  station are now forcing the European Space Agency (ESA) too to  reorient itself. Not even quite 10 months after the ministers'  conference in Granada its director general, Jean-Marie Luton,  presented at the end of September a new scenario that is to  serve as a guideline to the year 2000. Manned space flights  above all have been affected by the changes.    One has to adapt, Jean-Marie Luton stated. He said further  that all the same Europe must not lose its status in space  travel and has to make an independent outstanding contribution  to the future global space station. Furthermore, in the context  of financial and technological cutbacks, ESA is pinning its  hopes on European participation in the space station and on  greater cooperation with Russia. The Hermes shuttle is being  canceled completely, and the Columbus world space laboratory is  to be integrated in a diminished version into the new Manned  Space Transportation Program (MSTP). Because both versions of  the space station that are being discussed at present--with and  without Russian participation--are now planning the docking of a  European module not until the year 2002, the entire program is  to be extended to this point in time and 4 billion European  currency units [ECU] (8.2 billion German marks [DM]) are to be  saved. Expenditures of ECU22 billion (DM45.1 billion) were  planned in the Granada plan for the years 1993 to 2000, and  these are now to be limited to ECU18 billion (DM36.9 billion)  for the years 1994 to 2002. Everyone is being affected by hard  times, the ESA chief said. The most important thing now, Luton  said further, is to reorganize on the basis of clear performance  targets and broad agreement and to remotivate the European  partners in this manner.    The foundations of the new scenario are the Ariane 5, whose  development is to be sped up further without cuts, and the trio  consisting of the APM (Attached Pressurized Module) space  laboratory, ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) transfer vehicle  and CTV (Crew Transport Vehicle) capsule, integrated into the  MSTP program. At around DM14 billion, the CTV and ATV transport  elements are to cost only approximately a third of what was  estimated for Hermes. All three basic elements are to be  designed so that they can be launched by an Ariane 5. The APM  laboratory module is a diminished version of the Columbus  module. Only five double racks for scientific experiments,  instead of the originally planned eight, are to have a spot in  it. With a total mass of around 10 tons and a payload of 1.7 to  3.4 tons, it is approximately equivalent to the Spacelab.    A ballistic re-entry capsule, that for reasons of cost is  not  to be reusable, is planned for the transport of astronauts and  cargo. In the manned version it is to be able to transport from  four to nine persons to the space station. The CTV is  accordingly three times as large as the Soyuz and is to be  simpler to handle and more precise when landing, Luton  emphasized. The European design would also be ideally suited as  a rescue capsule.    The MSTP system will be completed with the ATV transfer  vehicle. It is necessary in order to take the laboratory and the  capsule to the space station and to dock them automatically  there. Two versions weighing 12.7 and 14.5 tons are being  examined at present.    The Ariane 5 would accordingly be the third carrier system  in  addition to the Shuttle and the Russian rockets able to succeed  in placing a space station in a 400-km-altitude orbit with an  inclination of 51.6 degrees, as planned for the global station.  Kourou's location close to the equator presents further  advantages here. Europe's new carrier rocket could, that is, as  it is being developed at the moment, carry 18 tons to a station  in this orbit. This is something absolutely new, and a  strengthening of Europe's position. In the original planning for  Freedom the Americans permitted only Shuttle flights and charged  a lot of money for them.    However, ESA's new plans also include an independent  scenario  for the case of cases that an international space station does  not come off. Equipped with a logistics module and solar cell  paddles, the APM could also orbit alone around the earth.  Jean-Marie Luton emphasized in closing that the paper in  question is a strategy document and is to serve as a reference  point for the next two years. The first actual decisions are to  take place not until at the next ESA ministers' conference at  the beginning of 1995.    BDLI [Federation of the German Aerospace Industry] Fears  Further Loss of Jobs    It is uncertain whether ESA will manage to succeed with this  plan with every member country. Though Federal Research Minister  KrÆuger and his French and Italian colleagues agree that  Europe in any case is to take part in phase two of the  American-Russian space station, however, as it looks, there are  various opinions about this. The new head of DARA [German Agency  for Space Affairs], Dr. Jan-Baldem Mennicken, said to the press  on this matter at the beginning of October, ""It is also being  considered whether it is not possible to do without an  independent laboratory and integrate Europe's contribution into  a joint international laboratory."" Mennicken said further that  this has to be discussed in the near future with ESA and the  industry. Timetables, costs and any disadvantages have to be  taken into consideration here. The maintenance of the industry's  technological capacity will play a decisive role in this  discussion. But the APM is still a stipulated part of the  program, he stressed.    The chairman of BDLI's space flight working group, Horst  Rauck, demanded in this connection, in the light of further cuts  in funds, ""The Europeans have to take part as equal partners in  the global space station."" Keeping the German contribution for  ESA at the earmarked sum of DM1.172 billion is the prerequisite  for this, he says. Otherwise the further weakening of Germany as  a site for industry and the loss of high-technology jobs are to  be feared, he stressed. What will remain at the end, with the  shrinking process of the Columbus European space station, is  written in the stars. The Freeflyer was stricken off the list a  long time ago already, and the docked laboratory (APM) has been  scaled down and postponed once again. We will wait and see.     "

""We achieved all objectives,"" said Russian team leader  Nikita  Smidovitch, who told reporters his 10-day mission to Iraq had  been ""successful.""

He was to leave Manama, the United Nations' base for Iraqi  missions, late Sunday.    The long-term monitoring of the Iraqi arms program is  critcial to Baghdad's hopes for an end to the embargo imposed  after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. By accepting  Security Council Resolution 715, Iraq hopes to at least have UN  sanctions on its oil exports lifted.    Asked how many missions were still needed before long-term  monitoring could begin, Smidovitch replied? ""Quite frankly, it  will take time. We need more activities to set up the  monitoring process.""    The surveillance program is the next UN step following the  destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf  war of January-February 1991.    Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting  it for three years and has been lobbying hard for an end to the  embargo.    On Wednesday, the UN's deputy disarmament chief said  long-term monitoring of Baghdad's weapons program was still some  way off despite Iraq's efforts to have sanctions lifted.

Both sides agreed to put up the construction of the plant  for  international bidding. The facility, which will filter  radioactive substances from the liquid waste, is expected to be  completed within this year.    In the coming years Russia will dismantle some 60 nuclear  submarines. Several storage ships including a 2,000-ton tanker  fully loaded with nuclear waste are currently mooring off  Vladivostok.    The hazardous cargo could pose a serious threat to the  environment as most of the vessels are worn out, although no  leakage has so far been reported.    For lack of storage and treatment facilities, the former  Soviet Union and Russia have dumped thousands of tons of nuclear  waste in the Sea of Japan and other waters off its coast.    The disclosure of the decades-long nuclear dumping has  sparked international protests and calls for a rapid solution to  the storage crisis.    Tokyo said earlier this month the plant will be funded from  a  70 million dollar Japanese grant for the dismantling of Russian  nuclear weapons and nuclear waste disposal.     "

""We achieved all objectives,"" said Russian team leader  Nikita  Smidovitch, who told reporters his 10-day mission to Iraq had  been ""successful.""    Smidovitch was inspecting Iraq's military arsenal under UN  Security Council Gulf war ceasefire resolutions.    ""The Iraqis had a forthcoming attitude,"" Smidovitch said.  ""Iraq has promised to cooperate and said they will do what they  can to shorten ?he period"" needed to set the monitoring process  in motion.    He was to leave Manama, the United Nations' base for Iraqi  missions, late Sunday.    The long-term monitoring of the Iraqi arms program is  crucial  to Baghdad's hopes for an end to the embargo imposed after the  invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. By accepting Security  Council Resolution 715, Iraq hopes to at least have UN sanctions  on its oil exports lifted.    Asked how many missions were still needed before long-term  monitoring could begin, Smidovitch replied? ""Quite frankly, it  will take time. We need more activities to set up the  monitoring process.""    The surveillance program is the next UN step following the  destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction af?er the Gulf  war of January-February 1991.    Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting  it for three years and has been lobbying hard for an end to the  embargo.    On Wednesday, the UN's deputy disarmament chief said  long-term monitoring of Baghdad's weapons program was still some  way off despite Iraq's efforts to have sanctions lifted.    American Charles Duelfer, deputy head of the UN Special  Commission (UNSCOM) disarming Iraq under the Gulf war ceasefire  resolutions, spent five days in Iraq preparing a visit there  this week by his boss Rolf Ekeus.    Ekeus is due to arrive in Baghdad on Tuesday to discuss  monitoring, but has said he is unlikely to recommend a lifting  of sanctions before the end of the year.     "

The moment to cut capacity is when an industry heads into recession, not when it is clambering back to profitability. No management will cut capacity when its plants, however inefficient, are set to generate cash. Even so, the Commission's failure to tackle the industry's structural overcapacity will have a long-term cost. The pain during the next trough is likely to be that much worse. Continuing excess capacity will once again drive prices so low that steelmakers will be unable to cover their fixed costs. But next time the sector will find it more difficult to export its way out of trouble, particularly to the US where manufacturers appear increasingly competitive. It will also need to cope with imports from eastern European suppliers which should have sorted out their difficulties by then. If Europe's industry is ever to become self-supporting and provide a decent return on capital, the Commission will have to reject demands for state subsidies next time round. Aid may preserve politically sensitive jobs, but it perpetuates inefficient production and costs huge sums to the tax-payers. Most importantly, subsidies threaten free trade. If Europe's steel industry is to prosper it must export, especially to Asia where growth is strong and capacity shortages exist. Asian doors will be justifiably barred to a subsidised European steel sector.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

In a report to the United Nations, Iraq admits to having more than 50 Scud-type missiles and a large arsenal of chemical weapons  - including Scud warheads - but claims to have no nuclear arms nor the means to make them. The report was delivered in response to the Security Council's ceasefire resolution, which ordered the destruction under UN supervision of all of Iraq's most dangerous weapons. Previously, neither western nor Israeli officials knew whether Iraq had chemical warheads for its Scuds, although it was known to have chemical bombs and artillery. Western officials are dissatisfied with Iraq's nuclear accounting, which also denied the existence of any support and manufacturing facilities for nuclear weapons. They said last night that the response, including an assertion that what nuclear materials Iraq possessed were subject to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, was inadequate. Baghdad acknowledges having 1,145 mustard gas bombs or artillery shells and 280 tonnes of mustard gas as a finished product, as well as no fewer than 9,420 nerve gas warheads, 200 nerve gas bombs and 725 tonnes of nerve gas of the Sarin and Tabun types as finished or intermediate material. But the document attests to the success of allied attacks, admitting that 16 production sites, including research and development laboratories, were destroyed. The report says Iraq now possesses one Scud missile in the 50-300km range and 51 al-Husseins (an upgraded Scud type) with 650km range. Thirty chemical and five conventional warheads are part of the al-Hussein arsenal. There are four missile launchers and two mobile missile erectors at the Rashid camp, according to the report, as well as 32 platforms in the western zone. An international commission of at least 20 technical experts will supervise the destruction of the weapons. Its composition, probably under a Swedish chairman, is expected to be announced next week.

0,FT921-1442 ,"FT921-1442 _AN-CCXBBAFAFT 920324   FT  24 MAR 92 / Brussels warns on fuel tax      By DAVID GARDNER      BRUSSELS   THE European Community will not be able to meet its commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 without some form of the tax on fossil and other forms of energy advocated by Brussels, European Commission officials said yesterday. Several member states had maintained that their own energy-saving and anti-global-warming measures could meet the EC target without a tax. But with a week to go before the deadline by which each of the 12 agreed to submit a programme of 'complementary measures' to cut CO output, only three member states - Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands - have done so. The UK, which has promised to stabilise emissions only by 2005, has submitted its white paper on the environment, This Common Inheritance, which lacks detailed timetables on emissions. Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner behind the energy tax proposal, said: 'This proves that on a strictly national level, far from being sufficient to deal with the emissions, the problem is that they (member states) do not even fulfil these basic commitments.' The national programmes are supposed to constitute one of three weapons  - alongside the SAVE energy conservation programme and the carbon/energy tax - in the EC arsenal against global warming. The Commission had originally calculated that without a tax, the EC would only meet three-fifths of its emission reduction target by 2000. It therefore wants a levy falling half on fossil fuels and half on other forms of non-renewable energy, equivalent to Dollars 3 on a barrel of oil, rising to Dollars 10 by 2000, which member states would offset by tax reductions. Industry has lobbied against the plan in proportion to the intensity with which it consumes energy, arguing voluntary measures would meet the EC target. Ministers did, however, agree on tighter limits to the sulphur content in diesel and heating oil. Sulphur in diesel will have to be not more than 0.2 per cent by October 1994, and 0.05 per cent by October 1996.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

The announcement was condemned by British and German officials in Brussels as 'astonishing' and 'ridiculous', and attacked as a thinly veiled attempt to push through controversial Commission proposals to accelerate EC anti-dumping procedure. Sir Leon believes the countries have broken EC law by taking unilateral action to abolish or extend national quotas on goods from 'state trading countries' - China, Vietnam and North Korea. Existing quotas expired when the single market began on January 1, and Sir Leon claims member states should have asked for Brussels' permission to extend or abolish them. The products affected include shoes, gloves, toys and crockery. Formal letters of complaint will now be sent and if the Commission is not satisfied with the replies it could eventually take the countries to the European Court of Justice. The harmonisation of quotas is linked to anti-dumping proposals which Britain, Germany and the Netherlands claim will give Brussels too much control over the EC's arsenal of trade weapons. The Commission says it cannot separate the quota problem from its proposals on trade weapons, because southern member states such as France will not agree to harmonise or abolish import restrictions unless anti-dumping procedure is speeded. 'If you talk to importers around the Community, they are in complete confusion about who they answer to and what they are meant to do,' said Sir Leon's spokesman yesterday. 'The risk is that by renationalising quotas they are undermining the single market: one country which might like to maintain limits on imports cannot because another has (unilaterally) opened its borders.' But British diplomats yesterday blamed the Commission for not coming up with an alternative interim strategy. 'We think (the Commission) is wrong legally and wrong politically,' said one. Both Britain and the Netherlands have extended last year's quotas until the end of March, while Germany has gone for full liberalisation, abolishing its remaining restrictions. Denmark, Italy and Greece have all sought Commission authorisation for interim measures.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     NLZ  Netherlands, EC.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

It would mark the first attempt by companies to pool their research resources to combat the growing US and Japanese threat. The sector has been suffering from chronic overcapacity especially in petrochemicals and bulk chemicals. Some unprofitable European plants are protected from closure by national governments even though their prices are deeply undercut by newer plants especially in Asia. Mr Dirk Hudik, ICI's manager of European affairs, said yesterday that research directors from European companies would meet next month to identify suitable areas for sector-wide research. Programmes would probably centre around environmental research, to develop waste management technologies, greater energy efficiency and sustainable production. Another possibility could be the use of information technology in process control, Mr Hudik added. Two more meetings are likely over the next six months, and the companies aim to submit concrete proposals to the European Commission by the autumn in the hope of attracting funding. Under its research programme, the Commission usually provides half the funding for joint industry projects, which have hitherto been limited to pre-competitive research. With the European chemical industry facing shrinking margins and mounting research development costs, there has been growing interest in exploring collaboration. Mr Peter Schwarz, head of research at the Italian chemical group Enichem, said yesterday: 'We believe co-operation will be a large part of operations in the future, particularly in the situations of high risk of financial exposure which are present in the chemical area.'

0,FT934-9556 ,"FT934-9556 _AN-DKJC4ACZFT 931110   FT  10 NOV 93 / Personal View: Europe cannot afford to miss Asia boat      By VICTOR FUNG   For those of us living in Hong Kong, at the heart of the Asia-Pacific region, these are heady times. Every statistic shows the region as the most dynamic in the world, and likely to stay that way for the decade ahead. The latest report of the Asian Development Bank predicts that the region's developing economies will achieve average annual gross domestic product growth of 7 per cent this year, compared with less than 2 per cent for developed countries. China, whose GDP growth has averaged 9 per cent over the past decade, is tipped to grow a further 13 per cent this year, and 10 per cent next year. Pause a moment and think what that means for Asia's potential as a consumer market: an economy of 1.2bn people - about a quarter of the world's population - growing at about 10 per cent a year. A new age of consumerism is emerging in Asia bringing breathtaking opportunities for trade and investment. To illustrate the point: By 2000, the economies of Asia will together be larger than those of Europe or North America, and will be home to two-thirds of the world's population. The number of affluent Asian households, with an annual income of Dollars 30,000 or more, will rise by 50 per cent, to 50m homes. Average incomes in Hong Kong and Singapore equal the European average, and are already higher than those in the Irish Republic, Greece and Portugal. Asia's imports from Europe amounted to Dollars 129bn in 1991 - Dollars 21bn more than US imports of European goods. The region is already the largest buyer of Europe's food, chemicals, machinery, and textiles and clothing. For its extraordinary potential to be realised, Asia needs the full engagement of companies from all regions, especially the advanced industrial economies. Indeed, Asia would not be where it is today, at the heart of international trade, without immense investment from countries outside the region. But is Europe going to play the same role in Asia in the years ahead that it has played in the past, or will it look inward to the single European market as it struggles with recession? We see executives preoccupied with forging links with the emerging economies of east and central Europe. Will these priorities keep investment and management attention out of Asia - or at least on the margins - at a time of unparalleled opportunity? I raise this because I feel uneasy about forecasts suggesting that the economies of east and central Europe will, within the decade, emerge from their transition from command economies. Hong Kong's experience as mainland China's principal joint venture partner in economic reform suggests that the transition will take longer. China's transition, while comparatively smooth, has not been free of economic and political difficulties. But by capitalising on a range of advantages, it has been able to put perestroika ahead of glasnost and motivated hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurial overseas Chinese to invest in their home provinces. Hong Kong on its border has acted as a funnel for potential investors, an efficient entrepot, and as a base for Chinese companies to learn the ways of market economies. If solutions to Europe's complex economic problems are to take years to unfold, can European companies afford to bury themselves in long-term prospects if it means neglecting opportunities to profit now from buoyant growth in Asia? Opportunities in Asia may no longer exist once Europe has put its house in order. The US, for example, is hosting a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum in Seattle next week, which is intended to forge closer economic links between the US and wider Pacific region. The US has unveiled an export promotion programme intended to boost annual exports from almost Dollars 700bn at present to Dollars 1,000bn by 2000, with Asia as an important target for growth. Unless European companies move quickly there is a real possibility of missing the boat in Asia. In raising the alarm my motives are not entirely philanthropic, because we in Asia will also pay a price if European companies are not fully engaged in the region. As leaders in innovation and high-tech production in many sectors, we need the stimulus Europe's companies would bring. In short, we need Europe's companies in Asia. Hong Kong can provide a principal gateway to a new economic alliance between east and west.

The document was submitted to the  government session by the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak  Republic. [passage omitted]    Radioactive waste is currently being stored on the premises  of individual nuclear power stations and the existing capacities  are about 50 percent full. Spent fuel is being stored in  storage pools of the wet type [skladovacie bazeny mokreho typu]  and, in the best possible case, existing storage capacities will  last until 1997.    Dominant among solid waste are a large quantity of  contaminated soil (1,900 cubic meters) and scrap metal (1,980  tonnes) stemming from the dismantling of some technical  installations. According to the Ministry of Economy document,  radioactive waste from nuclear power stations is being stored in  various storage systems that represent a fairly big risk from  the viewpoint of potential environmental impact.    The devices needed to handle, pack, and transport  radioactive  waste to the storage site have been secured. The long-term safe  storage of radioactive waste, however, including the storage and  definitive depositing of spent fuel, has not been secured so  far, the Ministry of Economy document states.     "

It should not be.' This is absolutely correct. The crisis in Kashmir has claimed many lives. As in Bosnia and Somalia, the majority of the victims of the Kashmir crisis are civilians, particularly women and children. These non-combatants have been targeted by military forces and suffer from chronic shortages of food and medicine. But in Kashmir there is an added dimension to the crisis. This is that both India and Pakistan, which as you say have fought two wars over Kashmir and remain at loggerheads, are now believed to possess nuclear arsenals. As tensions rise again today, the continued hostilities between them pose a nuclear threat to the Indo-Pakistani region, and to the world. The Bush administration had no policy for Kashmir. Its efforts to encourage nuclear non-proliferation were therefore doomed to failure since reducing the threat of a nuclear exchange in south Asia is inexorably linked to resolving the status of Kashmir. How can one talk of disarming India and Pakistan when the cause of their tensions, the usettled status of Kashmir, was not up for discussion? Reducing the threat of a nuclear exchange in south Asia is inexorably linked to resolving the status of Kashmir. Prime Minister John Major is to be congratulated for recognising this fact, and for seeking to bring about negotiations with Britain as the mediator. He should not be deterred by India's recent rebuff, and should also encourage the new Clinton administration to make Kashmir a priority. Time is not on our side. Every day more and more atrocities are being committed by Indian security forces. Humanitarian considerations for action in Kashmir are tremendous. But the geo-strategic considerations are even more compelling. Kashmir's strategic location makes it a 'nuclear trip-wire' for south Asia - a trip-wire more unstable than the threat posed by the nuclear arsenal in the Commonwealth of Independent States.

After all, Klein, author of The Keynesian Revolution and founder of Wharton Econometrics, has been associated with the sorts of economic policy and instruments which have not been an unqualified success in Western economies. By contrast, China's private sector is booming and the economy is growing at an annual rate of 10 per cent plus. Now might not seem the best time for the powers-to-be to start tinkering with the sort of micro-economic management that has failed elsewhere. However, China is no stranger to stop-go economic policies and Klein, who has made eight trips to the country, is no novice on the country's problems. Even fast-growing countries have to manage their growth, especially if this involves dismantling the complex structures of socialist bureaucracy. Econometric modellers may be out of fashion, but few industrialised nations dare dismantle their economic models, however flawed.  The Financial Times   London Page 21  "

Although neither ATT nor Ziff would comment on the reports, sources close to the negotiations said the deal could be completed before the end of the year. If the transaction went ahead, it would provide ATT with an important entry into the rapidly expanding market for on-line computer services. It would also complete the dismantling of the Ziff family's publishing empire. ATT, with its large customer base from its core telephone business, hopes to play a central role in the development of interactive telecommunications in the US. Although Ziff's Interchange Online Network is not expected to be ready until next year, the service will enable users to exploit the latest multimedia computer technology - a significant advantage over the older on-line services provided by established companies such as CompuServe, Prodigy and America Online. ATT will face intense competition in the on-line computer services business. In addition to the well-established services, it will soon face competition from software group Microsoft, which in November announced plans to launch an on-line service.

During the ANPP sessions, the address by  Eduardo Martinez from the Economic Commission of the ANPP  regarding a possible change in Cuban currency aroused intense  debate.    [Begin recording] [Martinez] I believe that the change of  currency is a valid measure that could effectively act upon the  problems of the national financial imbalance. Therefore, it is  one measure in the arsenal of possible measures. I believe it  can be implemented at the opportune moment, although I believe  there is another group of measures that can be adopted in a  first instance without having recourse to the change of  currency. In other words, I am not putting aside that  possibility at all, for it is one of the possibilities the  government should have at hand for implementation at the right  moment.    [Diaz] The people are also highly concerned about the  capacity, the purchasing power of the currency. Some people have  asked us: After certain measures are taken, the dollars will  have no value? Perhaps they are referring to an intermediate  currency between our currency and hard currency. How would this  function?    [Martinez] I believe it is still a little speculative to  talk  about this. The measures to control the hard currency  circulation in Cuba ought to be adopted, but their exact shape  must be adapted to the reality, and at the opportune moment.  Therefore, to now try to define the exact shape seems to me a  bit speculative. I believe the ANPP is highlighting the  essential, the need to exert control over the circulation of  hard currency in the country, which is already part of excess  liquidity.    [Diaz] Can you tell if the prices in the dollar stores are  going to increase or drop following this financial readjustment?    [Martinez] I can not predict that.    [Diaz] Thank you.

The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine has finally decided to define its  attitude toward the trilateral declaration of the presidents of  Ukraine, the United States and Russia. As official sources have  indicated more than once, this document proclaims the removal of  nuclear weapons from Ukraine and defines the mechanism for  compensation and security guarantees for our nation.    All of the nuclear warheads, according to the trilateral  declaration, will be removed from the territory of Ukraine to  Russia for their subsequent dismantling in the shortest possible  time. Russia will provide compensation in the form of deliveries  of fuel rods for the requirements of Ukrainian nuclear power  engineering.    Ukraine will provide for the destruction of all nuclear  weapons, including strategic offensive weapons, deployed on its  territory within seven years, and all of the SS-24 missiles will  be deactivated within ten months through the removal of their  nuclear charges.    Russia will in turn guarantee the technical servicing and  safe operation of the nuclear warheads. The United States will  provide technical and financial assistance for the reliable and  safe dismantling of the nuclear weapons.    Everything that is contained in the trilateral declaration  and the addendum to the declaration, from the point of view of  President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, conforms to the  requirements posed by the Supreme Soviet regarding ratification  of the START-1 treaty and satisfies the restrictions advanced by  the people's deputies. There were 13 such restrictions, and they  talked chiefly about the aforementioned security guarantees and  the granting of financial and technical assistance directed  toward the elimination of the nuclear arsenal.    Life has confirmed once again, however, that there are as  many ideas as there are people. And when we are talking about  politicians, then they could have even more.    There were meetings the day before the recent session of the  Supreme Soviet by the commissions on questions of defense and  national security, questions of legislation and legality,  foreign affairs and the working deputies' commission to study  the START-1 treaty. The aim of the session was to prepare  findings regarding the conformity of the trilateral declaration  signed on January 14 in Moscow. Since there was not a quorum at  the session, they did not come to any unified findings, but each  commission came to its own findings separately. Since it would  be out of place to cite those findings, we will address the  results of the working commission to study the START-1 treaty.    According to the statement by President of Ukraine Leonid  Kravchuk, the members of that commission indicate, he has  confirmed his ""commitment to the fact that Ukraine join the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NNPT] as a state not  possessing nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time."" The  Supreme Soviet, at the same time, had earlier considered Ukraine  to be the possessor of nuclear weapons, and only the realization  of START-1 ""would open up the way for the resolution by the  Supreme Soviet of Ukraine of the question of joining the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty.""    Another detail is connected with the fact that the  trilateral  declaration indicates that ""Ukraine will provide for the  destruction of all nuclear weapons, including strategic  offensive weapons, deployed on its territory,"" even though the  Supreme Soviet has stipulated the destruction of only 36 percent  of the missile delivery systems and 42 percent of the nuclear  warheads. Moreover, this presidential wording obligates Ukraine  to destroy not only all nuclear weapons within seven years, but  also all strategic offensive weapons along with their  infrastructure. After all, as was indicated on this score in a  memorandum of the U.S. embassy, ""any preservation of deployed  SS-24 ICBMs after the seven-year period of cutbacks under the  START treaty would be in contradiction to the obligations of  Ukraine, whether those missiles are fitted with nuclear or  conventional warheads,"" and the United States ""will not agree to  any weakening of this obligation."" This categorical American  attitude signifies that the prospects for the creation of  high-precision weaponry with conventional warheads based on the  SS-24 delivery system as a means of strategic deterrence are  quite uncertain.    The terms of compensation for tactical nuclear weapons,  financing for inspection activities, the possibility of using  launch silos for peaceful purposes, the use of weapons-grade  plutonium, and expenditures for the social support of officers  and warrant officers of the missile forces who will be  discharged from the army owing to the cutbacks all remain  uncertain in the trilateral declaration.    I am citing all of these contradictions in great detail in  order to give a better sense of the tension that was present in  the hall of the Supreme Soviet during the discussion of the  trilateral declaration, the ratification of the START-1 treaty  and the joining of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The  speeches by President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, Minister of  Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy  Radetskyy and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko  stressed once again the fact that nuclear weapons are no  guarantee of security for us, we are not able to maintain them,  and to go against the world opinion, even if you are correct, is  a hopeless matter. Nuclear weapons for Ukraine, in the current  economic difficulties, are almost a suitcase for a drowning man  -- too heavy to hold on to, but a shame to let go of.    The fate of the nuclear weapons stationed on the territory  of  Ukraine was resolved in two hours of discussion by the two  paragraphs of a Decree of the Supreme Soviet, namely:    1. Bearing in mind the specific steps taken by the President  and Government of Ukraine with regard to the fulfillment of the  provisions of the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of 18 November  1993 and the reciprocal steps on the part of the United States  and Russia, to remove the restrictions with regard to Article 5  of the Protocol to the START Treaty that was signed in Lisbon on  23 May 1993.    2. To authorize the Government of Ukraine to exchange  letters  on the ratification of the START-1 treaty and to make more  active the actions of the Government to reach a concrete  agreement that flows out of the restrictions of the Supreme  Soviet regarding the ratification of the START-1 Treaty.    What do the two paragraphs of this short decree mean?    First, that very difficult and painstaking work lies ahead.  At least five treaties or agreements will have to be reached,  which translate or at least should translate the declarative  substance of many provisions of the trilateral declaration into  the area of concrete, detailed and documented mutual  obligations. This pertains first and foremost to a schedule for  the dispatch of the first lot of nuclear warheads to Russia, an  agreement pertaining to the procedure and conditions for  monitoring their dismantling and salvaging on the part of  Ukraine, an agreement on compensation for the value of the  nuclear weapons transferred to Russia, and an agreement on  guarantor's and originator's oversight of the status of the  warheads that are still in Ukraine, including their transport to  ""S"" facilities and plant yards.    Second, that it is still too soon to put a period to the  resolution of the problem of the nuclear weapons stationed in  Ukraine, since a thing or two remains that is not entirely clear  or resolved. Although the removal of the restrictions pertaining  to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol also envisages Ukraine's  joining in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after all, the  deputies were still disinclined to the possibility during the  voting. Ukraine, under legal canons, does not have the slightest  right to demand compensation for strategic and tactical nuclear  weapons in joining the NNPT. The United States and Russia,  however, as indicated in the trilateral declaration, will  provide Kiev with security guarantees only in the event Ukraine  joins the NNPT. So the circle closes. And only time will tell  what the way out of this legal-political stalemate will be...     "

Its present Turkish  bosses are trying to find a town prepared to dismantle and store  300,000 square meters of asbestos roofing. Such work would cost  the United States $125 million. Turkey, following numerous  protests from the ``Greens,'' banned the dismantling within its  territorial waters. A factory in Sevastopol, that would be  prepared to do this for $1 million, is being picketed by  Greenpeace representatives, together with alarmed members of the  public. They are indignant at the intention to bury the  asbestos which is causing cancer and other grave illnesses on  the southern coast of the Crimea. However, the borders of the  CIS are clearly inaccessible to waste products.    The United States now plans to take the asbestos to Russia  and to bury it in the town of Azbest. A practice whereby rich  countries produce waste and the poorer pay for it with their  health and lives through burying, processing, or destroying it  is absolutely immoral, Greenpeace says. We are demanding the  immediate return of this poisonous vessel to its homeland, the  United States.

The published text of an agreement between the four countries suggested the pledges won by Kiev were little different from the standard promises made by nuclear countries to non-nuclear states under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Ukraine formally joined yesterday. Western diplomats declined to comment on whether any private or informal undertakings had been given in addition to the published text. The accession of Ukraine to the NPT is a diplomatic breakthrough which clears the way for the Start-1 treaty, providing for the elimination of 9,000 US and former Soviet nuclear warheads, to enter into force. The break-up of the Soviet Union left Ukraine with the world's third largest nuclear arsenal on its soil, and only last month did the Ukrainian parliament formally renounce the aspiration to wrest control of these weapons from Russia. Ukraine's adherence to the NPT was sealed during a European security conference in Budapest by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and the leaders of the US, Russia and Britain, which were the original architects of the treaty. President Kuchma thanked his three co-signatories for their understanding of the 'unique situation' of the nuclear weapons in Ukraine and their 'readiness to give security' to his country. Under the published text of yesterday's deal, the US, Russia and Britain pledged to respect Ukraine's borders, to refrain from using or threatening force against Ukraine, and to seek help from the UN Security Council if Ukraine is threatened with nuclear aggression. In an unusual declaration, reflecting Ukraine's nervousness of Russian commercial power, the three co-signatories pledged to refrain from infringing Kiev's sovereignty through economic coercion. Russian foreign policy experts have called openly for the use of their country's superior financial muscle to take over as much as possible of the Ukrainian economy. At the signing ceremony, President Bill Clinton hailed the 'arrival of a new and safer era' in world affairs. 'Ukraine has taken a bold move away from the nuclear precipice,' he said.

At the pre-tax level the year to February 28 suffered losses of Pounds 7.27m (1.41m profit). In Quadrant's continuing activities, operating losses grew to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 800,000) on turnover of Pounds 48.9m (Pounds 45.4m). Lord Rees ascribed this to 'the internal upheavals within the group,' and 'the deep recession in the UK economy.' The video systems and processing businesses were particularly badly affected. Extraordinary charges of Pounds 9.18m (Pounds 10.5m) included a Pounds 8.2m write-down of the company's two liquid petroleum gas ships. They were acquired in 1991 from a company controlled by Mr Robert Brothers, Lord Rees' predecessor. Mr David Coghlan, who became chief executive in December after he and Mr Jean-Marc Cangardel, his partner, bought a 25 per cent stake for Pounds 1.2m, said his first action had been to dismantle the nascent internal merger between the two divisions and Leeds Photovisual and Imagesenter. The merger contributed Pounds 2.11m to exceptional charges of Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 307,000), and its Pounds 101,000 dismantling costs swelled the extraordinaries. No dividend is proposed. In 1991-92, a total dividend of 4p was paid, including a final of 2.35p. Losses per share were 25.96p (6.87p earnings).   Companies:-  Quadrant Group.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT924-228 ,"FT924-228 _AN-DADBPAEXFT 921230   FT  30 DEC 92 / US starts crackdown on Somali gunmen      By REUTER      MOGADISHU   US FORCES began a crackdown on gunmen in the Somali capital yesterday seizing weapons, missiles and battlewagons 48 hours before a visit by President George Bush, Reuter reports from Mogadishu. US Air Force aircraft dropped 100,000 leaflets on Mogadishu warning residents that machine guns, mortars, and battlewagons would not be tolerated on the streets. 'Anyone aiming or pointing weapons directly at CTF (Combined Task Force) forces will be shot,' the leaflet said. Military spokesman Colonel Fred Peck said US troops seized a large cache of arms and missiles in north-east Mogadishu and a smaller arsenal from a building opposite the US embassy, which Mr Bush will visit. The actions marked the start of a clampdown by the multinational task force on bandits in Mogadishu, where shootings, looting and mugging are still widespread. More evidence emerged that Somalia's warring clans engaged in a final fling of killing and looting just before the December 9 US-led intervention in Somalia. Diplomatic sources confirmed that a clan in the southern port of Kismayu massacred over 100 people from another clan on the eve of the US Marine landing in Mogadishu. The diplomatic sources said the killings were believed to have taken place over three nights. Mr Sean Devereux, a Unicef worker in Kismayu, recently called the pogrom 'targeted clan killings.' Gunmen also shot dead four Somalis working for the International Red Cross (ICRC) and one from the relief agency Care on Monday in incidents which highlighted continued lawlessness, officials from both agencies said. Mr Bush is coming to Somalia primarily to meet US troops for the New Year in what will almost certainly be his swan song as commander-in-chief of the US military before he hands over the White House to President-elect Bill Clinton on January 20. The visit will last about 27 hours, half of it aboard the amphibious assault ship Tripoli. Mr Bush will meet soldiers at bases in Mogadishu, Baidoa and Bali Dogle and make brief stops at a relief agency field centre and a home for orphans of Somalia's famine and war, US officials said.

A total of 180  warheads had been removed from Ukraine to the Russian Federation  by now, said Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in an interview  with ITAR-TASS at an opening ceremony of the Kiev spring fair on  Friday.    ""It is no secret for anyone that combat nuclear missiles  stationed on the Ukrainian territory were not under Ukraine's  control since the `nuclear button' was in Moscow. Besides,  Ukraine never sought to take possession of such dangerous  weapons,"" the Ukrainian president said. He confirmed Ukraine's  intention to implement in full a tripartite agreement signed by  the Russian, Ukrainian and the U.S. presidents at the beginning  of 1994.    ""We signed the agreement, hoping that other nuclear  countries  would take adequate measures and begin disarmament,"" Kravchuk  said. He pointed out that according to information at his  disposal the United States intends to make large-scale cuts of  their nuclear arsenals, fulfilling agreements reached during the  Moscow meeting.    He went on to say that by the end of May all American  missiles targeted at Ukraine would be re-coded. ""The time comes  when our countries will really switch over from words of  friendship and cooperation to concrete deeds,"" he said.     "

TOTH, Times Staff Writer      WASHINGTON      The Soviet Union possesses about 33,000 nuclear weapons, 40% more than the  United States, but it is rapidly phasing out old warheads much as this nation  did 20 years ago when its stockpile was that large, the private,  pro-disarmament Natural Resources Defense Council reported Wednesday.    The two superpowers now have about equal numbers of warheads and bombs -- some  13,000 each -- on long-range weapons. The Soviets have twice as many  shorter-range nuclear systems. However, some of these are being discontinued,  or their nuclear explosives are being replaced with conventional explosives,  the council said.    The data was presented in the council's 433-page ""Soviet Nuclear Weapon  Databook,"" which it described as the first comprehensive tally and analysis of  the Soviet stockpile.

Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki on Monday reminded his negotiating  partners from Hungary and Czechoslovakia of the successful pact among their  forebears more than six centuries ago.    But Monday's effort to link the three most reform-oriented nations of Eastern  Europe in a new economic and defense alliance stalled over their differing  states of readiness for integration with Western Europe and over the future of  their relations with Moscow.    Age-old ethnic conflicts that threaten many of Europe's fragile new democracies  also prevented any major advance on the road to regional unity.    Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel called the Bratislava meeting to discuss  how the three nations might voluntarily cooperate, now that the alliances of  the Warsaw Pact and Comecon that bound them under socialism have begun  withering.    In an opening address to the presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers,  Havel proposed that a new European security commission be created this year,  based in the Czechoslovak capital of Prague.    Mazowiecki, however, reportedly pressed for such an institution to be based in  Warsaw, to bolster the Polish state that is wedged between the Soviet Union and  a new economic superpower forming to its west as the Germanys reunite.    Havel also brought up the idea of Hungary and Czechoslovakia joining in an  Adriatic trade bloc with Austria, Italy and Yugoslavia.    ""The Poles know they do not belong to this historical alliance of Alp-Adria,  but they fear they could be left out of a new integrated European community  without it,"" Havel noted in his speech.    Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski said that such a southeast  European alignment would not be a problem for Poland, which he says enjoys good  relations with the Adriatic and Alpine states.    Poland has been discussed as a potential partner in a regional alliance with  Scandinavia. But its severe economic problems, foremost among them a foreign  debt approaching $40 billion, might frustrate its integration with prosperous  nations like Sweden and Norway.    Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier said officials from the Central  European corridor would gather again in a few weeks to discuss how they might  move the security commission plan forward.    One awkward drag on the talks Monday was the lame-duck status of the Hungarian  delegates.

The three were sent to represent  Hungary at the Bratislava talks.    A particularly sensitive point for the three national delegations was the  question of their foreign relations, especially with the Soviet Union that once  dominated them.    Havel suggested that Soviet President Mikhail S.

The government  plans to send a fact- finding mission to Russia shortly to work  out details.    Hoping to prevent further dumping of nuclear wastes at sea,  the government had originally proposed to Russia that it would  supply a Panamanian-registered chemical tanker (with  displacement of 6,800 tons).    However, Russia rejected the offer in mid-January, pointing  out that ""the tanker cannot operate in frozen waters because the  outer walls of its hull are too thin."" Instead, Russia has  indicated its intention to tentatively store radioactive wastes  in its own tanker built exclusively for this purpose. In  addition, it has revealed a plan to construct simplified  disposal facilities for handling liquid radioactive wastes in  Vladivostok and has asked Japan to provide financial support for  this project.    In this connection, the Japanese Government, after careful  review, has decided to extend several hundred million yen in  financial assistance to help fund construction of a filtering  device which is to become the core of the disposal facilities.  The government plans to allocate funds for the project from a  $100- million fund designated for dismantling nuclear weapons  possessed by former Soviet states.     "

Some other  aspects have come to light today, however. In fact, in the  course of the 16th round of the Estonian-Russian talks an  agreement on the troop withdrawal from Estonia was almost  completely agreed upon. For the first time Estonia agreed  officially to the Russian proposal for the troops to be  withdrawn by 31 August of this year. This has been stated by  Juri Kahn, Estonian ambassador to Russia. According to Kahn the  only point in the agreement that remains unresolved is the issue  of financial compensation. This will have to be regulated at  the level of heads of state. The Russian side has, however,  (?stipulated) that they would agree to holding a summit only  once the Estonian side has ensured social protection for the  Russian military pensioners in Estonia, according to the  conditions set by Russia.    Considerable progress at this round of Estonian-Russian  talks  was achieved also concerning issues on dismantling the nuclear  reactors at Paldiski. According to ETA this was stated by Mark  Sinisoo, leader of the Estonian delegation's working group on  Paldiski and an adviser at the Foreign Ministry, at a news  conference today. According to him success achieved at the talks  in Moscow resulted directly from the conclusions made at the  conference held last week in Stockholm on the issue of Paldiski.     "

Though American soldiers from throughout West Germany are expected to attend  the contest, officials don't expect a sellout.    The NFL originally planned to play the game in Frankfurt, where the large  number of American servicemen has led to high interest in football. Frankfurt  will be one of four European cities hosting teams in the World League of  American Football that starts next March.    The game was switched to Berlin because of the historic changes in Eastern  Europe that led to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and moves toward the  reunification of Germany.    Irv Pankey, the Rams' 6-5, 295-pound offensive tackle, used a hammer and chisel  to carve out a few pieces of the Berlin Wall as souvenirs for his family.    Jim Everett will start Saturday for the Rams, with Mark Herrmann and Chuck Long  also expected to play.    Mike Elkins will start at quarterback for the Chiefs, to be followed by Steve  Pelluer. No. 1 signal-caller Steve DeBerg is not expected to play.      Wire    "

The licensing deal is the first significant collaboration between two of Europe's biggest vehicle makers, demonstrating Mercedes-Benz's new readiness to develop alliances with other producers. Under the deal, VW is to use Mercedes-Benz technology to develop a successor for its ageing Volkswagen LT range of heavy vans. The agreement, which represents an important consolidation of forces in the European van sector, ends VW's search for a partner, which included talks with Renault of France. Mercedes-Benz, automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz and the world's leading commercial vehicle maker, is planning to launch its new van range (in the 2.5-4.6 tonnes gross weight class) in Europe next year to replace the T1 series. The VW version is likely to follow a year later. The licensing deal is likely to cut Mercedes-Benz's development costs by around a third, while Volkswagen has lacked the sales volumes to justify the development of a new heavy van range alone. The production of Volkswagen LT commercial and passenger vehicles totalled only 14,309 last year. Mercedes-Benz produced more than 50,000 T1 vans in Europe last year. It is planning to expand capacity at its Dusseldorf plant. Mercedes-Benz has also finalised a joint venture with Tata Engineering  Locomotive (Telco) of India, one of the world's leading makers of commercial vehicles, for the assembly of Mercedes-Benz cars in India. The joint venture will build up to 20,000 E-Class executive cars a year, plus about 50,000 engines at a new plant near Poona. Telco will take a 49 per cent stake, and Mercedes-Benz will have management control. The two groups plan to invest around DM250m (Pounds 100m).

The government  plans to send a fact- finding mission to Russia shortly to work  out details.    Hoping to prevent further dumping of nuclear wastes at sea,  the government had originally proposed to Russia that it would  supply a Panamanian-registered chemical tanker (with  displacement of 6,800 tons).    However, Russia rejected the offer in mid-January, pointing  out that ""the tanker cannot operate in frozen waters because the  outer walls of its hull are too thin."" Instead, Russia has  indicated its intention to tentatively store radioactive wastes  in its own tanker built exclusively for this purpose. In  addition, it has revealed a plan to construct simplified  disposal facilities for handling liquid radioactive wastes in  Vladivostok and has asked Japan to provide financial support for  this project.    In this connection, the Japanese Government, after careful  review, has decided to extend several hundred million yen in  financial assistance to help fund construction of a filtering  device which is to become the core of the disposal facilities.  The government plans to allocate funds for the project from a  $100- million fund designated for dismantling nuclear weapons  possessed by former Soviet states.     "

Some 1,600 members of peace organizations and religious  groups across the country took part in the rally held in Yaizu,  Shizuoka Prefecture, to commemorate the nuclear incident, which  occurred off the Bikini atoll in the South Pacific on March 1,  1954.    In the so-called lucky dragon incident, the Japanese fishing  boat No. 5 Fukuryu Maru (""Lucky Dragon V""), which was based in  Yaizu, was showered by a cloud of radioactive ash after the  United States conducted a thermonuclear bomb test some 135  kilometers to the west of where the ship was conducting fishing  operations.    Most of the 23 crew members suffered nausea, pain and skin  inflammation and one of the crew later died.    The incident sparked outcries in Japan against the U.S.  testing of nuclear weapons and attracted worldwide interest in  the influence of radioactivity on the human body.    At the rally, the participants adopted a resolution calling  for the dismantling of all nuclear arms while the radiation  victims or their bereaved families are still alive.    Among the participants was John Anjani, who was then mayor  of  a village near the atoll and was also exposed to radioactive  ash, and Anthony Guarisco, chairman of an association of U.S.  veterans who fell victim to radioactivity from atomic testing.

The pair are to co-operate in what will be France's largest car recycling plant at Athis Mons, south of Paris, based at an existing scrap metal crushing plant owned by Compagnie Francaise des Ferrailles, a federation of metal crushing and treatment groups. The plant will recover recyclable materials from 200 cars per day and produce a mixture of re-usable components - fluids such as oil and brake fluid, plastic and rubber granulates for the construction industry and plastic foam for insulation of buildings. However, this will be a small proportion of the 2m cars scrapped in France annually. Renault and Peugeot have agreed to share research into recycling methods and to study a joint waste collection scheme to collect recyclable materials such as used plastic bumpers from their dealer networks. Both groups have operated separate pilot recycling plants, where they have researched the most efficient ways of dismantling old cars to make the best use of materials. Peugeot claims to be able to recycle 95 per cent of the content of disused cars at a pilot plant near Lyons, operated with Compagnies Francaise des Ferrailles and Ciments Vicat, the Paris-based cement group. However, the plant capacity is 16 vehicles per day. Renault has a test recycling centre at its Flins assembly plant near Paris.  The Financial Times   International Page 18  "

The proposal by the Advisory Committee for Energy will lead  to a policy shift by the Atomic Energy Commission, the nation's  top energy policy board, which is now working on reviewing  Japan's long-standing policy of hoarding plutonium.    In an interim report to be presented in early June to the  minister of international trade and industry, the committee's  subpanel on nuclear energy will propose delaying construction of  a second plant to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to reproduce  plutonium, the officials said.    ""The commission's review is likely to reflect a policy  change  by the advisory panel,"" said a senior official at the Agency of  Natural Resources and Energy.    The official said the policy change also reflects a glut in  global uranium supply and the resulting fall in demand for  plutonium as a result of the end of the Cold War. Uranium is a  key nuclear fuel.    ""With uranium prices and demand for plutonium down, it will  be hard to make ends meet given the cost of building related  facilities,"" he said.    Construction of the plant is a key part of Japan's program  to  develop widespread use of nuclear technology for fast-breeder  reactors that produce more plutonium than they consume.    Japan is the world's only country to continue work on  development of fast-breeder reactors and has been accused of  undermining nuclear nonproliferation as plutonium is a key  component in nuclear weapons.    Although Japan has flatly denied any intention of developing  nuclear weapons, its pro-plutonium policy has spawned  speculation that it may build its own nuclear arsenal in the  future.    The committee's subpanel report will also propose reserving  spent nuclear fuel as it is, describing it as ""resources which  are temporarily reserved"" for future use. Plutonium can be  extracted from spent fuel.    The proposal suggests that nuclear policymakers still weigh  the value of domestically processed plutonium and hold out  prospects for future use of plutonium.    Japan relies heavily on nuclear power for its energy needs,  with some 30 percent of the nation's electricity being generated  by 42 nuclear plants.     "
0,FT934-13125 ,"FT934-13125 _AN-DJVCQAHNFT 931022   FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Regions will diverge as the rally slows - Bonds / The US is out of recession, but Germany hasn't bottomed. And European markets should be assessed on an individual basis      By CONNER MIDDELMANN   SO FAR, it has been a bumper year for international bond investors, and while the three-year global bond rally appears to be slowing, most observers say it is still far from over. Bond yields worldwide have slid sharply, and, amid sluggish growth and high unemployment, continued disinflationary policies in most countries are expected to pressure real and nominal yields further, keeping bond prices firmly supported. Moreover, given the high valuation of most equity markets, the attractiveness of fixed-income investments remains intact. 'If you don't buy bonds, what are you going to buy?' asks Philip Saunders, fixed interest investment director at Guinness Flight Global Asset Management. However, increasing regional divergences  - with the US economy well out of recession, while Germany still hasn't bottomed  - will affect global bonds and currencies very differently in coming months. While the the end of the easing cycles in the US and Japan is in sight, European bonds are likely to benefit from further easing. However, Europe's markets should be assessed on a more individual basis since August 2, when the fluctuation bands for most currencies in Europe's exchange-rate mechanism were widened to 15 per cent. In many countries, the effective suspension of the ERM brought to light the fundamentals that the old-style system had masked. A case in point is Belgium, which was considered a hard-core currency thanks to its peg to the D-Mark, but whose bond market has come under increasing pressure as its underlying problems  - spiralling debt and political uncertainty  - have become more apparent. Nevertheless, 'Europe still has considerable mileage, partly because real interest rates are still quite high by historical comparison,' says Mr Saunders. For unhedged sterling-based investors, currency considerations indicate that 'they couldn't do much better than by staying in the UK,' says Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets. For one, gilts offer attractive yields compared with most European core markets. In early October, the 8 per cent gilt due 2003 yielded some 97 basis points over Germany's 6.5 per cent Bunds due 2003. Moreover, Mr Jessop says that, despite higher-than-expected August RPI, underlying inflationary pressures remain subdued. Lastly, he notes that the currency is undervalued. 'With economic recovery under way in the UK and most continental economies in recession, sterling has scope to appreciate against most European currencies on a three- to six-month view,' agrees Nick Henderson, head of fixed interest at Gartmore Investment, which manages about Pounds 1.4bn in its bond funds. Gartmore's Henderson favours gilts with maturities between seven and 10 years, which, he says, stand to benefit most from further interest-rate cuts. Although the bulk of issuance is being done at the intermediate part of the yield curve, the fact that roughly two-thirds of this year's estimated Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement is already funded indicates that the market will absorb further supply with relative ease. For those investing in currency-hedged funds, other European bond markets may offer even better returns, however. Many fund managers are still keen on high-yielding Italian bonds, which have been Europe's star performer in the past two quarters. The combination of a weak economy, improving inflation prospects and fiscal tightening is expected to lead to substantial interest-rate cuts, further boosting bond prices and narrowing Italian bonds' yield gap over other markets. At the beginning of the month, Italian 10-year bonds currently yielded some 310 basis points over German bunds and 215 over 10-year gilts. The only cloud on the Italian horizon is political uncertainty amid the current budget debate and ahead of national elections, expected next spring. However, the market is widely expected to recover from any sell-off, supported in the long term by its solid fundamentals. Some 25 per cent of Guinness Flight's Dollars 25m European bond fund is invested in Italy, says Mr Saunders. Another quarter is invested in Ecu bonds, which 'trade in a similar fashion to French bonds but offer a reasonable yield pick-up.' Some 40 per cent of the fund's currency exposure is in sterling, 40 per cent is in Italian lire and 20 per cent in Swedish kronor. TO INVESTORS shying away from Europe's higher-risk high-yielders, French bonds still offer an attractive alternative among the hard-core markets. Bond strategists at UBS expect French bonds to outperform Germany, with the yield on French 10-year bonds seen falling as much as 30 basis points below its German counterpart as the Bund rally stalls. In many markets, the absence of inflationary pressures, prospects for a sustained period of low short-term rates andinvestors' desire to boost their returns will act as powerful incentives for moving along the yield curves, note economists at SG Warburg Securities. Meanwhile, many investors are reducing their bond exposure to the US and Japan. The two markets make up only 20 per cent of Guinness Flight's global bond fund, with European bond markets accounting for the remaining 80 per cent, though the fund's currency exposure is dollar-oriented, with 65 per cent exposed to the dollar bloc, 10 per cent in yen and the rest in a mix of European currencies.

0,FT944-13536 ,"FT944-13536 _AN-EJ0D9AC6FT 941027   FT  27 OCT 94 / Technology: New light on road safety - European car makers are using pioneering techniques      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Europe's motor industry has developed a system which could sharply reduce road deaths, according to European car manufacturers. The technology, which involves the use of ultra-violet light in headlamps, was developed under the Prometheus research programme and could be ready by the end of this decade. About 50,000 people are killed and around 1m injured each year on roads in Europe. With a view to reducing the toll, and solving another of the problems bedevilling Europe's roads - traffic congestion - 90 cars and trucks fitted with an assortment of pioneering technologies were put through their paces at a Paris conference last week. They were demonstrating the fruits of Prometheus, the first pan-European collaborative research project, which involves 13 vehicle manufacturers and some of their key component suppliers, plus electronics and defence equipment producers, research institutes and universities. Prometheus - an acronym for Programme for a European Traffic with Highest Efficiency and Unprecedented Safety - is eight years old and has cost nearly Ecu900m (Pounds 703m). The UV system, developed by Saab and Volvo, was demonstrated by Saab last week. At an unlit test track near Paris last week, the Saab 9000 showed only a hint of UV light from two small lamps at bumper level. But for the driver, the UV transformed the view. White lines and road signs treated with UV-responsive paint shone out from hundreds of yards ahead. Apart from safety, there is another dimension to the programme. Europe's vehicle makers are locked in a fierce race with rivals in Japan and North America to develop new technologies expected to transform vehicles and road infrastructure by the 21st century. At stake are vast rewards for those whose technologies become the industry standard in areas such as vision enhancement, automatic collision avoidance, and data interchange between vehicles and roadside equipment for purposes such as route finding and automatic tolling. The Prometheus research has fallen into three categories: safer driving, mainly through autonomous on-board systems; 'co-operative' driving, involving information exchanges between vehicles or roadside information beacons; and broader traffic management technology. The UV system falls into the first category. Jaguar, glass manufacturer Pilkington and GEC Marconi Avionics have taken a different approach, adapting military technology. A near-infra-red camera and filtered headlamps allow the driver to see into pitch-black countryside. Infra-red, unlike UV, can also cut through fog. Jaguar also demonstrated an 'intelligent' cruise control car, developed with Philips, Lucas Industries, Alfred Teves and DASA, which measures the distance and speed of vehicles ahead, maintaining a safe distance by automatic braking and throttle. The driver can override the system. Lucas, and Oxford and Southampton universities, has joined Jaguar to develop a vision system using a video camera and radar sensors to scan the road ahead and predict collision risk. BMW, Matra, Renault and Jaguar have also developed systems which help the driver stay in lane using a camera which recognises lane markings. Collectively, the Prometheus technology stands to change driving and safety standards beyond recognition in the next two decades - if motorists are prepared to pay extra for safety features.

The sources said late Monday Pyongyang's First Vice Foreign  Minister Kang Sok-chu said in a June 3 statement that North  Korea will not divert to military use any radioactive material  from fuel rods withdrawn recently from an experimental nuclear  reactor.    In the statement, Kang asserted it is still possible to test  the spent fuel rods to ensure that no plutonium has been  diverted to military purposes.    Kang urged the U.S. to resume talks with Pyongyang in order  to reach a package solution to the nuclear issue but also said  economic sanctions would be regarded as a ""declaration of war.""    During refueling operations of the research reactor in the  Yongbyon nuclear complex some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang  last month, North Korea rejected demands by International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors that they be allowed to take  samples from the 8,000 rods being withdrawn.    North Korean officials said it was setting aside 40 rods for  testing later by the IAEA inspectors, but the Vienna-based U.N.  monitoring agency rejected the offer as insufficient to ensure  the continuity of the safeguards agreement.    The U.S. and other Western nations suspect that Pyongyang  may be attempting to build an atomic weapons arsenal and are  threatening U.N. sanctions if it continues to reject IAEA  demands for checks.    Pyongyang insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful  purposes, but its intransigence over the inspections has fueled  suspicions it may be trying to conceal a weapons development  program.    Washington is offering to resume high-level talks with  Pyongyang but wants to see a freeze on the suspected North  Korean nuclear program.    This would include allowing two IAEA inspectors to remain in  North Korea, no reprocessing of the discharged fuel rods and no  reloading of the Yongbyon reactor.    Kang suggested in the June 3 statement that when a  comprehensive resolution to the issue is reached with the U.S.,  North Korea would allow regular and special IAEA inspections of  its nuclear facilities, return to the nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty and change to the safer light-water type of nuclear  reactor.

In response to Chinese accusations that Vietnam had been  harassing its oil survey vessels, a Foreign Ministry statement  said the area in question was entirely within Vietnam's  exclusive economic zone and had been never been part of the  Spratly Islands.    The statement implicitly denied any harassment of Chinese  vessels, saying that Vietnam had only been carrying out  legitimate survey work completely within its rights.    ""China should not make declarations or carry out acts that  violate Vietnam's incontestable sovereignty over this area,"" the  statement said, adding that this would not help efforts to  improve relations or secure peace in the region.    Vietnam has accused China of acting illegally by granting  Crestone Energy Corp. a concession to explore in a huge swathe  of the South China Sea that includes what the Vietnamese call  the Tu Chinh area.    ""Declarations that the Tu Chinh area lies within the  maritime  zone of the Spratly Islands and China's signature of an oil  exploration contract with Crestone run contrary to legal  principles and international conventions, in particular the 1982  Law of the Sea,"" the statement said.    Vietnam's parliament is expected to ratify the UN maritime  law during its session this month in a move seen as boosting  Hanoi's legal arsenal in the dispute. [passage omitted covered  by referent item]    Both sides have repeatedly pledged to resolve the dispute  over the Spratly and Paracel islands through negotiations and  avoid a repetition of the brief naval clash they fought in 1988.    But stepped up oil exploration across the area and new  technology that enables oil firms to drill cheaper wells in deep  waters is threatening to complicate the problem.    Oil firms here have downplayed the risk of confrontation,  saying that they are more concerned over whether the promising  geology under the South China Sea will actually yield commercial  quantities of oil and gas.    ""You're not going to see gunboats out there firing at each  other,"" said one oil executive who insisted on anonymity, adding  that he thought the dispute was mostly ""shadow playing.""     "

Japan made the offer last month in response to a Russian  call  for assistance so that it would not have to dispose of the waste  at sea following protests from Japan over the ocean disposal of  900 tons of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in October.  The dumping caused an international furor.    At Russo-Japanese talks at the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo on  December 21, Russia proposed the use of a tanker.    The Russian side said at the time that it was storing about  1,900 tons of liquid radioactive waste in four vessels and other  facilities around Vladivostok, but needed help in finding  storage space for an additional 5,000 to 25,000 tons of the  waste.    An estimated 5,000 tons of liquid radioactive waste are  generated annually in Russia as a result of the dismantling of  nuclear-powered submarines.    Japan later offered a Panamanian-registered tanker, but the  sources said that after three Russian experts inspected the  vessel in Singapore, they concluded it was not properly equipped  to store radioactive waste.    Instead, Russia will store the waste in a vessel acquired  locally.    The vessel can only store a limited volume of waste and  Japanese government officials say they will eventually have to  face the prospect of assisting Russia to build on-land storage  facilities for the waste.

Lt-Gen Sergei Zelentsov, of the Commonwealth of Independent States joint command, said the transfer was completed on Tuesday night. It would help ensure that the number of nuclear states did 'not grow,' he said. The announcement is a first success for the republics' attempts to reassure the west over the future of the vast nuclear arsenal which they inherited from the Soviet Union. A Russian foreign ministry representative said he hoped the four republics with strategic missiles - Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan - would soon agree a formula for jointly ratifying the Start treaty on reducing long-range missiles. It was signed last year but not ratified by the US and the Soviet Union. Apart from Russia, Ukraine has 176 strategic missiles, Kazakhstan 104 and Belarus 54. The announcement on tactical missiles was confirmed by an aide to the Ukrainian defence minister, Mr Konstantin Morozov, who said: 'Ukraine is trying to behave in such a way as to inspire trust in its policies.' The news coincided with a US tour by Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, who sent alarm bells ringing two months ago when he said he was suspending the shipment of tactical missiles to Russia because he was not sure they would be dismantled. A Ukrainian spokesman in Moscow said Ukraine, would be seeking international guarantees for its security. In Washington, Mr Kravchuk merely said Ukraine would transfer all the tactical nuclear weapons on its territory by July as originally planned. He said he expected Ukraine to sign the Start treaty. President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who has made no such promise, was quoted by Itar-Tass news agency as saying he would give up all nuclear weapons if he received guarantees for his republic's security from the US, China and Russia. Lt-Gen Zelentsov said it would take from next month until the year 2000 to dismantle the tactical weapons and recycle for civilian use the weapons-grade plutonium contained in the warheads.

But he insisted that the fate of the  settlements is an internal Israeli affair, completely divorced  from the current negotiations with the PLO.    Peres also told foreign correspondents Israel does not have  the money to meet settler demands for compensation in return for  evacuation. [passage omitted]    Peres told reporters that the government does not have the  political power to evacuate Jews from settlements.    He insisted that the government would seek to convince the  public that this needs to be done, but it cannot come as result  of PLO demands.    When asked about the wisdom of having settlements remain,  Peres said removing them would cause a deep schism in the  country. ""We wanted to push through an agreement with minimum  opposition. That is one of the reasons why we insisted the  settlements remain where they are. We thought that any  different approach would split the nation beyond recognition,""  he said.    When pressed by reporters on the idea of compensating  settlers who wish to leave, Peres scoffed at the notion.    ""They are talking about very large amounts of money,"" he  said. We aren't forcing them to leave, so why should we pay  compensation? In Sinai, since the government forced them to  leave, there was reason to compensate them. If we start with  compensation, it will be an endless story. I don't think we  have to do it.""     "

At the same time, negotiations intensified to form the first genuine coalition  government in Czechoslovakia in 40 years, as the discredited Communist Party  undertook to restore its credibility.    Government spokesman Marcel Jansen said that Interior Ministry work crews had  begun dismantling the heavy fencing along segments of the Austrian border,  concentrating first on tourist areas. Border posts, watchtowers, fences and  electronic surveillance devices will all be dismantled, Jansen said at a news  conference.    The move, intended to ease restrictions on Czechoslovak citizens and improve  relations with Western Europe, will further diminish the Iron Curtain, a  barrier that has suddenly become a relic of another time.    In the moves toward a coalition government, those involved in the talks were  working against a Sunday deadline set by the opposition group Civic Forum.    The new government, which is likely to have several non-Communist members,  would be transitional. It would rule only until free elections can be held,  most likely in the year ahead.    Such a government was made possible Wednesday when the National Assembly voted  unanimously to end the Communist Party's dominant role in the nation's  political life.    As the effort to form a new Cabinet went forward, a source close to Prime  Minister Ladislav Adamec said its exact composition and balance would be ""a  reflection of how far he dares to go.""    He said that Adamec sees his job as building a ""government of national  reconciliation"" capable of steering the nation through its present crisis to  free elections.    Adamec, who broke with the Communist Party hierarchy early last week by making  the first open contact with Civic Forum, was described as having a relatively  free hand in approaching non-Communists for his Cabinet. It was not clear how  much control he would have in selecting Communist members.    Civic Forum spokesman Jiri Dienstbier said opposition representatives met with  three senior Communist officials, including Politburo member Vasil Mohorita,  and with members of the small People's Party and Socialist Party.    Dienstbier reaffirmed Civic Forum's initial stand that it does not want to be  represented in the new Cabinet. Instead, he said, the group has established  itself as a veto agency, reserving the right to block the nomination of  individuals it considers unworthy.    ""We've said clearly that we'll monitor how the Cabinet is constituted for  people who have no political, moral or any other competence, rejecting those  directly responsible for the last 20 years,"" he said.    Civic Forum appeared to be consolidating its opposition role. It was given 1  1/2 hours of prime time on Prague Radio on Thursday and is expected to move  this weekend from its headquarters in the Magic Lantern Theater to offices made  available by the government.    Representatives of the opposition group met with a U.S. senatorial delegation  that arrived in Prague on Thursday and with senior Czechoslovak military  officials about alleged harassment of army officers and their families since  the collapse of the hard-line Communist regime.    Afterward, the group issued a statement calling on the public to refrain from  such behavior, Dienstbier said.    The Communist Party was attempting to adjust to its new role after Wednesday's  vote abolishing its monopoly on political power. At Prague Technical  University, reformist party members, who have formed a so-called Democratic  Forum within the party, met for the first time in large numbers.    In a crowded lecture theater, they talked of abolishing the party militia and  party units within the military. They appealed for volunteer help to get their  movement going.    They handed out a statement declaring that there is only one condition for  membership in their group: rejection of any kind of power monopoly.    Some analysts regard the Democratic Forum as an attempt by reformists to  capture the party and turn it into a West European-style social democratic  party.    At a news conference on the other side of Prague, the newly appointed spokesman  for the party Central Committee, Josef Hora, told reporters that the Communists  now are just one of several political parties.    There was considerable back-pedaling by some party members.

0,FT942-11106 ,"FT942-11106 _AN-EEIC5AFNFT 940506   FT  06 MAY 94 / Mitterrand rules out nuclear tests      By DAVID BUCHAN      PARIS   President Mitterrand forecast yesterday that France would never again set off test explosions of nuclear weapons, unless another major atomic power broke the test moratorium which the French leader set in train two years ago. Mr Mitterrand reaffirmed that he would not allow nuclear tests during his remaining year in the Elysee, and predicted that his successors would not dare resume testing for fear of 'offending the whole world by relaunching the nuclear arms race'. Delivering a 90-minute discourse on his nuclear policy to France's military establishment, Mr Mitterrand's statement was as much a challenge as prediction to Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister who sat poker-faced in front of him. Like most in the conservative government, Mr Leotard is committed to at least re-examining the nuclear test issue once the socialist president leaves office next May. Indeed the president challenged the French military establishment to have the 'talent and imagination' to keep France's atomic arsenal up to date by simulating tests in laboratories rather than by setting off more explosions in or under its Mururoa atoll in the south Pacific. The FFr10bn set aside for nuclear test simulation in the defence spending programme for 1995-2000 gave it sufficient resources, Mr Mitterrand claimed. Most French conservative defence experts believe that France still needs a few more live tests, if only to calibrate laser, radiographic, and computer techniques used in laboratory simulation. But the president claimed France need not fear 'any nasty surprise' by renouncing testing, and so setting an example to other near-nuclear countries in the renegotation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty next year. The US was the only nuclear power which could make gains relative to France, because Washington had been working on simulating tests since the early 1960s, and Franco-American relations were sufficiently good that France had nothing to fear from that quarter. However, Mr Mitterrand yesterday showed himself a traditional gaullist in every other aspect of nuclear power. A French president could not share the decision to use nuclear weapons 'with any foreign authority', he said, and that was why France had been right to leave Nato's integrated command in 1966 and to stay out. Eventually, Europe might be sufficiently united politically for France to consider its vital national interests synonymous with those of its European Union partners. But the pro-European president implied that day was still distant.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Delegates at the exploratory Somali peace talks in the Ethiopian capital said the 57-year-old general, who has been blocking agreement between 15 factions since Monday, had finally agreed to three out of a five point proposal. The points accepted include an immediate nationwide cease fire and the convening of a national political reconciliation conference either in Mogadishu or Addis Ababa in late April. Yet to be agreed are a list of participants to the conference and an agenda. The breakthrough came after US Marines, backed by M1-A1 tanks and Cobra helicopter gun ships, blasted two compounds housing gunmen loyal to Gen Aideed and captured an arsenal of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, battle wagons and heavy artillery pieces. Delegates said both the US military action in Mogadishu and an eleventh hour intervention by Mr Meles Zenawi, the Ethiopian President, had persuaded Gen Aideed that if he did not join the growing consensus at the exploratory peace conference he would be completely isolated. But they warned that Gen Aideed could easily reverse his position. 'He has agreed tonight because of the pressure he is under,' said Mr Mohamed Farrar Siad, a member of self styled interim President Ali Mahdi's delegation. 'But the problem remains that Aideed wants the presidency and everything decided here could affect that ambition. He could change his face tomorrow ..we are in dialogue with an abnormal person.' Yesterday's dawn assault in northwest Mogadishu, which saw a 20 minute exchange of fire, was the most biggest military strike by US forces since they landed in Somalia last month and marks a new 'get tough' approach to Somalia's armed factions. There were no figures available last night for the number of casualties on the Somali side, but one Marine was wounded. Hours before the last minute agreement delegates from other factions could hardly hide their joy at the way the general's wings had been clipped by US forces. 'Good,' said Mr Ali Mahdi, Somalia's self-styled interim president and Gen Aideed's arch rival. 'It's very nice.' The warlords and political leaders are expected to sign a commitment today to hold a reconciliation conference but it is possible agreement may take several more days.

Radiation  near the reactor building was no higher that the background of  the previous days and is lower than the maximum allowed by the  norms, said Juri Tikk, the Estonian Government's representative  at Paldiski. Also Estonian police who observed the site found  no signs of a possible nuclear accident, Tikk added.    ""I'm absolutely sure everything is all right at Paldiski,""  he  said.    Tikk said rumors had spread in the morning of a black cloud  forming above the reactor building. He said the rumor had been  taken so seriously in some places that people were ready to  start evacuation of schools and kindergartens.    ""I suppose the rumors may have arisen from earlier  suppositions by some Estonian officials that the taking out of  nuclear fuel from the reactors is going to start on Apr. 5,""  Tikk said.    Estonian authorities are now trying to find out who started  the rumors.    Also in Paldiski, rumors spread late last month about  Estonian authorities registering the residents in the town in  preparation of a massive deportation.     "
0,FT933-1176 ,"FT933-1176 _AN-DIXCIAH7FT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (46): Europe's lost jobs puzzle - Employment / Governments have begun to recognise the economic waste and threat to social stability posed by persistently high levels of unemployment      By EDWARD BALLS   THIS WILL be remembered as the year in which mass unemployment finally rose to the top of the policy agenda in most developed countries. Over the past two decades the underlying jobless total has been rising regardless of the ups and downs of the economic cycle. Every OECD region has seen a trend rise in unemployment rates since 1960. The OECD's latest economic forecast says that, by the end of 1994, the jobless total will have risen to 8.25m in the US and 1.7m in Japan - but 23m in Europe. But only now are governments beginning to recognise the economic waste and threat to social stability that persisting unemployment at these levels implies. At its the June ministerial meeting, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published the interim findings of its investigation into the causes of persistent joblessness in its member countries. The EC has also recognised the seriousness of Europe's unemployment problem, devoting much of the time at its June summit meeting to debating the twin challenges of reducing EC unemployment and reviving jobs growth. Not to be out done, the Clinton administration is organising a summit on world unemployment this autumn. But it is in Europe that the debate appears to have caught the popular and political imagination, not surprisingly perhaps, given the deepening recession that Europe's monetary policy deadlock has bequeathed. The OECD's latest economic forecast says that, by 1994, unemployment rates will have risen to 6.4 per cent in the US, 2.6 per cent in Japan but 12.1 per cent in the EC. Europe also appears to have a more serious medium-term unemployment problem. While the US unemployment rate did move upwards in the 1970s, it has remained throughout the 1980s at around two thirds of European levels. Only 6 per cent of North America's unemployed have been out of work for more than a year, compared with nearly 50 per cent of European job seekers. But it is in the area of employment growth that Europe's record appears most dismal. Since 1970, the US has succeeded in increasing the numbers in employment by 30m - three times as many as the Community. Less than 60 per cent of the EC working age population is currently in employment, compared with around 70 per cent in the US and over 75 per cent in Japan. This employment record touches a sore nerve for European governments. Euro-sclerosis - the belief, popular in the early 1980s, that excessive labour market regulation is undermining Europe's economic performance - is a live issue once more. The OECD, the European Commission and national governments are all now asking whether the low levels of employment, as well as high unemployment, in the EC are the result of the more regulated nature of the European jobs market. Perhaps there is truth in the argument that the combination of persistent unemployment and sluggish job creation in EC countries, relative to other developed countries, indicates a lack of flexibility and competitiveness. The US experience suggests that deregulation has unpleasant distributional side-effects, but the US economy has managed to create a large number of new jobs in the service sector over the past decade. Member countries, a Commission paper suggests, need policies which deliver a more employment-intensive pattern of economic growth. The paper suggests high non-wage labour costs in some continental European countries, employment taxes, inadequate training and rigid working patterns might explain this poor record. Yet, this analysis ignores an important fact: that employment growth in both the US and UK has co-existed with low and falling male employment in both Anglo-Saxon countries. On average over the period 1982-90, and thus excluding the effects of either British recession, 9.7 per cent of British workers were unemployed according to the OECD, higher than in both the US, France and Germany. Rising unemployment is only part of the story. Male labour force participation in the US and UK has dropped sharply over the past two decades as many have shifted from being unemployed to economically inactive. The sum of these two groups is the non-employed. On average in the 1980s, 12 per cent of US males aged 25-54, and 14.9 per cent of UK males in the same age group were out of work compared to 9.1 per cent in France. Neither the US nor UK have avoided the economic shift which has pushed many poorly educated men out of employment: the shift towards more sophisticated technology and the employment of fewer unskilled production workers. By the end of the 1980s, one in five workers in OECD countries was employed in manufacturing, compared with one in four in 1960. Between 1970 and 1987 the share of industrial employment in total employment fell by 7.3 percentage points in the US, by 8.4 points in France and by 14.9 points in the UK. The US and UK have been able substantially to increase total employment by encouraging the creation of relatively low-wage service sector jobs. But these jobs have been shunned by men and taken up mainly by female entrants to the market. The proportion of UK women of working age who have jobs rose by 6.7 percentage points across the 1980s, but male employment fell by 2.6 percentage points. The US and the UK have substantially more women of working age in employment than, for example, France and Germany - nearly 60 per cent on average in the 1980s, compared with less than 50 per cent. But neither the US nor the UK experience suggests that a deregulated, more flexible, labour market is a solution to the puzzle which continues to dog almost all developed country governments: why do so men not work anymore? Labour market deregulation may be the fastest route to higher female employment, albeit at lower wages. But it is not a solution to the OECD's unemployment problem.   Countries:-  XAZ  World.

Mr Shevardnadze, who has accused Russia of aiding separatists in Georgia's Black Sea region of Abkhazia, headed straight for talks with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk after flying in. 'This is the beginning of the construction of new relations between independent states,' he told reporters. 'There are of course high hopes.' The Georgian leader, a former Soviet foreign minister, set the tone for discussions in a weekend interview, saying Georgia and Ukraine had a joint interest in acting as a counterweight to an unnamed 'third force'. 'We were forced into this war. Separatism has taken root over several decades thanks to the special interests of a third force,' he said in an interview with Georgian television. 'I believe Ukraine understands full well this third force is interested in destabilising not only Georgia.' Georgia says the continued presence of Russian troops on its territory is hindering a settlement in Abkhazia, where hundreds have been killed in the past eight months. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine has been locked in disputes with Russia on issues ranging from ownership of the Black Sea fleet to the future of Ukraine's share of the Soviet nuclear arsenal and repayment of Soviet debt. Kiev, generally suspicious of its northern neighbour after three centuries of Moscow rule, has accused the Kremlin of high-handedness and intimidation in its dealings with Ukraine. Mr Shevardnadze and Mr Kravchuk are due to sign about 20 documents, including a treaty on friendship and co-operation, which the Georgian leader said could extend to 'mutual assistance'. 'I think this is indisputably the correct approach. Our national interests, our strategic interests coincide fully. We can in real terms speak about friendship and mutual assistance,' Mr Shevardnadze said. A senior adviser to Mr Kravchuk also said the visit could help combat undue outside influence on both countries. Mr Kravchuk yesterday sacked the head of the Kiev city administration, who has often been compared to Russian President Boris Yeltsin for his rebellious, populist campaigns against authority. Mr Kravchuk formally dismissed Mr Ivan Saliy for his refusal to move the administration out of its imposing headquarters to make way for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. The two men had clashed repeatedly on how the city of 2.5m was run.   Countries:-  GEZ  Georgia, East Europe.     UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.

But Europe is about to witness the end of the  ""Delors decade"" -- a period which has already acquired legendary  status within the Brussels institutions; a period which many  factors suggest is coming to an end too soon, and which is  referred to as some kind of ""golden age"" in the offices of  Europe's capital. This era has come to an end mainly because  today's Europe seems to reject the values of Jacques Delors.    [Papitto] Mr. President, you are about to leave a Europe  very  different from the one you found 10 years ago. A swing to the  right is occurring in almost every country, and a party that has  always declared itself to be heir to fascism, at least until a  few months ago, is joining the Italian Government. Is this a  good thing or a bad thing for Europe? Could it set an example  for other countries?    [Delors] The president of the European Commission must be  careful not to intervene in a Community member country's  internal affairs. For my part, I will judge the Italian  Government's action on the basis of what it does and without any  mental reservations. As far as I am concerned, it is only deeds  that count.    [Papitto] Mr. President, Italy's affairs are also Europe's  affairs. We could regard Italy as a portion of Europe.    [Delors] There are two disturbing factors in Europe today.  On the one hand, the vigor of our democracies is growing  weaker. The Europeans are drawing in on themselves, in a crazy  individualism that ignores the real situation, namely, that the  future of each one of us depends partly on the future of the  group to which we belong. And, on the other hand, there is the  return of false prophets -- and not only in the East.  Yugoslavia is the tragic expression of all this, with the  monstrous ideology of ethnic cleansing. Furthermore, we are  witnessing everywhere the advance of populism, the spread of an  attitude of rejection of others, of those who are different by  virtue of their religion, their ethnicity, or the color of their  skin. Irrespective of individual elections, this is the real  danger that threatens to poison our democracies.    [Papitto] How should we respond to this?    [Delors] It is more necessary than ever to return to the  fundamental values that led to the formation of the European  Community: respect for others, the awareness that in the world  of today and tomorrow none of our countries -- even the  strongest -- can defend its interests on its own and disseminate  its own values. We are at a crucial moment in Europe's  evolution, which is more vulnerable precisely because it is  stronger.    [Papitto] Mr. President, why is it stronger and more  vulnerable?    [Delors] A doctor too will tell you that a virus makes  swifter progress in a strong and healthy body than in an aged  body. As it progresses, Europe becomes more vulnerable because  it becomes more and more part of everyone's life. Then citizens  rightly begin to wonder about the nature of this Europe that is  influencing their lives. Until Maastricht Europe was something  to be taken for granted; not any more. And I do not say this  with regret. In fact it is a good thing, because the citizens'  involvement will be more aware.    [Papitto] Are the Euroskeptics among the false prophets who  are returning?    [Delors] Until a few years ago, our cooperation developed  within the context of the historical necessity of a Europe split  in two. Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall other problems  have arisen, and we must not be surprised if there are  hesitations with regard to their scale. The priority now is to  heed the countries of the East in order to understand their  demands, hopes, and expectations. I have visited them, and it  seems to me that their main concern is security. Some of them  have been received into the WEU [Western European Union] as  associate members; and we are working on the stability pact  proposed by France and taken up by the European Council.    [Papitto] Meanwhile the European Union [EU] is extending to  include four more countries -- Austria, Norway, Finland, and  Sweden -- while another two, Poland and Hungary, have officially  applied for membership. As of next year we will be 16, and  later 20 or 24. How will such a huge EU function?    [Delors] There are plans for a meeting in two years of an  intergovernmental conference that will broach these very issues.  It is obvious to everyone that a Europe of 20 or 24 members  cannot function with the existing institutions. But permit me  to say that this is a matter that the next Commission will  broach, insofar as it is its responsibility to do so, and I will  not be free to express myself as an ordinary citizen until next  1 January. I will do so, because my battle for Europe will  continue. But I do not own any television channels or  newspapers, nor do I lead any large political party. I will  continue thinking about and working for Europe; whether I will  be heeded, I do not know.    [Papitto] Will these issues be broached at the coming  European Council meeting in Corfu?    [Delors] The Corfu meeting will mainly discuss the economy  and how to improve cooperation within the context of the second  phase of Economic and Monetary Union that we are building. It  will also make up a balance of the first implementation phase of  the Maastricht Treaty which created the EU. There will also be  a discussion of the implementation of the White Paper on  competitiveness, growth, and employment approved by the European  Council in Brussels. Judging from what I was told by the Greek  presidency, there will not be much discussion of Europe's future.    [Papitto] What about unemployment?    [Delors] This was the subject of the European Council in  Brussels, which approved the White Paper whose implementation  will be discussed in Corfu. Its analysis of the situation can  be summed up in three points: 1. We are emerging from the most  serious recession since the thirties; 2. we are doing so without  any instances of overheating of the economy, partly because the  great European market and the policy of competitiveness have  proved to be important resources in combating inflation; 3.  despite the recovery of growth, unemployment will remain large  and Europe's chief problem. The White Paper already contains  some ideas and proposals, but we must develop them, move  forward. We cannot find solutions without considering such  fundamental issues as the role of work in tomorrow's society,  and the overall organization of society. At the European  Council in Essen in December, the Commission will submit some  new ideas for considerably reducing unemployment. We are  already working on this, and it will be my ""vacation homework.""    [Papitto] With ""Europe's chief problem"" so highly developed,  is it really possible to build Economic and Monetary Union?    [Delors] Our countries could resign themselves and exclude  7-8 percent of the population; or they will realize that  societies with strong exclusions are generally socially and  politically unstable. If the latter happens, the evil of  unemployment will be tackled vigorously. The voters will say:  A single currency is all very well, but what do you propose in  order to build a more homogeneous society that displays more  solidarity? This will be the main subject of political debate  before the end of the century.    [Papitto] What do you think you could say to the voters in  this election campaign, when almost everywhere national issues  are stifling European issues?    [Delors] This campaign takes place every five years and is a  valuable opportunity to take stock after the very busy years  that Europe has experienced. It is necessary to vote, not to  yield to the temptation to abstain, because through their votes  citizens express their interest in their own collective future.  Basically the choice is simple: There are those who want a  political Europe -- in which the member countries will agree to  exercise their sovereignty together whenever their interests are  shared, and which for this purpose provides itself with the  necessary capacity for decisionmaking and action -- and there  are those who advocate a soulless and spineless trading area.    [Papitto] What is the European Parliament's role?    [Delors] It has been crucial in boosting our cooperation. My  efforts to gain approval of the Single Act -- the first reform  of the Community -- would have been in vain without the support  of what was called the ""Spinelli report."" The Parliament that I  have known, during my 10 years as president of the Commission,  has played its part in strengthening European building. The  next one will have a more important role because it will have  greater powers, granted to us by the Maastricht Treaty, and  because in 1996 there will be the institutional reform that will  decide on Europe's future.    [Papitto] What is your greatest regret, looking back over  these years?    [Delors] Not to have been heeded when I said that Germany's  unification would place a heavy recessionary burden on everyone.  I did not stress this sufficiently, because I risked appearing  like the Frenchman hindering unification, whereas I was the  first to support it.    [Papitto] What is your overall assessment of the ""Delors  decade?""    [Delors] I think I am leaving a more compact European  Community, with almost irreversible bases. But in the meantime  the world has changed, and new challenges have therefore  emerged. They must be taken up. Even as a youngster, I did not  believe that a man could become God or Prometheus. I know that  often the obstacle lies at the end of the road, that failure  always lies in wait, and that it is necessary to start over  without a break. But this is mankind's adventure.     "
0,FT943-7340 ,"FT943-7340 _AN-EHXE7ABPFT 940824   FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan pressed on beer monopoly - Regulatory bureau must satisfy Gatt by dismantling its own role      By LAURA TYSON   Political reform has ended the one-party system in Taiwan, but the island remains a one-beer state, thanks to Taiwan Beer, which contributes much of the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year that goes to the government as a monopoly producer of alcohol and tobacco. However, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau is now under pressure to satisfy the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by ending its regulatory role and dismantling its monopoly. The one-beer policy is a legacy from the 50-year Japanese colonial administration which began in 1895. Monopolies were established to control trade in opium, camphor, salt, tobacco, spirits, matches and petroleum. When the then Nanjing-based Kuomintang government took control of the island in 1947, it commandeered all breweries, wineries and distilleries and continued the Japanese administration's monopoly. Imports are allowed, and on September 1, some 137 countries will be permitted to sell alcohol in Taiwan, compared with 122 at present. However, with Taiwan Beer made from rice, and thus quite different in flavour to western brews, traditional Asian alcoholic beverages made from sorghum and rice, as well as Japanese alcohol, remain banned. Japanese beer is sold in Taiwan, but only where it has been produced outside Japan. Under this regime, the market penetration of imported beer is little more than 5 per cent, with Taiwan Beer accounting for around 94.5 per cent of sales in 1993 on annual production of 465m litres. However, Taiwan Beer's market share has fallen, from 96 per cent a year earlier, while beer imports rose by 62 per cent in the year to June 30 1994. In fiscal 1994, the Monopoly Bureau's alcohol and cigarette sales raked in NTDollars 91.5bn (Pounds 2.2bn); while net profits have yet to be released, they are expected to amount to some NTDollars 60bn. The bureau's substantial earnings are divided between central and provincial government, with the former receiving 65 per cent and the latter 35 per cent. Taiwan Beer produces four types of beer, in three breweries: bottled lager, keg beer, canned beer and an unsuccessful dark beer marketed under the label Baodao ('treasured island'). A light beer was launched several years ago but discontinued due to poor sales. The company has also revived plans to produce a low-calorie beer to compete with the influx of foreign rivals. Taiwan Beer contains 4.5 per cent alcohol and 2 per cent sugar. The new brew is to have 2-2.5 per cent alcohol and 1.5 per cent sugar. But the promotion and advertising of alcohol is currently highly restricted. Advertising for foreign brands of beer is restricted to 120 magazine insertions per year per label. Importers of spirits are permitted to advertise in magazines for one year after the brand is first brought into Taiwan. Thereafter they may not advertise. Television, radio, billboard or any other type of advertising or promotion is banned. The monopoly bureau does not advertise Taiwan Beer or any other alcohol which it produces. Importers are lobbying to have these rules eased once Taiwan joins Gatt. Foreign beer makers are also hoping they will eventually be permitted to establish bottling factories in Taiwan, which would reduce production and freight costs. Other Taiwanese alcohol, such as the fiery sorghum liquor, Kao Liang, is likely to be less affected by implementation of Gatt, than beer, but there are import tax implications. Taiwan is already the biggest market in the world in sales of XO grade cognac in terms of absolute volume. Brandy imports soared 70 per cent in the year ended June 30 to 406,828 cases of 12, while whisky imports jumped 66 per cent to 542,029 cases. 'All western products are now extremely popular in Taiwan,' explains Mr King Lai, managing director of Saatchi  Saatchi Advertising's Taiwan office. 'Before martial law was lifted in 1987, people never saw these products because the market was closed. Now many Taiwanese are travelling overseas; they've become more international in outlook and they're wealthy.' But US alcohol is subject to far more lenient tax treatment than European alcoholic beverages, with the tax on cognac and armagnac running at NTDollars 1,000 per litre and on Scotch at NTDollars 440 per litre, compared with NTDollars 198 per litre on US and Canadian whiskies. These discrepancies will need to be eliminated. The government has yet to determine how a post-Gatt tax system will work, or when it will be implemented. New rules are expected to go into effect on January 1 next year. The Europeans are lobbying for a tax based on alcohol content and the US is pushing for an ad valorem system. But the Taiwanese may settle on a combination of both, while devising a system which retains a degree of protection for local products.   Countries:-  TWZ  Taiwan, Asia.

But what awaits the British exporter across the Channel? One answer is even longer delays before payment than they currently endure in the UK. This may surprise smaller British companies who believe they already wait an inordinate length of time at home and are lobbying the government for a statutory right to interest on overdue bills. But Italian companies, for example, settle their bills on average after 130 days - compared with payment terms in the UK of 60-90 days. French companies, Europe's second slowest payers, settle after 121 days, according to the Association of British Factors and Discounters. Both countries' payment records have deteriorated over the past year and even the Germans, usually considered among Europe's promptest payers, are making their suppliers wait longer. By contrast, UK companies paid their bills this year in 59 days compared with 62 days last year, says the ABFD. Exporters to Scandinavia, Switzerland and the Netherlands are most likely to be paid on time. According to the ABFD some continental European customers offer to pay on time only if their suppliers accept discounts. In Spain and Italy these discounts have reached as high as 20 per cent. There are, however, ways in which the exporters, usually the slowest to collect, can reduce the risk of late payment. Finding the right distributor is essential, although smaller companies with limited management resources inevitably find it difficult to discover who is likely to pay on time and who is not. One solution is to use a factoring service to help vet distributors' credit-worthiness and manage the sales ledger. Eighteen months ago late payment by Italian customers was hampering the rapid expansion of Micra Instruments, a small Luton-based manufacturer of surgical instruments which exports most of its production. The company turned to Alex Lawrie, a Lloyds Bank subsidiary, which immediately helped Micra to change some of its distributors and rapidly improved its cash flow. Alex Lawrie also formalised credit controls and introduced a discipline Micra previously lacked. 'We have learnt about the realistic establishment of credit limits,' says Peter Richardson, managing director. 'Anyone can ship product and not get paid for it.' Foreign customers are now allowed a tightly controlled amount of credit. 'You have to be ruthless. As much as this might hurt your business it is better not to supply than not to get paid.' Factors argue that their services are particularly useful to companies like Micra Instruments which are growing rapidly and need to increase cash flow. A factoring facility is 'dynamic' in that it allows a company to raise more cash as its sales ledger grows - it will typically be advanced up to 80 per cent of the value of its invoices, depending on their credit-worthiness. An overdraft limit, by contrast, will generally not grow as sales increase. Factoring does not have the best of names. It is still frequently seen as a service required only by banks' poorest credit risks. But Michael Hulme, managing director of Naturaldata, a Lancaster-based company which writes software to help companies control the cost of factoring, says it is particularly suited to exporters. 'Sales-based companies are often not very good at managing credit control,' Hulme says. 'Factoring companies help on the credit control side.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti doubted whether anything  more than a vague statement of principles would emerge from the  two-day session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE).    ""The subject is not completely ripe for a decision,"" Cotti  told reporters as foreign ministers and other representatives of  the CSCE states continued their deliberations.    ""There will not be an absolute consensus but a rather broad  accord in principle with strict conditions,"" he said.    Delegates here said the ministers were generally agreed on  the need to strenghten peacekeeping structures across a Europe  plagued by ethnic and national strife.    But Moscow's request for a mandate in the former Soviet  republics drew warnings of caution from several nations and  opposition from the Baltic states, where Russia still has troops.    They fear Russia could use peacekeeping operations as a  pretext for maintaining control over its former domain.    The Russians, who have deployed forces in such hotspots as  Georgia and Tajikistan, have sought authorisation from the CSCE  or United Nations to give them international legitimacy and  financing.    But officials here said questions remained on the system of  financing, the relationship of Russian troops to their  international supervisors and other issues.    A Swiss diplomat, who asked not to be named, said the CSCE  would ask a group of experts to study the matter and report back  in a few weeks. The aim is to reach a conclusion by a meeting  of CSCE senior officials in Prague in March.    ""I understand the fears of certain countries,"" Cotti said.  ""But it is in everybody's interest to see a country, above all a  large country, operating within the framework of international  law.""    The Swiss minister said another subject of hot debate here  was pressure on the Ukraine to dismantle the nuclear arsenal it  inherited from the defunct Soviet Union.    Sources said Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev asked  the CSCE to condemn the Ukraine for balking on disarmament and  unconditional ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction  Treaty [START I).    Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko reiterated here  Tuesday that his country was moving towards gradual elimination  of its stockpile but required security guarantees and financial  help.     "

The ESA will propose a diminished future for the Ecu4.4bn (Dollars 6.3bn) Hermes shuttle programme at a meeting of technology ministers of its 13 members in Spain next month, said Mr Jean-Marie Luton, the agency's director general. Mr Luton, speaking a day after a meeting of the ESA's governing council, said the agency would propose a slowdown in work on Hermes over the three years to 1995 and an Ecu231m reduction in its budget. He denied reports that the ESA was preparing to scrap Hermes. If accepted by ESA members, this will mark a reprieve for the shuttle, in which France is the leading partner, contributing 43.5 per cent of its budget. Germany successfully demanded at the last ESA ministerial, last November, that any decision on the continuation of Europe's manned space programme should be delayed for a year. France is a staunch supporter of Hermes, which it sees as the spearhead of Europe's hopes for autonomy in space, but Germany - the second biggest partner with 28 per cent of the budget - is keen to defray the costs by seeking international co-operation. Bonn has argued that Russia has technology to offer from its cash-strapped space programme. Both the two leading Hermes partners' government spending has come under pressure over the past year, from the costs of German unification and French budget austerity. Separately, he announced that the ESA would take part in the development of Russia's latest generation of space stations, the MIR-2, due to be put into orbit in 1996.

In  times of crisis the Union is seen to have let its peoples down,  notably by failing to act to stop the killing in Bosnia; at  other times it is cast as a secretive, self-inflating  bureaucracy bent on over-regulating the lives of its citizens  just to keep its staff in business. It is at once too powerful  and yet not powerful enough, a beast showing the strength of a  bear and the timidity of a door-mouse, and both on the wrong  occasions.    For many, Europe has temporarily lost its bearings. Recent  history helps explain why: the painful reunification of Europe  has collided with the deepest recession since the 1930s, leaving  the shining emblems of a bold and prosperous Europe in the 1980s  looking tarnished alongside the unemployment of the l990s. As  the Danes rejected Maastricht and the money-changers gambled on  France doing the same, it seemed the dominoes of Europe's  delicate consensus in favour of integration were falling one by  one.    Europe must rebuild the confidence shaken from it by recent  history to face the tough decisions that history has now thrust  upon it. The countries of Central and East Europe, fearful of  backsliding in Russia, are knocking ever louder at the Union's  door; the vexed question of monetary union is now resurfacing;  Bosnia has exposed the need for a shared foreign and security  policy but also the immense obstacles to achieving it; the  interdependence of the world economy is calling on Europe to  restore its industrial competitiveness, and seemingly  unstoppable growth in Asia is telling it to do so fast.    If the Union is to confront these issues with unity and  resolve, it needs to carry the people with it. This, above all,  means putting the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in law for  the first time in the Maastricht treaty -- to work.    Subsidiarity, properly practised, should defy the pro- and  anti-federalists alike, for it means striking a balance between  intervention and abstention, allowing decision-making to settle  at the most appropriate level. It is not a static principle but  one which should allow for the ebb and flow of responsibility  between regional, national and European authorities, according  to the need for Europeans to act alone or together at any moment.    If it is to stall excessive centralisation, the burden of  proof must fall on those arguing for decisions to be taken by  the Union itself, and the least restrictive instrument should be  used. All legislation should be screened accordingly, and no  powers should be set in stone -- indeed, there may be cases  where national governments have acquired the expertise to  perform the task hitherto allotted to the Union just as  adequately, and the reins could then be handed back to them.  Knowing when to stop will, therefore, be instrumental in  restoring the Union's credibility.    But equally, the true application of the principle of  subsidiarity means that, where acting together at European Union  level enables something more desirable to be achieved more  effectively, the Union should not hesitate to take the necessary  action. Europe's collective achievements -- the creation of a  unified market and effective single policies on competition and  trade, for example -- should have proved to its detractors by  now that team work at European level can enable each country to  score more highly for itself than it could have done alone,  however tiresome its team-mates may seem at times. Yet  widespread distrust persists. The Union's duty, therefore, is  not simply to accrue power when times are good and wash its  hands of those responsibilities when times are bad: it is to  assist governments in the search for the best level at which to  take each decision, and draw ordinary people into that process.    To do that, the democratic element in the European Union  must  be reinforced. With 12 national parliaments and one European  Parliament all empowered to scrutinise European laws, Europe has  considerable means of democratic expression, but much of that  potential is wasted. National parliaments seldom analyse  European laws with the degree of scrutiny those laws deserve.  They appear to exert little influence over their ministers when  the latter meet at Union level to adopt new laws. Often  national and European MPs are locked in opposition, one  suspecting the other of tugging policy too far towards, or away  from, the centre of Europe.    This need not be. For, if harnessed jointly to the  decision-making wheel, they would complement each other.  Through a Committee of Parliaments, national MPs could be  assigned specific powers alongside their counterparts in the  Strasbourg assembly, so reassuring voters that power over their  lives is not ebbing abroad to bodies they did not elect.    The Committee of Parliaments could ensure power was  exercised  at the right level and on the right legal grounds: it could  watch over subsidiarity, with the power to ask the European  Court of Justice to adjudicate if necessary; ensure laws have  the correct legal base (a common battleground among governments  fearing the Union may be growing by stealth); and check when  governments consider extending the Union,s authority.    Only if it realises its democratic potential can the Union  face the greatest challenge: the drive to maintain efficiency as  it takes in more countries. The Union,s decision-making  machinery, which has hardly changed since the Community began,  is already creaking under the weight of 12 countries. It will  creak more loudly with 16, and grind to a halt if Europe  enlarges thereafter. But to lock out Central and East European  countries on these grounds is inexcusable.    Instead the inter-governmental conference that is to be  held in 1996 should centre on the simple, but intractable  question: how should we change the way the European Union is run  to enable us to admit a substantial number of new countries  without the Union grinding to a halt? This involves looking at  how the Union's institutions work: the Commission and the  Parliament, as well as the Council of Ministers and a fresh look  at the voting questions which have caused such agonised debate.  But we would also have to widen our analysis if the countries  of East and Central Europe were to be absorbed into the Union in  due course.    The collapse of communism is forcing a more sharply focused  consideration of Union policy towards its Eastern neighbours.  The question is no longer one merely of foreign policy -- it is  central to the future of the Union itself. The loss of Soviet  markets made East Europeans look west for business but the  threat of Russian nationalism is sharpening their demand for  membership of the European fold, in economic, political and  security terms.    War in Europe, too, is forcing Nato to confront the need for  its European members to develop a more autonomous security  policy within the alliance, as Soviet might gives way to  smaller, less easily identifiable security threats closer home.  The old dichotomy between reinforcing the European pillar of  Nato and maintaining the transatlantic link is withering away as  the U.S. encourages Europe's autonomy within the Western  European Union [WEU] and France begins to shed its staunchly  independent view of defence. Developing a true European pole  within Nato, but one also capable of acting outside it under the  WEU, is now realistic and should be encouraged.    The European Union should also gradually lift its remaining  barriers to trade from the East, while urging East Europe to  adopt competition and other market rules similar to its own.  Yesterday those countries needed aid and advice on how to build  a market economy; today they also need investment and the  infrastructure and economic stability to attract it as painful  reforms take root. The West's role must also be made more  visible, to help prevent people turning their back on those  reforms. Ultimately it is economic prosperity that will weld the  continent together, leading to a joint political future in one  Union, each country in its own time.    Prosperity is also the most effective agent of integration  in  West Europe -- a lesson apparent from the lack of support for  European integration as the recession and unemployment bite.  The Union will sink or swim on its ability to restore the  competitiveness of its economy. Through its role as ""steward""  of Europe, the Union must establish order among a series of  often competing priorities -- for example, the protection of  Europe's rural communities while encouraging agriculture to  compete without excessive subsidies; or the creation of a social  safety net which does not stifle industry; or the need to close  the wealth gap by bringing poor countries up to richer ones, and  not vice versa. Any attempt to muddle through -- merely to  ""manage"" these issues rather than to introduce real reform where  necessary will not work. The reason is that one priority  thwarts all others: the need to compete on world markets.    Only a detailed and dispassionate analysis of Europe's  economic woes can find a common cure. This process has begun  with the Commission's white paper on Growth, Competitiveness and  Employment. It is clear the Union must pursue existing policies  with renewed vigour, for example by completing the single  market; loosening the grip that monopolies still hold over  Europe's transport, energy and communications networks, while  channelling private capital more smoothly into those networks;  and ensuring that we and our competitors abide by the stringent  new trade rules agreed in the Uruguay Round. We also need  improved research to turn good ideas into market-beating  exports; to encourage the growth of small companies and  entrepreneurship; to reduce state subsidies to ailing  enterprises; and to ensure more efficient spending of the Union  budget, not just by quashing fraud but also by shifting staff  more quickly to confront new challenges.    Of the cures, two of the most potent are also among the most  controversial. First Europe has to improve the versatility of  its workforce. This does not mean neglecting health and safety,  or hiring and firing for short-term gain; rather, it means  removing rigidities which discourage employers from creating  jobs, and correcting the mismatch between the skills people  learn and those they require for the posts available. The Union  itself can remove barriers to workers seeking jobs abroad;  provide ""marriage guidance"" for industries looking for the most  suitable training schemes in Europe; and help distill  conflicting national views on social policy into common  principles upon which European industry can rely, not through  coercion but through debate. This will help governments shift  their focus away from merely protecting old industries towards  propagating new ones.    Secondly, the European currency crisis has not destroyed the  Continental consensus in favour of a single currency, although  it has shifted the debate over how to achieve it and by when.  Far from exploiting their monetary freedom after the crisis,  most EU countries have followed fiscal and monetary policies  consistent with the approach laid down in Maastricht. In fact  they have not used the greater freedom given to them by the  wider band in the revised ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism]. It  might be however, that the best way of achieving EMU [European  Monetary Union] would be to seek agreement on a trans-Union  non-inflationary monetary target, and for each country to be  able to lower interest rates provided this would not risk  breaching that target. This might mean more rapid emergence  from recession and a pattern of exchange rates based on economic  fundamentals which could, in due course, provide the basis for a  single currency. That goal seems to me to be as valid and as  attainable as ever, even if by slightly different means.    It is ironic that people are most tempted to spurn the  European Union when their countries, need for it is greatest.  Grafting a split continent back together is no mean feat,  particularly when it forces radical change to the structure of  the European house and brings fresh competition to an economy  grappling with recession. The overarching aim must be to  achieve that unity while assuring Europe's place in an ever more  competitive world. It can only be done by a Union that is  democratic, transparent and restrained enough in its actions to  be confident and deserving of the public support it needs.     "

The visit will mark the most substantial economic and diplomatic overture towards South Africa from the Gulf since Pretoria began dismantling apartheid and crowns a series of initiatives, led by Bahrain, to attract South African investment into the region. A trade and investment accord was signed in Bahrain on Tuesday between Kanoo, one of the Gulf's biggest trade groups, and Omega Investments, a Cape Town-based business consultancy. Bahrain officials say the May 10 visit by representatives from the Bahrain Monetary Agency promises to develop such ties. 'We're flying the flag, and putting up markers for the future,' said one. Bahrain has no diplomatic relations with Pretoria, though ministers from both countries have engaged in a flurry of exchange visits in the past year. And while Gulf countries still technically maintain the internationally applied sanctions against South Africa, reforms in the republic have encouraged Bahrain, in particular, to ignore them. 'There is acquiescence to consider them no longer there,' said Mr Tareq Almoayed, Bahrain's information minister. The Bahrain delegation intends to examine South Africa's exchange controls and trade policy with particular attention to the banking sector, in the hope of tempting big South African banks to establish branches in Bahrain. The arrival of a batch of South African banks would be a considerable fillip to the island, which has seen its pre-eminence as the Middle East's banking sector eroded in recent years.

0,FT941-4932 ,"FT941-4932 _AN-ECICYACQFT 940309   FT  09 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Rivalries to the rescue in the search for lost creativity - Diversity      By GUY DE JONQUIERES   In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed - they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.' - Orson Welles in The Third Man. The historical detail is flawed. The Swiss have fought two civil wars since the 16th century and did not invent the cuckoo clock. But Welles' monologue, ad-libbed amid the ruins of 1940s Vienna, contains a poetic truth. Conflict is a powerful spur to creativity. And diversity is the mother of conflict. If Europe has a genius, a single defining characteristic, it is diversity. In no other region is such intense intellectual, cultural and linguistic variety packed into so small an area. Nowhere has the destiny of so many nations been more powerfully shaped by continuous rivalry between them. In some eyes, this is a debilitating heritage. It has, after all, exacted a cruel price over the centuries in recurrent wars. Now that national advantage is furthered more by economic than military means, it is fashionable to decry Europe's heterogeneous structure as a handicap in the face of the relative homogeneity of Japan and the US. Has not Japan's economic success been based heavily on management by consensus and a widely shared sense of national purpose? Has Hollywood not conquered the world because of the scale economies available from its large and integrated home market? Surely, logic requires European industry to respond by closing ranks and presenting a united front to the world? Such analyses, however, miss the point. At a time when technology and liberalisation are forcing open markets worldwide, the toughest corporate challenge is not to achieve global production scale, but to differentiate products and services and tailor them precisely to widely varying local demand. In theory, these trends should work in Europe's favour. First, because restricted home markets have long compelled ambitious producers to look beyond their own borders. For many, learning to adapt to unfamiliar conditions, and incorporating the lessons into their own operations, has been a prerequisite of expansion. Secondly, because many of Europe's enduring industrial successes have been built on intensive specialisation and continuous striving to create and enhance distinctive competitive capabilities. This is the story of German capital goods, Swiss precision engineering, Italian luxury products, French fashion and British pharmaceuticals. The point was well understood by the authors of the single market programme. Their intention was never to create a uniformly level playing field dominated by equally matched industrial monoliths. Rather, by unleashing fiercer cross-border competition, they aimed to promote specialisation by freeing resources to flow to where they were most efficiently employed. But the vision is still far from realisation. European countries continue to cling to the notion that sovereignty requires a presence in a broad swathe of industries, almost regardless of the cost. For all the talk of EU integration, governments obstinately defend the right of national steel producers to continue losing money and of sleepy telecommunications monopolies and flagship airlines to charge high prices for mediocre service. Nor is such nationalism limited to bigger countries. It was clearly at work in the decision last year by Swedish shareholders to torpedo the Renault-Volvo marriage and in the collapse of Alcazar, the planned merger of Austrian, Dutch, Swiss and Scandinavian airlines. The result is not simply diminished efficiency, but the duplication across Europe of largely undifferentiated structures in many industries. Instead of breeding healthy diversity and creativity, national rivalry has perversely produced sameness and common weaknesses. In these circumstances, preserving existing structures wholesale is not evidence of an ability to compete, but of a refusal to do so. The real test will be how effectively European economies enhance comparative advantage by abandoning poor performers and concentrating resources on those activities which they do best.

0,FT921-3159 ,"FT921-3159 _AN-CCPB5AC2FT 920316   FT  16 MAR 92 / Push to harmonise air traffic systems      By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent   TRANSPORT ministers from the 28 countries in the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) will meet in London tomorrow to step up efforts to improve Europe's fragmented and inadequate air traffic control structure. Airlines and civil aviation authorities have warned that Europe faces an air travel crisis in the next few years unless urgent action is taken to harmonise and integrate European air traffic control systems. Air traffic delays are estimated to cost European airlines Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn)-Dollars 5bn a year, and airlines say the current air traffic control system risks undermining Brussels' efforts to liberalise European air transport. The problem is highlighted in a report the transport ministers will consider. The report says the work needed to harmonise and improve air traffic control 'will be much greater' than first estimated. The biggest deficiency of the present network is that the different European air traffic control centres use computers from 18 different makers with 22 different operating systems and 33 different programming languages. Two years ago, the transport ministers launched a long-term initiative to enhance European air traffic control in response to the air travel crisis of summer 1988, when Europe's system could not cope with heavy holiday demand, with thousands of passengers stranded at airports. The problem was acute in the UK where delays have been exacerbated by air traffic congestion in continental Europe, as well as regular strikes by continental air traffic controllers. ECAC ministers will attempt to draw up concrete proposals to integrate the different European air traffic control systems. They are also expected to consider introducing new air routes and airspace structures, and new facilities with common procedures. Although last year's air travel slump caused by the recession and the Gulf conflict eased some of the immediate pressures facing European air traffic control, the recovery in traffic this year is expected to revive the problem. Figures for airline punctuality, released by the Association of European Airlines (AEA), which groups 22 European carriers, showed little improvement in delays last year despite the traffic slowdown. The AEA said 19 per cent of airline departures in Europe were delayed more than 15 minutes last year, only slightly better than the previous year. The AEA also said congestion continued to grow in Europe last year with 54,000 aircraft hours lost because of congestion. This was the equivalent to the annual workload of a fleet of 20 short-haul jets.

He is, of course, aware that  six reactors already stand idle on the territory of the former  Soviet Union, including:     -  reactor 1 at the Metsamor nuclear power plant, idle since  February 25, 1989, and reactor 2, idle since March 18, 1989;    -  reactor 1 at the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant, idle since  August 6, 1984, and reactor 2, idle since August 29, 1990;    -  reactors 1 and 2 at the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant, idle  since September 10, 1981, and September 10, 1989, respectively.    -  Sixteen other reactor systems, including research reactors as  well as critical and subcritical test reactors, are also being  shut down.       The development of nuclear energy worldwide is closely  regulated by the domestic nuclear policies of individual nations  and by international law. Russia, however, although it regulates  the design, start-up, and operation of its nuclear power plants,  has no guidelines for decommissioning them. In a number of  cases, this means delays in proceeding with the dismantling of  plants that are currently in safe storage.    Meanwhile, since 1979, the Commission of the European  Community has been assisting the international community in  coordinating its efforts to resolve problems associated with  decommissioning nuclear power plants. The commission establishes  and finances from its general fund five-year research programs  geared towards safety issues and protection from radiation  during nuclear facility decommissioning.    Between 1979 and 1993, the CEC sponsored three programs for  a  total of 93.8 million European currency units (in December 1993,  1 ECU equaled 1.11 dollars), and 126 program-related contracts  were drawn up.    Programs administered by the International Atomic Energy  Agency have established data bases on handling radioactive  wastes and safely transporting radioactive materials.    In Japan, the RAN-DEC (Research Association for Nuclear  Facility Decommissioning) was founded to study ways to safely  dismantle obsolete nuclear facilities.    In 1979, the Technical Information Center was established at  the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to  provide information on the dismantling and decontamination of  nuclear facilities.    And what is happening with the four idle reactors we now  have  in Russia? At the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant, work is  being done to complete the radiation survey of the equipment and  structures (the work is about 70% complete), to develop  experimental technologies for reprocessing radioactive wastes,  and to decontaminate and dismantle the equipment. Spent nuclear  fuel is completely removed and stored on site due to problems  associated with transporting the containers and with the Mayak  production association's (Chelyabinsk-65) refusal to take  delivery of the fuel.    The first and second reactors of the Beloyarsk nuclear power  plant, which are uranium-graphite RBMK-type reactors, were shut  down because their critical components had reached the end of  their rated service life and no longer complied with modern  safety standards, and because they are not slated for  reconditioning.    Beloyarsk-1 was shut down clear back in 1981. All of the  fuel  assemblies have been completely removed from the reactor. No  more than 180 kg of fuel (measured with the gamma method, or 130  kg if the neutron method is used) remains in the form of  ``spillage'' scattered throughout the reactor's pressure vessel  lining. The reactor power control, active ventilation, and  energy conservation systems are still running.    Beloyarsk-2 was shut down in September 1989. Removal of the  spent fuel assemblies is nearing completion. Emissions of  radionuclides into the unit's ventilation system are lower than  levels detectable by the original monitoring equipment.    The plant's spent-fuel pools hold 4990 spent fuel assemblies  in casks designed for ``dry'' storage. Because the seals of some  of the containers have lost their integrity, uranium sometimes  comes in direct contact with the cooling water, the  radioactivity of which has increased 1.6-fold over the last  three years. Technical safety requirements for storing spent  fuel and handling radioactive wastes are not being observed.    Unfortunately, Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy has pretty  much left reactor decommissioning up to local authorities,  resulting in missed objectives and unfinished work. Moreover,  inspections by federal agencies have turned up violations of  nuclear power safety practices and procedures, and, as a result,  further decommissioning work has been suspended at the Beloyarsk  nuclear plant until safe and proper working conditions are  restored.    Beginning sometime between the years 2000 and 2005, most of  the reactors at Russia's nuclear power plants will begin  decommissioning, to wit: reactors 1 and 2 at the Kola nuclear  power plant; reactors 3 and 4 at Novovoronezh; reactors 1-4 at  Bilibino; and reactors 1 and 2 at Leningrad. Regardless of the  reasons for decommissioning, it is an inevitable stage in the  service life of a nuclear power plant. Therefore, it is  necessary to formulate a comprehensive policy for  decommissioning nuclear power plants, and this can only be  accomplished with a great deal of theoretical and experimental  information. The current inability to understand this or move  this work forward will only cause additional problems for future  generations.      "

In its most recent meeting,  the European ISDN User Forum, which now boosts an average  attendance of some 300 participants -- mainly service providers,  at its six-monthly rendez-vous, announced TELCOs plans for  launching the special EURIE '93 week from 12-17 December.    The demonstrations, to run concurrently in all main European  cities, will come to a head on December 14 when, in a live  broadcast from Brussels, top European Union (former European  Community) executives and Belgacom chairman, Bessel Kok, will  discuss ISDN and map out its European future.    In another meeting, recently held at one of Europe's  best-known universities, ERASMUS in The Netherlands, we have  already tested for ourselves some of the promises of ISDN.    Live videoconferences and all forms of multimedia  transmission (what will come of Electronic Trade Data  Interchange?) are possible with a modest Apple and a 64 Kbits/s  channel. Two channels offer much better quality of course.  Cost? Not more than ECU5,000-6,000 (dollars approx.), computer  and telecamera included.    But this is only part of the Pandora's box that may be  opened  up by ISDN. Consider the opportunities for teleshopping,  telebanking, interactive television and other multimedia  wonders. British Telecom is likely to be allowed to send movies  to the homes of all who have a telephone. Analogue may offer  patchy quality, but ISDN, through the very substantial advances  made in the past two years in data compression technology, will  certainly be up to standard.    In the meantime, whilst Europe is struggling to find its  ISDN  identity, other developed regions are not waiting on the  sidelines. East Asia, Pacific countries and North America are  moving swiftly to be ahead of the game. Pacific Bell, one of  the large United States ""Bell"" companies, has just announced  plans, in line with the political motivation of Vice-President  Gore, for the creation of the ""super highways"" data  infrastructure, modernizing its California network with a fibre  cable investment of some ECU16 billion. Forecasts are for some  five million homes to be connected by the year 2000. To put  this in perspective, that is more than all houses in Belgium.    Europe is also doing what it can, although, if one takes the  recent announcement by Mr. Carpentier, Head of the powerful  Directorate General XIII (Telecommunications, Information Market  and Exploitations of Research), for a ECU90 million grant to  help ISDN developments, one begins to wonder what sort of  minimalistic policies Europe is beginning to implement. Sure,  this is money that will go towards sharpening interconnectivity  and convergence, but it is like spraying droplets of water on  dry soil. Hopefully this will only be an interim measure, until  the EU's Council of Ministers unblocks funding for some ECU13  billion for the next quadrennial plan for research and  development in the European Union.    Still, as this money must be shared amongst all sorts of  RD,  very little can be expected to be added to the ISDN pot.    It goes without saying that TELCOs prefer to address their  investments to their own markets and may consider European needs  as peripheral matters. Why release, for the common good,  research and development effort that may give other operators a  leading edge?    We must consequently accept with some reservations any claim  that ISDN is fully available across frontiers. TELCOs' driving  strategy may differ and so will the facilities that they  provide. Full integration will be delayed by other important  factors. Few European TELCOs aim to provide facilities wall to  wall, something that would make ISDN really take off. France,  the United Kingdom and a good part of united Germany may move  perceptibly ahead, but most of the others show more than  unwillingness to offer customers ISDN home-based facilities.    We, for one, resident in the capital of Europe, ten minutes  by car from the headquarters of the powerful Directorate XIII,  Telecommunications, will be unlikely to see the light of fibre  optics in our office this century, if ever. Imagine the destiny  of some of the more remote regions in this Europe of ours.    Then there is the problem of cooperation. We are all agreed  that telecommunications knows no bounds, yet it looks as if the  dismantling of those we have today may take sufficient time to  ensure that we all become economically handicapped in the  meantime. Size is the game of the next century: to have size,  one needs alliances. It may be a shame that Europe's three  giants (British, French and German TELCOs) did not manage to  decide on a common penetration policy and have now gone their  separate ways, forming two distinct blocks, one by the British  Telecom and MCI alliance and the other codenamed Project  Atlantic (French, German Telecoms and ATT).    It reminds us of efforts, in the late 1970s, to try to bring  Euro manufacturers, ICL, Siemens, BULL and Olivetti around the  discussion table to form a Euro-venture. See what has become of  them now.    Of course, there is always the spectre of Directorate  General  IV, the Competition Directorate of the European Commission, to  remind us that such alliances create almost monopolistic  situations. Let's wait and see.    Yes, we are believers of the opportunity market that may be  created by Euro-ISDN, but we know that this will only be  possible if it is given size, spread and funding to implement  killer, multimedia-based applications. In short, a joint  investment in hard Euro-cash rather than soft Euro-words at  Euro-ISDN festivities.

BASF of Germany, reporting a halving of profits for the first half of the year, said: 'We do not expect any cyclical recovery of business in the second half of 1993.' Bayer of Germany, reporting a 25 per cent profits fall for the same period, said: 'There is no prospect of an economic recovery in Europe.' BASF said that in Germany, it was unlikely the recession would bottom out before the middle of next year. Worldwide, said Dr Jurgen Strube, BASF chairman, 'we do not expect any cyclical recovery of business in the second half of 1993'. However, he said, there should be a slow upturn in the US. 'Following the United Kingdom, the economy in other western countries will also improve gradually in 1994,' he said. 'From 1994 onwards, slowly at first, we expect business to revive.' He warned of continuing job losses. 'We will continue to reduce employment by around 4 or 5 per cent a year in the group, and by more in Germany.' Productivity at the group's main German complex at Ludwigshafen had risen 13 per cent in the past three years. However, this had been largely eroded by the rise in the D-Mark. 'Increases in wage costs in Germany cannot be accepted,' said Dr Strube. On a day when the Bundesbank defied expectations by refusing to relax interest rates, Dr Strube defended German monetary policy. 'There is a need for additional financial discipline in Germany,' he said. 'Germany requires capital to invest in eastern Germany, and has to finance a growing burden of public debt. The Bundesbank has little room for manoeuvre.' Referring to the overcapacity of Europe's petrochemicals industry, Dr Strube said BASF had less need to reduce capacity than others. He defended the group's decision to build a large new ethylene cracker at Antwerp, saying its output would be largely used within BASF itself. He expected ethylene plants to be shut in Italy and the UK early next year. Details, Page 19   Companies:-  BASF.     Bayer.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT921-11441 ,"FT921-11441 _AN-CA4AUAD6FT 920131   FT  31 JAN 92 / Shaposhnikov gives pledge on missiles      By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent and REUTER      WASHINGTON   TACTICAL nuclear weapons have been withdrawn to Russia from all the other former Soviet republics except Ukraine and Belarus, Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, commander of the joint armed forces, said in London yesterday. The weapons, previously spread throughout the former Soviet Union, have been the principal source of concern about the possibility of nuclear arms getting into the wrong hands. About 11,500 tactical nuclear arms are believed to have been deployed with army, air defence and air force units, but Moscow promised last year to destroy a large part of the stockpile. Marshal Shaposhnikov, who was accompanying Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, told British officials that all the tactical weapons would be in Russian sites by July. Strategic nuclear weapons are due to be withdrawn from Ukraine by 1994 and from Belarus and Kazakhstan - the other two republics outside Russia where they are based - by 1998. Britain is to send specialists to Moscow to assess Russia's needs for technical assistance in dismantling its nuclear arms. The US will end or reduce operations at 83 more military installations in Europe and bring home 17,000 troops from those sites, mostly in Germany, the Defence Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. A Pentagon spokesman said the military was accelerating its reductions in Europe and now planned to withdraw 106,600 troops instead of 86,600 previously announced for the year ending on October 1. US troop strength in Europe had gone from 314,000 in September of 1990 to 227,000 and would be further reduced to 208,000 by the end of next September.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "
0,FT944-10599 ,"FT944-10599 _AN-EKJEJAAGFT 941110   FT  10 NOV 94 / European Interview: Kinnock revs up in lay-by - The European Union's next transport commissioner is eager to get motoring      By DAVID GARDNER and LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS   Mr Neil Kinnock is straining at the leash. Maybe it is the prospect of leaving behind British politics for lusher European pastures, but this week the former leader of the UK Labour party was in ebullient mood as he spoke about his new job as EU commissioner for transport. Commissioner Kinnock, who starts work in January, likes the transport portfolio. After all, ordinary European citizens can relate more readily to good, cheap, safe trans-frontier travel by air, road, rail or sea, than to the often opaque debate about the future of Europe. 'Transport is something tangible,' said Mr Kinnock in an interview, 'it can have an application literally at street level.' Over the next five years, he believes 'there is a real job for advocacy and advocates' of Europe. His warm, folksy manner will help make Europe more relevant; but ever conscious of his reputation back home as the 'Welsh windbag', he knows that 'going for the flamboyant phrase' will not be enough to win credibility. 'Before the headline term is used we need a strategy for its delivery,' he says soberly. 'Without that, this (Commission) will always look like a well appointed rest home for bureaucrats.' It is too early to pin down the new commissioner on specific policies. But he is clearly aware of the two toughest challenges in his in-tray: development of the trans-European networks (TENS), the multi-billion Ecu road, rail and other transport projects designed to link Europe's single market; and state aid cases, particularly among some of Europe's cosseted airlines, which threaten to distort that market. The TENS (like the Channel tunnel which he used to get to Brussels this week) are seen as job-creators in their own right, assuming up to Ecu400bn (Pounds 312bn) is spent over the next decade or so. But they are also the key to strengthening EU competitiveness and 'shrinking' the continent. Mr Kinnock reminds listeners that in the mid-19th century, 'single markets were created by a transport revolution' in Britain, France and Germany. 'The next 40 years will see us go through a similar process' at continental level, through a public and private partnership 'on a scale that has never been seen before'. While acknowledging the concerns of Europe's eco-lobby, he says the Greens must not be allowed to halt judiciously planned projects which will help save 'billions and billions on wasted time and fuel' on Europe's clogged highways. On state aid, the former Labour leaders seems surprisingly hawkish, even going as far as to hint that he may revisit the Commission's recent approval of FF20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in fresh state aid for Air France, the beleaguered national carrier. 'As far as I'm concerned (Air France) is an ongoing story. No decision could reasonably have been expected to be final, could it?' he says. The Air France aid is under challenge in the European Court from a British Airways-led coalition. It is only the largest sum in a torrent of government finance to national airlines which Brussels is allowing in exchange for 'last chance' restructuring plans. Mr Kinnock believes a fine judgment has to be made between subsidies which 'are appropriate for the maintenance of vital services, or where they are giving an unfair competitive advantage'. But he insists: 'Unfair advantage has got to be taken on.' Mr Kinnock is bound to be more like the UK's senior commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, than Mr Bruce Millan, the former Labour cabinet minister whom he is replacing. Sir Leon has repeatedly trumpeted his own and the Union's successes in competition and trade policy; by contrast, Mr Millan is almost allergic to publicity. Yet Mr Millan, a former secretary of state for Scotland, is widely credited with running a tight ship and making a success out of the EU's regional aid policy. Asked whether he will be at a disadvantage in Brussels, never having run a ministry in the UK, Mr Kinnock replies: 'I would say, modestly, yes.' But then, he smiles, 'there are not many government departments that equate to the Labour party'. So what are the main qualities a commissioner needs to do a good job? For a moment he hesitates, then reaches for Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Marxist thinker, who spoke of the need to combine 'optimism of the will, with pessimism of the intellect'. More practically, he admits that it also helps to be well connected with his Euro-Socialist confreres, who number 10 on the 21-strong Commission. Mr Kinnock is clearly delighted to be able to team up with his wife, Glenys, who preceded him into Europe and is already establishing a prominent voice as a newly elected European parliament member. He intends to make his views known across 'a fairly broad spectrum', from monetary union, through social policy, to EU expansion and reform - all issues that spark warfare among Britain's governing Conservatives. 'There will be occasions,' he says quietly, but he does not see himself primarily as a Brussels adjunct to the UK's tortured domestic debate on Europe.

But still some diseases had succeeded in finding their way across the channel, such as warble fly infestation and brucellosis in cattle, Mr Keith Meldrum, the government's chief veterinary officer told the agriculture select committee of MPs yesterday. The import of live cattle to the UK has increased six-fold since the single market came into effect at the beginning of last year. Half of these animals have their documentation checked at the farm and 10 per cent receive blood tests and other examinations. Mr Meldrum said the Ministry of Agriculture was adding 30 man years' worth of work to conduct on-farm checks of imported animals. Before the single market came into effect, officials checked all animals at their port of entry. 'There are not a large number of holes in the internal market arrangements. We are now identifying those holes and blocking them up,' he said. Mr Meldrum said the outbreak of brucellosis last November in Anglesey, which was largely blamed by farmers on the single market, might still have occurred under the previous arrangements. He estimated that outbreak had cost farmers and Maff between Pounds 400,000 and Pounds 500,000 to stamp out. Warble fly infestation was introduced last year from France after the UK had been free of the disease for two years. He said 1,500 herds of cattle had to receive the complex treatment for the infestation.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P0721 Crop Planting and Protecting.

The cabinet will discuss this subject on Wednesday [22 June],  and Chancellor Kohl will report on the cabinet's conclusions to  the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday. Next  Monday, Swedish Prime Minister Bildt will discuss Sweden's EU  admission with Kohl in Bonn. Next Wednesday, after the EU  Council meeting on the Greek island of Corfu, Foreign Minister  Kinkel will make a government statement to the Bundestag. On 5  July, the European Commission and German cabinet will hold a  joint meeting in Bonn.    Apart from the prime ministers and foreign ministers of the  12 EU member countries, the Corfu summit, taking place on Friday  and Saturday, will also be attended by the prime ministers of  Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, future members of the EU.  Government spokesman Vogel confirmed in Bonn on Monday that the  admission documents to the EU would be signed on Friday. The  partnership agreement upon between the EU and Russia is also  supposed to be signed in Corfu, provided that matters concerning  the translation of the documents have been settled by then. In  Bonn, it is expected that President Yeltsin will travel to  Corfu, but, says Vogel, Moscow has not yet confirmed this.  Vogel said that the EU countries hope to be able to notice an  economic improvement in the individual countries when making  their assessment of the general economic situation. They cannot  come to terms with the continuing structural difficulties there.  An ""interim report"" on efforts to safeguard Europe's  competitiveness and jobs, as set out in EU Commission President  Delors's white book, is to be presented in Corfu. Germany is in  favor of an integration of railroads, telecommunications, and  energy supply lines to form a ""trans-European network."" But,  said Vogel, a method of financing that does not threaten  stability is necessary for this. Competition with private  suppliers must also be kept intact.    Germany and Great Britain have agreed to present a joint  motion in Corfu aimed at simplifying the multiplicity of  regulations in the EU. That should serve to simplify  competition. After initial hesitation, the EU Commission seems  to have agreed to this motion, said Vogel. Germany will seek to  expand Europe's systems of training and education. A start  should finally be made on the reduction of bureaucracy, so that  small and medium-size enterprises are relieved of unnecessary  pressure in their work. Bonn views this as a condition for  Europe's industrial stability and for Japanese and U.S.  investment.    Germany wants to encourage an opening of the European market  to products from Central and East European countries, with the  exception of agricultural goods. These countries should be  given the impression that the EU welcomes them politically and  psychologically first as partners, and later as as members, said  Vogel. Germany wants the EU Commission to suggest regular  meetings of EU heads of government, also attended by the prime  ministers of East European and Baltic countries. France sees  Germany as a partner in its calls for greater support for the  frail countries in the southern Mediterranean. Kinkel and the  remaining EU foreign ministers want to include in the Corfu  summit a group of personal assistants to the prime ministers,  who will subsequently prepare a report to be considered at the  1996 government conference deciding on institutional reforms.  In Corfu and at the world economic meeting in Naples in July,  Kohl and Mitterrand want to reiterate their desire for  additional funds to safeguard nuclear power stations in the  East. Finally a resolution condemning xenophobia and racism  should be adopted in Corfu.    Vogel said no personnel decisions are likely to be made in  Corfu, but the government considers it an urgent matter to reach  a consensus concerning the next president of the EU Commission  and other Commission members, because the process of approving  the newly elected European Parliament will take time; the terms  of office of the new parliamentary members begin in January. It  would be good for Germany's EU presidency, beginning on 1 July,  if the relevant resolutions are passed in Corfu, said Vogel.  But there are no guarantees of that. It is possible that the  government will appoint a member of the Christian Democratic  Union and a representative of the Social Democratic Party of  Germany to succeed the two German EU Commission members  Bangemann (Free Democratic Party of Germany) and Schmidhuber  (Christian Social Union).

[Longuet] In the framework of the long conversation I had  with Mickey Kantor on 30 March, we agreed to put our ""foot in  the door."" However, the aim is not to force our partners to join  a system which, moreover, we have not yet defined. France and  the United States want the social dimension of international  trade to be taken into account. The aim is not to curb the  expansion of the developing countries or to call into question  competition with countries with low wages, but to ensure that  our partners share concerns -- and hence objectives -- of a  social nature.    Like democracy, freedom of information and human rights are  imperatives, and there must also be a degree of respect for the  worker. With a minimum and a limit. The minimum encompasses  the International Labor Organization [ILO] and matters relating  to enforced labor or child labor. I would readily describe it  as a ""humanitarian clause"" without which world trade would not  be morally acceptable. The limit is that there is no question  of imposing our system of social protection on others. However,  there must be some proportion, a relationship between the level  of development and the degree of social protection.    [LE FIGARO] Why talk of this social clause now?    [Longuet] The GATT issue is based on three major  considerations: solidarity among regional groupings (and we have  succeeded in securing recognition of the European identity);  respect for the environment; and the social clause. These are  the preconditions of fair trade. Indeed, the countries which do  not respect the international standards in the sphere of the  environment should not benefit from an unfair advantage.  Conversely, the protection of the environment must not be a  pretext for adopting protectionist measures. That is why we  were demanding the permanent establishment of a committee for  the environment. We secured it.    Conquest and Relocation    [Longuet continues] On the other hand, before 15 December,  we  did not want to call into question European solidarity by  demanding, at the time, a monetary or social clause. Today, the  United States is demanding the introduction of a social clause.  This is a chance to seize the opportunity and try to move the  European position in this direction. Here, too, our position is  gaining ground, as the compromise adopted in Geneva yesterday  shows.    With regard to the Third World countries, if we imposed  restrictions on them, they would have reason to refuse them.  But this is not the case: The social clause is the logical  complement of the commercial provisions of the GATT agreement:  The gradual dismantling of the AMF (Multifiber Agreement), the  reduction in customs duties and -- if China one day joins GATT  -- the dismantling of quota regulations.    Who will be affected by the social clause? The new  industrialized countries, of course, and the developed countries  which are considering relocation as an element of conquest.    [LE FIGARO] Is this not opening a new debate, while there  has already been some backtracking on the proposals made in  Geneva [as published] and a number of issues have not been  settled? Are the shortcomings of the GATT agreement not being  concealed?    [Longuet] Between 15 December and today, there has been some  backtracking on a small number of tariff offers.    But, generally speaking, the GATT agreement is and remains  positive: Customs duties will fall by 40 percent! That is a  wonderful prospect for world trade. In terms of sector  agreements, we knew that there were some difficult areas:  aeronautics and financial services, for instance. Even on  these two issues, negotiations are planned for after Marrakesh.    I think that making progress between 15 December 1993 and 15  April 1994 on social issues is much more important than sadly  noting that we have not received new offers of customs duty  reductions. Reaching a good agreement with the Americans on  social issues and aeronautics also strikes me as a good  investment. With regard to the AMF, I would like to be sure  that the lack of proposals to open textile markets by countries  with low wages -- Pakistan and India, for instance -- will be  well compensated for by a slower dismantling of tariffs  affecting those countries.    [LE FIGARO] To return to Marrakesh, do you think that all  the states present will sign?    [Longuet] Yes. I think that the significance of the event  must be gauged. The creation of the World Trade Organization  (WTO) marks a new era in relations among countries. After the  end of the Cold War and the military confrontation between the  blocs, the creation of the WTO bears witness to a period in  which the concerted development of human activity prevails over  ideological and territorial confrontations.    [LE FIGARO] Is there likely to be a problem of ratification  in some countries, especially in the United States?    [Longuet] I think that if Mickey Kantor, who succeeded in  securing a favorable vote in the U.S. Congress on NAFTA, is  demanding this social clause, it is because he has fully  realized that it was useful to have this clause to ensure  ratification of the GATT agreement.    [LE FIGARO] Is there not some inconsistency in welcoming the  GATT agreements, explaining that they are good for France, and  at the same time supporting the GATT entry of the new  industrialized countries (NIC), where wages are 10 or 20 times  lower? Will that not speed up the process of relocation?    [Longuet] In the sphere of development, the Asian NICs have  taken the easiest route: producing consumer goods in a  competitive way. They must now move on to the next stage: that  of infrastructure, which is costly, which requires technology  and capital, and in which we are very competitive. It will take  them 10 or 20 years to catch up.    Toward the Western Model    [Longuet continues] During this period, we will continue to  sell them capital goods. But experience shows that these  countries will have to face a fairly rapid increase in the cost  of labor in their countries. Their ability to mobilize a cheap  labor force is not unlimited, whereas the requirements of  consumption are vast. The wage increases in Hong Kong, Chenxing,  and Singapore are already considerable. We are therefore  engaged in a race in which these countries are both our clients  and our competitors. But they will be competitors less and less  as their production costs become comparable with ours, and  clients more and more as their purchasing power increases. The  implementation of rules on forgery and intellectual property  will now contribute to moving these countries toward the Western  model.    [LE FIGARO] The problem for us is the cost of the  transition, which is measured in particular in terms of  relocation.    [Longuet] When the French consumer benefits from an increase  in his purchasing power by the reduction in the price of  products, the French producer does not benefit from a reduction  in his production costs, in view of the cost of labor which  nobody reasonably envisages reducing. The scales are tipped in  the consumer's favor, to the producer's detriment. Should we  not now seek a better balance? This is what we are doing by  including some social security contributions in the budget.  This eases the pressure on the producer and shifts it to the  taxpayer, hence to the consumer, whose purchasing power will be  reduced. If the load is shifted to sectors which are not  exposed to world competition -- I am thinking, for example, of  the distribution of gasoline by hiring pump attendants -- you  penalize the consumer a little but you benefit employment. I  think that this is now a priority.    [LE FIGARO] For years, the participants have been trying to  introduce a monetary dimension to the GATT agreements. However,  the Americans do not want that. What is most important:  stabilizing the dollar or signing GATT agreements?    [Longuet] If we could do both, it would be perfect, but the  stabilization of the dollar is largely beyond our control. We  are participating in the organization of GATT and the creation  of the WTO, and the WTO will become a factor of stability in a  world which lacks it terribly. So, what is, basically, the best  way of stabilizing the dollar? It is a European currency, which  would make it possible to offer a refuge ""as good as the  dollar,"" as my friend Jacques Toubon would say.    [LE FIGARO] What is France's position on China joining GATT?    [Longuet] We are not hostile to it in theory. But, in view  of China's size and the problems involved, the conditions of  this membership really must be carefully defined. And China  must accept all the rules of the WTO.     "

The document agreed in Brussels yesterday calls for a radical rethink of EU strategy toward Asia, which it treats as a coherent economic region encompassing Japan, China, and East Asia. By the end of the century, the paper notes that 1bn Asians will have significant consumer spending power, with 400m having average disposable incomes at least as high as Europeans or Americans. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, drove home the increasing importance of Asia during last weekend's Group of Seven summit in Naples. By the year 2010, the G7's share of global output would fall from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, he predicted. The German presidency of the EU encouraged the Commission to produce a paper on Asia as a means of increasing awareness of the region's economic importance and making the Union more outward-looking. The paper lists several priorities for action: A wider political dialogue to extend the coverage of the UN conventional arms register and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty. Deeper co-operation on controls of sensitive technology, and 'strengthening the policy of encouraging the improvement of human rights'. Raising Europe's profile in Asia, through more education visits and training programmes, cultural exchange and twinning cities: 'The EU needs to make a far greater effort to explain its policies.' says. Strengthening Europe's economic presence, by lobbying more forcefully for the removal of laws restricting trade and investment, as well as the discriminatory use of intellectual property rights, standards and testing.

0,FT942-17106 ,"FT942-17106 _AN-EDGDVAAKFT 940407   FT  07 APR 94 / Hungary paves way for power sell-off      By NICHOLAS DENTON      BUDAPEST   Hungary's parliament yesterday voted through an act regulating the electricity industry and creating the conditions for eastern Europe's first wholesale power privatisation. The law breaks the national monopoly on electricity generation and distribution held by the electricity utility, MVM, allows for independent utilities and establishes the basis for a division along British lines between power generators and distributors. Crucially, the legislation, on which the UK merchant bank Schroders has advised the Hungarian government, establishes a legal framework for setting prices. This gives foreign investors the pricing stability they need to bid confidently in the privatisation tender due this summer. The electricity industry as a whole has a book value of Ft570bn (Pounds 3.76bn), the government claims. Its partial sale will be of roughly the same order of magnitude as Hungary's telecommunications privatisation. Last December, Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US paid Dollars 875m for 30 per cent of national telecoms operator, Matav, in eastern Europe's largest single privatisation. But the crucial determinant of the size of the transaction is the detailed pricing regulation of the electricity sector, which will flesh out the act passed yesterday and is due in the coming weeks. Tariffs may have to nearly double if the industry is to cover its forecast capital costs, and advisers hope that price rises can close the gap in 3-5 years. In preparation for the electricity sale, the government has split MVM into eight generating companies and six regional distributors. West European utilities may be permitted to acquire majority stakes in six regional distribution companies. The authorities also intend to allow complete foreign ownership in four generating companies which rely largely on coal-fired power plants and require modernisation. The state plans, however, to retain a stake of 25 per cent in three larger conventional power complexes and to keep full control of the Paks nuclear power station. Hungary has taken a liberal approach to foreign investment in the utilities because of the pressing need to develop infrastructure neglected under communist rule. The industry ministry estimates that the electricity sector must invest Ft220bn-Ft250bn by the year 2000 to replace outmoded capacity with more efficient, cleaner stations.

The agreement, signed in  Algiers between the Malian Government and the Tuareg Azaouad  movement, called for the dismantling of rebel military bases and  allowed for the integration of former Tuareg rebels into the  Malian Army and civil service. But the armed attacks, often  blamed on bandits, have continued, and now President Alpha  Konare has ordered a security crackdown as Mustapha Sana reports  in this telex from Bamako:    Speaking to representatives of political parties, trade  unions, and associations at a meeting at the presidential  palace, the head of state said he gave orders to restrict the  entry and circulation of weapons in the country. President  Konare said that measures will be taken with the cooperation of  neighboring countries to stem the traffic in arms across the  borders of Mali.    The president also spoke of the northern movement, (Ganda  Koi), which opposes the agreement with the Tuaregs, and which  recently made an appeal to Malians to fight the Tuaregs. He  said he understood the exasperation of the sedentary northern  population from which (Ganda Koi) draws its support but he  stressed that he refused any management of the peace accord on  an ethnic basis. Speaking of insecurity in the north, President  Konare said it was a difficult situation but not a desperate  one. He said he would not tolerate the continuation of that  state of affairs because it prevented the presence of the civil  service in northern Mali and has also impeded development  activities.     "

""The Echo"" program correspondent Kjell  Albin Abrahamson reports from Ukraine.    Abrahamson: Today Yeltsin is governing Russia, but  tomorrow Zhirinovskiy may come to power. Today President  Clinton is supporting Ukraine, but we know nothing about the  next U.S. President. This was said by Ukrainian General  (Oleksandr Rul), who will stand as a candidate of the  super-nationalist Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists in the  parliamentary elections. He now sees nationalism and nuclear  weapons as the best guarantee for an independent and sovereign  Ukraine.    Most political parties here share that view, including the  Republican Party -- an offshoot of the dissident movement -- and  the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, which want Ukraine to  retain some of its nearly 1,800 nuclear warheads. General (Rul)  points out: It is us, not you who are in the immediate  frontline in the event of a Russian attack.    START Provisions Discussed, Dependence on Nuclear Weapons  Denied   [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent Serhiy Zhurets:  ""Nuclear Weapons for Ukraine Are Like a Suitcase for a Drowning  Man--Both Too Heavy to Hold, and a Pity to Let Go""]    [Text] That which we have long been waiting for has come.  The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine has finally decided to define its  attitude toward the trilateral declaration of the presidents of  Ukraine, the United States and Russia. As official sources have  indicated more than once, this document proclaims the removal of  nuclear weapons from Ukraine and defines the mechanism for  compensation and security guarantees for our nation.    All of the nuclear warheads, according to the trilateral  declaration, will be removed from the territory of Ukraine to  Russia for their subsequent dismantling in the shortest possible  time. Russia will provide compensation in the form of  deliveries of fuel rods for the requirements of Ukrainian  nuclear power engineering.    Ukraine will provide for the destruction of all nuclear  weapons, including strategic offensive weapons, deployed on its  territory within seven years, and all of the SS-24 missiles will  be deactivated within ten months through the removal of their  nuclear charges.    Russia will in turn guarantee the technical servicing and  safe operation of the nuclear warheads. The United States will  provide technical and financial assistance for the reliable and  safe dismantling of the nuclear weapons.    Everything that is contained in the trilateral declaration  and the addendum to the declaration, from the point of view of  President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, conforms to the  requirements posed by the Supreme Soviet regarding ratification  of the START-1 treaty and satisfies the restrictions advanced by  the people's deputies. There were 13 such restrictions, and  they talked chiefly about the aforementioned security guarantees  and the granting of financial and technical assistance directed  toward the elimination of the nuclear arsenal.    Life has confirmed once again, however, that there are as  many ideas as there are people. And when we are talking about  politicians, then they could have even more.    There were meetings the day before the recent session of the  Supreme Soviet by the commissions on questions of defense and  national security, questions of legislation and legality,  foreign affairs and the working deputies' commission to study  the START-1 treaty. The aim of the session was to prepare  findings regarding the conformity of the trilateral declaration  signed on January 14 in Moscow. Since there was not a quorum at  the session, they did not come to any unified findings, but each  commission came to its own findings separately. Since it would  be out of place to cite those findings, we will address the  results of the working commission to study the START-1 treaty.    According to the statement by President of Ukraine Leonid  Kravchuk, the members of that commission indicate, he has  confirmed his ""commitment to the fact that Ukraine join the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NNPT] as a state not  possessing nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time."" The  Supreme Soviet, at the same time, had earlier considered Ukraine  to be the possessor of nuclear weapons, and only the realization  of START-1 ""would open up the way for the resolution by the  Supreme Soviet of Ukraine of the question of joining the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty.""    Another detail is connected with the fact that the  trilateral  declaration indicates that ""Ukraine will provide for the  destruction of all nuclear weapons, including strategic  offensive weapons, deployed on its territory,"" even though the  Supreme Soviet has stipulated the destruction of only 36 percent  of the missile delivery systems and 42 percent of the nuclear  warheads. Moreover, this presidential wording obligates Ukraine  to destroy not only all nuclear weapons within seven years, but  also all strategic offensive weapons along with their  infrastructure. After all, as was indicated on this score in a  memorandum of the U.S. embassy, ""any preservation of deployed  SS-24 ICBMs after the seven-year period of cutbacks under the  START treaty would be in contradiction to the obligations of  Ukraine, whether those missiles are fitted with nuclear or  conventional warheads,"" and the United States ""will not agree to  any weakening of this obligation."" This categorical American  attitude signifies that the prospects for the creation of  high-precision weaponry with conventional warheads based on the  SS-24 delivery system as a means of strategic deterrence are  quite uncertain.    The terms of compensation for tactical nuclear weapons,  financing for inspection activities, the possibility of using  launch silos for peaceful purposes, the use of weapons-grade  plutonium, and expenditures for the social support of officers  and warrant officers of the missile forces who will be  discharged from the army owing to the cutbacks all remain  uncertain in the trilateral declaration.    I am citing all of these contradictions in great detail in  order to give a better sense of the tension that was present in  the hall of the Supreme Soviet during the discussion of the  trilateral declaration, the ratification of the START-1 treaty  and the joining of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The  speeches by President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, Minister of  Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy  Radetskyy and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko  stressed once again the fact that nuclear weapons are no  guarantee of security for us, we are not able to maintain them,  and to go against the world opinion, even if you are correct, is  a hopeless matter. Nuclear weapons for Ukraine, in the current  economic difficulties, are almost a suitcase for a drowning man  -- too heavy to hold on to, but a shame to let go of.    The fate of the nuclear weapons stationed on the territory  of  Ukraine was resolved in two hours of discussion by the two  paragraphs of a Decree of the Supreme Soviet, namely:    1. Bearing in mind the specific steps taken by the President  and Government of Ukraine with regard to the fulfillment of the  provisions of the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of 18 November  1993 and the reciprocal steps on the part of the United States  and Russia, to remove the restrictions with regard to Article 5  of the Protocol to the START Treaty that was signed in Lisbon on  23 May 1993.    2. To authorize the Government of Ukraine to exchange  letters  on the ratification of the START-1 treaty and to make more  active the actions of the Government to reach a concrete  agreement that flows out of the restrictions of the Supreme  Soviet regarding the ratification of the START-1 Treaty.    What do the two paragraphs of this short decree mean?    First, that very difficult and painstaking work lies ahead.  At least five treaties or agreements will have to be reached,  which translate or at least should translate the declarative  substance of many provisions of the trilateral declaration into  the area of concrete, detailed and documented mutual  obligations. This pertains first and foremost to a schedule for  the dispatch of the first lot of nuclear warheads to Russia, an  agreement pertaining to the procedure and conditions for  monitoring their dismantling and salvaging on the part of  Ukraine, an agreement on compensation for the value of the  nuclear weapons transferred to Russia, and an agreement on  guarantor's and originator's oversight of the status of the  warheads that are still in Ukraine, including their transport to  ""S"" facilities and plant yards.    Second, that it is still too soon to put a period to the  resolution of the problem of the nuclear weapons stationed in  Ukraine, since a thing or two remains that is not entirely clear  or resolved. Although the removal of the restrictions pertaining  to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol also envisages Ukraine's  joining in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after all, the  deputies were still disinclined to the possibility during the  voting. Ukraine, under legal canons, does not have the slightest  right to demand compensation for strategic and tactical nuclear  weapons in joining the NNPT. The United States and Russia,  however, as indicated in the trilateral declaration, will  provide Kiev with security guarantees only in the event Ukraine  joins the NNPT. So the circle closes. And only time will tell  what the way out of this legal-political stalemate will be...     "

0,FT921-3951 ,"FT921-3951 _AN-CCLA2AAMFT 920312   FT  12 MAR 92 / Hopes high for big nuclear arms cuts      By ROBERT MAUTHNER      BRUSSELS   THE US and Russia yesterday expressed cautious optimism that they could reach agreement on further sweeping cuts in their nuclear arsenals in time for their next summit in June in Washington. After nearly five hours of talks on US-Russian bilateral problems with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, said they had not been able to reach a 'definitive agreement' on arms control. However, he hoped progress could be made at further meetings before the summit. It was important that the new era of partnership and co-operation between the US and Russia should be reflected in 'further significant movement' in the reduction of nuclear weapons. Hopes of progress in the new negotiations, launched by Mr Baker and Mr Kozyrev in Moscow three weeks ago, were raised by the Russian minister's statement on Tuesday that Moscow was ready to move towards the US position. Mr Kozyrev publicly indicated for the first time that Russia was prepared to negotiate a ban on land-based multiple independently-targeted warhead missiles (MIRVs), of which Russia has a far greater number than the US. But Mr Baker yesterday stressed that, while both sides wanted to move beyond the reductions already agreed on in last year's Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start), differences still remained over the timetable of the new cuts and the weapons to be covered. One of the main areas of disagreement is the number of warheads on submarine-launched missiles which the US would be allowed to retain. The US strategic arsenal concentrates on submarine-based missiles, while Russia relies on land-based ones. In January, President George Bush proposed the elimination of all land-based multiple warhead missiles. But his plan to reduce the overall ceiling for US warheads to 4,700 would still allow Washington to keep 2,300 warheads on submarine-based missiles. Russian President Boris Yeltsin subsequently suggested the number of warheads of each side be reduced to 2,500, which would entail a substantial reduction of Washington's submarine-launched missiles. Under Start the US has been allowed to keep 9,000 warheads and Russia 7,000. Iran, vying with Turkey for influence in the former Soviet Moslem republics, yesterday suggested a multinational observer force to monitor a truce between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign minister, who is trying to broker a ceasefire in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, said Azerbaijan had agreed to the idea.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

As of now 176 ICBM  launching pads are located in Ukraine, including 130 SS-19 and  46 SS-24 units. Overall Kiev has 1,300 ICBM warheads and 600  air-based cruise missile warheads. Having given a positive  assessment of the signing of the trilateral  Russian-Ukrainian-U.S. agreement on the abolition of Kiev's  nuclear potential, General Maslin stated that it is  impermissible to mark time on the evacuation and dismantling of  the nuclear missiles. The beginning of this process now depends  on the Ukrainian parliament, which is to ratify the trilateral  agreement. Should it not be approved by the Ukrainian  lawmakers, there may be unpredictable consequences. Nuclear  munition storages are over-filled, which has already led to  enhanced radiation backgrounds. The shelf life of most nuclear  missile components have run out; part of the charges are in a  near-emergency condition, while the level of emergency response  crews shows that in the event of an explosion or leakage they  will not be able to handle the consequences. ""There are  people,"" Maslin said, ""who do not understand this danger."" But  there are also others who appreciate the threat but do not wish  to help the abolition, either because they are playing the  nuclear card or are unwilling to part with their chairs in state  structures which they obtained after Ukraine assumed  jurisdiction over the nuclear weapons of the former USSR located  on its territory.

Five years after the  surge of Central and East European discontent that led to the  fall of the Berlin Wall, the ground is shifting under West  Europe's political leadership.    Four weeks after Italy's general election, and with the  countdown under way to polls in the Netherlands on May 3 and for  the European Parliament on June 9 and 12, the continent is in  the midst of a period of intense electioneering.    Coming political contests also include Germany's general  election in October and the presidential tussle in France in May  1995. By summer next year, most of the leaders who launched a  dynamic phase of European integration leading to agreement on  the Maastricht Treaty are likely to have left office.    The Maastricht summit in December 1991 represented a high  point both in enthusiasm for European Union [EU] and for the  careers of a remarkably long-lived set of European leaders. Of  the 13 main participants at Maastricht, 11 had been in office  (some for more than one spell) for six years or more. Since  then, their political fortunes, like the European economy, have  turned down. Five of the 13 have left office. At least three  more will go over the next year. Of the 24 European Union  finance and foreign ministers who signed the treaty in February  1992, only seven remain.    The new generation must manage a difficult transition.  Europe's challenges include:    1. Handling the slow recovery from recession, in one of the  most difficult periods for the European economy since the 1930s  depression;    2. Finding a common foreign and security policy to counter  instability in former Yugoslavia, the ex-Soviet Union and  northern Africa;    3. Holding the 1996 conference to renew the EU's structure  and preparing for enlargement to East Europe after the planned  1995 accession of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden;    4. Rediscovering currency stability following the exchange  rate mechanism's collapse in 1993 and doubts over the Maastricht  goal of economic and monetary union (Emu) by 1997-99;    5. And re-establishing fiscal control after a rise in  government borrowing to well above Maastricht Emu targets.    The Maastricht Treaty has become law, but it looks out of  kilter with public opinion. The latest opinion surveys in  Brussels show only 39 per cent of EU voters support the treaty,  with 22 per cent against it and 39 per cent undecided.    Most governments expect a large protest vote in the European  elections. The treaty gives the parliament greater powers. Yet  an increased number of anti-Maastricht MEPs [Members of the  European Parliament] is likely to enter the Strasbourg chamber.    ""The elections are taking place at the worst possible  juncture -- a time of malaise and disdain,"" says Mr Michael  Sturmer, director of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, a  German Government policy thinktank. ""All governments have  failed to explain to their populations why Europe is good for  them.""    Political and economic strains have undermined earlier  assumptions about European integration. No government at  present wants to press for initiatives ahead of the 1996  Maastricht review conference. This includes reconstructing the  ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism]. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of  the Danish national bank, and Europe's longest-serving central  bank chief, says last summer's break-up of the narrow-margin ERM  has led to a ""vacuum"" in Emu planning. ""This setback has  paralysed the political process.""    The changes in Italy, a traditional supporter of European  Union, are particularly striking. The new government to be  formed soon, probably under Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is likely to  be more inward-looking than administrations run by the  now-eclipsed Christian Democrats over the last 40 years.    Most EU members' policies are increasingly focused on  national interests. This is underlined by France's support for  its farmers during GATT negotiations, the row between Greece and  the EU over Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia], and Britain's attempt to maintain its EU voting  power after next year's enlargement.    Priorities seem to be switching in Germany and France, the  main partners behind European co-operation. Pointing to unrest  in the former Soviet Union and the Maghreb Mr Richard Portes,  director of the London-based Centre for Economic Policy  Research, says: ""Germany will be looking more to its interests  in the East, France to its interests in the south.    These are diverging perspectives.""    A crucial factor behind the Maastricht Treaty was the French  and German Governments' desire to reinforce the framework of  integration to tie reunited Germany to West Europe. Leading  figures in France and Germany admit that the plan to subsume the  D-Mark into a single European currency was based partly on the  perceived need to restrain German power. As exPresident Valery  Giscard d'Estaing recently put it, ""We need an organised Europe  to escape German domination.""    However, the German electorate's hostility to abandoning the  D-Mark has added to the difficulties of realising Emu.  Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he no longer wants ""the United  States of Europe"" -- a goal he formerly specifically endorsed.    According to Prof Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann head of Germany's  Allensbach opinion research institute, whose polls are  influential with Mr Kohl, ""There is a great determination in  Germany not to go towards a federal European state. People want  to keep national variations unchanged. Before Maastricht, this  was not an issue.""    Ms Noelle-Neumann's surveys show German opposition to Emu  has softened recently because many Germans believe its prospects  have receded. On the balance between deepening West European  integration and extending the EU eastwards, Ms Noelle-Neumann  says Germans have ""an unswerving wish"" to open Europe to the  East. ""This could create difficulties with France, Italy and  Spain.""    In France, business leaders recall Mr Edouard Balladur, the  prime minister, a possible successor to President Francois  Mitterrand, previously voiced strong doubts about Emu. ""Union or  not, we have to solve our own problems,"" says Mr Gerard Worms,  chairman of France's Suez financial conglomerate. ""What will  happen in 1997 or 1999 is not the most important question.""    One top French official says wistfully, ""If the Soviet Union  had not fallen, we could have had a triangular relationship  between West Germany, Britain and France.""    All hope for the Maastricht blueprint has not been lost.  Economic recovery will rekindle enthusiasm for West European  integration, just as it revived after the 1981-82 recession.  The Union is likely to find a more coherent policy to deal with  turbulence on its borders. Whatever the German population's  scepticism, the German Government will not want to escape its  treaty commitment to Emu. None the less, as Europe's political  landscape changes, none of these three forecasts can be assured.  As the 1980's leaders disappear from the stage, the objectives  they espoused, too, may start to fade from view.     "

In spite of weak economic conditions in most European countries, Alpine resorts have enjoyed lively business this season and ski equipment makers are seeing the beginning of a welcome recovery from a disastrous slump in the late 1980s. In sharp contrast to the past four winters, the Alps have been blessed with ideal weather conditions for skiing - several heavy snowfalls divided by long sunny spells. The winter olympics in France's Savoy region last month also gave a fillip to the sport. According to the Swiss Tourist Office, the number of bed-nights sold in January was up 5 per cent to 2.6m, with most of the growth attributable to skiers. Visitors from Germany were up 11 per cent, those from Italy up 19 per cent and those from the UK up 16 per cent over last year's levels which were depressed by the Gulf crisis. Worldwide sales of ski equipment look set to grow roughly five per cent, heavily concentrated in Europe. Producers say the Japanese market has calmed down after several strong seasons while the North American market is slumping because of recession and a lack of snow. Salomon, the French equipment maker, is forecasting sales of 5.8m pairs of skis worldwide in the year to March 31, 1992, up 5 per cent from the trough of 5.5m reached in 1990-91, but still well below the 1988-89 peak of 7m pairs. This will be enough to enable the company to make a small profit for the first time in three years. For another French company, Skis Rossignol, the world market leader in skis, a return to profit is not expected until next year, but the group's loss in the year to March 31, 1992 is likely to be only FFr40m, sharply down from FFr140m in the previous year.

Russia's retired and reserve military  personnel living in Estonia should organize into units to defend  their honor and dignity, thinks Pyotr Rozhok, representative of  Russia's Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia.    ""If some Estonian official should try to send out a Russian  officer, he better look out for himself. Should there be a  police check or some other inspection by some kind of officials,  they should just be removed by force, and that's that,"" said  Pyotr Rozhok, in his interview with SILLAMYAESKI VESTNIK  [Russian language local newspaper in Estonia].    Rozhok thinks that Estonia is `an ancient Russian region'.    ""Nobody has nullified the Nystad peace treaty or the 1975  Helsinki accord. This is why retired and reserve members of the  Russian military living here should know that they live in  ancient Russian territory,"" asserts Zhirinovskiy's  representative in Estonia.    Rozhok also thinks that all Russians living in Estonia  should  take out Russian citizenship `so as to benefit from the  protection and support of great Russia'.    Rozhok says that he convinced Zhirinovski not to toss around  such expressions as `let's bring in the tanks', but to threaten  Estonia only with economic sanctions.    Commenting on the statement that, should economic sanctions  be applied, the first to be hit would be the Russian industrial  workers, Rozhok replied: ""Russians have nothing left to lose,  anyhow.""    Referring to organizations for Estonia's Russian-speaking  population, Rozhok spoke highly of the activities of Yuri  Mishin, leader of the Narva Russian Citizens' League. The  Representative Assembly, however, was termed by him as the  'academy for dismantling all Russian movements, parties and  organizations, under the baton of Estonia's government.'     "
0,FT942-994 ,"FT942-994 _AN-EF0DGABJFT 940627   FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Different keys to Eurovision theme songs - Peter Martin on national views      By PETER MARTIN   What are the corporate qualities that Europe's business leaders most admire? The Financial Times/Price Waterhouse survey asked top managers to name the competitors they most respected on seven factors of business performance, and to list the qualities that contributed to this excellence. Their responses give a unique snapshot of the qualities important to business success in the 1990s. Each category has its own surprises. Companies best show they are focused upon their customers for example, by demonstrating that their customers are loyal. At least, that is so for British managers. Their response is enough to take customer loyalty to the top of the ranking on this issue, overall and in those industry sectors in which British companies are strongly represented. But managers from other countries placed less emphasis on customer loyalty: only in Sweden was the British view shared. Germany and Switzerland plumped for customer service, which was the top-ranked quality in nearly half the industry sectors; France and the Netherlands went for good communications with customers. Managers in Italy put good use of technology at the top of their list of qualities, a view shared by the electricity, media, oil and gas industries. There was less national polarisation on the second category: people. In France and the Netherlands, satisfied, loyal staff was most important; in Britain and Italy, this lagged behind giving people the means and facilities to deliver results. In Germany training was the most important people factor, a view shared by many industry sectors. But all respondents believed that progressive childcare policies and demonstrating 'real' equal opportunities mattered least. The answers in the third category, which asked for the company with the best products and services, produced one very surprising result. In almost every country, investing heavily in RD was seen as making little contribution to product excellence; quality also made little impact. The most important issue, in most countries, was meeting real market needs. In Britain, perhaps reflecting industry's traditionally concentrated structure, market leadership was seen as most important. This view was also shared in industries in which volume is critical (such as food processing and commercial banking). Despite the negative attitude to RD, technology was not ignored: making innovative use of technology was seen as the most important product issue in Germany and Switzerland, and it also scored well in Italy. Unanimity reigned on the factors contributing to outstanding business performance. In almost every country and industry sector, consistent growth and long-term profitability was the best definition of performance. More unexpected, was the general view that being a low-cost producer was not a particularly important contributor to outstanding business performance. Among industrial sectors, only cars and beverages put low costs as a high contributory factor to business performance. Perhaps Europe's top companies are more vulnerable to low-cost competition than they realise. There was also clear agreement on qualities that make the most important contribution to leadership: displaying a positive management style. Germany and the Netherlands, perhaps reflecting the way business works in these two countries, gave equal weight to communicating the company's aims and making sure they were shared by everyone from the top down. Taking a strong position on social issues came bottom, almost everywhere. What is the most important element in giving a company an effective strategy? As in the leadership category, clear policy and objectives came top in almost every country and industry; responding to the market needs of the 1990s came next. There was much emphasis on seizing opportunities in the emerging European market. But, perhaps worryingly, the rest of the world seemed less important. Only British managers seemed to care about doing business on several continents, though a handful of industries across national boundaries from insurance to engineering shared the view. Only in Italy (and in the oil and gas sector) were managers expected to have knowledge of international markets. There was little enthusiasm for the seventh category, in which managers were asked to nominate the company which cared most about the environment. However, a clear trend was evident: managers think of good environmental behaviour primarily in terms of production processes, not packaging or product design. Thus, investing in pollution control measures came top in most countries, while reflecting environmental policy in products, packaging and the like came bottom.

The single market is open for business, just as the European economy slows down. Far from heralding renewed economic dynamism, January 1993 coincides with rising unemployment, currency turbulence and popular dissatisfaction. The European Community witnesses not a new burst of confidence and creativity, but a return to the gloom that occasioned the single market programme. The OECD's latest Economic Outlook gives the growth of Europe's real gross domestic product at 1 per cent between 1991 and 1992 and forecasts it at 1.2 per cent between 1992 and 1993. By contrast, the Outlook published last June forecast growth of 2.4 per cent between 1992 and 1993. This halving of the forecast for the coming year is consistent with the past over-optimism of the mainstream forecasters. The economic growth of 2.5 per cent forecast by the OECD for 1993 to 1994 could prove to be yet another overestimate. The European economy would then experience four successive years of disappointing growth. Economic performance of the main European economies has been far from uniform. Worst by far has been that of the UK. After falling by 2.2 per cent between 1990 and 1991 and by 1 per cent between 1991 and 1992, GDP is forecast by the OECD to rise by 1.3 per cent between 1992 and 1993. Yet even the expected growth of 2.4 per cent between 1993 and 1994 would only bring GDP back to its 1990 level. By contrast, Italy is at least expected to sustain positive growth, though at low rates, throughout. Between 1990 and 1991 growth was 1.4 per cent. This is expected to be followed by 1.2 per cent growth from 1991 to 1992 and 0.8 per cent from 1992 to 1993. In spite of Italy's fiscal crisis, the most severe among the group of seven leading industrial countries, its economic performance has not been much worse than that of France, even though French rigueur has made it the EC's blue-eyed boy. Between 1990 and 1991 French GDP expanded by 1.2 per cent. The OECD says it will expand by 1.9 per cent between 1991 and 1992 and forecasts only 1.6 per cent growth in the following year. Europe's disappointing economic performance is partly explained by an adverse world economic environment, particularly the lingering recession, from which the US seems at last to be recovering. It is also explained by problems within particular countries, notably the UK, with its overhang of private sector debt, and Italy, where public debt exceeds total GDP. But the principal failure lies in Germany, Europe's economic and geographical heart. After four years of rapid economic growth, capped by the positive economic effects of unification in 1990 and 1991, German GDP continued to expand by 2.9 per cent in the first half of 1992, but only to contract by 0.9 per cent in the second half. The OECD has forecast 1.2 per cent growth of GDP between 1992 and 1993, but the organisation's chief economist has already lowered this forecast by half a percentage point. Surprisingly perhaps, a German recession need not be bad news for the rest of Europe. The German economy has slowed in response to the Bundesbank's determination to bring inflation down from the 4.5 per cent registered in 1991 (measured by the deflator for total GDP) and expected by the OECD for 1992, to the 2 per cent it thinks is tolerable. German short term rates of interest have been exceptionally high in both nominal and real terms. But the belief that the D-Mark would never be depreciated within the exchange rate mechanism turns these German interest rates into the floor for all ERM members. Those interest rates have then deflated the economies of the rest of Europe. French short term real interest rates are 7-8 per cent, for example. The contractionary effect of these rates has endured far longer and been far stronger than the stimulus generated by the disappearance of the German current account surplus between 1990 and 1991. Europe needs lower short term rates of interest. Though a deep recession is bound to damage Germany politically and economically, it should lead to lower German interest rates and so give members of the ERM the lower interest rates they need. By now, this group excludes the UK and Italy, both shaken out of the ERM in mid-September. Apart from the suspension of the pound and the lira, the Spanish peseta has been realigned twice and the Portuguese escudo once, while the Irish punt, the Danish krone and the French franc have all been subject to considerable pressure. The collapse of Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian attempts at fixing their exchange rates attests to the general disarray. Should the process of dissolution proceed still further, the Maastricht treaty's planned march towards economic and monetary union by 1997, or 1999, will lose all plausibility. In any case, the convergence criteria laid down in that treaty, largely at German behest, will create severe difficulties. At present only two countries - France and Luxembourg - fulfil all these criteria, though Denmark (which has opted out from Emu) and Germany (the majority of whose citizens would like to opt out) almost make the grade. The European slow-down has helped to bring about convergence of inflation: eight EC member states had consumer price inflation of between 2.2 and 4.1 per cent in 1992, with German inflation highest of this group. But slow growth makes it much more difficult to meet the Maastricht criteria for fiscal policy. The IMF and the OECD argue that most member states cannot afford and should not attempt further fiscal stimulus. This may well be so, but slow growth will make reducing fiscal deficits difficult, while the immediate consequences are bound to be deflationary. Gloom is the natural reaction to Europe's current economic situation. The single market is not having the positive effect on Europe's economic performance that was hoped. The monetary system is under attack. Meanwhile, policy-makers seem totally ineffective. The growth package agreed at the Edinburgh summit was nugatory, for example. As for the Bundesbank, it remains obstinately set on its deflationary course. Yet, there is more to the prospects for the European economy than the current slow down. The important questions are those about the long term. Here there are important worries, but there are also opportunities. Among the worries are whether Germany will manage to integrate the east German economy or will be struggling semi-permanently with high overall unemployment and high public sector deficits; whether the eastern European economies will achieve rapid economic growth; whether the world economy will recover its lost dynamism; and whether, in particular, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations will be successfully completed. These worries are the counterparts of economic opportunity. German unification should enable the EC's most important economy to achieve faster growth than in the 1970s and 1980s; eastern European reform could revitalise the European economy as a whole; and a dynamic and truly global economy can be created for the very first time. Since the EC is the world's largest trading entity and one of its two largest economies, accounting for more than a quarter of world output, it is itself able to turn its worries into opportunities.

Mr Paolo Savona, Italy's minister, rejected a Commission compromise on subsidies and capacity cuts at Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker. Senior commissioners and the Belgian presidency of the EU warned that the impasse would be highly damaging not only for Europe's ailing industry, but for the new Union itself. Italian opposition to a 2m tonne capacity cut at Ilva now seems likely to be discussed, at least informally, at the EU summit in Brussels on December 10. Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, called it a 'black day' for the EU, and Mr Melchior Wathelet, Belgium's industry minister, who chaired the meeting, said the outcome did not bode well for the relationship between the Union's institutions. Mr Wathelet said he would only call a follow-up meeting of ministers, on December 17, if there was a chance of a deal. The British industry, however, which has already cut jobs and capacity severely, welcomed the fact that ministers had resisted agreeing other restructuring plans which Britain believes insufficiently strict. The Commission had asked ministers to give their political blessing to Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies to six companies - in east Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal - in exchange for 5.5m tonnes of capacity cuts. Final agreement on subsidies must be unanimous. There was friction between Germany and Britain over UK opposition to a new hot rolling mill at Ekostahl, east German steel producer, 60 per cent of which is being offered for sale to Riva, a private Italian company. The Treuhand, the privatisation agency handling the Ekostahl sale, will today set a deadline of Tuesday for Riva to answer 'crucial questions' about the new mill before the sale can be concluded. British Steel welcomed the tough line taken by Mr Tim Sainsbury, the UK minister, saying that by allowing subsidised new capacity at Ekostahl, Brussels had not grasped the nettle. Mr Sainsbury had told fellow ministers 'no agreement would be better than a bad agreement' on subsidies. Denmark, Luxembourg and France are understood to have some objections to the east German and Spanish plans.   Companies:-  Ilva.     Ekostahl.   Countries:-  BEZ  Belgium, EC.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

But critics  speak of window dressing. As a researcher who was involved in  JESSI, how do you see it?    [Kurz] It is more than window dressing, but we must take  into  consideration that it was not the federal minister who landed us  in JESSI. JESSI is, so to speak, an old boys' network, and a  minister who is a layman is taken in by the window dressing.  The fact is, there is a vast discrepancy between the claims and  the results. None of JESSI's big ""flag ships"" has got off the  ground. On the contrary, the fleet has almost sunk already.    [Rubner] Can you tell us what the project's most important  flag ships were?    [Kurz] Apart from the clusters, the joint projects in  manufacturing technology, which were also not particularly  successful, there are five applications flag ships. These are:  high resolution television, digital broadcasting, broadband  communications, mobile radio, and safety electronics for  automobiles. The high resolution television project has just  gone under, mobile radio is firmly in the hands of firms that  were not sponsored by JESSI. The problem is that there were  several changes of strategy. Industry regarded JESSI as a  sponsorship program for itself in which firms need not have  clear objectives.    [Rubner] Yet the European semiconductor industry still has  only a small share of the world market. Surely more must have  gone wrong than just a change of strategy?    [Kurz] The failings go back 15 or 20 years. The five-year  program running until 1996 has at best delayed Europe's  withdrawal from the world market. Initially, JESSI was not  intended to be a program for capturing the market, but to create  the technological basis for the microelectronics industry. Only  later were substantial parts of a basic program abandoned to  press ahead with applications.    [Rubner] Applications are not necessarily bad. Where did  JESSI go wrong?    [Kurz] If firms are always looking out of the corner of  their eye for more competent partners outside of JESSI, there is  bound to be failure in applications.    [Rubner] With 150 firms involved, does that not entail an  enormous amount of bureaucracy?    [Kurz] Here we have Europe's old complaint again. The money  that was spent on administration could have been put into basic  research or given directly to competent firms without them  having to find a pseudo-common objective. But all European  projects have this problem.    [Rubner] Among others, a European CAD [computer-aided  design] software program is cited as a successful JESSI project.  Why was it worth spending millions on it?    [Kurz] I don't understand it at all. But JESSI sets great  store by the project partners talking to each other. It would  of course have been more honest if JESSI had been called a  political integration program from the start.    [Rubner] Have there been technically good results?    [Kurz] Yes, isolated ones in the areas of the clusters I  mentioned. But the question remains whether the progress was  not rather the result of ideas from the USA or Japan, or from  JESSI. By the way, one particular misjudgment was X-ray  lithography.    [Rubner] But most experts didn't expect it would be possible  to make the 64 megabit chip without X-ray lithography.    [Kurz] That isn't the case. There are a lot of predictions  about how far optical lithography will go. They were still  talking about X-ray lithography in JESSI when the Japanese were  already announcing the 64-megabit chip with optical processes.    [Rubner] JESSI runs out in 1996. What ought to come then?    [Kurz] Certainly not a repetition. We already know how  JESSI will end. The people with political responsibility should  already be setting up an independent commission of enquiry so  that competent experts can talk about the next stage. The most  important questions are: What is a long-term research strategy?  What is the correct form of involvement for the universities,  Fraunhofer Institutes and others? We need new methods to better  develop Europe's existing potential. There should at all events  be greater [financial] support for basic research, particularly  in the direction of automatic mini labs, that is small factories  in which special chips, Asics [application-specific integrated  circuits] for short, are made. Funding should be awarded solely  according to scientific and technical criteria -- not like in  JESSI, where industry acted like a society for self-advancement  in deciding who would get money.

President George Bush may announce his plan to cut the core of the US nuclear force in his State of the Union address to Congress next week, the launch-pad for his re-election campaign this year, US officials yesterday. The latest US proposals reflect rising concern over the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the risks of nuclear proliferation, and the desire to encourage the republics to preserve central command and control of their arsenal of 27,000 nuclear warheads. The New York Times reported yesterday that the White House and the Defence Department are drawing up plans to cut or eliminate multi-warhead long-range missiles, including the land-based MX and the older Minuteman. Some of the cuts would be unilateral; others would depend on the response of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, the nuclear-armed republics. It was unclear yesterday whether Mr Bush intends to make concessions on sea-based multi-warhead strategic missiles, an area where the US has jealously guarded its technological superiority. One complicating factor is that a US offer could put pressure on the British and French governments to place their own nuclear systems on the bargaining table. If Mr Bush agrees to cut the Trident I and newer Trident II missiles, 'it would be a dramatic move,' said one US official yesterday. Last September, Mr Bush announced a combination of unilateral reductions and proposals for negotiated reductions in the air, sea and land-based US nuclear arsenal. Hailed at the time as dramatic, the US offer risks being overtaken by the collapse of Soviet military power and the virtual disappearance of the Soviet threat. In testimony to Congress this week, two top intelligence officials, including Mr Robert Gates, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Russia was drastically cutting defence spending and posed virtually no threat to the US. Russian military procurement in the first quarter was expected to drop by 80 per cent, the officials said. The nuclear cuts under consideration were first mooted by Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State, during a visit to the former Soviet Union at the end of last year. He is due to visit Moscow early next week, when Mr Bush is to give his State of the Union address.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

The Yugoslav economists, the Foreign  Ministry's note reads, believe that for the complete revival of  economic productive departments one needs a minimum of 18 years,  something that from a social viewpoint is inconceivable.    In these conditions, one hopes for Serbian-Romanian  cooperation, mainly in the areas of metallurgy, machine  building, electrical engineering, electronics, chemicals, and  the pharmaceuticals industry. By starting with these actions as  soon as sanctions are lifted, the exchange might reach a volume  of 1 billion dollars by 1995. In this way, the revival of the  Yugoslav economy could be completed by the year 2000 and the  Romanian economy could make up for the losses suffered as a  result of the dismantling of the CEMA market and loosening of  relations with the CIS.    The aforementioned note also mentions that the Romanian side  expressed agreement with the cooperation projects presented by  the Serbian guests. However, it insisted that they should take  place only when sanctions are lifted, because currently the UN  Committee 724 sometimes shows a totally unjustified rigidity  toward any commercial operation with Yugoslavia.    At the meeting of the two countries' presidents, when the  sides examined the results of the talks, the Serbian side  launched the idea of building a free trade zone along the Bega  Canal [which crosses Timisoara], as soon as international  political conditions permit it. Considering that the idea of  creating certain free economic zones is a long-standing wish of  President Iliescu's, it was regarded with great interest and  will be implemented as soon as possible.

After the arrest of a cell that planned to ""unleash"" a  strong  wave of violence in Tarapoto, the Shining Path continued its  attempt to occupy the vacuum left by the Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Army (MRTA) in the Huallaga region after the  defeat by the Army.    During a recent tour of the region, EXPRESO listened to  testimony that confirms that the Shining Path has managed to  extend its area of action in San Martin Department. With their  latest actions, SL members have reached northern San Martin,  control some areas in the Lower and Middle Huallaga Valley, and,  what is more worrisome, they have managed to hold on to their  old areas of influence in the region.    The recent Shining Path actions were concentrated in areas  abandoned by MRTA. In Tarapoto, SL members attacked two Upper  Huallaga Development Program (PEAH) officials, killing one and  injuring the other at the beginning of last December. The attack  took place at kilometer 22 of the Marginal Highway when the PEAH  officials were returning from supervising work in Ponaza Valley.  Two weeks before the attack, the SL had threatened the PEAH  officials who operated in Aypena, Shamboyacu, and Alfonso Ugarte.    PEAH officials who operate in other regions apparently have  received the same threats. For example, PEAH engineers in Junjui  have not gone to the fields in months as a result of SL threats.    A few weeks ago in the town of Santa Clara, located in Mayo  Medio -- where the MRTA had great influence -- 150 SL members  gathered residents together and appointed some delegates. ""We  did not know what to do. We did not have weapons with which to  defend ourselves,"" a peasant patrol member in the area told us.    In La Banda de Shicayo, a populous neighborhood in Tarapoto,  located three blocks from the local arms square, 20 people  hailed the SL on the evening of 8 December.    In the hamlet of Pasarrya, located near Saposoa, a group of  SL members attempted to hold a meeting of residents and appoint  delegates a few weeks ago.    A short time later in Sisa Valley another group entered the  towns of Nauta and Agua Blanca and burned the local municipal  files.    In Ponaza and Biavo, the SL arrived to control some hamlets  and strengthened their presence in the region's capital in the  past few months.    The SL apparently is concentrating on turning this strategic  area of the Huallaga region into its most important bastion  because it has not suffered many casualties there and has made  much progress.    The fast spread of the SL in the region represents serious  danger. Until January 1992 the Shining Path and MRTA had divided  control over San Martin Department among themselves: The  territory from Juanjui to the north was controlled by MRTA and  the territory from Huicungo to the south was controlled by the  SL. Now with the MRTA out of action, things have changed.    The SL currently operates freely in the area previously  controlled by MRTA. Its new operation areas are located in the  extended territory between Tocache and the Lower Huallaga. The  SL still maintains strong influence in its old area of influence  between Huicungo and southern San Martin Department.    In Huanuco, the group still controls the provinces of  Huacaybamba, Huamalies, Huanuco, Leoncio Prado, and Maranon.  Military sources guarantee that in these areas several  subversive groups operate under the name of T-1, T-2, Astro  Rojo, and T-4, which work with the ""local force"" of the Regional  Huallaga Committee, which is the top SL organization in the  region. It is thought that 200 SL members operate in those  provinces to indoctrinate members.    The ""main force"" operates in Ucayali, forming companies the  subversives have named ""Conquistar,"" ""Atreverse,"" ""Tormenta,""  and ""Mar Rojo,"" or ""ZB,"" ""JR,"" and ""AQ."" These groups control  Padre Abad Province and the towns of Aguaytia, Santa Ana, and  San Alejandro. The Army believes these columns are ""mobile"" and  are made up of 200 other SL members who are always armed.    According to some intelligence reports, the hamlets of Costa  Rica, Ledoy, Pajarillo, La Banda, Huayabamba, Barranca, Muralla,  Gonzalez Prada, Alfonso Ugarte, and Rocafuerte, among other  hamlets in San Martin Department, are the new ""red zones"" while  La Morada, Cuchara, Pendencia, Paraiso, and Primavera continue  being areas in which the SL has its ""basic force"" dedicated to  production and surveillance.    ""Open people's committees"" are thought to have been set up  in  several of the aforementioned places.    Local residents and authorities -- like General Alfredo  Rodriguez Rivero, the new commander of the Huallaga Counter  Subversive Front, who replaced General Eduardo Bellido Mora --  have voiced concern about the spread of the SL in the San Martin  region.    During a ceremony at the ""Leoncio Prado"" military post at  the  end of last year, Gen. Rodriguez declared his concern about the  SL's spread in the presence of several reporters from Tarapoto.  Intelligence contends that SL's Regional Committee in Huallaga  has kept its structure nearly intact.    According to police, the Tarapoto cell had planned major  attacks and the murder of the city's leading authorities. The  cell was made up of 10 SL members, six of whom were captured in  Tarapoto. Police reported that the subversives had been  entrusted with several missions, including that of recruiting  new members from Tarapoto schools and institutes and  propagandizing SL ideology in the city.    The dismantling of the cell was a severe blow to the SL, but  there are no indications that it was a mortal one.     "

Today, the same journey on a new British Airways Boeing 767 jet is scheduled to take five minutes more. Despite advances in aircraft design and the introduction of the jet engine, the average journey time on short-haul routes (one hour or so) takes longer these days because of congestion in European skies and on the ground at busy airport terminals. Even the slump in air travel caused by the recession and the Gulf crisis last year has done little to ease the problem. BA calculates that delays in its operations last year at London's Heathrow airport alone totalled 233 days. Lufthansa says it loses about DM100m (Pounds 35m) a year through delays. The Association of European Airlines (AEA), which represents 22 European airlines, estimates the total cost of air traffic disruptions in Europe at about Dollars 4bn a year. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that this is likely to worsen to some Dollars 10bn a year by the end of the decade if nothing is done to improve the situation. The problems of European air traffic control are not new. But the issue is coming to a head with a recent warning from Mr Giovanni Bisignani, the new AEA chairman and managing director of Alitalia, that Europe's fragmented and inadequate system could lead to another hot summer of delays and cancellations, and, in the longer term, to a capacity crunch in Europe's skies. The warning coincides with both a recovery in European air traffic this year after a 7 per cent fall last year and the completion of a detailed report by Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based European air traffic control body, concluding that the problems are much greater than had been thought. The two-year study was commissioned by the transport ministers of the 23-nation European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) in 1990 as the first phase of an overdue programme to try to harmonise and integrate Europe's disorderly patchwork of different air traffic control systems by the end of the decade. Transport ministers will consider the report's findings at a meeting in London next month to launch the next phase of ECAC's European Air Traffic Control Harmonisation and Integration Programme. Of 52 European air traffic control centres evaluated, half were found to have 'significant deficiencies' requiring 'a major system upgrade'; 24 per cent had 'major deficiencies' needing a completely new system; 9 per cent had 'some deficiencies'; and only 17 per cent had 'no deficiencies' at all. However, all the centres share one big deficiency. They are incompatible. 'The 51 centres from which information is available have some 31 different systems, using computers from 18 different manufacturers with 22 different operating systems and 33 different programming languages,' the report says. By contrast, the US, which controls nearly three times Europe's airspace, operates a single system in 20 centres. Investment in air traffic control systems in Europe has also lagged way behind spending in the US. But perhaps the biggest problem is political. Some countries, such as Greece and Portugal, have low priorities in their national spending targets for new aviation infrastructure programmes compared with Britain, France or Germany. But even these countries are divided on how to resolve Europe's air traffic control problems. Germany, for example, has been pressing for the development of a single, unified system using the same equipment throughout Europe. But the UK argues that the German proposal is unworkable and is recommending integrating the existing European systems. 'You cannot stop traffic for even one day while you develop a parallel system,' says Mr Derek McLauchlan, chief executive of National Air Traffic Services at Britain's Civil Aviation Authority. According to Mr McLauchlan, the multiplicity of air traffic control equipment in Europe is not a fundamental problem. He says a more realistic approach to improve European air traffic controlis to adopt common standards to enable them to communicate. But many in the industry are sceptical about the prospects of improvement. 'The chances of getting governments to agree are limited,' says Capt Philip Hogg, who is in charge of air traffic control affairs at BA.

Neither Copenhagen Airports, nor SAS, which wants exclusive use of the new terminal, appears willing to pay for the building. The terminal is planned to have a capacity of between 15m and 20m passengers a year. The airport, the main hub of SAS's traffic system, has an annual capacity of 15m but at present handles only 12m passengers a year. Mr Peter Hoeland, managing director of SAS Denmark, said: 'We do not see ourselves as airport investors. No airline, apart from Alitalia, is investing in airports. We expect the airports authority to do this.' SAS has recently presented Copenhagen Airports with its plans for the highly sophisticated and automated terminal which could make Copenhagen more attractive to transit passengers. SAS wants the airport to become northern Europe's main hub. It is at present Europe's 8th largest in terms of passengers. Mr Neils Boserup, chief executive of Copenhagen Airports, said: 'Only SAS can justify an investment of DKr8.5bn. The proposed terminal is so advanced, it's not a building, it's a machine. An airline might be able to afford it, but we can't' Copenhagen Airports made pre-tax profits of DKr169.2m on turnover of DKr1.2bn for the 15 months to December 31 1991. SAS reported pre-tax profits for the first six months of 1992 at SKr502m on turnover of SKr16bn. Mr Boserup is proposing an alternative terminal for use by all airlines. This building, which he describes as modern but more conventional than SAS's plan, would add about 7m passengers a year to existing capacity and would cost about DKr2bn. He said that if the SAS terminal was not started during the next year, he would go ahead with the alternative plan. An investment of DKr8.5bn might cast a shadow over the future of Copenhagen Airports, which is due to be partly privatised.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "
0,FT934-2558 ,"FT934-2558 _AN-DLND1AAJFT 931214   FT  14 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Republics jolted by backing for expansionist      By JILL BARSHAY and CHRYSTIA FREELAND      KIEV, MOSCOW   Former Soviet republics reacted with concern yesterday to the strong support given to the neo-fascist leader, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has said Russia should occupy all the territories of the former USSR. From Ukraine and the Baltic states on Russia's western flank to the Central Asia republics on the south-eastern rim of the Russian Federation, republican leaders expressed their worries about Mr Zhirinovsky's showing. However, all tempered their fears with hopes of a united, anti-fascist alliance of Russian democrats and a firm rejection of Russian expansionism by the western powers. The toughest response came from the Baltic states, whose large ethnic Russian minorities make them particularly vulnerable to Mr Zhirinovsky's pledge to defend Russians no matter where they live. Leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia plan to meet in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, tomorrow, to develop a common strategy on how to deal with Russia in the aftermath of the elections, a spokeswoman for the Latvian president said. Adopting strong language laced with references to inter-war Germany, Baltic leaders urged the west to take a firm stance in the face of the possible resurgence of Russian expansionism. In Kiev, Mr Viktor Stelmakh, a spokesman for the Ukrainian president, said: 'Zhirinovsky's success does not portend well for Ukraine. 'In his election campaign, he used demagogic slogans about recreating the Russian Empire and made direct territorial claims on Ukraine.' Foreign ministry officials in Kiev said Mr Zhirinovsky's electoral triumph would make the Ukrainian parliament less likely to give up the nuclear weapons stationed on its territory. Failure to surrender the weapons has become a source of mounting concern in the US and threatens to jeopardise the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). 'Parliamentarians have said there will be no ratification of Start while there's a threat (to Ukrainian independence),' the Ukrainian official said. 'Here's concrete proof of a threat from our neighbour. For them it is proof of why we should hold on to the weapons.' Officials from Kirghizia, which was caught up in a domestic political crisis that culminated yesterday with the ousting of the entire cabinet, said they were worried by the Russian election results but would wait to see how the parliament shaped up. Officials in Belarus, one of the most conservative of the former Soviet republics, also expressed concern, while Georgian leaders took comfort in Russia's approval of a new constitution. The Russian poll result coincided with Kazakhstan's formal accession to the NPT. The Kazakh parliament, which had already agreed to give up the portion of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal on its territory, joined the accord in a session attended by visiting US Vice-President Al Gore.

The agreement should be welcomed in every way, since it will  help to ""civilize"" Russian exports and will promote Western  capital investment in the Russian economy. This opinion was  expressed with typically English restraint by British Prime  Minister John Major.    A more frank and optimistic assessment of this event was  given by FRG President Richard von Weizsaecker. ""The spirit of  unity which has been established in Europe testifies that the  Cold War era will never return,"" he said.    On the whole, the tone of the statements by all the EU  representatives was almost wholly positive. Only journalists  expressed a certain skepticism. Thus THE LOS ANGELES TIMES,  while noting that the agreement will undoubtedly facilitate  European capital investment in Russia, which is undergoing a  severe economic crisis, at the same time reminds its readers  that the document still has to be ratified.    Journalists accredited to the EU Council session noted that,  despite the significance of all Russia's latest diplomatic  steps, much mutual suspicion still remains in the new partners'  relationship. Questions on which agreement has not yet been  reached include Russian access to the European Investment Bank,  the unconditional application of international rules in mutual  trade, and the relaxation of visa regulations for Russians in EU  countries. And the demand for the removal of restrictions on  the activity of five Western banks on Russian Federation  territory is hardly going to increase the optimism of Russian  financiers.    But Britain's THE GUARDIAN notes that the resolution of  virtually all international problems will be made easier for the  Russian leadership by the fact that the West has staked too much  to allow the risk of Russia's returning to isolation.    Russia will undoubtedly receive a number of benefits. Almost  all Russian and Western observers incline to this conclusion.  Above all, there is access to Western markets. But the Russian  Federation has secured this access on the same terms as other  countries whose economic development and cooperation led to the  elaboration of today's market laws. Here a problem arises. The  Russian economy urgently needs to reorient itself toward the  harsh conditions of competition. Concessions should not be  expected here. And observance of the strict norms in the EU's  relations with other states in Europe is closely monitored, with  a whole arsenal of punitive measures being used against  offenders. Will Russia, with its current legislative chaos, be  able to be a normal partner for the EU, and observe its own  interests as well?     "
0,FT943-810 ,"FT943-810 _AN-EI0DNAGKFT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (2): The old champion is still on his feet - Philip Coggan considers Europe's long-term economic problem, and the possible solutions      By PHILIP COGGAN   Europe stands condemned, in many economists' eyes, as an ageing boxer, flabby with age and made soft though luxury, ripe for a bruising from younger, hungrier challengers such as the countries of south-east Asia. Accountants Coopers  Lybrand have predicted that Europe's share of world GDP will fall to 17 per cent in 2010, from 22 per cent in 1990, while Asian developing countries' share rises from 18 to 28 per cent over the same period. There are two broad schools of thought in dealing with this long-term problem. The free-market, British approach is to argue that European labour markets are too rigid, and that the costs of employing workers, in particular in the form of additional social benefits are too high. Non-wage labour costs were estimated by a House of Lords report to be 44 per cent of total labour costs in the European Union, against 28 per cent in Japan and 24 per cent in the US. 'Europe's manufacturing cost-base is too high,' says Mr Stephen King, deputy chief economist at brokers James Capel. 'The main problem countries, such as Germany and Belgium, have high unit labour costs with a big government element, in terms of employers' social security contributions. Clearly, Europe will have a declining share of world markets if those high costs continue, and we will tend to see a shrinking of the manufacturing sector.' Mr Giles Keating, chief economist at CS First Boston, says: 'The problem with the European economic system is not just that we're more expensive; we are set up too inflexibly. Institutions were set up which worked well under the old system but which aren't appropriate any longer.' Among the problems that Mr Keating cites are regional concentrations of heavy industry, strong trade unions, and a generous system of social protection 'which was set up to look after workers who made temporary moves in and out of a static employment profile.' It is not just labour-market rigidities that impose a cost burden on European countries. The steady ageing of European populations means that those in work will face ever-increasing social costs of looking after the elderly. Around a fifth of the European Union's 320m citizens are aged over 60. Some 20m of those are aged over 74. By the year 2040, the proportion of those aged over 60 is expected to grow to 25 per cent; Ireland which has more than one child for every person of working age is one of the few exceptions to this greying trend. The burden of supporting the future elderly is increased, because most countries have followed a 'pay-as-you-go' pension system, in which benefits are met from current taxation rather than funded by contributions made during the beneficiary's during working life. CS First Boston has calculated that, as a proportion of GDP, unfunded pension liabilities are higher than conventional debt in every EU member except Belgium. Adding in unfunded liabilities, the only EU country with total debt below 100 per cent of GDP is the UK; five countries (Belgium, Greece, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal) have debt totalling over 200 per cent of GDP. Such drastic problems require radical solutions, according to the free-market view. Flexible labour markets are needed before Europe can adapt to the competitive challenge posed by Asia and other developing areas. Proponents cite the success of the US in creating jobs, while Europe has seen inexorably rising unemployment. Critics of this approach refuse to countenance the social costs implicit in freeing up labour markets in this way. They argue that the US has only succeeded in creating low-quality jobs, and that real wages in America have been stagnant for 20 years. They also point out that the high-cost argument is too simplistic. Germany - on many counts, one of the highest cost centres of all - is leading the way out of European recession through an export boom. Its costs are evidently outweighed by high productivity or the high quality of its products. Nevertheless, such economists do believe that the challenge for Europe is to emphasise technological development, education and training. The continent cannot compete in commodity-style products, where the low wages of Asia will be an insuperable barrier. Instead, it must try to maintain its comparative advantage in high-quality, value-added goods. 'High labour costs are only part of a complicated equation,' says Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson. 'When you're producing sophisticated capital equipment, which can be differentiated, you can command a premium price.' However, there are worrying signs that Europe is falling behind in the technological race. In 1991, the European countries devoted just under 2 per cent of GDP to research and development, compared with 2.74 per cent in the US and 2.87 per cent in Japan. And even the development of high-technology industries may not improve the unemployment problem, nor make Europe's citizens more prosperous. 'What essentially is causing Europe's problems is structural unemployment caused by technological change,' says Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at SG Warburg. 'Europe has to cope with the fact that capital has become materially more competitive compared to labour. The hit is going to take the form of minimum growth in real wages.' The scale of the problem can be exaggerated, however. Some economists argue that countries and continents do not compete against each other in the manner of corporations. Growth in Asia will bring prosperity to Europe as trade increases; Asia may catch up in terms of income per head, but both continents will grow richer. 'The need in Europe is to be able to grow modestly at 2-3 per cent per annum, while the Pacific rim is growing at 7-8 per cent per annum,' says Kleinwort Benson's Mr Edwards. 'Over the long term,' says CS First Boston's Mr Keating, 'the adjustment will occur in the form of a gradual rise in Asian real exchange rates. European purchasing power will gradually fall, but its exports will become more competitive.' But in the short term, Europe's high costs may cause severe problems for individual countries. 'Sweden is a classic case: far too generous a social security system, whose weakness has been chronically exposed because they didn't cut back quickly enough in the 1980s,' says Mr Keating. The European boxer may not yet be knocked out, but he will need some nimble footwork to stay on his feet over the next 30 years.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.

They are not revealing the details of the current operation,  its schedule, or the size of the transfers, citing the secrecy  and security requirements stipulated in a special document. But  independent experts maintain that the secret [liternyy] trains  taking the nuclear warheads out of Ukraine must be taking  several dozen warheads previously removed from SS-19 liquid-fuel  strategic missiles of the 43d Missile Army's 46th Missile  Division, which are in a pre-malfunction state.    Special cars are bringing elements for Ukrainian nuclear  electric power stations to meet these trains.    According to information at the disposal of the editorial  office, at least some 200 strategic missile warheads are to be  removed from Ukrainian territory to Russian plants during the 10  months of this year. In return, Ukraine will receive by way of  compensation, as a first real step, 100 tonnes of slightly  enriched uranium in the form of those very fuel assemblies for  its nuclear power industry.    It is no coincidence that these March days have been  selected  to start the removal of nuclear warheads from Ukrainian  territory. At the time the secret train crossed Russia's border  with specific weapons and headed deep into the country, toward  the plants where they will be dismantled and salvaged, Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk was meeting with Bill Clinton. He had  something to report in Washington.    The trilateral Moscow accord is being fulfilled. This  attests that Kiev and Moscow are serious about the obligations  they have assumed.     "

The signatories of the GATT have begun a new round of  negotiations on this single issue. An agreement should be  reached by the end of 1996. Between now and that time, the  status of most favored nation will not apply to this sector.    Europe had proposed opening up maritime transportation (with  the exception of coastal shipping between two ports in a given  country) to competition. But while the European nations have  almost entirely opened up their markets, they have not been able  to obtain reciprocal treatment from the Americans, who have a  very protectionist policy in this sector. For a long time, the  Americans in this sector have benefited from federal legislative  protection of their activities, which gives them priority on the  domestic market. The negotiators submitted minimal offers with  regard to the opening up of their markets. Countries like Japan,  Mexico, and Korea followed suit. Without result. The European  shipowners reject the institutionalization of the current  situation, wherein they come up against protectionism in  numerous countries, while at the same time competitors can  attack them on their own home ground. Therefore no offer was  included in the global accord, and new negotiations will be  launched.    Between now and the end of 1996, none of the parties should  be able to strengthen their protectionist arsenals, except by  means of retaliatory measures. But the Central Committee of  French Shipowners (CCAF) would have preferred a freeze, followed  by the dismantling of the protectionist regulations.    According to one market analyst, the heaviest losers as a  consequence of this accord are likely to be the Asian countries,  Taiwan in particular (Evergreen is the largest international  shipowner), and the countries of northern Europe, such as  Denmark, for example. Greece will also be affected.     "

However, the country's large foreign debt and deteriorating current account position mean it is still rated only a B1 risk by Moody's, four notches below full investment grade. Moody's also said it had no plans to review the ratings of other Latin American countries, despite the debt accord reached last week between Brazil's and its international bank creditors. 'Just a debt deal is not by any means sufficient,' said Mr David Levey, head of sovereign debt ratings at Moody's. The agency did not expect any improvement in Brazil's economic position in the near future, he said, leaving it with a rating of B2. Explaining the decision to lift the credit rating of Argentina's long-term debt from B3, Moody's pointed to significant steps in dismantling administrative and regulatory controls within the country. Also, Argentina has linked its currency more closely to the US dollar and made efforts to raise its tax revenues permanently . Pointing to the country's current account deficit, and fears of a resurgence of inflation, Moody's concluded: 'The potential for a reversal of current positive trends thus cannot be ruled out . . . but the credit rating agency does not expect a return to the chaotic conditions of the 1980s.' Venezuela and Mexico remain the two most highly-regarded of the countries with debt ratings in the region.

Rumors have lately been circulating in Paldiski that the  number in the stamp entered in documents during registration of  the population denotes the order in which people will be  deported from Estonia. In reality the numbers 1, 2 or 3 in the  stamp indicate in which of the three registration stations in  the town a person was registered.

In particular, he pointed out that the removal of nuclear  warheads from Ukraine to Russia for their subsequent dismantling  and utilization is being carried out as scheduled and in  accordance with a defence capacity of enterprises which will  carry out processing. The expert said that during transportation  and storage of nuclear warheads at enterprises serious attention  is paid to ensuring their safety. At the same time, there is no  point in closely watching the movement of each convoy since  secrecy during the transportation and storage of nuclear  warheads will be fully observed.    The first convoy with nuclear warheads from ""Ukrainian  missiles"" is bound to arrive at its destination in the near  future. The destination is not disclosed for reasons of  secrecy, but it was announced that in accordance with tripartite  Russo-American-U.S. agreements signed in Moscow on January 14,  1994, the warheads will be dismantled for being subsequently  processed at one of Russia's enterprises.    Under the agreement, in exchange for the warheads Russia has  pledged to supply fuel to Ukrainian nuclear power stations, but  not in the form of processed nuclear material obtained from  withdrawn missiles. The processing of this nuclear material  will take from several months to one year, experts said. The  supplies of nuclear fuel to Ukrainian nuclear power stations  will be carried out from Russia's fuel reserves.    According to the Russian Defence Ministry, on the Ukrainian  territory there are about 1,300 warheads for intercontinental  ballistic missiles an over 600 - for cruise land-based missiles.  The condition of part of nuclear ammunition causes special  concern of nuclear experts which might promote the speediest  removal of nuclear ammunition from Ukraine.     "

After the arrest of a cell that planned to ""unleash"" a  strong  wave of violence in Tarapoto, the Shining Path continued its  attempt to occupy the vacuum left by the Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Army (MRTA) in the Huallaga region after the  defeat inflicted by the Army.    During a recent tour of the region, EXPRESO listened to  testimony that confirms that the Shining Path has managed to  extend its area of action in San Martin Department. With their  latest actions, SL members have reached northern San Martin,  control some areas in the Lower and Middle Huallaga Valley, and,  what is more worrisome, they have managed to hold on to their  old areas of influence in the region.    The recent Shining Path actions were concentrated in areas  abandoned by MRTA. In Tarapoto, SL members attacked two Upper  Huallaga Development Program (PEAH) officials, killing one and  injuring the other at the beginning of last December. The attack  took place at kilometer 22 of the Marginal Highway when the PEAH  officials were returning from supervising work in Ponaza Valley.  Two weeks before the attack, the Shining Path had threatened the  PEAH officials who operated in Aypena, Shamboyacu, and Alfonso  Ugarte.    PEAH officials who operate in other regions apparently have  received the same threats. For example, PEAH engineers in Junjui  have not gone to the fields in months as a result of SL threats.    A few weeks ago in the town of Santa Clara, located in Mayo  Medio -- where the MRTA had great influence -- 150 SL members  gathered the population and appointed some delegates. ""We did  not know what to do. We did not have weapons with which to  defend ourselves,"" a peasant patrol member in the area told us.    In La Banda de Shicayo, a populous neighborhood in Tarapoto,  located three blocks from the local arms square, 20 people  hailed the Shining Path on the evening of last 8 December.    In the hamlet of Pasarrya, located near Saposoa, a group of  SL members attempted to gather the population and appoint  delegates a few weeks ago.    A short time later in Sisa Valley another group entered the  towns of Nauta and Agua Blanca and burned the local municipal  files.    In Ponaza and Biavo, the Shining Path arrived to control  some  hamlets and strengthened their presence in the region's capital  in the past few months.    The Shining Path apparently is concentrating on turning this  strategic area of the Huallaga region into its most important  bastion because it has not suffered many casualties there and  has made much progress.    The fast spread of the Shining Path in the region represents  serious danger. Until January 1992 the Shining Path and MRTA had  divided control over San Martin Department among themselves:  The territory from Juanjui to the north was controlled by MRTA  and the territory from Huicungo to the south was controlled by  the Shining Path. Now with the MRTA out of action, things have  changed.    The Shining Path currently operates freely in the area  previously controlled by MRTA. Its new operation areas are  located in the extended territory between Tocache and the Lower  Huallaga. The Shining Path still maintains strong influence in  its old area of influence between Huicungo and southern San  Martin Department.    In Huanuco, the group still controls the provinces of  Huacaybamba, Huamalies, Huanuco, Leoncio Prado, and Maranon.  Military sources guarantee that in these areas several  subversive groups operate under the name of T-1, T-2, Astro  Rojo, and T-4, which work with the ""local force"" of the Regional  Huallaga Committee, which is the top SL organization in the  region. It is thought that 200 SL members operate in those  provinces to indoctrinate members.    The ""main force"" operates in Ucayali, forming companies the  subversives have named ""Conquistar,"" ""Atreverse,"" ""Tormenta,""  and ""Mar Rojo,"" or ""ZB,"" ""JR,"" and ""AQ."" These groups control  Padre Abad Province and the towns of Aguaytia, Santa Ana, and  San Alejandro. The Army believes these columns are ""mobile"" and  are made up of 200 other SL members who are always armed.    According to some intelligence reports, the hamlets of Costa  Rica, Ledoy, Pajarillo, La Banda, Huayabamba, Barranca, Muralla,  Gonzalez Prada, Alfonso Ugarte, and Rocafuerte, among other  hamlets in San Martin Department, are the new ""red zones"" while  La Morada, Cuchara, Pendencia, Paraiso, and Primavera continue  being areas in which the Shining Path has its ""basic force""  dedicated to production and surveillance.    ""Open people's committees"" are thought to have been set up  in  several of the aforementioned places.    Local residents and authorities -- like General Alfredo  Rodriguez Rivero, the new commander of the Huallaga Counter  Subversive Front, who replaced General Eduardo Bellido Mora --  have voiced concern about the spread of the SL in the San Martin  region.    During a ceremony at the ""Leoncio Prado"" military post at  the  end of last year, Gen. Rodriguez declared his concern about the  SL's spread in the presence of several reporters from Tarapoto.  Intelligence contends that SL's Regional Committee in Huallaga  has kept its structure nearly intact.    According to police, the Tarapoto cell had planned major  attacks and the murder of the city's leading authorities. The  cell was made up of 10 SL members, six of whom were captured in  Tarapoto. Police reported that the subversives had been  entrusted with several missions, including that of recruiting  new members from Tarapoto schools and institutes and  propagandizing SL ideology in the city.    The dismantling of the cell was a severe blow to the Shining  Path, but there are no indications that it was a mortal one.     "

After a two-day summit in Washington President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin said they had agreed to implement the nuclear cuts agreed in the Start 2 missile reduction treaty as soon as the pact was ratified by the two countries. The Start 2 treaty, signed by Mr Yeltsin and former President George Bush in January 1993, provides for the elimination of 15,000 of the 21,000 nuclear warheads in the two countries' arsenals, but allows them until the end of 2002 to complete the task. 'By doing it right away we can save at least seven and perhaps more years,' Mr Yeltsin said at a White House press conference after the summit ended. Mr Yeltsin said he had also agreed with Mr Clinton on a deal that would bring an end to Russian sales of military equipment to Iran and allow Russia to become part of the successor regime to the Cocom system which regulated arms exports from the west during the cold war. An existing contract signed in 1988 would be honoured, Mr Yeltsin said, but thereafter no new contracts would be signed and no new weapons would be supplied. 'That is the principle on which Bill Clinton agreed to let us participate in the post-Cocom regime,' Mr Yeltsin said. Mr Clinton hurriedly noted he had reached only 'conceptual agreement' with his Russian counterpart. 'We have to work through the details.' The US and Russia remained at odds over whether to lift the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia, even though the Bosnian government's request for a delay has at least put the issue on ice. Mr Yeltsin yesterday repeated his opposition to lifting the embargo.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.     USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

According to EL TIEMPO, during the past 70 days the  survivors  of the Medellin Cartel who are currently in jail have  unsuccessfully sent letters to their emissaries in Cali, the  country's third largest city, seeking a peace agreement with the  Mafia in that region.    Some time ago, the clandestine group ""Pepes"" [Persecuted by  Pablo Escobar], reportedly made up of members of the Cali  Cartel, announced it would reactivate its struggle against the  men of slain drug trafficker Pablo Escobar until all the members  of the once powerful organization are exterminated.

Since its creation a year ago, ""Pepes"" has killed more than  50 of Pablo Escobar's men and destroyed some 30 properties  belonging to the Medellin Cartel. According to the police, the  hunt for the survivors of the Medellin Cartel who are free has  continued after Escobar's death and this is keeping the people  related to this organization in a state of fear.

State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Washington  did not rule out further steps ""against any other Russian  diplomats who are subsequently implicated in the Ames affair.""    McCurry was referring to Aldrich Ames, former chief of the  Central Intelligence Agency's counterintelligence center's  Soviet section who, together with his wife, was accused of  selling vital CIA operations and personnel information to Moscow.    Lysenko, whom the U.S. said is ""the chief Russian  intelligence official"" that is ""in a position to be responsible  for the Ames espionage case, was ordered to leave the United  States within seven days, McCurry said.    The Russian side protested the U.S. move, McCurry said.    Before announcing the demarche, McCurry stressed the United  States would continue its support for Russian reforms that  ""extremely important"" to Washington. [sentence as received]    Earlier, President Bill Clinton urged the nation not to  reduce or suspend aid to Moscow because helping Russian reforms  is in the very interest of Washington.    Clinton argued that the bulk of U.S. aid for Russia is to  help dismantling nuclear weapons ""that were aimed at the United  States for over four decades.""    Besides, Clinton said, Washington's economic assistance was  ""flowing not to government, but to reformers outside Moscow,  most in the nongovernmental sector, to help them start business  and privatize existing businesses.""    However, Clinton reiterated that Washington took the Ames  spying case seriously and urged Russia to take steps required by  the United States.    ""The Russians ought to be at least told what we know...and  given an opportunity to take whatever action they wanted to  take,"" Clinton said.    Local observers said the expulsion of Lysenko was only a  measured response to the Ames case and relations between  Washington and Moscow would eventually resume to normal.     "
0,FT934-894 ,"FT934-894 _AN-DLVCCADNFT 931222   FT  22 DEC 93 / Double trouble, toil and struggle: Ukraine's nuclear weapons and its collapsing economy are worrying for the west      By EDWARD MORTIMER   In the latest of a series of attempts to convince Russia and the west of its good faith, Ukraine announced on Monday that 17 of the 46 SS-24 strategic nuclear missiles on its territory had been deactivated, by moving the warheads away from the launchers. The move may go some way towards allaying anxieties in the west about the prospect of a Russo-Ukrainian conflict, heightened by the electoral success of Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who wants to restore Russian rule throughout the former Soviet Union. One Ukrainian parliamentarian has argued that Ukraine should try to secure operational control of the nuclear missiles on its territory, 'to confront the threat to its security posed by Zhirinovsky's new-found strength'. Russia has conducted a vigorous diplomatic campaign on the nuclear issue, claiming that the weapons based in Ukraine are not being properly serviced or maintained, and that there is a grave risk of an accident if they are not handed over soon. 'Ukraine is deceiving us all . . . and we are so helpless that we cannot deal with this evil,' President Boris Yeltsin was quoted as telling US Vice-President Al Gore last week. Western policymakers have grown increasingly worried about Ukraine's apparent reluctance to implement the Lisbon protocol, signed last year, under which it pledged to transfer the remaining nuclear weapons on its territory to Russia, and to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned recently that Ukraine would get little or no US aid until it dismantled the weapons, while Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister and current president of the EU Council, said it was 'unthinkable' for Ukraine to join Nato's planned Partnership for Peace so long as it had not fulfilled its disarmament commitments. But while some Ukrainian deputies have talked loosely of the weapons' value as a deterrent against Russian aggression, defence experts realise that any Ukrainian nuclear force would be vulnerable to a Russian pre-emptive strike. Nor do they believe it would be easy for Ukraine to gain operational command and control from Russia. 'The specialists who maintain and service the weapons are Ukrainian,' says Serhiy Pirozhkov, director of Ukraine's National Institute of Strategic Studies, 'but the black or red suitcase - whichever it is - remains in Moscow.' Anton Bouteiko, foreign policy adviser to President Leonid Kravchuk, insists that full compliance with the Lisbon protocol depends on three conditions: technical and financial help with dismantling the missiles; compensation for their value; and guarantees that Ukraine's security would not be jeopardised by its non-nuclear status. The west has been trying to meet Ukraine's concerns on all three points. Several well-placed western observers in Kiev are convinced that the importance of the nuclear issue has been exaggerated, and that the true danger to Ukraine's independence lies in its own government's mismanagement of the economy. Industrial output fell by 20 per cent in 1992, and probably as much again in 1993. Inflation is running at about 70 per cent a month - or, as economy minister Roman Shpek prefers to put it: 'The total price index this year is 37.8 times higher than last.' The long-promised national currency, the hryvnia, has yet to be introduced; meanwhile Ukrainian workers are paid in coupons which last week were trading at more than 30,000 to the US dollar - or, even more tellingly, at 27 to the Russian rouble, with which it started at par two years ago. Despite monthly increases in wages and pensions, incomes cannot keep pace with prices, and few Ukrainians can afford more than the barest necessities unless they have access to hard currency. Most families survive on fruit and vegetables from their dachas (country cottages), having gone out after work every evening last summer to pick the beetles off their potatoes by hand; and many, even in large towns, keep a goat for milk and cheese. Thus a sophisticated industrial economy, which once manufactured many of the components and guidance systems for the very missiles now in dispute, has all but reverted to subsistence farming under the impact of hyperinflation, aggravated by energy shortages. Ukraine imports virtually all its energy from Russia, which has gradually raised the price of its oil and gas exports to world market levels. Ukraine has failed either to prepare for or adjust to the change. Its oil refineries, which used to re-export refined products to Russia, are closing down for lack of input, while gasoline is smuggled across the frontier in trucks. Ukraine no longer has surplus electricity, and has therefore had drastically to cut its exports to central Europe, potentially a precious source of foreign exchange. Conservation measures are haphazard and panicky - many Kiev apartments were virtually unheated during November's severe cold spell, and universities have been told to extend their Christmas holiday until early February. President Kravchuk recently called in foreign ambassadors and tried to convince them that his latest 'economic reform', involving cuts in industrial and energy subsidies and credit creation, with faster privatisation, is more serious than its seven predecessors. All previous attempts have been sabotaged by increases in wages and pensions to compensate for price rises, and by credits to help companies stave off bankruptcy and unemployment. 'We have a law on bankruptcy, but unfortunately we don't have a single bankrupt,' says Mr Shpek. Ironically, many Ukrainians voted for independence in 1991 not out of any firm sense of national identity - though 11m of the 52m inhabitants define themselves as Russian - but in the belief that they would be economically better off. Mr Kravchuk's avoidance of painful economic measures which might shatter this fragile consensus has resulted in a situation in which, by every economic indicator, Ukraine is now worse off than Russia. Not surprisingly, a lobby of politicians and industrialists has emerged in the mainly Russian-speaking east of the country, advocating closer economic ties with Russia, with which Ukraine still does 90 per cent of its trade. At the same time, groups in various regions have started calling for greater local autonomy. Politically most sensitive is the Crimea, which was only made part of Ukraine in 1956, and which many Russians regard as rightfully part of Russia. So far Ukraine has been remarkably free of the ethnic violence which has plagued other ex-Soviet republics. But while some Ukrainian nationalists proclaim their willingness to 'eat grass' for the sake of independence, it seems unlikely that many Russians are ready for that degree of self-sacrifice. If the economy continues to deteriorate, different ethnic groups will see their interests as divergent; and if violence does break out, a local Russian leader, in Crimea or elsewhere, will sooner or later call on Russia for help. After the 1917 revolution, Ukraine, like the states of Transcaucasia, had a brief fling of independence followed by reabsorption into the Russian empire under the new guise of a Soviet republic. This time round a similar pattern has been set, notably in Georgia and Azerbaijan: local conflicts have been exploited by locally based Russian forces to reimpose de facto Russian control while maintaining formal independence. Should the same happen in Ukraine - a country that includes Europe's geographical centre, and shares borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania - it would, in the words of Markian Bilynskyj, the British-born research director at a Ukrainian think-tank, be the result of 'a succession of bad policy choices which look inevitable to the analyst after the fact; a case of self-destruction or suicide, with Russia only too eager to play the role of Dr Kevorkian (the US practitioner of euthanasia)'. Ukrainian nationalists advocate greater economic independence from Russia and closer ties with western Europe. Yet few grasp that only much bolder reforms would make that orientation realistic.

US vice-president, Al Gore, arrives in Kiev for a one-day official visit with Ukraine's new leadership. Mr Gore comes on the personal invitation of President Leonid Kuchma, just two weeks in office. Discussions are to focus on Ukraine's progress in dismantling its nuclear arsenal and launching economic reforms. UK economy: The Bank of England's quarterly inflation report, published this afternoon, may be used as justification for a change in base rates, as it was in February. Even if rates are unchanged, the market will scan the report for the Bank's expectations of inflation rates in the medium term. Kuwaiti and US troops will start a 12-day joint military exercise to commemorate the Iraqi invasion exactly four years ago, according to the Kuwait News Agency. US officials had no immediate comment. Specific gravity: Serious drinkers will be descending on the Olympia exhibition centre in west London for the Campaign for Real Ale's five-day Great British Beer Festival. Bonnie Prince Charlie, as painted by the French artist La Tour, joins the Scottish National Portrait Gallery on the 249th anniversary of the Young Pretender setting foot on Scottish soil. 3 WEDNESDAY Fed releases Beige Book The US Federal Reserve releases its Beige Book, an up-to-date compendium of regional reports on the US economy. The Commerce Department's report on leading economic indicators for June is expected to climb, pushed by rises in orders for new plant and equiment and materials prices. Nigeria: A general strike is threatened in Nigeria from today amid rising concern that the country's worst crisis in decades could degenerate into ethnic chaos. Nigeria is suffering from a complete polarisation between the military government of General Sani Abacha and the pro-democracy supporters of Moshood Abiola, who is being detained on treason charges after declaring himself victor in a 1993 election that was later annulled. Cuba's parliament debates a new tax law when it meets in ordinary session today. Authorities on the Caribbean island have been laying the groundwork for the gradual introduction of some personal taxes, as part of a cautious process of economic reform. The aim is to bring order to the country's internal finances by reducing pesos in circulation and cutting the budget deficit. Anti-atomic rally in Hiroshima: A representative of Japan's ruling conservative Liberal Democratic Party is to attend, for the first time, the annual World Rally against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, in Hiroshima (to August 6). The LDP has never in its 39-year life sent an official delegation to rallies calling for a ban on nuclear weapons. The rally is backed by the LDP's coalition partner, the left-wing Social Democratic Party, its traditional enemy until the formation of Japan's latest coalition government in late June. US-NZ relations: US assistant secretary of state Winston Lord starts a two-day visit to New Zealand. It is the latest step in a gradual improvement of relations after a seven-year rift. The State Department suspended senior level contacts with New Zealand in 1987 because of legislation banning nuclear-armed and nuclear-propelled vessels from the country's ports. Banana dispute: Representatives from eight Latin American banana-producing countries are meeting in Nicaragua to try to end a dispute over import quotas in Europe. Unlike the other Latin American staple export - coffee - bananas have been floundering at 10-year price lows on the international markets. 4 THURSDAY Court decision on Nasreen A court in Dhaka is due to consider whether to declare Taslima Nasreen a fugitive. Anybody sheltering her would then be committing an offence. The feminist Bangladeshi writer is in hiding following death threats because she allegedly insulted Islam. Last week she received an invitation to visit Norway, which could defuse the situation by getting her out of Bangladesh. Tin mine: Managers at Britain's last operating tin mine, South Crofty, Cornwall, will know today if their share offering has raised enough to get them through the next 18 months, when they hope tin prices will be higher. If Pounds 1m is raised by midnight, the UK government and RTZ Corporation will write off loans of Pounds 30.4m (Dollars 47m). Otherwise, the future looks bleak. Saleroom: Batman and Superman slug it out in South Kensington as Christie's London office holds its first sale of comics. It includes the first editions to feature the American heroes: Superman in Action Comics on June 1 1938, and Batman in Detective Comics in May 1939. The Batman comic, the rarer of the two, has an estimated value of Pounds 30,000-Pounds 40,000. The Superman comic is estimated at Pounds 15,000-Pounds 20,000. Basketball world championships open in Toronto (to August 14). Cricket: The second test match between England and South Africa at Headingley, Leeds (to August 8). 5 FRIDAY N Korea-US talks resume The US and North Korea are scheduled to resume high-level talks in Geneva on international inspection of North Korea's nuclear programme. Discussions, which began on July 8, were suspended after one day following the death of President Kim Il-sung. Pyongyang has promised to suspend its nuclear operations if progress is achieved, including possible US diplomatic recognition and economic aid in return for full inspections. The talks will be the first main test for North Korea's new leader, Mr Kim Jong-il, the son of the late president. US economy: The Labour Department may drop the unemployment rate from 6 per cent to 5.9 per cent. This could alarm the Federal Reserve, ever alert to early signs of tightening labour markets. Nigeria is host to a summit of West African heads of state. Chinese index: An index for Chinese enterprises listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is launched today. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index comprises the 10 H-share companies. Exit Graces: Unless Pounds 7.6m (Dollars 11.8m) is raised by today, Stephen Dorrell, UK national heritage secretary, will allow an export licence to the Getty Museum, California, for Canova's neo-classical sculpture The Three Graces. It is not expected that a sum to match the Getty's purchase price will be raised. 6-7 WEEKEND Samper becomes president Outgoing Colombian president, Cesar Gaviria, is due to hand over power on Sunday to president-elect Ernesto Samper, who narrowly won the May 19 election. Mr Gaviria is to become secretary-general of the Organisation of American States. Hiroshima ceremony: Peace Memorial ceremonies take place on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the 1945 atomic bombing of the city. Aids conference: The 10th international conference on Aids starts on Sunday. This year's week-long event in Yokohama is likely to be smaller than last year's in Berlin, not because of a lack of scientific developments, but simply because of the expense of travelling to and staying in Japan. The conference is expected to yield details of trials showing that the drug AZT can inhibit transmission of HIV from mother to child, and news about the effectiveness of using three drugs in combination. Guinea-Bissau vote: The second round run-off in the presidential elections in the west African republic is held on Sunday. In the first round on July 3, head of state Joao Bernardo Vieirafell fell short of an outright majority against the leading opposition candidate, Kumba Yala.

0,FT943-801 ,"FT943-801 _AN-EI0DNAGTFT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (6): Flag-carriers in a flutter - Competition among airlines is likely to intensify      By PAUL BETTS   Even during the last four years of recession, European business travel has continued to grow at an appreciable rate. A recent study by British Airways, covering all European airlines, shows that the number of passengers travelling by air for business reasons in Europe rose by 15.5 per cent between 1989 and 1992, and is expected to continue growing by 4.4 per cent this year and 5.5 per cent in 1996. The International Air Transport Association (Iata), the Geneva-based organisation grouping more than 200 airlines, also expects to see overall European air passenger numbers increase from 394m this year to 653m by the turn of the century, and as many as 1bn by 2010. This growth in European air travel demand, which is likely to be further stimulated by the emergence of the new markets of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, is expected to intensify competition in the European airline market, with airlines already having to adapt to growing liberalisation and new competing modes of transport, including high-speed trains and the Channel Tunnel. Liberalisation is gradually changing the structure of the European airline industry. Under the European Union's three-stage liberal policy, European governments are being forced to abandon the era of heavy regulation, which protected national flag-carriers from the rigours of free-market competition, and has kept many air fares, especially for business travellers, artificially high. The process of liberalisation has been slow and controversial. Under the EU's third package of liberalisation measures, EU-registered airlines were finally given last year much greater access to the overall European market and greater pricing freedom. In theory, the process of deregulation will be completed in April 1997, when all EU airlines will be able to fly wherever they choose within the single European market. In practice, it is unlikely that full European 'open skies' will lead to a rush of new airline start-ups, the opening of new routes and services and fierce price competition, which has been one of the characteristics of airline deregulation in the US, the world's biggest aviation market, during the past decade. Many governments continue to be reluctant to give up sovereignty over their airspace. The French government, for example, fought hard this year to try to block the opening of Paris Orly airport to UK competition, to protect its financially troubled flag-carrier, Air France. The European Commission has also come under pressure from several governments to approve large financial support packages and subsidies to help their national carriers restructure themselves and prepare for the new deregulated European airline market. Privatised airlines like British Airways, and other carriers in the process of being privatised like Lufthansa, have attacked these latest subsidies as threatening to distort competition in the new liberalised market. In July alone, the EC approved state aid totalling Dollars 7.1bn to three airlines, including Air France, Olympic Airways of Greece and TAP of Portugal. Since August 1991, the industry calculates that the Commission has approved state aids to European airlines totalling Dollars 10.35bn. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, recently said Europe was creating a two-class airline industry. The first involved airlines which had to solve their problems on their own; the other included airlines which continued to defy the laws of economics and were being protected by their governments to the detriment of other airlines. But despite continued obstacles in the way towards full 'open skies' in Europe, liberalisation has started to bear fruits for the European consumer and the business air traveller. On busy routes now served by more than two airlines, like London-Paris or London-Brussels, fares have fallen and service standards improved. Smaller regional carriers have emerged and opened new services between regional centres. The big carriers have also intensified their efforts to strengthen their European networks and sought partnerships with smaller carriers, either by investing in equity stakes or forging commercial and franchising agreements with these airlines, to feed traffic into their increasingly global operations. BA, for example, has developed a string of partnerships with smaller European carriers, including taking stakes in TAT in France and Deutsche BA in Germany. Many flag-carriers are also setting up lower-cost subsidiaries to serve domestic markets, to provide lower-cost air travel, reflecting growing competition in their home markets as liberalisation starts to gather momentum. But the expected growth in air travel in a more competitive and liberalised European airline market risks being seriously undermined unless governments step up their efforts to address the urgent issue of congestion at a number of big European airports, as well improving European air-traffic control. The rising tide of airline traffic is bound to put even greater pressure on Europe's existing air-traffic control system as well as its airports infrastructure. The introduction of a new generation of larger aircraft, being developed by Boeing and Airbus, may help to ease the growing strains on Europe's air transport infrastructure; but much more will have to be done to avoid a repeat of the crisis that occurred a few summers ago, when Europe's air and ground infrastructure simply could not cope with the volume of traffic. Since that crisis, European governments have started to address the problem of congestion by attempting to harmonise and modernise Europe's diverse air-traffic control systems, and encourage more airport development and expansion. But Iata has already warned that additional efforts will be needed in air-traffic control and airport facilities to cope with the expected growth in European air travel. Unless there is a common political will to undertake these big investments, the benefits of 'open skies' will be quickly eroded, and Europe could face, in the not too distant future, chaos in its skies.

These projects concern the new generation strategic submarine  missile, M5 (and possibly a version of the M5 for the Albion  platform), and the airborne ASLP air-to-surface missile to be  carried by the Rafale. However, that does not mean that these  projects have been frozen. Research credits have been earmarked  for both deterrent weapons systems. However, any decision to  start -- or, if necessary, abandon -- the development and above  all the production of these missiles has been delayed until 1997  when the schedule will be revised to take account of the  international situation and the state of French public finances.    Designed to determine the level of credit for the purchase  of  equipment and the number of troops in force for the period  1995-2000, the military planning law has been drated up by a  presidential Defense Committee. It will take the form of  six-year legislation after being submitted to Parliament before  the end of this spring session.    Intended to be the continuation of the 1994 defense white  paper, the planning project, which translates the white paper  into budgetary terms, prioritizes a conventional armed force  charged with foreign missions, and envisages the creation of  so-called projectable units for long-distance deployment either  under national command or operating by international mandate. On  the other hand -- and this is the main turning point in France's  conception of security compared with previous planning programs  -- the new draft law more or less signals a pause in plans for  future nuclear weapons systems. To be more exact, it does not  make a definite decision between the various options available  but leaves all avenues open.    There are several reasons why things have reached this point  but the logic is the same in each case: namely, it is too early  to make a commitment to send plans for nuclear weapons in one  direction rather than another and so risk making irreversible  decisions, since the production cycle for this type of weapon is  in the region of 15 to 20 years.    First, financial restrictions weigh heavily, even if France,  by agreeing to increase its military expenditure despite  economic difficulties, has taken a direction which runs counter  to the attitude of most of its allies, who have been obliged to  make significant defense cuts. Given these financial  restrictions, the emphasis placed on conventional forces means  that nuclear investment has to be limited. In addition, the  priority that was for a long time given to the whole range of  deterrents was, to some extent, a carryover from the East-West  Cold War which has since lost much of its meaning. The French  nuclear arsenal has not suddenly become so obsolete that it has  to be completely modernized from top to bottom and at any cost.  Last, it is generally considered that -- without seriously  jeopardizing its security -- France can wait, and extend the  life of existing nuclear weapons until such time as they become  obsolete. The current and foreseeable state of the world no  longer justifies, as it once did, the deployment of the most  up-to-date deterrents.    All these considerations came into play to ensure that the  military planning law is kept within reasonable limits. In 1997  a final decision will have to be taken concerning the different  formulas that will lay the ground for the weapons systems that  will replace -- or not replace -- the current M4 submarine-borne  missiles, the S3D missiles in the Albion platform's silos, and  the ASMP air-to-ground missiles carried by the Mirage IV, Mirage  2000-N, and other Super Etendards in service. The aim is still  for these nuclear weapons to be replaced by their possible  successors around the year 2010. By then, and between 1995 and  1997, research credits will continue to be allocated for the M5  (including for its ground version on the Albion platform) and  for the ASLP, so that the industrial groups concerned can retain  their know-how and their engineering teams.    If necessary, it will be possible to allocate development  credits in advance. This should be the case for the  stato-reactor technology which forms the basis for the ASMP (and  the new version of the ASLP which will be derived from it), an  area in which France is still a long way ahead of its  international rivals.    Will Tests Restart?    All this means that, while the core has been retained and  there is apparently no hurry, it will be up to the next head of  state to make the final decision, during the first two or three  years of the planning law, to determine which nuclear weapons  system will replace the existing submarine missiles and make up  the rest of the deterrent. It is understood that, in addition  to the missile-launching submarines, a second strategic  ""component,"" based on ground-based or airborne missiles, will  have to be chosen.    Whatever decision is made by the next president of the  republic, it is assumed that by 1995 a solution will have been  found to the particularly thorny problem of which explosive  warhead should be used in the nuclear weapons system. The issue  is not so much the nature of the new missile, but the nuclear  charge it will carry.    The suspension of nuclear testing decreed by Francois  Mitterrand, due to run until the end of his presidency in May  1995, prevents experts -- or so it would appear -- from defining  the characteristics and performance of the warhead which is to  be adapted to suit the requirements of this second ""component.""  All they can hope to do is ""patch together"" a new warhead using  existing ones, hoping that laboratory simulations will prove  sufficient, for the next 10 years, to build the weapon in  question. However, even if this were the case, it would still  be unwise to deploy a nuclear weapon whose safety and ""scale""  aspects had not first been subject to full-scale testing.    The next head of state will be given two choices that in  effect come down to the same thing. Either he can prolong the  test ban and, as a result, he will not be assured of having a  really new deterrent -- missile and warhead -- ready in time.  In this case he runs the risk of being accused of having led  France down the path toward definitively abandoning the very  principle of deterrent. Or he can take the initiative and break  the test ban, and then have to modernize the nuclear arsenal  with the prospect of having to be content with a relatively  limited number of tests before switching to laboratory  simulations. In this case, he will need much more courage and  tenacity to brave the antinuclear campaign in his own country  and, at the same time, risk turning his back on much of the  international community, which will be plunged into the torment  of having to renegotiate the non-proliferation treaty (NPT).    A cruel dilemma for a newly elected president to have to  face  just after taking up his new office! Those in favor of  restarting nuclear tests -- unilaterally, if need be -- will not  be held up by this point of detail. They consider that, on the  contrary, 1995 will be the year when a new president can --  during what is termed the period of presidential grace -- obtain  the backing for France to participate in the new NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty] framework with the express condition  that it can first complete its new deterrent by performing any  remaining tests.

They are not revealing the details of the current operation,  its schedule, or the size of the transfers, citing the secrecy  and security requirements stipulated in a special document. But  independent experts maintain that the secret [liternyy] trains  taking the nuclear warheads out of Ukraine must be taking  several dozen warheads previously removed from SS-19 liquid-fuel  strategic missiles of the 43d Missile Army's 46th Missile  Division, which are in a pre-malfunction state.    Special cars are bringing elements for Ukrainian nuclear  electric power stations to meet these trains.    According to information at the disposal of the editorial  office, at least some 200 strategic missile warheads are to be  removed from Ukrainian territory to Russian plants during the 10  months of this year. In return Ukraine will receive by way of  compensation, as a first real step, 100 tonnes of slightly  enriched uranium in the form of those very fuel assemblies for  its nuclear power industry.    It is no coincidence that these March days have been  selected  to start the removal of nuclear warheads from Ukrainian  territory. At the time the secret train crossed Russia's border  with specific weapons and headed deep into the country, toward  the plants where they will be dismantled and salvaged, Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk was meeting with Bill Clinton. He had  something to report in Washington.    The trilateral Moscow accord is being fulfilled. This  attests that Kiev and Moscow are serious about the obligations  they have assumed.     "
0,FT942-4301 ,"FT942-4301 _AN-EFJCMADBFT 940610   FT  10 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Missing links   European Union finance ministers were right this week to rebuff a European Commission proposal to issue 'Union bonds' to fund investment in large cross-border infrastructure projects. The scheme is deeply flawed. However, the debate it has stimulated offers an opportunity to explore more constructive alternatives. Union bonds, and the so-called trans-European networks they are supposed to finance, owe much to the desire of Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, for a grand political initiative to fight recession and promote European integration. But his proposals are unlikely to produce those results. At a time when national budgets are under severe strain, and the demands of the public sector weigh heavily on European economies, the EU should think carefully before embarking on a large amount of new borrowing. That might fuel recent rises in long-term interest rates and make it harder for private borrowers to obtain financing. If the EU needs extra funds, they should be sought from the existing lending capacity of the European Investment Bank. Nor has Brussels made a convincing case for its proposed infrastructure projects. It says they will create cross-border links which member states have had no incentive to provide in the past. However, that confuses cause and effect. The priority sectors identified by Brussels - telecommunications, surface transport and energy - have long been dominated by national monopolies. Their myopia, conservatism and resistance to competition - not market failure or lack of demand - are the main reason for Europe's deficient cross-border infrastructure. Too much of the spending envisaged by Mr Delors' plan would be channelled through public sector bodies. As well as being inefficient, that could blunt efforts to liberalise and privatise sectors, such as telecommunications and energy. The EU should instead use trans-European networks to support those goals by maximising the scope for competition and private sector initiatives. These are the most cost-effective way to identify and achieve worthwhile projects. In many promising areas, such as advanced information highways, Europe's biggest handicap is not scarce capital, but over-regulation, which has needlessly restricted opportunities for private investment. The most important contribution Brussels can make is to keep attacking those obstacles. Imaginative and radical policy measures are needed to ensure that trans-European networks are driven by the market, not by bureaucrats' dreams. That way, the idea could breed innovation and enterprise, rather than expensive white elephants.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

At  least eight demonstrators were detained by Carabineros who went  to restore public order.    After participating in a tribute to the killed MIR [Movement  of the Revolutionary Left] members yesterday afternoon, a group  of masked people set up barricades on Grecia Avenue and threw  Molotov cocktails and stones. Carabineros cordoned off the area  and caused huge traffic jams. Vehicles were diverted to nearby  streets while Carabineros used water cannons and tear gas.    The new Israeli-made water cannons, exhibited at the FIDAE  [International Aerospace Fair] and purchased by Carabineros to  serve at the 29th Special Forces Precinct, were used for the  first time.    Carabineros yesterday evening prevented another tribute to  the killed MIR members in Villa Francia District, dispersing  those who were planning to participate in it.    Manuel Vergara, the father of the killed MIR members,  explained that it was a peaceful tribute and that Carabineros  ordered the dismantling of the stage. He said:    [Begin Vergara recording] It was supposed to have been a  very  beautiful tribute. We could have had a video with a script,  with artists. It was scheduled for 2000. The problem is that  Carabineros arrived at 1830, surrounded the area, and even  prevented the stage from being assembled.    Mounted Carabineros pushed the people. They charged at the  people and the stage had to be dismantled. [end recording]    While the mother of the Vergara brothers was expressing her  protest to journalists, a water cannon soaked the journalists  who were recording her comments.

Jacques Delors, president of the EC's Executive Commission, proposed that $275  million in EC funds be earmarked to help the industry over a five-year period.    In specific action, the meeting expressed:     -- The need for a European postgraduate school to train writers, directors and  producers in a way that will strengthen the link between education and  industry. The school would encourage the development of co-productions. Nine of  the 26 nations represented have no national film and television academies for  professional training.     -- Support for creation of a European Film-Television Agency to strengthen  ties between national industries. Initially, this agency would serve as an  information clearinghouse, but would eventually coordinate, plan and conduct  research on such subjects as audience reaction and new technology.     -- Agreement to expand the European Script Fund to cover documentaries and  artistic programs, boost its funding and open it to artists from all  contributing European countries.

0,FT924-199 ,"FT924-199 _AN-CL3BJAA1FT 921230   FT  30 DEC 92 / Arms accords offer Bush a dignified exit      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   PRESIDENT George Bush can leave office next month with three important arms reduction treaties under his belt after tying up the loose ends of the Start 2 nuclear missile cuts he agreed with President Boris Yeltsin last June. The pact, coming on the heel's of last year's Start 1 and of the 1990 treaty reducing conventional forces in Europe, will certainly provide a more triumphant tone to the final days of the Bush presidency than seemed likely after Mr Bush's decision to pardon Mr Casper Weinberger, the former defence secretary, and others involved in the Iran-Contra scandal. 'I think it's about the best gift we could have during this Christmas season,' commented Congressman Lee Hamilton, who is about to take over as chairman of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee. 'It is good news that these two powers will be reducing sharply their warheads and it certainly gives a good send-off for President Bush as he leaves the presidency.' While the details of the Start 2 agreement remained to be settled, Mr Bush had come in for some criticism for failing to seize the chance to clinch deep cuts in the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union. Some have even criticised the Start 2 pact for offering too many opportunities for 'breakout', where one power starts a rapid rearmament programme with the aim of securing a nuclear advantage. This is because both Start treaties will allow some 'down-loading' to convert multiple warhead missiles into single warhead missiles, and so present the possibility of 'uploading' by putting extra warheads back on. Most arms control specialists, however, argue that the risk of break-out is exaggerated: it would take a considerable time, can be monitored and would have little effect against weapons that can survive an attack and threaten retaliation, such as submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The agreement leaves open the question of where disarmament efforts should now be focused. A hypothetical Start 3 agreement could, according to Mr Ronald Lehman, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, aim for the elimination of all intercontinental ballistic missiles, the 'Greenpeace option' of eliminating all SLBMs, or the 'Reykjavik option' of eliminating both categories of weapon. But participants in a recent conference at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy warned that if the US pursues disarmament through the Start framework, it could slow down the political changes it wants in Russia, by strengthening the hand of Russian hardliners. The conference urged a broader approach to curbing the threat of nuclear proliferation.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

The Netherlands has embassies in 87 countries, whereas  Luxembourg has representations in only 19 countries. That is  why Netherlands diplomats act on behalf of Luxembourg if that is  convenient. They prepare visits by political and trade  missions, and Luxembourg subjects can turn to Netherlands  embassies if they need help.    This is a unique form of diplomatic cooperation which,  according to Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques F. Poos, would  serve as ""a good example"" for other member states of the  European Union to combine their powers. With the fall of the  Berlin Wall and the dismantling of the Soviet Union, some 20 new  states have already been created in Europe alone. It is very  expensive to open diplomatic posts in all these countries. That  is why the small- and medium-sized member states of the European  Union would be well-advised to open joint representations in the  future, Poos said.    The diplomatic cooperation between Luxembourg and the  Netherlands stretches back to the last century when Luxembourg  was made a Grand Duchy in personal union with the Netherlands  under the terms of the Vienna Congress. The first of April will  mark the 30th anniversary of the conclusion of an official  cooperation treaty between the two countries. In order to  celebrate the anniversary, Minister Poos today opened --  together with Prime Minister Santer (who is also minister of  culture) and in the presence of Foreign Minister Kooijmans -- an  exhibition of Netherlands and Luxembourg artists at the Musee  National d'Art et d'Histoire. The exhibition will travel to our  country in May.    Poos' desire to have the Luxembourg-Netherlands example  imitated contrasted sharply with the humiliating experience the  minister had earlier this week in Brussels during the  enlargement negotiations for the EU. Norway's accession looked  like it was going to be blocked by 7,000 tonnes of cod. In  addition, the membership of Sweden, Finland, and Austria was  seriously jeopardized by the frontal assault which Great Britain  and Spain launched against the position of the smaller member  states in particular in the Council of Ministers.    To the rage of most of the EU member states, London and  Madrid refused to raise the threshold of the blocking minority  from 23 to 27 votes. By taking this hard-line position, both  governments put a heavy advance burden on the intergovernmental  conference to be held in 1996 on the future structure of the EU.  During that conference the administrative coherence of the EU  is to be reinforced to such a degree that by the end of the  decade the following step -- the inclusion of countries from  Central and East Europe -- can be made flawlessly.    The 58-year-old Poos is clearly disappointed. ""Nobody  understands the attitude taken by Spain and Great Britain which  provoked this discussion and jeopardized the current  enlargement. Everyone is guessing at the underlying  considerations,"" he said. ""Naturally, the Union will have a  different geographical configuration after the enlargement. The  weight of northern Europe and the weight of Germany -- through  the adhesion of Austria -- will be reinforced. But surely that  is nothing new? That was already known a year and a half ago  when, at the European summit in Lisbon, we decided that  enlargement should take place quickly and that this accession  would still fit in with the existing institutional relations.  The Spanish and British prime ministers were there and said  `yes.' Now the time has come for a signature, and they are  saying `no.' They have assumed a serious responsibility in  doing so, but I have not yet given up hope that this crisis can  still be overcome in the coming days.""    [Netherlands] State Secretary Piet Dankert said this week  that the debate on the voting position must be taken up at the  intergovernmental conference in 1996, when all institutional  changes must be put on the agenda. ""I am not saying that in  1996 the Netherlands will definitely agree with 23 votes,""  Dankert said. Poos agrees completely with this position. ""Nobody  currently has a clear blueprint"" for the future structure of the  Union, he said. However, ""everyone does agree that the EU must  remain efficient, and the fundamental principle of equality of  the countries must not disappear,"" Poos stated Luxembourg's  position. His government is not looking forward to an  institutional revolution. After 1996, too, the maintenance of  Luxembourg's national identity as a founding father of the  united Europe is a priority.    This implies, among other things, that the Grand Duchy is  firmly committed to having a representative in the European  Commission. The suggestion of appointing, say, one commissioner  for the Benelux countries -- once the EU has been enlarged -- in  order to keep the size of the European Commission under control  is unthinkable for the Luxembourg Government. ""No, no, no.  That would be unacceptable to the Luxembourg parliament, and  also for the Netherlands parliament. We are not yet that far  advanced with the federal Europe,"" Poos said. According to him,  ""it is up to the Commission, and not the member states"" to find  a meaningful distribution of work.    According to Poos, there should also be talk of things  besides the expansion of the powers of the European Parliament.  ""I am convinced that the national parliaments will claim their  share of powers in the European decisionmaking process. The  role of the national parliaments at the European level has only  grown in recent years. Europe's democratic legitimacy has two  pillars: one in Strasbourg and one in the national parliaments.""    When speaking of national identity you inevitably come to  the  status of Luxembourg as a financial center. Germany, which will  take over the EU presidency this summer, has already hinted it  will submit plans for a European tax on interest income. Bonn  hopes to curb capital flight to neighboring Luxembourg in this  way, but the Luxembourg Government will not cooperate, Poos  announced. Such a proposal is ""not acceptable"" because that  would start off a capital flight not only from Luxembourg but  from the entire European Union to financial centers outside the  Community. ""We will not move as long as gaps inside and outside  the Community remain unplugged,"" Poos said.    He can say that easily because decisions in this area must  be  made unanimously and not with a majority of the votes. ""We  therefore do not need a blocking minority. We have a veto, but  we do not stand alone here. The British, too, do not favor  this, nor do other countries, such as the Netherlands.""    Poos the economist is optimistic that the majority of EU  member states can move on to the third phase of economic and  monetary union [EMU] in 1997, and that ""the ECU will become the  currency of Luxembourg."" Last year, when the Belgian franc  dropped sharply, there were even rumors that Luxembourg wanted  to break off the monetary union with Belgium. However, said  Poos, that would be ""a catastrophic option, which we do not even  want to think about seriously."" He simply said that Belgium  would be in a position to move on to EMU along with Luxembourg  in 1997.    Poos' optimism was further strengthened with the visit by  Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski to Luxembourg this  week. The economic recovery is already under way in the United  States, as well as in several East European countries. Economic  growth in Poland is now around 4 percent, according to  Olechowski.    That offers hope. Poos is counting on countries like Poland,  Hungary, and the Czech Republic to become members of the  European Union before the end of the century. ""We have no  alternative.

Nato defence ministers expressed continuing concern over the dispute. Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, held separate talks in Brussels with ministers from both countries as well as representatives of Belarus and Kazakhstan, the other two former Soviet republics where nuclear arms are stationed. He said all four had reiterated their 'basic commitment' to the principle that nuclear weapons should be concentrated in Russia and the stockpile reduced. 'I'm inclined to take them at their word until I have evidence to the contrary,' he said. General Konstantin Morozov, Ukrainian defence minister, said shipments of tactical nuclear arms to Russia, which were suspended last month, would not resume unless Russia agreed to place the dismantling of the weapons under international supervision. But General Pavel Grachev, representing the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, said this was not part of the agreement reached between the four republics at Alma Ata, Kazakhstan, last December. Kazakhstan has already transferred all its short-range tactical weapons and Belarus about 70 per cent. Ukraine says it had shipped 57 per cent of its stockpile, reckoned to be more than 2,000 warheads, when it halted transfers. All three also have strategic weapons sites. Both the Russian and Ukrainian ministers said they hoped the dispute could be resolved in time to complete the transfers of tactical arms by the July 1 target date. Mr Tom King, UK defence secretary, said Nato expected all the non-Russian republics to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If there was any departure from these assurances, he said, assistance to these countries 'could be put in jeopardy'.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

The three-step 'Meyer plan' is easy to organise, simple to administer and guaranteed to succeed Step one: organise a conference and invite every unelected official who has proposed a growth plan or thrown his weight behind such a plan. Step Two: Shoot them all. Step Three: Repeat steps one and two as often as necessary to allow Europe's entrepreneurs the freedom they need to create jobs. Seriously, what is with you people? The wealth of Europe's great civilisations was not created by bureaucrats armed with grandiose and expensive growth plans. It was created by ambitious, clever, hard-working people who had the grit and the guts to turn ideas and dreams into marketable products and services, thus creating industries and millions of jobs. Europe continues to produce such men - and women  - in abundance. Indeed, I meet them all the time. Unfortunately for Europe, I meet them in California or elsewhere in the US where they have settled to work in a country that - despite its current leadership - continues to provide a better political environment in which to achieve commercial success than is available anywhere else in the industrialised world. For heaven's sake, we are at the end of the 20th century and we know the proper role for government in creating economic growth: it is to establish ground rules, to ensure these rules are obeyed, and otherwise to get the hell out of the way while entrepreneurs make growth happen. This works all the time; nothing else has ever worked. Why not give this approach a try? More accurately, why not try this approach again, since the last time Europe let its entrepreneurs run free they made it the world's most powerful civilisation, as well as its richest in terms of both material wealth and culture? Isn't this what you want? Or is all this talk of growth merely a cover story, designed to persuade people that something is being done while the real goal - feathering the bureaucrats' nests - continues unabated?

More than 60,000 people died in thousands of incidents  across  the country between January and October.    And Zou described the toll in lives and damage as  unprecedented.    Governments at all levels should make every effort to stem  the rise, he said on Tuesday to the third national  tele-conference on industrial safety since July.    He also called for new laws to protect workers and to punish  firms which put them in danger.    Protecting workers has an important role in China's economic  development, said Zou, adding that governments and enterprises  must do all they can to solve any problems.    ""While the workers are making contributions to our country,  we must bear responsibility for their safety,"" said Zou.    The tragic rise in the number of accidents was particularly  marked in foreign-funded firms and collectively-run mines.    Zou called for new laws on industrial safety to be drafted  as  soon as possible and for the powers of watch dog groups to be  strengthened.    And he stressed that any accident caused by negligence or  bureaucracy must be punished severely.    Safety inspections should be carried out regularly, he said,  adding that they should target accident black spots such as  foreign- funded or township enterprises.    He also hoped the press could improve public awareness of  the  importance of industrial safety by high-lighting major accidents  which claim many lives or cause severe damage.    Labour Minister Li Boyong blamed the accident figures on  poor  discipline, management, and operation and lack of proper  supervision.    Li also accused some managers of going for higher output at  the expense of their workers' safety.    He also attacked the illegal practice of dismantling firms  safety supervisory departments as they restructured their  managements.     "

Documents to this effect  were submitted on Thursday to the Japanese Government during  two-day consultations in Tokyo. The Russian side was  represented at the consultations by a delegation led by  academician Nikolay Laverov, vice-president of the Russian  Academy of Sciences.    When discussing possible disposal of liquid low-active waste  produced by nuclear-powered submarines of the Pacific Fleet, the  Russian delegation, which included representatives of the Navy,  suggested calculating how much it will cost to stop dumping  these wastes into the world ocean and to build facilities for  their complete recycling. Another proposal provides for the  construction not far from the Siberian city of Tomsk of a  storage for uranium and plutonium released in the process of  dismantling nuclear warheads.    Commenting on the Russian projects in an interview with  TASS,  Nikolay Yegorov, a member of the delegation and Russian deputy  minister for nuclear power engineering, stressed that in this  manner the Russian side displayed an initiative to promote  implementation of the agreements reached, specifically, during  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo this October.  Yegorov noted that Japan's participation in both projects would  not cost it more than 6 mln dollars out of the 100 mln dollars  of the earlier announced financial assistance to the former  Soviet Union's nuclear disarmament. In any case, Moscow is  ready to shoulder the lion's share of expenses.    The Japanese side, represented at the meeting by experts of  the Foreign Ministry, scientific and technical department and  the Ministry for Foreign Trade and Industry, showed a great  interest not only in Russia's proposals, but in the very  possibility of exchange of opinions between nuclear specialists.  An official of the scientific and technical department gave a  positive assessment to the consultations and stressed that Japan  favoured this initiative and was ready to go ahead with it.     "

In the last 18 months, he thinks he's done his share to help it end. But Roedy  isn't in uniform these days -- he's chief executive and managing director of  MTV Europe, which, like its American parent channel, broadcasts music videos,  rock concerts and music information aimed at 16- to 34-year-olds.    MTV Europe reaches 16.4 million households in 26 countries -- and the massive  changes in the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries in the last year have  opened up a market of vast potential. In the wake of perestroika, glasnost and  the momentous fall of Communist regimes, the Eastern Bloc nations have been  unanimous: They want their MTV.    ""Back then, I had a very different perspective toward Eastern Europe than now,""  Roedy said. ""It was strictly NATO versus Warsaw Pact. Now I think TV's a much  more effective instrument than missiles. My old colleagues at West Point may  not love to hear that. But I really do believe it.""    Indeed, when Roedy recently attended a reunion of his West Point class,  opinions on his new career were mixed. ""Some people were enthusiastic, almost  envious,"" he said. ""Others said, 'You do what?' They're so service-oriented.""    Ironically, Roedy has been closer to the historic action in Eastern Europe than  many of his old friends who stuck with the military. As the man charged with  finalizing deals with Eastern European governments to accept MTV Europe within  their borders via cable or satellite, he has assumed a role equivalent to that  of a cultural ambassador.    ""In Budapest last year, I signed an agreement for Hungary to receive MTV in the  presence of 20 government officials,"" he said. ""The ceremony took place in a  beautiful hotel restaurant overlooking the Danube. There were white tablecloths  and Champagne. We gave speeches all night. There was an exchange of pens. It  was like signing a peace treaty. I had to keep reminding myself this was only  music television.""    Roedy was addressing a music industry conference in East Berlin late last year  and had succeeded, through labyrinthine negotiations, in hooking up MTV for  cable TV in the city for the first time.    An hour into the conference, the East German Politburo resigned. Within 48  hours, the dismantling of the Berlin Wall began. A group of East Germans  heading for liberty in the West were stopped and asked how they knew the wall  was down. ""We saw it on MTV,"" they said.    Then last month, MTV, after lengthy talks with government officials, broke  through on Soviet TV for the first time. The channel will broadcast for an hour  every Friday night on ""Vzglyad"" (Glance), a popular youth-oriented program.  It's a modest beginning, but because it's on Gostelradio 1, the most-watched  national channel in the U.S.S.R., MTV Europe will be beamed into 88 million  homes, from the Baltic states to Siberia.    Roedy has souvenirs of his foreign adventures in his London office -- photos of  the ceremony in Budapest, pieces of the Berlin Wall. On his own wall, a map  with thumbtacks marks those cities conquered by MTV Europe. Roedy now has a  Harvard MBA and a successful career in the entertainment industry, but old  military habits die hard.    MTV's successes behind the former Iron Curtain have been attention-grabbers,  but its real achievement is the stranglehold it has secured on all of Europe  after only three years. Not only is the channel in every major European  country, but it acts as a kind of index for pan-European trends and fashions  among its target audience.    One is equally likely to see young people wearing MTV sweat shirts in Lisbon or  Leningrad, in Barcelona or Bucharest. Additionally, the kinds of products  advertised on MTV Europe -- Benetton clothes, Swatch watches, Nike or Reebok  sneakers -- are popular across the Continent.    MTV, then, has become a complex cultural phenomenon with far-reaching  influence. Not everyone is thrilled by this: Critics charge that the music it  plays and the fashions and trends it espouses all combine to create a bland,  Anglo-American flavored ""monoculture,"" which will erode national youth-culture  differences in the various countries it serves.    An article in the current issue of the London-based style magazine Blitz poses  the question of whether MTV's real mission is to stamp out ""indigenous  creativity.""    MTV Europe initially encountered some resistance, notably from the European  record companies that, after all, provide the bulk of the channel's programming  in the form of music videos. ""There was a lot of anti-American feeling at the  start,"" says executive producer Brent Hansen.    Yet Roedy takes pains to point out that MTV Europe is not an American  organization. (It is a partnership between Viacom International, which also  owns MTV in the United States, and London-based media baron Robert Maxwell.)  ""We employ 106 people in five countries,"" Roedy says, ""but only six are  Americans.""    Certainly MTV Europe does not look like the typical American corporation. Its  head    quarters are a converted 1880s warehouse in a narrow, gloomy, cobbled north  London thoroughfare, recently renamed Mandela Street by the radical chic ruling  group on the local council. ""For this I gave up a home on the beach in Santa  Monica and a 42nd-floor corner office in Century City with an ocean view,"" says  Roedy, who was previously a sales and marketing vice president with HBO.    The differences go deeper. On MTV Europe's payroll are employees from 14  nationalities, according to press director Christine Gorham. She is Austrian;  Hansen is a New Zealanders. Maiken Wexo, who is arguably the channel's  best-known veejay, is Danish; her colleague Kristiane Backer is German.    ""We encourage people to speak more than one language when they work here,""  Gorham says, ""even if they don't speak it perfectly.""    Still, the charge of cultural imperialism has stung Roedy enough for him to  address it head-on when he talks to officials from different countries who are  considering taking MTV on board.    ""I tell them we're not here to blend or blur cultures, we're here to enhance  cultures,"" he says. ""When I'm in France, which is the most extreme on this  issue, I quote De Gaulle: No one can expect to bring together a country which  has 265 different kinds of cheeses.""    But De Gaulle also envisioned a Europe that stretched from the Atlantic to the  Urals. MTV's burgeoning empire stretches 3,000 miles further east, to  Vladivostok. How can one playlist encompass music to accommodate the youthful  population of such a huge land mass?    ""We're positioning ourselves as a multicultural channel,"" says Hansen, 35,  whose curly shoulder-length mane contrasts with Roedy's trim, military bearing.  ""But what we are looking for are potential artists we can break in an  international arena.""    This might seem to confirm the critics' worst fears of MTV Europe gravitating  toward a bland, smooth-edged brand of ""Euro-pop"" with no discernible geographic  roots. Hansen concedes that before he joined the channel, ""I regarded MTV as  the enemy"" for precisely those reasons. Now, he says, he sees things  differently.    ""We're not an access channel, and I'm not in favor of playing a video that  doesn't look great,"" he says. ""That's patronizing. Just because there's a group  from Czechoslovakia with a video doesn't mean they'll get on MTV Europe. If the  video isn't as good as it should be, they'll embarrass us and they'll embarrass  themselves.    ""But, for instance, there is a group from Yugoslavia, called Laibach, who did a  good cover of the Stones' 'Sympathy for the Devil.' They might conceivably  release something we would put on the playlist.""    Rather than trying to find a bland lowest common denominator in the music  offered by the channel, Hansen says his job involves ""making sure that  something will work in Britain and in Yugoslavia. Or in Finland and in Greece.""    He gives MTV Europe credit for helping break the Creeps, a Swedish band whose  ""Ooh I Like It"" found favor with MTV Europe viewers from many countries. The  workers in Mandela Street believe they helped launch the career of the visually  arresting Sinead O'Connor. Hansen thinks the channel helped black rock singer  Lenny Kravitz: ""I think we also encouraged MTV in the States to focus on him,""  he says.    The notion that MTV Europe takes its creative cues from its American parent  channel makes Hansen bridle. All but three shows on MTV Europe are its own  original programming. ""I fiercely believe we have a better MTV than they do in  the States,"" he says. Hansen also points out that MTV Europe had its own rap  show, called ""Yo!"" since its inception three years ago, before the idea caught  on for MTV's ""Yo! MTV Raps"" in the United States.    For his part, New York-based MTV boss Tom Freston warmly praises MTV Europe as  the most flourishing growth area in the channel's rush toward global  domination. Certainly young Europeans have proved enthusiastic about MTV  Europe, and in heavily cabled countries like Belgium and Holland, Wexo, Backer  and English vee-jay Paul King are capable of stopping traffic. Meanwhile  Roedy's team concentrates on consolidating such key Western European  territories as Germany and Britain -- with some success. In the month of  September alone, MTV Europe added more than 1.1 million households to its  empire -- the largest growth for any single month to date.    But Roedy, the former Cold Warrior and Vietnam vet, cannot resist returning to  the implications of the channel's ventures in Eastern Europe. ""I took the tack  that we're European, not American,"" he says, ""but in Eastern Europe, they  didn't care at all. They actually wanted more American programming -- because  they'd had so much Russian programming rammed down their throats for so long.""    Recalling the minutiae of the Soviet deal, Roedy says: ""I told them, 'If you  are serious about glasnost and perestroika, and you want to send a signal to  Western business and industry leaders, there's no better sign to say how  serious you are than embracing MTV.' ""    This was well received. Mark Conneely, a network development manager who  participated in the lengthy discussions, reports that the Soviet delegation  glowingly described MTV as ""the Coca-Cola of music television.""    The channel's entry into the Soviet Union, Roedy reflects, was ""more than a  cultural breakthrough -- it's an economic breakthrough too. They gave us a nice  amount of troubles. But we are selling eight minutes an hour to advertisers,  and we are turning around and giving two minutes back to the U.S.S.R. They get  hard currency, which they badly need, and we get exposure in 88 million  households.    ""The advertisers jumped on it -- L.A. Gear, Stimorol chewing gum, Benetton,  Renault cars, Wrangler jeans. What I find significant is that not all these  companies even have distribution in the Soviet Union yet. We have a one-year  deal in the Soviet Union, so clearly they're laying the seeds for the future.""    MTV Europe also takes some credit for encouraging corporations and their  advertising agencies to buy air time on a pan-American basis, reflecting the  channel's scope, rather than doing deals country by country.    Its advances continue, apparently unchecked. Israel and Iceland are the latest  territories to sign on the dotted line with MTV Europe; Roedy has big hopes for  Israel, which is heavily cabled. Talks are now being held with Turkey; the next  region for channel to conquer is the North African coast.    If pressed, Roedy will claim that TV has played its part in the astonishing  political changes in Eastern Europe in the last 18 months. ""I do believe  there's been a hand in the changes caused by TV and satellite  telecommunications and deregulation -- which mean you simply can't have the  barriers you once had.    ""In Russia, you could watch TV and be fooled. You could have all your military  and space achievements and heroes and not realize you were living in what's  almost a Third World country. But not any more. Now there's a free flow of  information -- and it can't be blocked out.""

This might seem to confirm the critics' worst fears of MTV Europe gravitating  toward a bland, smooth-edged brand of ""Euro-pop"" with no discernible geographic  roots. Hansen concedes that before he joined the channel, ""I regarded MTV as  the enemy"" for precisely those reasons. Now, he says, he sees things  differently.    ""We're not an access channel, and I'm not in favor of playing a video that  doesn't look great,"" he says. ""That's patronizing. Just because there's a group  from Czechoslovakia with a video doesn't mean they'll get on MTV Europe. If the  video isn't as good as it should be, they'll embarrass us and they'll embarrass  themselves.    ""But, for instance, there is a group from Yugoslavia, called Laibach, who did a  good cover of the Stones' 'Sympathy for the Devil.' They might conceivably  release something we would put on the playlist.""    Rather than trying to find a bland lowest common denominator in the music  offered by the channel, Hansen says his job involves ""making sure that  something will work in Britain and in Yugoslavia. Or in Finland and in Greece.""    He gives MTV Europe credit for helping break the Creeps, a Swedish band whose  ""Ooh I Like It"" found favor with MTV Europe viewers from many countries. The  workers in Mandela Street believe they helped launch the career of the visually  arresting Sinead O'Connor. Hansen thinks the channel helped black rock singer  Lenny Kravitz: ""I think we also encouraged MTV in the States to focus on him,""  he says.    The notion that MTV Europe takes its creative cues from its American parent  channel makes Hansen bridle. All but three shows on MTV Europe are its own  original programming. ""I fiercely believe we have a better MTV than they do in  the States,"" he says. Hansen also points out that MTV Europe had its own rap  show, called ""Yo!"" since its inception three years ago, before the idea caught  on for MTV's ""Yo! MTV Raps"" in the United States.    For his part, New York-based MTV boss Tom Freston warmly praises MTV Europe as  the most flourishing growth area in the channel's rush toward global  domination. Certainly young Europeans have proved enthusiastic about MTV  Europe, and in heavily cabled countries like Belgium and Holland, Wexo, Backer  and English vee-jay Paul King are capable of stopping traffic. Meanwhile  Roedy's team concentrates on consolidating such key Western European  territories as Germany and Britain -- with some success. In the month of  September alone, MTV Europe added more than 1.1 million households to its  empire -- the largest growth for any single month to date.    But Roedy, the former Cold Warrior and Vietnam vet, cannot resist returning to  the implications of the channel's ventures in Eastern Europe. ""I took the tack  that we're European, not American,"" he says, ""but in Eastern Europe, they  didn't care at all. They actually wanted more American programming -- because  they'd had so much Russian programming rammed down their throats for so long.""    Recalling the minutiae of the Soviet deal, Roedy says: ""I told them, 'If you  are serious about glasnost and perestroika, and you want to send a signal to  Western business and industry leaders, there's no better sign to say how  serious you are than embracing MTV.' ""    This was well received. Mark Conneely, a network development manager who  participated in the lengthy discussions, reports that the Soviet delegation  glowingly described MTV as ""the Coca-Cola of music television.""    The channel's entry into the Soviet Union, Roedy reflects, was ""more than a  cultural breakthrough -- it's an economic breakthrough too. They gave us a nice  amount of troubles. But we are selling eight minutes an hour to advertisers,  and we are turning around and giving two minutes back to the U.S.S.R. They get  hard currency, which they badly need, and we get exposure in 88 million  households.    ""The advertisers jumped on it -- L.A. Gear, Stimorol chewing gum, Benetton,  Renault cars, Wrangler jeans. What I find significant is that not all these  companies even have distribution in the Soviet Union yet. We have a one-year  deal in the Soviet Union, so clearly they're laying the seeds for the future.""    MTV Europe also takes some credit for encouraging corporations and their  advertising agencies to buy air time on a pan-American basis, reflecting the  channel's scope, rather than doing deals country by country.    Its advances continue, apparently unchecked. Israel and Iceland are the latest  territories to sign on the dotted line with MTV Europe; Roedy has big hopes for  Israel, which is heavily cabled. Talks are now being held with Turkey; the next  region for channel to conquer is the North African coast.    If pressed, Roedy will claim that TV has played its part in the astonishing  political changes in Eastern Europe in the last 18 months. ""I do believe  there's been a hand in the changes caused by TV and satellite  telecommunications and deregulation -- which mean you simply can't have the  barriers you once had.    ""In Russia, you could watch TV and be fooled. You could have all your military  and space achievements and heroes and not realize you were living in what's  almost a Third World country. But not any more. Now there's a free flow of  information -- and it can't be blocked out.""

0,FT931-9626 ,"FT931-9626 _AN-DBLB0AFPFT 930212   FT  12 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Trading east   THE FIRST annual economic review of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development provides a chilling perspective for western Europe's pessimists. While economic conditions are difficult in the European Community, they are many times harsher for its eastern neighbours. While strained economic relations are making trading conditions difficult for members of the European exchange rate mechanism, the almost complete breakdown of monetary relations to the east has meant an accelerating collapse in trade and output in the republics of the former Soviet Union. All is not completely bleak. The first casualties of the demise of the former Soviet Union were the countries of eastern Europe. Heavily dependent on Soviet trade, they were devastated by the shift to hard currency settlement of trade with the then Soviet Union in January 1991 and the 63 per cent fall in Soviet imports that followed. But Poland, after three years of falling output, is on the verge of economic growth while the Czech Republic and Hungary have also shifted successfully to current account convertibility, and re-oriented their economies towards western markets. Sadly, the main obstacle to export-led growth in eastern Europe is now western Europe's unwillingness to accept free trade. But even if the EC, in a fit of uncharacteristic enlightenment, were to open its markets to eastern products, the plight of the republics of the former Soviet Union would remain dire. Heavily dependent on each other for the large majority of trade in oil, raw materials and industrial components, they have little chance of surviving independently. Rebuilding close economic and trade ties between the republics is a pre-condition for the success of economic reform. But the EBRD is right to argue that the western pressure to hold the rouble zone together was misguided. The inflationary and fiscal tensions produced by the effort to maintain it are largely responsible for the deterioration in monetary relations between the republics, the reversion to bilateral trade agreements and crude barter arrangements, and the collapse in trade and output. The former Soviet republics should, instead, be building a multilateral clearing system, with western support, in order to finance trade and allow Russia to raise oil prices to world levels, without provoking balance of payments crises. A common currency is not needed for a revival in inter-republican trade. At present, it is having the opposite effect.   Companies:-  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

0,FT934-1447 ,"FT934-1447 _AN-DLSAAADRFT 931218   FT  18 DEC 93 / Steelmakers angered as EU approves state aid      By ANDREW HILL and ANDREW BAXTER      BRUSSELS, LONDON   Europe's big steelmakers reacted angrily last night when the European Union cleared the way for restructuring its ailing steel industry after more than a year of often bitter wrangling over state subsidies. Industry ministers unanimously approved a series of state aids for public sector steel producers in eastern Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal worth nearly Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.33bn) and involving more than 5m tonnes of capacity reductions. The deal is the most far-reaching attempt by the Union to resolve the deep-seated problems of Europe's steel industry since the restructuring carried out under the Davignon plan of the early 1980s. Without agreement on state subsidies, the entire industry faced sliding into further heavy losses next year. The European Commission and the Belgian presidency of the EU said it was now up to non-aided steel producers to carry out their side of the bargain and cut production by almost 25m tonnes, easing problems of overcapacity. But the deal was immediately criticised by these unsubsidised private sector producers, raising the possibility that they will be reluctant to offer their own capacity cuts. 'This is a compromise, driven by political expedience,' said British Steel. Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel Federation, called it 'pure window dressing for the gullible' and predicted dire consequences for Germany's private steelmakers. The ministers issued a strong political declaration renouncing further state subsidies for the companies involved. Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, said: 'The importance of today's agreement is exactly that it is a road without a return.' Mr Savona had been accused by the Commission and the Belgian presidency of blocking an overall deal on state subsidies at the November meeting of industry ministers. But the agreement on restructuring Ilva, the state-owned Italian producer, was reached without detailed discussion yesterday. Mr Tim Sainsbury, British industry minister, also had to abandon UK resistance to the restructuring of Ekostahl, the east German producer. But Britain and Denmark won commitments that Riva, the private Italian company planning to buy Ekostahl, would limit new capacity to 900,000 tonnes over the next five years, and 'significantly below 2m tonnes' up to 2004. Mr Sainsbury also stressed that most of the restructuring packages would involve an element of privatisation which, he said, would lead to 'much fairer trading for steel in the Community'. Yesterday's agreement is subject to formal parliamentary scrutiny in Denmark and Britain. The Commission has already won agreement from ministers for other elements of its rescue plan: Ecu240m of financial support to ease the pain of more than 50,000 redundancies; monitoring of the steel market; and safeguards to limit cheap imports of steel from central and eastern Europe.

The Cabinet of Ministers  must then confirm them.    I think there still are, however, some ambiguities. Other  countries--some of them that have even congratulated Latvia on  such an outcome to the talks and are satisfied--at the same  time, are they satisfied? [passage omitted]    Mr. Birkavs, are these other countries, after all, aware of  how many troops will remain here and of what this process will  be like?    [Birkavs] Mrs. Grinberga, you immediately grab the bull by  the horns very strongly. [passage omitted] I would very much  like everyone to feel secure and stable about the future during  this heated time. Precisely during the present day, however,  our state's boat or our state's ship is being rocked quite  heavily in connection with the agreement between Russia and  Latvia. Moreover, it is being rocked in such a way that all the  values that we possess and that we have achieved and for which  we are striving may collapse.    We, of course, are very thoroughly evaluating each sentence  in the agreement. The agreement is the result of two years of  difficult talks, in which a compromise in one place gave an  opportunity to move forward at another place. The heart was  heavy before signing this agreement, but the agreement is a  guarantee. It is a guarantee for our future: that the troops  will definitely leave, that Skrunda will definitely be  eliminated, and that military pensioners will definitely be  controlled in our state. This is because one of the component  parts of the agreement are the lists of pensioners, of the  militarists; 22,000--that is a big number--but we will know them  all. At the present moment, we do not even know them all.    We will know exactly who those 599 military persons will be  who are to be located at the Skrunda facility. When we know all  those persons--in the near future we are forming an immigration  policy--then we will find much more easily the superfluous ones.  We will much more easily isolate them and much more easily  extradite them from the state. Therefore, we must very  thoroughly weigh in, but the movement toward signing the  agreement is absolutely necessary. I think that the attitude of  the world toward signing of the agreement is comparatively  unequivocal in principle; it is positive, because the world sees  that we are using a civilized method. [passage omitted]    [Grinberga] Is it, after all, really ethical to lay down in  such detail those social guarantees for the military people who  will be considered pensioners and will be considered retired.  These minute concerns that have been laid down in one of the  agreements, why is it necessary to do so in that much detail, to  do so very thoroughly?    [Birkavs] You see, in one of the agreements all the minute  concerns have been laid down that are being implemented until 31  August. After 31 August, both these minute and major concerns  will end for us because the troops, and their family members,  and the military persons who retired after this agreement was  concluded are being guaranteed definite rights until they leave.  That is those who retired after 28 January 1992; in fact, it is  from the moment when Yeltsin recognized the former USSR troops  as their troops. Until that moment that all the complex of  military persons leaves, they are being guaranteed definite  rights--comparatively minute, yes, but so it is. This is until  the agreement's ... [pauses] until the troops leave.    Another agreement relates to the stay in Latvia of military  persons, of retired military persons. Of course, if we would be  able to get rid of these retired military persons easily without  an agreement--and they would leave with the troops--this would  be an ideal version. I would be the most glad of all. This is  not possible, however; therefore, it is laid down in the  agreement that they cannot and never will obtain Latvian  citizenship under any conditions and that they must subjugate  themselves to the laws of Latvia.    They have those minute concerns for themselves, as you said,  to be allowed medical services, to visit the dentist, on general  grounds. So that their apartments will be warm--although the  apartments of Latvians, as they usually are, are cold--this has  been laid down in the agreement. So, neither more nor less is  given to them than to others, but these were the demands by the  Russian side. This is what they insisted on, as a result of  which we have arrived at the agreement that will rid us of them  after all.    [Grinberga] So, would you also please tell us with what  means  will the Skrunda radar station be dismantled--those  buildings--with what money?    [Birkavs] I think that--although hatred and anger against  Skrunda is so great that the radar station might collapse by  that alone--nevertheless, the U.S. Senate will decide on 15  April on allocating 10 million dollars in order to make use of  technical means for dismantling the Skrunda radar station.  Dismantling can begin, dismantling of the new radar station can  begin at the moment the agreement is signed. I have already  spoken with people about whether they would be ready to drive  there with tractors, although a tractor will not suffice.  Actually, the Skrunda radar station, the new one, must be  levelled to the ground. Also, the foundations must be blown up.  No kind of a temptation must remain there for Russia. If  foundations were to remain, then building the top--that big  one--could be done very quickly. Therefore, at that moment  when there will be nothing--neither the foundations nor the  top--we will be fully convinced that Russia will not make any  kind of investments for building a new radar station. They  will, evidently, invest that in Belarus, at Baranovichi.  [passage omitted]     "

Only a handful of MPs from mainland constituencies expressed reservations about the declaration, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given strong support by key backbenchers on both sides. Conservative MPs cheered as Mr Major challenged Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, to accept the challenge to condemn violence and join the political process. Reaction from the Conservative back benches was largely positive, although a handful of MPs suggested that the agreement represented a weakening of Britain's commitment to Northern Ireland. Others called for assurances that the fight against terrorism would continue, and urged the government to insist on a surrender of weapons and explosives by the IRA before entering into talks with Sinn Fein. In Belfast last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, signalled on a television discussion programme that the IRA might be required to surrender its arsenal of weapons before being accepted into the political process. Mr Andrew Hunter, the influential chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee, said the declaration was 'a positive step forward'. But there were cheers as he urged the prime minister to 'ensure that there is no let-up in the hunt for those who perpetrate violence'. Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a senior Conservative backbencher, said the declaration was supported by the UK-Irish Inter Parliamentary Body, of which he is joint chairman. Mr Tom King, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said the declaration contained nothing to seriously threaten the interests of any part of the Northern Ireland community. Few MPs expressed concern about the permanence of the links between Northern Ireland and the UK. However, Mr Tony Marlow, the Conservative MP for Northampton North, said there was 'a danger that people will say that the prime minister of the UK is careless with regard to the integrity of the UK'. Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative MP for Macclesfield, welcomed the prime minister's commitment to peace, but urged him to go to Northern Ireland to campaign for the union. The declaration was welcomed 'with enthusiasm' by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and by Mr Alan Beith for the Liberal Democrats. Most Labour backbenchers also welcomed the declaration. Mr Doug Hoyle, MP for Warrington North - in whose constituency two boys were killed by an IRA bomb this year - said the terrorists would never be forgiven if they failed to respond. 'It is time for all the paramilitaries to lay down their arms,' he said. The declaration was criticised by some Labour leftwingers. Mr Tony Benn, a former cabinet minister, said public opinion in Britain would support talks with Sinn Fein in advance of a cessation of violence.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Historian and Deputy Eusebio Leal issued an appeal to act  without delay against ""scoundrels and speculators"" according to  the revolution's legal system.    In a special session of the National Assembly of the  People's  Government (parliament) held today, Rolando Lao, parliamentary  member for Plaza de la Capital Municipality, emphasized the need  to adjust the taxes imposed on self-employed workers according  to the income they earn.    ""We must not expect miracles. The deputies, government, and  public administration officials are responsible for preventing  the diversion of state resources to the black market,"" he said,  adding that he endorses the gradual enforcement of measures that  will affect a majority of the population.    The deputies argued for and against changing the currency as  an instrument to put finances on a sound basis and to control  and penalize illegal enrichment.    Deputy Lazaro Barredo proposed changing the currency,  freezing funds, and the eventual confiscation of assets owned by  citizens who cannot justify their incomes.    Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the parliament's Economic  Affairs Commission, said that changing the currency can be  another measure used but that it is not a solution per se. He  did not link it to the policy against the so-called ""currency  hoarders,"" citizens whose wealth stems from the black market or  from speculation.    He said: These people converted a sizable part of their  funds into assets a long time ago, so changing the currency  would not be efficient. He said there are other options  available without resorting to a change of currency.    He reminded everyone that if you analyze savings accounts,  you will see that 62 percent of the population has money  deposited in the national banking system.    An exchange measure can be traumatic because it would entail  establishing a limit on the money that can be exchanged and  freezing funds, with the subsequent negative effects on people  who have not necessarily grown rich illegally.    Under the Cuban economy's current situation, when no  substantial short-term increase is foreseen in the production  sector, the change of currency would not have a permanent effect  on the black market, the economist said.    President Fidel Castro also spoke about this issue. He said  that changing currency is one weapon in the arsenal of measures  that may be used, but it must never be exclusively aimed at the  eradication of the so-called ""currency-hoarders.""    He said that the parliament's final decision, whatever it  may  be, cannot allow these speculators to walk away scot-free for  their illegal activity.    The assembly, which is being attended by 551 deputies plus  dozens of foreign guests invited to the 1 May celebrations, has  only one topic: the analysis of measures to put internal  finances on a sound basis.

0,FT942-12005 ,"FT942-12005 _AN-EECCXAC8FT 940503   FT  03 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Europe's parliament   European Union institutions often face justifiable criticism for lack of transparency in decision-making. One of the bodies best placed to address this problem is the European Parliament, but the public doubts its effectiveness. That is one reason why, in most EU countries, the turnout in the election for the Strasbourg assembly on June 9 and 12 will probably be much lower than in national polls. In fact, as a result of the Single European Act that came into force in 1987 and the Maastricht treaty, the power of the 518 (soon to be 567) MEPs in many cases exceeds that of members of national parliaments. With the ability to determine Europe-wide legislation, vet both the European Commission and Council of Ministers and check the EU budget, Europe's transnational assembly demands to be taken seriously. At the same time, the rules governing the parliament's own operations need to be tightened. If it wants public sympathy in its campaign for a more directly democratic EU, the parliament will have to correct its own shortcomings. At present, the parliament offers a case study in unwieldiness, due only in part to the inevitable problems of linking 12 states' diverse political cultures. Efficiency is constrained and costs increased by MEPs' need to peregrinate between plenary sessions in Strasbourg and committee meetings in Brussels. Higher profile The parliament's difficulties have often reflected national governments' unwillingness to allow it to undermine national parliaments. However, during the next five-year legislature period, it will have a much higher profile. Already, around 2,000 MEPs' amendments relating to single market legislation have passed into law. Under Maastricht, the parliament shares 'co-decision' power with the Council of Ministers. It can veto most measures passed by qualified majority voting, in fields ranging from consumer protection and vocational training to health and research. In a fresh sign of its importance, the parliament is due to decide tomorrow whether to accept the formula for EU voting planned when Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden join. It would be both unwise and regrettable if MEPs risked delaying an enlargement timetable which commands widespread support within the EU, but which is politically sensitive in the applicant countries. The parliament is, however, on stronger ground in seeking confirmation hearings with nominees for the new Commission due to take office next year and is playing a welcome part in efforts launched by the Dutch to reduce secrecy in EU ministerial discussions. Credibility In its supervisory or watchdog role, the parliament can have a beneficial impact in promoting transparency, controlling EU bureaucracies and curbing over-spending, including that linked to fraud. But these efforts will command little credibility while evidence persists of parliament's own mismanagement. Responsibility for the wastefulness of the Brussels-Strasbourg Euroshuttle lies largely with the French government, which has constantly opposed siting the parliament in its logical home, the Belgian capital. Nonetheless, the parliament is partly to blame for the cost over-runs on its new building in Brussels and for the plan to create an expensive new chamber in Strasbourg. Independent inquiries into both affairs are urgently required. Among necessary procedural reforms, the parliament must widen timely dissemination of its often valuable committee work. It must also try to ensure a more cohesive framework for its debates and for the ensuing votes. Possible moves to crack down on absenteeism might include suspension or expulsion of MEPs. Equally, given its influence over EU legislation, the parliament needs firmer rules for disclosure of members' links with outside companies. To reinforce the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions, it is healthy that the parliament is acquiring and using extra muscle. But there is also a need to scrutinise the scrutineer. Only if it respects the principles of probity and openness in the conduct of EU affairs can the parliament hope to safeguard them. Without a better reputation, the parliament will fail to engage the interest and to win the trust of Europe's voters.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

0,FT943-1007 ,"FT943-1007 _AN-EI0DNAA3FT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / US warns Moscow on complacency      By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor      WASHINGTON   Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, yesterday urged Russia to quicken economic reform while simultaneously taking additional steps to control inflation. Speaking in advance of today's summit between presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, he said: 'Russia's progress has been better than most people expected, but the danger now is that complacency could lead to a severe setback.' Specifically, Mr Bentsen said that adoption of a tougher fiscal budget could release Dollars 8bn to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5bn to Pounds 6.3bn) in western assistance already promised at the G7 summits. Pegging the rouble on the foreign exchange markets 'would bolster market confidence by delivering an effective Dollars 6bn currency stabilisation fund'. 'Let me be clear,' he went on, 'our support policy has been successful because our lending is conditional. For Russia to get all this money I've mentioned, it needs a bold economic reform programme.' Mr Bentsen was complimentary about Russia's political and economic achievements. He noted that inflation was down to about 5 per cent a month from more than 20 per cent a month last year; that real interest rates were now positive, real incomes rising, not declining; and that 50 per cent of gross domestic product was now in privatised hands. But Russia, he went on, 'must finish the privatisation job and not get stuck half-way'. More companies needed to be sold and more land released from state control. 'In the long run our relationship must be based on trade and investment, not aid,' Mr Bentsen maintained. US assistance approved by Congress is due to fall next year to Dollars 850m from the Dollars 2.5bn of 1993-94. The Clinton administration is broadly satisfied with the present state of relations with Russia, although nervous about political developments over which US influence is marginal at best. Rifts with Moscow over the former Yugoslavia have been carefully avoided so far, through strong Russian involvement in the Bosnian 'contact group'. The US worked hard to help resolve the difficult issue of the status of Russian military and civilians still in the Baltics, and has tacitly acknowledged Russian hegemony over some former Soviet satellite states, such as Georgia. At the same time, Nato's 'partnership for peace' programme has seen the first joint exercises between Russian and western forces. Last week President Clinton ruled out further reductions in the US nuclear arsenal until cuts already agreed with Russia had been implemented, but the US is likely to remain open to further Russian initiatives. But, as Mr Bentsen's speech was designed to make clear, the greatest positive contribution the US believes can be made to Russian domestic stability is greater integration with western economies. 'The present situation in Russia worries me,' he said, 'and I can't tell you how this will turn out. But I do know that to avoid slipping backward, Russia must take a bold step forward.'

0,FT941-6117 ,"FT941-6117 _AN-ECCCVACVFT 940303   FT  03 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: 'We cannot continue like this' - Cost of the rulebook      By DAVID LASCELLES   Increasingly, Europe is becoming aware of the costs of high environmental standards. The question is whether it can afford them. At Porto Marghera, in the Venetian lagoon, Mr Lucio Pisani is the director of Italy's largest petrochemical plant, owned by the state company Enichem. The plant has already been forced to cut back its operations because of losses caused by foreign competition, and now the environmental pressures are mounting, not least because of the proximity of one of Europe's most beautiful cities. There have even been demands that the Enichem plant be split up or removed, which has enraged local businesses and alarmed the workforce, already battered by thousands of lost jobs. 'The problems of the lagoon are not chemicals,' Mr Pisani says. 'The water we put back in the lagoon is better than that which we take out.' Since 1991, his company has spent L125bn (Dollars 74m) on clean-ups, a huge sum which Mr Pisani uses to justify the company's continued operation there. 'To those who suggest fragmentation of the site, I say we have the critical mass. That's the reason we can afford all these environmental improvements.' In this he is backed by his workers. 'Environmental costs don't add to others. They improve the efficiency and quality of the process,' says Livio Marini of the leftwing CGIL labour union. This view gets an echo in Sweden where Mr Sven Niberg of the Swedish Labour Organisation sees environmental pressures in positive terms. 'They have created jobs, for example in the engineering industry which has increased production of clean equipment,' he says. But generally, industrialists worry about the cost and competitiveness implications of the environment. Europe's petrol retailing industry is doing battle with the Brussels Commission over a plan to oblige garages to recover vapours which escape from the pump when people fill their vehicles. The Commission wants stations to install devices which suck in the vapours and return them to the storage tank - a small but nonetheless costly move. 'Any analysis of the costs and benefits of this proposal produces very disappointing results,' says Mr Aurelio Ayala-Thomas, head of the Spanish petrol retailing industry's trade group. 'It entails a lot of investment for a tiny return in environmental terms. These emissions account for only 2 per cent of total emissions of volatile hydrocarbons.' Like many EU businessmen, Mr Ayala-Thomas is urging a more balanced approach. He thinks dealing with industrial waste is a more pressing priority. One man who has experienced the bitter costs of environmental clean-ups in an extreme form is Mr Dietmar Hayn. He is mayor of Molbis, a little community in the heart of the brown coal mining region south of Leipzig. Molbis was once dubbed the 'filthiest village in Europe' because of the neighbouring Espenhain lignite liquification plant which was run flat out by the East Germans. The plant has now been closed down, and Molbis is being restored. But employment has fallen from 6,000 to only 1,000. Mr Hayn is hoping to attract in new industries - including factories which make environmental control equipment. In Leipzig, Mr Arnold Vaatz, the Saxony environment minister, talks of 'jobs versus the environment'. Coal miners in his region recently demonstrated to persuade a Potsdam power station to burn lignite rather than natural gas, despite the environmental consequences. But though Mr Vaatz wants to clean up Saxony, he is acutely aware of the price. Hourly production costs in his former Communist-run territory are already 10 times higher than in neighbouring Poland and 100 times higher than in Russia. Yet he still has to conform to EU water standards, for example, which he estimates will cost DM43bn for a population of only 4.6m. Up in Finland, the heavily export-oriented forestry and paper industry is finding that the environment can entail two quite different types of cost. One is the bill for cleaning up its factory operations. The other is for adapting its manufacturing processes to produce products which meet the environmental standards of its foreign customers. For example, Finnish paper companies now try to make paper which uses less bleach and contains more recycled paper. Mr Pertti Salolainen, Finland's foreign trade minister, confesses to deep scepticism about Europe's future - in large part because of the costs it is loading upon itself. 'In the Far East, they are now producing products at prices which are equal just to our raw materials. We can't continue like this.' Even though Finland's jobless rate is already 20 per cent he warns: 'There is more unemployment on the way.' Mr Salolainen does not believe that the answer lies in compromising on environmental standards because he thinks they are less to blame than unrealistically high wages. But he does believe that Europe should hasten to reach international agreement on standards so that they do not get whittled down by competition among countries keen to reduce their costs.

0,FT942-841 ,"FT942-841 _AN-EF0DGABGFT 940627   FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Benchmark is set by clear winners in product groups - Paul Taylor takes a look at some of the results by sector      By PAUL TAYLOR   When Europe's senior executives were asked to nominate the most respected companies in their industries on the basis of seven measures of business performance, clear winners emerged in most business sectors. As a result the first Financial Times/Price Waterhouse survey should provide a valuable tool for corporate executives and others wishing to benchmark their companies against the best in Europe. This is a summary of the some of the results by sector: Automobiles/Auto Trucks  Parts Bayerische Motoren Werke, the German carmaker came top in this sector which had a particularly high response rate. BMW was followed by Robert Bosch, the German components manufacturer, and then Peugeot Citroen, the French motor group. Banks Although Deutsche Bank no longer ranks as Europe's biggest bank - that title is now held by HSBC following its takeover of Midland Bank - the German bank emerged well ahead of its rivals in a large sector. HSBC ranked fifth equal with Germany's BHF-Bank, behind UBS, Lloyds Bank and Spain's Banco de Santander. Beverages  Tobacco In this sector the only two non-British contenders, LVMH Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, the French luxury goods group, and Heineken, the Dutch brewer which has a substantial international reach, topped the rankings. However, Guinness and Whitbread were well placed and Grand Met scored well. Chemical, Paper  Packaging Ciba-Geigy, of Switzerland, which also has substantial pharmaceuticals interests, took first place in this sector even though L'Air Liquide, the world's biggest industrial gases group, made it into the top 25 list. Ciba did well mostly because of its customer focus, products and financial performance. However, unlike many other sectors, votes were very evenly spread across the industry. L'Air Liquide came second, followed closely by ICI, of the UK, Akzo, of the Netherlands, and Rhone Poulenc, the French chemicals group. Construction, Homebuilding  Building materials German and British companies shared the top honours in this sector. Philipp Holzmann emerged with most votes by a clear majority, followed by Britain's RMC Group, the world's biggest concrete producer, and Pilkington, the UK glassmaker. Dykerhoff, the German cement group which recently acquired a 50.05 per cent stake in Ciments Luxembourgeois, and Wolseley, the UK-based heating and plumbing merchant, also made it into the sector top five. Diversified Holding Companies This was one of the most difficult categories to rank because of the wide range of business activities covered. Nevertheless BTR, the British industrial conglomerate, emerged as clear winner, closely followed by UK-based Rentokil and Hanson. Chargeurs, the French textiles, transport and communications group, and Pinault, which owns the Printemps stores also made the top five. Electricity  Water Germany's largest utility group, RWE, led the electricity and water field, closely followed by Britain's Powergen and then Belgium's Electrabel, National Grid and Sweden's Vattenfall utility. Electronics  Electrical Components Siemens came top by a wide margin, followed by Alcatel-Alsthom, of France, Finland's Nokia, Sweden's Electrolux, Britain's GEC and then Philips of the Netherlands. Engineering Although ABB Asea Brown Boveri dominated this sector, Britain's Rolls-Royce and Linde, the German lift truck maker also rated highly. The top three were followed by Sandvik of Sweden and Williams Holdings of the UK. Food Processors Unilever and Switzerland's Nestle group headed this sector. They ranked fifth and sixth in the overall winners group. They were followed by BSN, the French-based multinational food group, Barilla, Italy's family owned pasta and biscuit group, was ranked number four in the sector. Insurance Germany's Munchener Ruckversicherungs group won the most praise in this category followed by Fortis, the Dutch/Belgium group, Swiss Reinsurance, Zurich Insurance and Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance company. Media, Printing  Advertising Reuters Holdings, the new and financial information group, stood head-and-shoulders above its rivals in this category receiving as many commendations as the next five companies put together. Reed-Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, came second, followed by the German Bertelsmann media group, Britain's EMAP and Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publishing group. Pharmaceuticals  Healthcare Switzerland's Roche claimed the top slot in this sector. Surprisingly however, Roche did not figure in the 25 overall winners. Glaxo, made it into the top 25. But in the sector it ranked third behind its arch ulcer drug competitor Sweden's Astra. SmithKline Beecham ranked fourth. Retail British companies, J Sainsbury and John Lewis took second and third places respectively after Marks  Spencer.

AFRICA INVESTMENT BAN;    COMMUNITY: THE LEADERS ALSO TAKE GIANT STRIDES TOWARD POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC  UNITY.      By JOEL HAVEMANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ROME      Europe's leaders took giant strides toward political as well as economic unity  Saturday and, as if to underscore their determination, jointly lifted a ban on  investment in South Africa, demanded Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and provided  $1 billion in food aid to the Soviet Union.    The heads of the 12 European Community nations struck only one sour note, on  international trade. Although they approved a resolution calling for  resurrecting the negotiations that broke down last week, several of them  individually blamed the United States for the deadlock and insisted that  America make the next move.    Otherwise, the leaders set in motion a process designed ultimately to enable  their nations to speak with one voice on foreign policy and to blend their  individual economies into what could become the most potent economic force in  the world.    Disagreements remained on how to move toward a common currency for all 12 EC  nations. And the leaders stepped gingerly around the highly charged question of  whether they should somehow combine their military forces.    Yet for a continent divided by two world wars in the first half of the century,  the progress seemed extraordinary. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose embrace  of European unity has allayed fears that the newly reunited Germany would seek  to dominate the Continent, said Saturday's actions inaugurated ""a decisive  phase for European union, one of the great dreams of our century.""    South African policy served to demonstrate Europe's desire to stand together on  controversies of global scope. In recognition of ""the movement under way aimed  at the complete abolition of apartheid,"" the 12 European leaders lifted a  four-year-old ban on European investment in South Africa.    Pending further reforms, the EC maintained other economic sanctions, including  an embargo of arms sales to South Africa and a boycott of South African steel  and gold.    As the European leaders acknowledged, South African President Frederik W. de  Klerk has reversed the racial policies of some of his predecessors and freed  anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress,  who had been imprisoned for 27 years.    Yet the ANC quickly condemned Europe's lifting of the investment ban as  premature. Spokeswoman Gil Marcus, charging that white-led security forces are  still killing ANC members, demanded: ""How many lives do you want it still to  cost?""    On the more abstract question of whether Europe should conduct a forced march  toward political and economic union, only British Prime Minister John Major  refrained from a wholehearted commitment. But his mild and measured tone, in  stark contrast to the sarcasm that his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher,  displayed at the last such meeting in October, encouraged the European  Community's other 11 heads of government.    In a phrase that Thatcher would never have used, Major declared it ""perfectly  legitimate"" for the 12 EC nations to press toward unity even though  disagreements remain.    ""We have a menu,"" Major said. ""Our favorite dishes are on that menu, so are  others' favorite dishes, but the Community has not yet determined what orders  to place.""    Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, the host of the two days of meetings  that ended Saturday, replied at a separate press conference: ""The important  thing is that all 12 guests have sat down to table.""    Both were discussing the prospect of political union. Among the relatively easy  issues for a committee of European officials to thrash out are whether to  establish ""European citizenship"" and how a central European government should  deal with environmental, energy and health policy.    The committee will also tackle the more sensitive questions of a common foreign  and security policy. The European heads of government acknowledged the  difficulty of putting a single umbrella over the military policies of nations  as diverse as France, which has long insisted on maintaining its own nuclear  force, and Ireland, which is neutral and not a member of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization.    Major, despite his disarming style, emphasized that the plan for political  union would require the unanimous consent of the 12 countries.    Yet Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis, for one, was optimistic. ""A  few weeks ago,"" he said, ""it appeared impossible for defense policy even to be  mentioned.""    The committee on political union is to finish its work by next fall, to give  the 12 national parliaments time to adopt its product by the end of 1992.    A similar timetable faces a separate committee on economic and monetary union.  At their last conference in October, 11 of the heads of government decided to  march toward a common currency, with Thatcher the odd leader out.    Major served notice that he too objected, on grounds that to adopt a common  currency would be to leap into the unknown. He promised to prepare by early  next month his own, more modest plan for economic union, including a common  currency only if money markets demonstrated they preferred that to today's 12  national currencies.    Italian Finance Minister Guido Carli, criticizing Major's approach to what he  called an essentially political issue, said, ""This matter cannot be left  entirely to market forces.""    The 12 leaders found themselves split over one pressing issue of current  economic policy.    In the wake of last week's collapse of international trade talks over American  demands that Europe dismantle its costly farm subsidy system, the 12 managed to  approve language in support of negotiating ""a balanced political signal that we  actually want and expect those talks to succeed.""    Other signals from Rome were not so clear. Even though his election was two  weeks behind him, German Chancellor Kohl showed no sign of abandoning German  farmers, who vehemently oppose cuts in farm subsidies.    ""I cannot at all accept the idea that Germany should untie the . . . knot,""  Kohl said. ""Everyone will have to help find a solution.""    Spanish and Portuguese leaders struck similar themes. And Jacques Delors,  president of the European Commission, the EC's executive branch, castigated the  Americans for meddling in Europe's efforts to preserve its rural countryside.    ""American negotiators must stop insulting us around the world and isolating us.  . . ,"" he declared. ""They asked for too much too soon. They are mainly  responsible for the failure.""    On many of the other major issues of the day, the 12 European leaders had  little difficulty reaching unanimity.    On the Persian Gulf crisis, they expressed ""relief"" at Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein's decision to release all foreign hostages but emphasized their ""deep  concern at Iraq's failure to withdraw, at its oppressive and inhuman occupation  of Kuwait and its attempt to destroy the fabric of the country.""    Expressing support for ""a dialogue of the sort President Bush has offered,""  they also expressed their own interest in a meeting between Andreotti and Iraqi  Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz. Shortly afterwards, Iraq canceled Aziz's scheduled  meeting with Bush on Monday.    In a conscious effort not to link Iraq's invasion of Kuwait to the longstanding  Arab-Israeli conflict, the 12 European leaders issued a separate declaration  condemning recent Israeli reprisals against Palestinians. In a split with the  United States, they said they would support a Mideast peace conference under  U.N. sponsorship.    The $1 billion in food for the Soviet Union, which the 12 European leaders had  tentatively approved Friday, is to be divided into one part gifts and two parts  loan guarantees. To improve the Soviets' primitive and corrupt food  distribution system, the EC promised about $550 million in technical assistance  next year and an undetermined sum in 1992.

0,FT931-9172 ,"FT931-9172 _AN-DBPBVABLFT 930216   FT  16 FEB 93 / Asbestos removal 'risky and a waste of money'      By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor   RIPPING asbestos out of schools and other public buildings is usually a waste of money and can increase the risk to the public, a leading specialist on asbestos-related disease warned yesterday. Professor Julian Peto of the Institute of Cancer Research in London said that asbestos exposure constituted a minor risk to the general public. He said: 'The last 20 years have witnessed an extraordinary shift, from neglect of a major industrial hazard to irrational exaggeration of a negligible environmental pollutant.' Prof Peto's comments will encourage those public health officials who maintain that the best course of action - when asbestos is discovered in a building or public place - is to paint over it and leave well alone. Removing the material can liberate needle-shaped asbestos particles that cause cancer if they get into the lungs. The Health and Safety Executive - the public body responsible for protecting workers from asbestos exposure - welcomed Prof Peto's remarks. 'We agree with him,' said Dr Trevor Ogden of the executive. 'Asbestos materials that are sound, undamaged and not releasing dust should not be disturbed.' About 9,000 cases a year of asbestos removal are notified to the executive ranging in scale from removing lagging from a pipe to dismantling a large factory. The Asbestos Removal Contractors' Association said 200 to 300 companies work actively to remove the material in the UK, although 1,000 are licensed to do so. 'I'm not going to argue with Julian Peto,' said a representative of the contractors' association. 'There's no legislation which would force a building owner to have the asbestos removed.' There is no accurate estimate of total UK spending on asbestos removal, although it probably exceeds Pounds 100m a year. Even a single case - such as stripping the material from Linlithgow Academy near Edinburgh - can cost more than Pounds 5m. Asbestos is responsible for more occupational cancers than any other agent - almost 1,000 deaths from mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the lungs) and more than 2,000 deaths from lung cancer each year in the UK.

This assessment came in spite of President  Clinton's assurance to his nation that Iraq's nuclear weapons  programme is ""out of business"" and Baghdad's official commitment  to put its entire weapons programme including its nuclear  capabilities, if any, under long-term international supervision.    Why then Washington still clings to its conviction that Iraq  continues to covet nuclear and other mass destruction arsenal  and therefore must be denied any relaxing of the punitive  measures is something that goes beyond reasonable comprehension.  State behaviour cannot be judged on metaphysical basis but  rather on hard evidence unless of course there is no intention  whatsoever to treat the Arab Gulf country differently no matter  how far it goes to meet its obligations under U.N. Security  Council resolutions. Since Iraq's mass destruction capabilities  are for all intents and purposes ""out of business,"" and will be  monitored for as long as one can see, one fails to understand  how Washington or anybody else for that matter can rightly guess  the Iraqi intentions and find sinister plans in them.    The White House is also wrong in apportioning blame for the  suffering of the Iraqi masses as a result of the sanctions  solely on the Iraqi regime. Such a view is of little relief to  the greater majority of Iraqis who have not been able to find or  afford to buy basic medicines and food staples for over three  years now, given the fact that the regime in Baghdad is solidly  entrenched and has an effective grip on power, telling the  people that they have only their leadership to blame is of no  practical comfort. If pressure must continue to be applied  against the Iraqi regime under all circumstances there is a good  case for applying it in such a way as to minimise damage to the  innocent people. Such a distinction between ruler and ruled  could and should be made, and ways and means to give it effect  is obviously not beyond the ingenuity of the western nations  which still spearhead the hostile campaign against the country.    President Clinton was on stronger grounds when he called for  the introduction of pluralistic democracy to the country as a  condition for its full rehabilitation with the international  community. Baghdad has yet to make significant movement in the  direction of democracy and this is a source of alarm not only to  Washington but also to the entire region, not to mention its own  people. There is clearly no long-term solution to the problem  in that country as long as its people are denied democracy and  basic human rights. Meanwhile, however, no matter where the  responsibility lies, the Iraqi people themselves must enjoy the  right to feed themselves properly and find the necessary  medicines to treat the sick among them.

0,FT943-6186 ,"FT943-6186 _AN-EH4EGAB7FT 940831   FT  31 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Dam busters go into battle - Environmentalists are trying to encourage salmon back to rivers in the US      By VICTORIA GRIFFITH   Legend has it that 50 years ago, during the great salmon runs in the New England state of Maine, a fisherman could stand knee-deep in a river, hold a bucket and wait for the fish to jump in. These days, he would wait a long time. Migrating salmon are rare in New England, and the situation is not much better in the Pacific North-west. According to the National Wildlife Federation, an environmental group, migrating salmon populations in the Columbia and Snake rivers, for example, have been reduced to 5 per cent of previous levels. To maintain populations, the federation has adopted extreme measures such as capturing salmon, taking them upstream by road to spawn, then bringing the offspring back down the road again. Environmentalists place the blame for the reduced stocks on dams, which block the passage of the fish. 'We have a Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) programme in place to restore salmon fishing to at least sport fishing levels over the next few years, and that effort is being seriously hampered by dams,' says David Conrad, water resources specialist for the federation. Concern over the environmental impact of dams is growing in the US, and opponents have already won an important victory. Two dams on the Elwah river in Washington state are about to become the first in the US to be pulled down for environmental reasons. Opposition is also building in other parts of the country. In Maine, environmentalists are pressing the federal government not to re-license the Edwards dam on the Kennebec River. In Michigan, environmentalists are pushing at least two hydro-electric dams to be decommissioned. In the 1960s and 1970s, ecologists promoted hydro-electric power as a clean energy source that could save the earth from the ravages of coal and oil-based electricity. In response, thousands of dams were erected around the country. Environmentalists find the campaign to reverse the impact of hydro-electric dams no easy task. 'The Elwah dams took an act of Congress to decommission,' says Ronald Wilson, attorney with the Sierra Club Legal Defence Fund, set up by the Sierra Club environmental group. 'That can't happen every time we want a dam taken out. We're going to have to find other legal routes to getting dams decommissioned.' Environmentalists hope they can convince the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is in charge of dam licensing, to refuse permits on ecological grounds. As hydro-electric dams are destroyed, the government will have to find alternative sources of energy. 'We have to remember that hydro-electric is clean energy,' says Linda Church-Ciocci, executive director of the National Hydropower Association. 'If we use more of other forms of energy, we'll have a hard time meeting new emissions standards.' There are other obstacles to tearing down dams. One is cost. The dismantling of the Elwah river dams alone will cost Dollars 100m. Another barrier is the ecological chaos that can be caused by dismantling a dam. The mounds of silt and other deposits which build up behind dams could threaten the environment if it is all released at once. Normally, the river flow would flush the sediment downstream. Since the Elwah dams are likely to be looked on as a model of dam removal, the government must proceed with caution. To guard against disaster, engineers will probably use a combination of methods to control the release of sediment. Vegetation will be planted to keep some of the silt and sand in place. The old dam site may be dredged and gravel, which salmon need to lay their eggs, may be redeposited upstream. Environmentalists believe fish stocks will begin to recuperate within a few years on the Elwah. However, it may take 10 to 30 years for full restoration of populations. The sediment will probably take this time to redistribute and vegetation also needs time to grow. However many problems the removal of the Elwah dams presents, ecologists say they are nothing compared with the challenges other dams would pose. The Elwah is set within the Olympic National Park and the sediment deposited behind the dam is relatively pollution-free. Other sites, which operate downstream from manufacturing companies, hold years of toxic waste in mounds of sediment, which would wreak havoc if the dams were dismantled. Regulators are now trying to work with dam owners, who accept there is an environmental problem, to improve conditions for the wildlife. Temperatures fluctuate greatly around dams, as the water builds up before release. Temperature control devices improve the salmon's chances of survival as many fish die because the water is too hot or too cold. Also, screens on turbines help by preventing fish from being chopped up, and more fish ladders allow greater numbers of fish to pass through. It appears that the tide is turning on hydro-electric power. Hydro-electric supporters complain it is extremely difficult to obtain permission for new projects. Some 150 dams will see their licences expire over the next few years, and with public pressure mounting, the federal government is likely to consider environmental impact before renewing the licences. It may be some time before fishermen can fill their buckets with salmon again, but environmentalists are optimistic that in rivers where the dams are removed, the fish will start jumping.

0,FT922-8562 ,"FT922-8562 _AN-CEMBDAAGFT 920513   FT  13 MAY 92 / Machine tool industry holds EC crisis talks      By ANDREW BAXTER   LEADERS of Europe's recession-torn machine tool industry are holding crisis talks with the European Commission in an attempt to win agreement on the first EC-wide industrial policy for the sector. The initiative by the Dollars 19bn European sector reflects fears that the recession has seriously damaged the competitiveness of a strategically important industry. Output fell by 8-10 per cent last year, due to the near-total collapse of east European business and a sharp decline in the US and western European markets. The downturn has exposed the financial weakness of a fragmented industry of 1,500 producers, and raised questions about the survival of several leading companies. The talks are being spearheaded by Cecimo, the umbrella body for 12 European machine tool associations, which earlier this year submitted to the EC a document outlining the sector's plight and listing a raft of short- and medium-term measures. Cecimo wants an EC framework programme to revive manufacturing investment by Europe's mechanical engineering sector, through measures such as tax changes, faster depreciation, capital grants and lower interest rates. Financial and fiscal matters are still the responsibility of EC member states, but Cecimo is keen that individual countries can select from a range of initiatives which will not be blocked by the EC. Medium-term measures include better financial and fiscal incentives to carry out cross-border mergers, and improved access to EC research and development programmes for the industry's predominantly small and medium-sized companies. But the organisation also wants, as a priority, the creation of a 'European pool' for machine tool control systems, motors and drives to challenge the supremacy of Fanuc, the Japanese producer. Cecimo's approach to the EC has been encouraged by the Bangemann paper of November 1990 which laid out a new industrial policy strategy for the Community. The group is hoping for an EC communication on the mechanical engineering industry in the second half of this year, in which the problems of the machine tool industry would be addressed.

0,FT924-808 ,"FT924-808 _AN-CLVB1AB6FT 921222   FT  22 DEC 92 / The empire splits up: The fragmentation of Warsaw Pact countries is creating an unstable division of military might      By DAVID WHITE   Across central and eastern Europe, armed forces are being remodelled or created anew. In place of a monolithic system, a new military map is in the making, fragmented, unstructured and disparate. Since the winding-up last year of the Warsaw Pact and then the Soviet Union itself, a pattern of new regional powers and spheres of influence has begun to emerge. In its closing months, after the loss of East Germany in 1989, the Warsaw Pact had six members. In the new year, when the Czech and Slovak republics split, the six will have become 21 countries, all either possessing their own armies, or forming them, or planning to form them, with differing degrees of civilian control and varying levels of clarity about doctrines or aims. Old grievances and suspicions are returning in a region where borders affecting large swathes of territory and ethnic groups have changed within living memory. Nationalism is resurgent. Tensions and clashes of interest are inevitable. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) counts some 30 current territorial disputes in the Caucasus region alone, arising from frontier changes in the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s. On the fringes of the former Soviet Union, war has already struck Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan. The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia have revealed the inability of present European security structures and mechanisms to tackle crises of this sort. Military authorities in central and eastern Europe all now profess democratic principles, but they are largely survivors from the old system. For 36 years their armies acted as an extension of the Soviet command, with standardised military doctrines and equipment. Today's reform-oriented general staff officers come from a background of allegiance to the party and to the dominant ally. Reform of army structures is going on while remnants of a Soviet troop presence remain in Germany and Poland as well as various former Soviet republics, and while part of Moscow's long-range nuclear arsenal lies stranded in three republics outside Russia. Military spending among Moscow's former allies has been dropping for several years, although according to SIPRI the process slowed down in 1991. Throughout the region cuts have begun under the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, which demands the destruction of large numbers of heavy weapons, aircraft and helicopters. But the treaty, agreed between the Warsaw Pact and the Nato nations two years ago, was designed to balance two blocs, not to secure stability within either group of countries. There are enormous disparities. Belarus, finding itself unexpectedly independent, currently has twice as many tanks as Britain, more big guns than France, more combat aircraft than Germany. In Ukraine, there are reckoned to be about 700,000 troops, including forces withdrawn by Moscow from Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Under agreed manpower ceilings, these are due to be reduced to 450,000 in 1995. The official aim is a strength of 250,000 - roughly equivalent to the UK's - at the end of the decade. Most have signed oaths of allegiance to Ukraine. Experts say some 10,000 officers have refused and are due to leave. But there may be up to 200,000 Ukrainian officers currently serving in other republics and eligible to return. Ukraine now has more tanks, armoured vehicles and combat aircraft than any other country in Europe after Russia. Even under the CFE cuts its entitlements for tanks and armoured vehicles are Europe's third largest, and for artillery and aircraft the second largest, dwarfing those of its neighbours to the west. With seven national borders and a Black Sea coast, Ukraine holds a pivotal position in the region. The greatest source of international concern is its ambiguity over the nuclear weapons on its soil: 176 SS-19 and SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles and two bases with nuclear-armed Bear and Blackjack bombers. The country's leaders have promised to become non-nuclear by the end of 1994. But Ukraine has yet to ratify the Start treaty with the US on reducing strategic arsenals, as Russia and Kazakhstan have. Unlike Belarus it has refused to accept full Russian control over the weapons. In the spring, it stalled over the transfer of short-range nuclear arms for destruction in Russia. Its aim now appears to be to win the financial assistance it failed to obtain then. The US has already offered it Dollars 175m to help dismantle the strategic arsenal and store the materials, on condition that Kiev joins the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. 'It is largely a bargaining chip, but we can't be sure,' says Dr Mark Smith, who heads research on the former Soviet Union at the Royal United Services Institute in London. Ukraine does not have operational control over the weapons, nor the command system it would require. But experts believe it could overcome these hurdles. Under the Soviet system, the most advanced stages of nuclear weapon production were kept in Russia, but Ukraine could undoubtedly develop an indigenous capability. Nato officials are worried that President Leonid Kravchuk may be attracted to the idea of a place in the family of nuclear-weapon states. Some parliamentarians have spoken of the desirability of a small nuclear deterrent. 'Why should they give it away, if they distrust the Russians?' asks Mr Henry Plater-Zyberk, a military expert at the University of Surrey. Uncertainty also surrounds the future of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet. Agreement was reached in August on a temporary joint Russian-Ukrainian command, putting off the division of the fleet for three years. But there have been hints that Ukraine may want to extend its naval presence beyond its coastal waters and possibly into the Mediterranean. The European countries that have emerged from Moscow's domination have all, except for Belarus, clearly turned their backs to Russia. Since the Warsaw Pact's demise in April, 1991, a queue of potential applicants has built up at Nato's door. However, officials at the organisation's headquarters in Brussels complain that the central and eastern European countries have 'exaggerated expectations of what Nato can do'. The North Atlantic Co-operation Council, set up by Nato as a forum for these countries, also embraces the former Soviet Union's central Asian republics, with which they have few interests in common and which still have ties with Russia. Nato, created for stability in Europe, has yet to work out what its function is in that part of the continent which used to be in Moscow's dominion. Mr Dick Cheney, the outgoing US defence secretary, recently issued a personal warning to Nato colleagues: 'An organisation devoted to security that does not address these concerns is not going to survive long-term.' Nato should ultimately agree to admit 'at least some of these nations', he said. But Nato allies are reluctant to provide security guarantees over territory reaching to the borders of the former Soviet Union. They are also anxious not to sideline Russia. In the Baltics, Nato has been trying to dampen fears about Russian aggression and about the concentration of Russian forces in the Kaliningrad enclave between Lithuania and Poland. This area contains as many as 400,000 troops, officials say, including units being withdrawn from Germany and the independent Baltic republics. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are creating new armies - still tiny with hardly any equipment. They are the only three countries building up their military from scratch. Elsewhere the greatest advances in ideas for reform and restructuring have been made in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the members of the Visegrad group formed last year. All want to redeploy forces concentrated near their western borders. But in the case of air forces this means building new airfields. The problem is at its most acute in the division now being undertaken between Czech and Slovak forces. Military strength, including air defence, has been concentrated in western Bohemia, although the defence industry is mostly in Slovakia. Equipment in these countries lagged behind that of Soviet forces. But modernising is difficult, with Nato not yet ready to supply arms and traditional suppliers demanding payment in hard currency. Hungary, which has had fighters on alert since a cluster bomb fell on a border village in October last year in a spillover from the fighting in former Yugoslavia, has obtained aircraft identification equipment from the US, the first such supplies to a former Warsaw Pact country. It is also getting spares from the former East German army and recently agreed to take Dollars 800m worth of equipment from Russia as part of debt repayments. Most of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States - the fragile grouping of former Soviet republics other than the Baltics and Georgia - have founded their own national forces; Tajikistan plans to; Turkmenistan is the only one planning to share command with Russia. But if these countries want professional, western-style forces, how are they going to afford them? Their ministries frequently cannot even afford the fares to take part in seminars with Nato members. Implementing the CFE cuts is an awesome problem for all central and eastern European countries. Cutting up tanks is expensive and environmentally hazardous. It is unclear how Russia and Ukraine, in particular, will face up to the force reductions required, with large-scale military unemployment adding to the effects of economic upheaval. The deterioration of morale and discipline in the Russian military is already notorious. Officers are disoriented, some bitterly resentful of the way arms control has been handled. Most of the Russian forces are now regarded by Nato as being in poor condition. Cuts promised for the end of the decade include a 45 per cent reduction in current troop numbers. But even then, Russia will still have an army of 1.5m, backed by 3,000 long-range nuclear weapons, the accoutrements of a superpower. When a Nato military official declares that 'none of us is afraid of the Russians any more', he is speaking for stable, secure western Europe and not for the countries that have emerged from the Warsaw Pact.

The ruling in New Jersey could reduce losses faced by hundreds of Names  - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the Lloyd's insurance market. The decision on Tuesday came in a case involving Diamond Shamrock, a US company which produced herbicides and other chemicals. Potential insurance claims from pollution in the US represent a heavy liability for the London insurance market in general as well as Lloyd's. Mr John Robson of the Anton members' agency said: 'This is an important case for the industry. It's a powerful decision in a state which has not always been sympathetic to insurers.' Mr Robson considers the case to be as significant as the the case brought by Shell against its insurers over pollution at the Rocky Mountain arsenal site in Colorado. A lower court ruling in 1988 favoured insurers, but an appeal has been lodged against it. Insurers expect the appeal to be heard later this year. The latest case arose when Diamond Shamrock was ordered by the US Environmental Protection Agency to clean up dioxin pollution at a number of sites where it had formerly manufactured herbicides. In 1989 the company attempted to have the cost of cleaning one of its sites, at Newark, New Jersey, paid by its insurers. At the same time it sought to recover from insurers some Pounds 23m paid to a group of Vietnam war veterans who had won compensation for disability suffered through their exposure to Agent Orange, a defoliant also made by Diamond Shamrock. The company sued more than 100 companies - which have insured it since 1951, when dioxins were first manufactured at the plant - to recover clean-up costs of several hundred million dollars. Aetna Casualty and Surety led coverage, but much of the cost would be borne by re-insurers including HS Weavers, Dominion and Turegum Insurance as well as Lloyd's underwriters. At Lloyd's, syndicate 932 led a group of syndicates whose exposure totals around Dollars 100m (Pounds 581,000). Judge Reginald Stanton of the New Jersey superior court found at trial-court level in April 1989 that the insurers had no responsibility for site clean-ups, but were liable for the Agent Orange claims. Diamond Shamrock appealed, but on Tuesday the New Jersey appeals court found that insurers were liable neither for cleaning up the site nor for the Agent Orange claims.

The EC is being pressed by the US and Japan to dismantle the tariff. It is the only main industrial region that has kept tariffs on semiconductors. The US, Canada and Japan suspended theirs in 1985. The EC Commission has offered to cut the 14 per cent tariff on imports of integrated circuits by a third, to 9 per cent, in exchange for reciprocal lowering of trade barriers. Such a cut could sharply reduce competitiveness of the European industry and is unlikely to lead to lower prices. The declining trend in European manufacturers' own share of their market and low market prices of many chips in Europe have created a situation where dismantling the tariff overnight 'is likely to spell the death of the European semiconductor industry,' Mr Byron Harding, industry analyst at Dataquest, asserts. The EC, the US and Japan are discussing the issue in Gatt's Uruguay Round. Calls have come from within the US to reinstate the suspended 14 per cent tariff on chip imports if Europe fails to cut its tariff. EC chip users have been urging a cut in the tariff, which, they say, damages their competitiveness. The study indicates that despite the EC tariff on imports, prices of certain chips in Europe have been as low as, or at times lower, than prices in other main markets. This is because foreign makers are ready to sacrifice profit to revenue, to boost European market penetration, Mr Harding believes. * EC Semiconductor Tariffs and Related Issues.

0,FT934-331 ,"FT934-331 _AN-DL2BSAB7FT 931229   FT  29 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Europe's new monetary forum   At a season associated with the arrival of wise men, the establishment of a new institution to supervise European monetary arrangements might be heralded as a sign of hope. The European Monetary Institute is being formally set up on January 1 as part of the European Union's so-called 'second stage' of progress towards economic and monetary union. By concentrating on a few necessary tasks, firmly defined by governments and central banks, the EMI can improve the prospects for successful monetary integration. Conceived as an embryonic European central bank, the institute will have to lower its sights from the ideas that inspired its creation. An important priority will be to improve co-ordination within the present European Monetary System, which is a long way from carrying out its original and still badly needed function of providing a stable exchange rate environment for European business. In view of the EMS disturbances since autumn 1992, along with other setbacks to the Maastricht timetable for a single currency, the gestation period for the new monetary body has been highly problematic. Because of delays in deciding to place the institute in Germany, the EMI will not even be able to move to a permanent home in Frankfurt before the summer. In 1988-89, when plans for setting up the institute were first laid, the European Commission, backed by the French and Italian governments, wanted it to carry out some fully-fledged central banking operations. This idea has been watered down, above all because of opposition from the German Bundesbank. Monetary decision-making will remain the preserve of the EMI's 12 member central banks. French-backed proposals for the EMI to help manage currency reserves look unlikely to get off the ground. Harmonisation drive The task of Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the EMI's designated president, will thus be to assemble a staff of statisticians and economists, rather than to wield power. This does not mean that the EMI will not have a job to do. First, it will have to accomplish detailed technical work to prepare for the harmonisation of monetary statistics and money market instruments that forms an essential precondition for Emu. If the harmonisation drive leads to an increase in efficiency of different countries' monetary systems, then the benefits would extend beyond making Emu more viable. Second, the EMI can provide a forum for general debate on European monetary matters. Mr Lamfalussy sees the need to uphold the consensus on the desirability of Emu, but he also has the experience and independence to speak plainly about the hurdles that lie in its path. He will be helped in his task of nurturing public understanding of Europe's unhealthily secretive central banking system, if the EMI is required to publish detailed minutes of its monthly meetings of central bank governors. Vital arbiter Third, in a less high-profile role, the EMI president can function as an arbiter, providing advice and assistance to member countries. The misunderstandings and mismanagement evident during the monetary system flare-ups in September 1992 and July-August 1993 could have been lessened had an intermediary been on hand to adjudicate between countries pursuing different monetary priorities, or even to ensure that rival positions were clearly communicated and understood. After the upsets of the past 17 months, it seems still more likely than before that Emu, if it takes place at all, will be reached first by a relatively small group of countries willing to combine a lasting political commitment to Emu with a readiness to gear their monetary policies to Germany's. If monetary convergence stops short of Emu, the task of managing that process will require expertise and sensitivity of the highest order. Creating a new institute will not, by itself, solve Europe's monetary problems. But if it can successfully combine the roles of trouble-shooter and think-tank, the EMI will have a good chance of bringing Europe closer to objectives that individual central banks are incapable of fulfilling. It is a welcome addition to the institutional landscape of the European Union.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.   Industries:-  P6011 Federal Reserve Banks.

Mr Craig Kotze, a police spokesman, said more than 1,000 police and an undisclosed number of soldiers threw a cordon around the south-coast Transkei homeland. 'We have to stop attacks on civilians by APLA (Azanian People's Liberation Army) members from Transkei,' he said. APLA is the military wing of the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), one of 26 groups scheduled to meet the government in Johannesburg today and tomorrow for the first substantive democracy talks in more than 10 months. A PAC spokesman said APLA would continue its armed struggle. The government has accused Transkei of harbouring APLA guerrillas, which it blames for a series of recent attacks on whites. Mr Romero Daniels, APLA political commissar, denied the group was attacking white civilians but said it regarded police and security forces as legitimate targets. Major-General Bantu Holomisa, the Transkei's military ruler who has accused white military and political chiefs of planning coups and assassinations against homeland leaders, said he would meet President F W de Klerk today to discuss the crisis. Government and ANC officials expected a stormy start to the second attempt for a political settlement but added that both sides were committed to success. 'We cannot afford to have these talks break down. We have to go for broke this time,' said one government official. Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, conservative leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, was expected to make a strong pitch for an immediate commitment to federalism. The PAC and Mr Nelson Mandela's ANC said control of the army would top the agenda at the opening session. Government officials said they wanted to talk first about violence, including the murder of 10 whites, two of them children, since December and dismantling guerrilla armies. The peace process stalled last May in a dispute about regional powers and the state's role in black township violence.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

This former military camp, where a handful of specialists  and  soldiers remain, is still kept in ideal order. There is no  spitting or discarding of cigarette butts here. Everything is  spotlessly clean. And yet the camp is not so small. It is  located in the depths of the border zone, covering 40 hectares  of a beautiful pine forest. There are five apartment blocks of  100 apartments each on its territory, along with a kindergarten,  school, barracks, large hospital, club, gymnasium, and stadium.  Add to this a superb garage and filling station and a powerful  boilerhouse and generator hall with two marine diesel generators  each producing one megawatt, and you will have some idea of the  site, whose existence used to be a strict military secret.    Its main asset is its unique 32-meter antenna. All around  the world such giant installations can be counted on the fingers  of one hand. This 1,000-tonne structure designed for space  communications is one of the most precise and complex of modern  instruments. It is around this antenna that the fuss has now  developed.    Owing to the hasty Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia our  country is nursing colossal losses. There are many  installations on this Baltic republic's territory which cost  astronomical amounts of money to build and are now having to be  abandoned. In particular, Latvia has inherited 26 former  military airfields with ideal concrete runways (four of them are  the best in Europe) capable of handling all types of aircraft,  including the heaviest transports. Latvia is simply unable to  digest everything it has inherited. Real estate, even if left  unmonitored for a short period of time, becomes easy prey for  looters. There are now whole gangs of them in the republic who  rob abandoned military installations. For instance, immediately  after one flying unit was withdrawn and redeployed to the east,  the robbers descended on the deserted airfield. When, a couple  of days later, representatives of the local authorities arrived  here, they saw a picture that is now typical of Latvia -- stores  were opened and sealed premises broken into. The raiders took  everything they could find, including doors and window frames.    Obviously, the same fate would be in store for the Ventspils  installation. But, fortunately for it, events have begun to  develop to quite a different scenario.    When equipment was removed and the question of dismantling  the antenna arose, the military consulted its developer --  Professor Boris Alekseyevich Poperechenko, chief designer at the  Moscow Power Institute. He flew in and satisfied himself that  dismantling the dish would be impossible. Did that mean it had  to be blown up? No, the chief designer could not tolerate the  idea of destroying his brainchild, which was the embodiment of  state-of-the-art Russian technology. He suggested a different  option.    That was how the news of this unique installation reached  the Russian Academy of Sciences. And the leaders of the Applied  Astronomy Institute proposed using it for absolutely peaceful  purposes.    The fact is that this antenna is a superb radio telescope.  The Russian Academy of Sciences' scientific organizations had  never dreamed of such modern equipment. The largest telescope  our radio astronomers have available to them is the 22-meter  dish in Serpukhov. Consequently, when they need to do serious  space research, they are forced to appeal to the military and to  lease free time on their dishes. Understandably, in this  situation you can only ever do one-time experiments, rather than  systematic observations.    There was one other reason why it was important for the  Russian Academy of Sciences to get its hands on the Ventspils  installation. For eight years now the Applied Astronomy  Institute has been implementing under a government decree the  ""Quasar"" project -- a national Russian system of radio  interferometers to be based on six 32-meter dishes located over  a huge area from Leningrad Oblast to Kamchatka and from Murmansk  to the North Caucasus. The greater the distance between the  dishes, the more accurately the coordinates of stars and quasars  can be determined and the more reliable the research results  will be.    Project ""Quasar"" will also make it possible to resolve  purely  applied tasks connected with precision cartography, geodesy, the  study of the country's natural resources, and so forth. But the  construction of each of its six centers will require billions in  expenditure and take a long time -- building a counterpart of  the Ventspils dish will take up to 10 years. That is why the  scientists are so interested in using it for the needs of  fundamental and applied science.    This sensible and noble idea has met with a response from  virtually everyone. After visiting Riga in late April a  government delegation from Moscow signed a protocol envisaging  joint work between scientists from the two academies of  sciences, and a fundamental decision was reached to set up a  Latvian-Russian radio astronmy center. It only remains to sign  the already prepared draft intergovernmental agreement, but....    ""Initially we could not understand what was going on in  Latvia,"" Andrey Finkelshteyn, deputy leader of the Russian  Government delegation and director of the Applied Astronomy  Institute, said. ""All the necessary permits and signatures had  seemingly been collected, the idea had been approved in  government circles, and -- nothing happened. Then we realized  that the Latvian Government is in a more difficult position than  our own: Every step it takes is monitored by the opposition, if  it took one step out of line it would be destroyed.  Consequently, the republic's leaders are afraid that during the  debate in the Saeima somebody will state that it is not Russian  scientists who want to come to the Ventspils site, but disguised  intelligence operatives; that the government has struck a deal  with the Moscow generals.... And another scandal would break.    It was in order to calm things down and reassure the Latvian  public that such fears are groundless, that the sensational  ""open-door"" event was held near Ventspils Monday.     "

Last year it made Pounds 23m. This year it is in loss. Shell is the world's biggest petrochemicals producer, and the rest of the industry is suffering along with it. The sector is used to cycles of boom and bust, but this time the damage may be more lasting. The immediate cause of the industry's plight is familiar. Petrochemicals manufacturers - which transform oil and gas into chemicals used principally to make plastics - are reeling under the twin burdens of recession and overcapacity. This last happened a decade ago, when losses were much heavier than any sustained before. But a new threat has emerged. Capacity planned or installed by Asian manufacturers between 1988 and 1995 is equal to more than half of Europe's total production. This expansion threatens an imbalance of world supply and demand, weakening prices and margins possibly until the end of the decade. The question is whether this leaves Europe with a long-term future in petrochemicals manufacture. This same question arose in the early 1980s when overcapacity and recession sent the industry into loss. But an extraordinary surge in demand near the end of the decade enabled the industry to recover. The final reckoning, however, may simply have been postponed. In the late 1980s, petrochemicals producers were generating profits verging on the 'pornographic', according to Mr Bob Lee, director of marketing of light hydrocarbons at Dow Europe, the subsidiary of the US chemical giant. The industry reacted by reducing bottlenecks in existing plants in an effort to expand production, sometimes by as much as 20 per cent. Europe's output of ethylene - the basic building block of the petrochemicals industry - grew from 16m tonnes in 1990 to 18m in 1992. Now, Mr Lee says: 'No one is making money in European petrochemicals.' Prices and margins have been driven to an untenable low, according to Mr Roger Longley, a director at Chem Systems, the consultants. 'Return on investment - presently at minus 2 per cent - looks foul,' he says. The collapse in profitability is only partly the result of weak demand. European demand for ethylene actually rose by about 7 per cent between 1990 and 1992, partly the result of increased demand for plastics from the automobile and building industries. But this rise was less than expected. It is overcapacity that is inflicting the most serious damage. Not all of this is due to Asian competition. The European industry has been expanding production as well. Over the next two years four new ethylene plants, built by BP Chemicals, Enichem of Italy, and the German groups Veba and BASF, will begin production. Altogether, a further 2m tonnes will be added to an already oversupplied market by 1994. None of the new plants, costing some Dollars 3bn in total, is likely to recover the cost of construction before the end of the century. Mr Peter Vogtlander, chemicals co-ordinator at Shell Chemicals, admits: 'We became over-excited by the results around 1988 and 1989. With margins so high, we could pay a new plant off within a year. We forgot the lessons of the early 1980s. Some at the top of the industry should have known better.' Dr Gary Dirks, manager of international marketing of nitrogen at BP says: 'My economist friends call this the downside of the capital cycle. My less erudite colleagues refer to it as the march of the lemmings.' Mr Lee of Dow estimates that within two years the European industry will be supplying 20m tonnes of ethylene a year at a time when demand will be only 15m tonnes to 16m tonnes. It is unlikely that balance will be restored as quickly as it was in the mid-1980s. Then, a combination of falling fuel prices, rapid economic recovery and a 2m-tonne cut in European ethylene capacity helped the industry reverse its plight. This time, the avenues of escape appear blocked. Demand is likely to remain disappointing at least until the middle of the decade as the principal international economies remain sluggish. Any increase in demand is unlikely to lead immediately to higher prices. There is oversupply in the US as well. Mr Longley of Chem Systems says: 'If prices in Europe pick up American imports will flood in.' Nor can the European industry export its way out of trouble. Even during the best of times, European manufacturers are at a cost disadvantage to US and Middle East suppliers because they have limited access to cheap gas feedstocks. The fall in the dollar has made Europe even more uncompetitive than usual, according to Mr Longley. The worst case is the basic plastic PVC, widely used in the construction and packaging industries. The most competitive European plant produces PVC at Dollars 563 a tonne. A US plant, using cheap gas rather than oil-derived feedstock, can sell PVC in Europe for Dollars 505, including tariffs and transport costs. This imbalance has prompted a shift in the balance of trade. In 1987 Europe was a net PVC exporter of 200,000 tonnes. By last year it was a net importer of 260,000 tonnes. Such difficulties are prompting calls for action. 'We just can't afford to grit our teeth and sit it out waiting for demand to pick up. That would take until the late 1990s. The industry has to rationalise,' says Mr Lee at Dow. In a perfect market, the squeeze on margins should mean the least efficient producers close their plants. But before the sector can rationalise it needs to overcome some significant barriers to exit. These include: Cost considerations. The cost of closure, including redundancies and environmental clean-up, is expensive in the short term. And even if plants are not producing profits, they may well be generating cash. The most inefficient plants were closed in the early 1980s. The difference between the most and least efficient of Europe's 53 ethylene cracking plants remains considerable. But the number at either extreme is limited - there are few laggards left. A lack of urgency. Many petrochemical operations are part of larger organisations, often state-owned, that do not have proper financial discipline, says Mr Vogtlander. He says many companies are not aware of their competitive position and blame their present predicament on the market rather than their inefficiency. The tendency is to do nothing and hope the problem goes away, agrees Mr Eric Edwards, a BP manager. The difficulty of closing ethylene plants which supply derivative plants producing plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and PVC. Closure of the ethylene plant may mean that derivative sites also have to be closed. Political factors. Some plants may no longer be financially viable, but the economic impact of closure on local communities is, in some countries, regarded as unacceptable. One manufacturer comments: 'The Italians have cornered the market in laggard plants, but closing them is politically impossible.' The attitude of the European Commission. The industry fears restructuring could be blocked or delayed by the Commission which is fearful of cartels emerging. In spite of these barriers, one leading company in the industry claims there are as many as 14 deals in the offing across Europe aimed at rationalisation and reducing capacity. These range from disposals to joint ventures, mergers, asset swaps and plant sharing agreements. Most companies have drawn up lists of European plants that should be closed. They include those which are too small or too old to be economic. Few companies include their own plants. Some steps have already been taken. Internal memos at BP Chemicals talk of a choice between 'rapid, decisive measures or slow death'. Last week the company revealed it was selling a polyethylene plant at Antwerp to Neste of Finland. ICI has announced it is looking to swap assets or set up joint ventures with other companies in the industry. But in spite of such moves, the rationalisation process across the industry is likely to be slow. It needs guts and determination says Mr Vogtlander. 'I would be amazed if it took sooner rather than longer, but I hope I will be wrong,' he adds. Even if the European industry does succeed in restructuring, its future is likely to remain uncertain. 'The industry believes that when demand eventually picks up so will prices and margins. They won't,' says Mr Stuart Wamsley, editor of Focus on Chemicals, an industry newsletter. The main reason will be the ambitious expansion of supply in Asia. In 1988, South Korean ethylene capacity was only 500,000 tonnes a year. Next year it will 3.2m tonnes. China intends to double ethylene output from 1.8m tonnes a year in 1990 to 3.7m tonnes by 1995. Together with China, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan and Malaysia are expected to add a combined 2.45m tonnes in new ethylene capacity by the middle of the decade. 'As the Asian plants come on stream, European companies will find it increasingly difficult to export to Asia, exacerbating the oversupply problems in Europe,' says Mr Wamsley. Moreover, as European exports decline, so imports are set to increase. Low-cost Middle East suppliers, increasingly squeezed by the new Asian manufacturers, will be forced to divert product to Europe. Further, although Asian manufacturers may have no obvious cost advantage over the Europeans, Mr Wamsley believes they too will increasingly export to Europe and will sharply cut prices in an effort to generate cash. Backed by large conglomerates, the Asian producers, such as Korea's Hyundai Petrochemicals and Formosa Plastics of Taiwan, appear willing to endure losses to win market share. 'There is no room for European manufacturers of commodity chemicals,' warns Mr Wamsley. 'Once the far eastern plants come on stream, the Europeans don't have a hope in hell.' The European shipbuilding and man-made fibres industries - both virtually destroyed by Asian competition - provide potent warnings for Europe's petrochemicals sector. If the industry is to avoid their fate, it will have to rationalise with a speed and determination which it has yet to demonstrate.  -------------------------------------------        FAR EAST CAPACITY ADDITIONS          ('000 tonnes a year)  -------------------------------------------                  1988-90   1991-92  1993-95 Ethylene          3,085     3,055    5,210 Polyethylene      1,665     1,090    1,225 Polypropylene       995       940      710 Polystyrene         422       260      260 PVC                 240       460      490  ------------------------------------------- Source: Stuart Wamsley's Focus on Chemicals  -------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 14  "
0,FT921-15084 ,"FT921-15084 _AN-CAMBUAAOFT 920113   FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (16): United European front looks doubtful - Electronics / The future for Europe's electronics companies seems to lie in deals with stronger partners      By ALAN CANE   THE options for Europe's struggling electronics companies are closing fast. Collaboration on a grand scale to share research, development and marketing costs and present a united front against US and Far Eastern competition is looking increasingly doubtful either in semiconductors or computers. Siemens of Germany, for example, announced in mid-year that it intended to collaborate with International Business Machines of the US in the design and fabrication of the next generation of semiconductor memories. The deal effectively put paid to hopes that Europe's three large semiconductor makers - Siemens, Philips of The Netherlands and the French-Italian combination SGS-Thomson - could be persuaded to join forces to create a company with the resources to compete on a world scale. With the loss of the UK computer manufacturer ICL to Fujitsu of Japan last year and the sale by Philips of its minicomputer interests to Digital Equipment hopes finally died that a European-owned computer giant could be formed from the indigenous suppliers, Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany, Olivetti of Italy and Groupe Bull of France. The commercial logic behind such a merging of computer interests has always been doubtful. None of the European suppliers - with the possible exception of Siemens - has ever been strong enough to have a guaranteed future unaided. Now all are losing money heavily. Siemens, which fell two places in the FT500 to ninth, has seen a renaissance in computers in recent years. Two years ago it was making small but consistent profits. Its agreement to merge its computer interests with those of the loss-making Nixdorf Information Systems, however, resulted in a company awash with red ink. Returning the company to profit is likely to take much longer than chief executive Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig anticipated at the time of the merger. Groupe Bull lost more than FFr6bn (Dollars 1.11bn) last year and is not expected to return to the black for at least a further 12 months after drastic cost cutting and reorganisation - the 'Transformation Plan' put in place by chief executive Mr Francis Lorenz. Olivetti (dropped in ranking from 178th to 375th) slipped into loss this year after some years of steadily declining profitability. The company has been struggling, unsuccessfully, to persuade the Italian government to modify its employment laws to accelerate the rate at which it can cut staff. In the past few months Olivetti chairman Mr Carlo De Benedetti, credited with having turned the moribund typewriter manufacturer into the leading European office systems company in the 1980s, has announced he is returning to take day-to-day control of the company in an effort to turn its fortunes. A conclusion must be that merging the interests of weak companies will only accelerate their decline. The wind has changed in Brussels, moreover. The European-owned group can expect little financial help from the Community. Industry ministers meeting in Brussels late last year promised support for Europe's electronics companies but shied away from endorsing direct subsidies. The Commission is looking hard at French proposals to provide FFr6bn to help Groupe Bull carry out its Transformation Plan and update its technology. ICL of the UK and Siemens of Germany are particularly critical of such subsidies which, they believe, distort competition. What the Commission is essentially promising is to create fair conditions in which European companies can compete at home and abroad. Mr Michel Carpentier, director-general for the informatics industries, told a conference last year: 'We consider it essential that European companies have equitable conditions of competition and market access for products, investments and technologies. We strongly favour an open, multilateral international trade system . . . where necessary, however, the Community will have recourse to bilateral measures and will fall back on its custom regulations and trade policy instrument if equitable conditions are not achieved.' The future for Europe's electronics companies seems to lie in deals with stronger partners. The future for Europe's electronics companies seems to lie in deals with stronger partners. The merger between Fujitsu of Japan and the UK's ICL is one model. Its purchase by Fujitsu left it a European-based company, managed autonomously and with its research and development facilities intact. It has been consistently profitable over the past few years. The reason it seems not to have suffered the same fate as its European competitors is that its well-publicised problems in the 1970s forced it to slim down earlier and look for market niches where it could grow and prosper. It is now a world leader, for example, in retail systems. More than half its revenues come from software and computing services rather than hardware. Another model is Siemens's collaboration with IBM in semiconductors; the aim is to produce the next generation of silicon memory chips, each capable of storing 16m individual bits of information. Memory chips are a fundamental component of most electronic systems; furthermore, the discipline of manufacturing high capacity memory gives a company the skill to innovate in other kinds of semiconductors. SGS-Thomson, which is state-controlled, is still seeking a partner; this year it concluded a chip development agreement with GEC Plessey Semiconductors of the UK and another agreement with Philips, but there is now, seemingly, no hope of a merger with either the Dutch company or with Siemens. One possibility is a strategic alliance with a US company such as Hewlett-Packard, the electronics giant. Groupe Bull is talking to a number of potential US partners including IBM, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard. The problems of the hardware sector, however, tend to distract attention from software and services where Europe is comparatively strong. Most companies in this sector are small. The only computing services company large enough to feature in the FT500 is Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS) of France which, with revenues of more than Dollars 1.5bn, towers over its competitors. Computing services companies are moving towards systems integration, taking prime contractor role in large hardware and software projects. It is a role which requires size and capital. Mergers between Europe's computing services companies to achieve the critical mass for systems integration should ensure that CGS will not be alone in the ranking for long.

This former military camp, where a handful of specialists  and  soldiers remain, is still kept in ideal order. There is no  spitting or discarding of cigarette butts here. Everything is  spotlessly clean. And yet the camp is not so small. It is  located in the depths of the border zone, covering 40 hectares  of a beautiful pine forest. There are five apartment blocks of  100 apartments each on its territory, along with a kindergarten,  school, barracks, large hospital, club, gymnasium, and stadium.  Add to this a superb garage and filling station and a powerful  boilerhouse and generator hall with two marine diesel generators  each producing one megawatt, and you will have some idea of the  site, whose existence used to be a strict military secret.    Its main asset is its unique 32-meter antenna. All around  the world such giant installations can be counted on the fingers  of one hand. This 1,000-tonne structure designed for space  communications is one of the most precise and complex of modern  instruments. It is around this antenna that the fuss has now  developed.    Owing to the hasty Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia our  country is nursing colossal losses. There are many  installations on this Baltic republic's territory which cost  astronomical amounts of money to build and are now having to be  abandoned. In particular, Latvia has inherited 26 former  military airfields with ideal concrete runways (four of them are  the best in Europe) capable of handling all types of aircraft,  including the heaviest transports. Latvia is simply unable to  digest everything it has inherited. Real estate, even if left  unmonitored for a short period of time, becomes easy prey for  looters. There are now whole gangs of them in the republic who  rob abandoned military installations. For instance, immediately  after one flying unit was withdrawn and redeployed to the east,  the robbers descended on the deserted airfield. When, a couple  of days later, representatives of the local authorities arrived  here, they saw a picture that is now typical of Latvia -- stores  were opened and sealed premises broken into. The raiders took  everything they could find, including doors and window frames.    Obviously, the same fate would be in store for the Ventspils  installation. But, fortunately for it, events have begun to  develop to quite a different scenario.    When equipment was removed and the question of dismantling  the antenna arose, the military consulted its developer --  Professor Boris Alekseyevich Poperechenko, chief designer at the  Moscow Power Institute. He flew in and satisfied himself that  dismantling the dish would be impossible. Did that mean it had  to be blown up? No, the chief designer could not tolerate the  idea of destroying his brainchild, which was the embodiment of  state-of-the-art Russian technology. He suggested a different  option.  That was how the news of this unique installation reached the  Russian Academy of Sciences. And the leaders of the Applied  Astronomy Institute proposed using it for absolutely peaceful  purposes.    The fact is that this antenna is a superb radio telescope.  The Russian Academy of Sciences' scientific organizations had  never dreamed of such modern equipment. The largest telescope  our radio astronomers have available to them is the 22-meter  dish in Serpukhov. Consequently, when they need to do serious  space research, they are forced to appeal to the military and to  lease free time on their dishes. Understandably, in this  situation you can only ever do one-time experiments, rather than  systematic observations.    There was one other reason why it was important for the  Russian Academy of Sciences to get its hands on the Ventspils  installation. For eight years now the Applied Astronomy  Institute has been implementing under a government decree the  ""Quasar"" project -- a national Russian system of radio  interferometers to be based on six 32-meter dishes located over  a huge area from Leningrad Oblast to Kamchatka and from Murmansk  to the North Caucasus. The greater the distance between the  dishes, the more accurately the coordinates of stars and quasars  can be determined and the more reliable the research results  will be.    Project ""Quasar"" will also make it possible to resolve  purely  applied tasks connected with precision cartography, geodesy, the  study of the country's natural resources, and so forth. But the  construction of each of its six centers will require billions in  expenditure and take a long time -- building a counterpart of  the Ventspils dish will take up to 10 years. That is why the  scientists are so interested in using it for the needs of  fundamental and applied science.    This sensible and noble idea has met with a response from  virtually everyone. After visiting Riga in late April a  government delegation from Moscow signed a protocol envisaging  joint work between scientists from the two academies of  sciences, and a fundamental decision was reached to set up a  Latvian-Russian radio astronmy center. It only remains to sign  the already prepared draft intergovernmental agreement, but....    ""Initially we could not understand what was going on in  Latvia,"" Andrey Finkelshteyn, deputy leader of the Russian  Government delegation and director of the Applied Astronomy  Institute, said. ""All the necessary permits and signatures had  seemingly been collected, the idea had been approved in  government circles, and -- nothing happened. Then we realized  that the Latvian Government is in a more difficult position than  our own: Every step it takes is monitored by the opposition, if  it took one step out of line it would be destroyed.  Consequently, the republic's leaders are afraid that during the  debate in the Saeima somebody will state that it is not Russian  scientists who want to come to the Ventspils site, but disguised  intelligence operatives; that the government has struck a deal  with the Moscow generals.... And another scandal would break.""    It was in order to calm things down and reassure the Latvian  public that such fears are groundless, that the sensational  ""open-door"" event was held near Ventspils Monday.     "

Papandreou's  address also included a political message regarding our  country's position in Europe but mainly in the Balkans.    For PASOK to continue its direction, Papandreou said, it  must  be revived. We must realize the big changes and contradictions  of the times and give answers with our philosophy and political  practice, he said. A party, Papandreou continued, which works  as a human-centered society cannot be a party of mechanisms, it  is a figure of autonomous people.    Papandreou said PASOK's orientation is, of course, European  but stressed that we are not Europe's poor partner. We are  Europe's arm in the Balkans, its eastern border, he said.  Papandreou blamed Europe for the tragedy in the former  Yugoslavia, talked about the revival of suffering and regional  hostilities and said that these clashes are cultivated by the  big powers to promote their special interests. With a tone of  optimism for the future, Papandreou said that wars and the  economic crisis cannot cancel, can only delay for a while, the  impressive development at the doorstep of which we find  ourselves. Following is that specific part of Papandreou's  address:    [Begin Papandreou recording] We follow the tragedy of war in  the former Yugoslavia with fear. We resist the attempt to  revive ancient Balkan disputes and serve the big powers'  shortsighted goals. However, no resistance can hide the fact  that the Greeks have begun to find their natural role in the  Balkans. Half of the foreign investments in Bulgaria now are  Greek. In Albania, Greek companies have set up 54 joint  companies and we are second after Italy. In Romania, there are  700 joint Greek-Romanian companies. The Balkans's greater area  calls on Greece. The Greeks, who throughout their history have  stood as a factor of progress and civilization in the Balkans  under historical conditions that are incomparably more difficult  that today's, are preparing, in cooperation with the peoples of  the Balkans, to rediscover their old position. [end recording]    Papandreou said that we should again discover our historic  optimism and added that PASOK's revival is firmly connected with  the restoration of political life in the country. The primary  role in this difficult mission belongs to the youth, Papandreou  stressed.    [Begin Papandreou recording] PASOK's revival is firmly  connected with the revival and restoration of political life,  not only of ideas, positions, platforms and choices, but mainly  of institutions, norms and practices. It is an issue that  regards the present and future of democracy and its principles.  Through this road, Greek youth and politics will be reunited.  It will be a necessary meeting for Greece itself. The country  moves ahead only when the youth are in the national and  political foreground, only then. [passage omitted] [end  recording]     "

0,FT921-2257 ,"FT921-2257 _AN-CCTBGAAGFT 920320   FT  20 MAR 92 / Ukrainian confusion on nuclear options      By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and JOHN LLOYD      KIEV, MOSCOW   UKRAINIAN leaders yesterday angrily denied reports that they had reversed their decision to halt the shipment of tactical nuclear missiles to Russia. They said they were ready to have the weapons dismantled in Russia as originally planned, but only on condition this took place under international supervision, for which no provision has been made. The denial of both Russian and Nato reports underscores the tense relations between Ukraine and Russia and the confusion surrounding the control of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union on the eve of a crucial meeting of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Kiev. Mr Anatoli Zlenko, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said that 'no-one has revoked the decision of the president.' President Leonid Kravchuk last week announced that Ukraine was halting the transfer of the weapons to Russia because it had no guarantees that they were being dismantled. On Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, was quoted as saying Ukraine had reversed its decision, and this was backed up by a Nato spokesman. Yesterday western diplomats in Moscow were treating the Ukrainian insistence on international monitoring as a face-saving gesture. They believe Ukraine has indeed submitted to the necessity of returning the missiles to Russia by July because of pressure from western states, particularly the US and Canada. One western defence attache said: 'I think we can say that this was a false alarm.

Ukrainian officials admit it was a mistake for Mr Kravchuk not to consult western powers before making his announcement. Western states, including the US, Britain, and France, have promised technical assistance in the dismantling of the nuclear missiles on Russian territory, although there is no provision for international supervision of the process.

Plans to revise the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (TAA) to meet Commission objections were unveiled in Brussels by Lord Sterling, president of the European Community Shipowners' Associations. The Commission said it could not respond to the new proposals until it had time to study them, but the British Shippers' Council, representing most large UK exporters, said the changes did not go far enough and it would still press for a dismantling of the TAA. The TAA is an accord between 15 large shipping lines accounting for about 85 per cent of sailings between northern Europe and the US, to regulate rates and capacity. Members include large container shipping lines such as PO, Maersk and Nedlloyd. Exporters claim that the TAA, which came into effect in 1992, has pushed up freight rates by as much as 100 per cent. The shipowners say an agreement, or 'conference,' is necessary to put an end to large losses made on the north Atlantic routes. 'We believe the revised agreement will provide new and welcome flexibility,' Lord Sterling said yesterday. 'It is not a climbdown. It is the result of months of discussions to meet the concerns of the shippers while taking note of where the Commission stands.' The new proposals will make it easier for small shippers to negotiate deals with TAA members. They will also allow shippers to reach agreements with just five of the shipping companies involved in the TAA. Shippers will also be able to negotiate different rates for specific quantities to be moved under general service contracts. On the question of tariffs, shipping lines will be able to take independent action to set rates after only five days' notice instead of 10 at present.

Deadline for Their Destruction May Not Be Met""]    [Text] Saratov Oblast -- Around now a terminal was to have  been built on the banks of the Volga in Saratov Oblast to strip  out [peretarivaniye] chemical agents from their containers  [yemkosti] and subsequently detoxify them. That at least is  what the draft first stage of the state program for the  destruction of chemical weapons envisages. However, local  residents, worried by leaks at stores that have been here a long  time, have sounded the alarm and are objecting to new  installations with this kind of specialism.    Russia's president signed the Paris Convention on the  Prohibition of Chemical Weapons a year ago, in January 1993.  According to the Convention, the first installation for the  destruction of chemical agents must be tested within two years  at most. Half this time has already elapsed and Russia still  has no laws, no concept, no approved state program for chemical  weapons destruction. Meanwhile leaks of poisonous substances  from containers that have eroded have been recorded at the  arsenal sited on the territory of Saratov Oblast.    The village of Gornyy, where 690 tonnes of mustard gas, 225  tonnes of lewisite, and 210 tonnes of their compounds are  stored, is not far from the Volga. The chemical weapons that  have been here for ages, packed in metal barrels and railroad  tankers, pose a potential danger.    The strength of the harmful chemicals will be reduced by a  factor of 1,000-10,000 when the chemical agents are stripped out  at the new terminal. The plan is to reprocess the reactive  matter obtained in Shikhany, 100 km from Gornyy, where the  top-secret State Institute of Organic Synthesis Technology  [SIOST], which developed chemical weapons in the recent past, is  located.    Doctor of Sciences Aleksandr Kochergin, the institute's  director, said that several technologies have been developed for  the destruction of the stocks from the arsenal in Gornyy.  Whereas the situation is clear with regard to the mustard gas,  a choice has not yet been made with regard to the lewisite and  its compounds. In the opinion of SIOST scientists, the most  preferable option is for this kind of chemical agent to be  recycled [utilizatsiya] since it contains costly arsenic used in  microelectronics, laser technology, optics, and pharmaceuticals.  In other words, the recycling technology presupposes not only  expenditure on chemical weapons destruction but also  considerable income from the reprocessing of chemical agents  into particularly pure arsenic, which Russia does not currently  produce.    This technology can also be used to recycle  arsenic-containing adamsite -- an irritant chemical agent  produced early this century, which has been shipped to Shikhany  from throughout the former Union -- of which more than 8,000  tonnes have been buried straight in the ground at the testing  range of the military institute next to SIOST. The huge Russian  adamsite dump is a source of great worry not only to the public  but also to scientists, who are voicing misgivings over the  possible environmental contamination from these stocks.    It may seem to the uninitiated that there are no particular  problems with the destruction of the Saratov arsenal. It is  only the choice of technology and the construction of a terminal  and recycling installations that are holding things up.  However, one must not forget that we are talking about chemical  weapons, which are to be destroyed in densely populated areas  right next to the Volga. This is a very sensitive subject for  the residents of the area since the environmental background  here is unfavorable enough as it is. In the city of Volsk, for  instance, which is no more than 5 km from Shikhany as the crow  flies, the arsenic content in the soil is already several times  in excess of the maximum permissible concentrations owing to  three local cement plants using so-called pyrite cinders, which  contain arsenic, in their manufacturing process.  People's disquiet is intensified by the constant rumors about  the danger of radiological contamination of the area from the  Balakovo nuclear electric power station 50 km from Volsk. Add to  that atmospheric discharges by Balakovo's big chemical giants  and you will understand the public concern, which is threatening  to develop into an organized protest against the siting of  chemical weapons destruction facilities bin these areas.    This disquiet is intensified by conjecture and speculation  due to the utter secrecy surrounding the facilities at Shikhany.  I visited them, spoke with scientists, and saw that there is no  intention of building any more production units here, the former  technology used for the synthesis of chemical agents has merely  been reversed. According to the findings of a special  environmental and medical monitoring laboratory, the air in  Shikhany is considerably cleaner than in Volsk, people live  longer and have fewer illnesses.    Choosing the technology is only part of the problem and by  no  means the most important part. Social and environmental  questions are the main thing. Mikhail Yakovlev, Saratov Oblast  Administration department head, briefed me on a Russian  Government draft decree that the residents of the oblast have  prepared on their own initiative. It enshrines their immediate  demands without whose fulfillment the chemical weapons  destruction process cannot be started. During the first quarter  of this year the Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical  and Biological Weapons under the Russian President and the  Ministry of Defense, in conjunction with other departments, are  asked to define a concept, prepare drafts of a basic law and a  number of other legislative acts designed to form the legal base  for the practical implementation of the Paris Convention, and  guarantee safety, health, and social protection. According to  civilized norms, the facilities for the storage and destruction  of chemical weapons and the population centers around them  should be given special status with all the concomitant  guarantees, as is the case in the United States for instance.    The demand for regular environmental and medical monitoring  is also natural. During the first stage, before the  experimental installations begin work, the intention is to study  the state of the environment and carry out a comprehensive  screening process involving residents in Volskiy and  Krasnopartizanskiy Rayons, which include Shikhany and Gornyy, in  order to determine the consequences of the storage and testing  of chemical weapons on the environment and the population's  health.    The importance of the social and environmental aspects can  be  judged from the funding structure, where expenditure on  monitoring and the social everyday sphere in Shikhany, Volsk,  and Gornyy amounts to 67 billion rubles [R] of the R72 billion  that the oblast administration deems it necessary to allocate  for the entire first phase of the program, a phase culminating  in the construction and testing of the experimental-industrial  facility for the destruction and recycling of chemical agents  and the creation of the requisite support infrastructure.    Nadezhda Saratovtseva, head of administration of the  settlement of Shikhany, has a better knowledge of the whole set  of problems than anyone else. She takes part without fail in  all the meetings and talks on this topic and has even addressed  parliamentary hearings.    ""The state program for the destruction of chemical weapons  has been in the process of being written and draft laws have  been in the process of being harmonized since 1989,"" she said.  ""Presidents, governments, and parliaments have come and gone,  but still there are no laws and no program. There is no concept  and no funding. The SIOST has not been paid for three months  and that unique institution is on the verge of stoppages. The  social sphere -- the burden of which is borne entirely by the  institute -- is going to pieces.""    Judging by the center's unhurried approach, one can  confidently assume today that the schedule proposed by the  Saratov administration in its draft government decree will also  be disrupted.    ""You produced the chemical weapons, you destroy them,""  Saratovtseva was told by one highly-placed Moscow official.    Meanwhile the chemical bomb planted almost on the very banks  of the Volga may spring its surprise at any minute. In that  case it would not only be the residents of Saratov on the Volga  who would suffer.     "

Its aeronautics branch is eliminating 10,300  jobs, and its automotive branch, 14,000. And its electrical  engineering subsidiary is seeking new alliances. The emphasis is  now on reduction of costs.    ""Gross ist wunderbar [Big is wonderful],"" Daimler-Benz's CEO  [chief executive officer] Edzard Reuter responded to those who  criticized his industrial bulimia. That was in 1989. Reuter had  just completed a forceful entry into MBB  [Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm], Germany's big aircraft  manufacturer.    Five years later, the visionary leader of Europe's largest  industrial group (approximately 349 billion francs [Fr] of  annual revenue] is in the grip of the worst recession in its  history. The current economic turnarounds are buffeting the  German eagle's expansionist ambitions in its sectors of  predilection -- the automotive (70 percent of its activity), the  aeronautical (17 percent), and the electrical engineering (11  percent) -- with crushing force.    Dornier, MTU, MBB, Fokker, and Deutsche Airbus -- all  brought  together under Daimler's subsidiary, Deutsche Aerospace (DASA)  -- are reeling from cancellations of orders by airline companies  and the drastic reduction of military spending across the Rhine.  Its flagship fighter-aircraft program, the Eurofighter, being  realized together with England, Italy, and Spain, and already  seriously downsized, is now also running into serious technical  difficulties. And its prospects are all of the gloomiest. In  1993, DASA's orders will total Fr10 billion less than projected,  and for the second consecutive year, the Munich-based firm will  post losses. Given the situation, Jurgen Schrempp, the company's  president, is slashing away at costs. After putting in place an  initial cost-cutting plan last fall, he has now announced a new  phase: the elimination of 10,300 jobs and the closing of six  plants. The goal: savings of Fr5.2 billion annually in this  sector, deemed strategic for the future of the Daimler group.    The restructurings of its aeronautics branch are all the  more  necessary since its automobile branch, Daimler-Benz's  traditional pillar, has also been profoundly hit. A drop of  around 28 percent in new car registrations combined with the  cost of launching its new C series, and the turbulences of the  European market for heavy trucks, have Mercedes also tobogganing  in the red for 1993. To resume the road to competitiveness, the  subsidiary's top management estimates that it must reduce  operating costs by 30 percent within a period of three years.  This coming year, 14,000 jobs will be eliminated in the  prestigious automobile manufacturer's plants. Mercedes remains  tightly knit and is moreover planning to launch its entry into  the micro-car market -- a cultural revolution that takes on the  allure of a challenge.    Meanwhile, Daimler's profits are melting like snow in a hot  sun, jeopardizing Edzard Reuter's position. Nor can he count any  longer on AEG, Daimler's electrical engineering subsidiary,  which expects to post a loss of Fr1 billion this year. Having  already divested itself of its domestic appliances business to  Sweden's Electrolux, AEG is now searching for new alliances.     "

0,FT932-4855 ,"FT932-4855 _AN-DFGB7AD9FT 930607   FT  07 JUN 93 / Community in trouble      By IAN DAVIDSON   With any luck, the Treaty of Maastricht should soon be ratified in all 12 member states. But the European Community is now in deep political and economic trouble, and it will not be resolved by getting the treaty on to the statute books. The political problem is that the member states have not yet taken on board the full consequences, and therefore have not accepted the full responsibilities, of the post-cold war era. The economic problem is that the process of economic integration, which should be carried a great stride forward by the single market and Maastricht, is in fact in jeopardy from the recession and the growing anxiety over Europe's competitive weaknesses. France and Germany last week called for a special European summit later this year to revitalise the Community, and their proposal was immediately endorsed by five Christian Democrat governments. What we don't yet have is evidence that the member states have remedies for the Community's problems. The tell-tale of the post-cold war era, is the comprehensive muddle over the war in Bosnia. After weeks of feverish transatlantic diplomacy, five UN Security Council members last month drafted a 12-point action plan for containing the conflict. But that ambiguous document was really a cloak for continued disagreement between the US and Europe; and the disagreement has not been ended by Friday's Security Council vote to protect 'safe areas' in Bosnia. Sanctions have not stopped the Serbs from killing Moslems nor from conquering more and more Bosnian territory; above all, they have not persuaded the Serbs to submit to the Vance-Owen plan. If that plan is to be brought back from the dead, and then implemented, much more forceful military compulsion would be needed. But troops on the ground, in sufficient numbers credibly to threaten the use of force, would require a substantial US contribution. That is what we shall not get. The US is determined not to get involved in the war. On the campaign trail Bill Clinton criticised President George Bush for the limpness of his Bosnia policy and promised he would be more vigorous. But now, after much reflection, he has evidently concluded that the Bush policy was not so bad after all. He does not say that Bosnia is Europe's problem, but that is what he means. The fiasco of the Washington 'agreement' was underscored by an off-the-record briefing by a senior state department official, who told journalists the new administration would be adopting a lower international profile, and would be 'setting limits on the amount of American engagement in Bosnia and around the world'. His words were immediately repudiated by the White House, and secretary of state Warren Christopher assured the world that America would continue to lead 'because the need for American leadership is undiminished'. But these were just the gesticulations of national vanity: the state department official was merely telling us what we already knew. If America was the uncontested leader of the west for the past 50 years, it was primarily because of the cold war: Europe and America needed each other desperately, and only America could lead. But leadership is a heavy burden. Now that the Soviet threat has vanished, America has much less incentive (and fewer resources) systematically to bear the burden of leadership seven days a week. In the new loose world after the cold war, Europe may find that sometimes America has quite different strategic objectives, and sometimes simply does not want to get involved at all. The implications of this for Europe are profound. First, Europe can no longer take America for granted. We share many values, and many common interests; but we may not necessarily have the same strategic objectives. Therefore, the Community needs to decide whether it is serious about the Maastricht objective of a common foreign policy; if it is, it must go much further than anything in the treaty. If the Community is to be more self-reliant, the tasks of a full-gamut foreign policy can no longer be left to France and Britain: the Germans must recognise that their posture of atonement may be a critical obstacle to the European integration they say they want. Europe's economic problems are, if anything, even more intractable. When Maastricht was being negotiated, the centrepiece was regarded as the programme for economic and monetary union. But today's most pressing economic problem is high and rising unemployment, and it is not being helped, and may be made worse, by the Emu programme. Europe's economic downturn has been aggravated both by the costs of German unification, and by Germany's tight money policy. But the high rate of unemployment may also be due to the relocating of European jobs to low-cost countries elsewhere. A report to the French senate calculates that France has lost 450,000 jobs in clothing, footwear and electronics in the past 15 years; and it estimates that another 2.7m French industrial jobs are vulnerable to the same threat. Last week an official at the OECD warned privately that rising unemployment could trigger a 'social explosion'. The prescription of the French senate report is that 'Europe must be protectionist'. Free-traders will regard this as outrageous, and typically French. But we should note that it would be all of a piece with the human protectionism that Europe is already practising on a massive scale. We are not ready to do anything to stop the war in ex-Yugoslavia; but we have no shame in merely excluding the hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war, death and destruction.

In the city of Volsk, for  instance, which is no more than 5 km from Shikhany as the crow  flies, the arsenic content in the soil is already several times  in excess of the maximum permissible concentrations owing to  three local cement plants using so-called pyrite cinders, which  contain arsenic, in their manufacturing process.    People's disquiet is intensified by the constant rumors  about  the danger of radiological contamination of the area from the  Balakovo nuclear electric power station 50 km from Volsk. Add to  that atmospheric discharges by Balakovo's big chemical giants  and you will understand the public concern, which is threatening  to develop into an organized protest against the siting of  chemical weapons destruction facilities bin these areas.    This disquiet is intensified by conjecture and speculation  due to the utter secrecy surrounding the facilities at Shikhany.  I visited them, spoke with scientists, and saw that there is no  intention of building any more production units here, the former  technology used for the synthesis of chemical agents has merely  been reversed. According to the findings of a special  environmental and medical monitoring laboratory, the air in  Shikhany is considerably cleaner than in Volsk, people live  longer and have fewer illnesses.    Choosing the technology is only part of the problem and by  no  means the most important part. Social and environmental  questions are the main thing. Mikhail Yakovlev, Saratov Oblast  Administration department head, briefed me on a Russian  Government draft decree that the residents of the oblast have  prepared on their own initiative. It enshrines their immediate  demands without whose fulfillment the chemical weapons  destruction process cannot be started. During the first quarter  of this year the Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical  and Biological Weapons under the Russian President and the  Ministry of Defense, in conjunction with other departments, are  asked to define a concept, prepare drafts of a basic law and a  number of other legislative acts designed to form the legal base  for the practical implementation of the Paris Convention, and  guarantee safety, health, and social protection. According to  civilized norms, the facilities for the storage and destruction  of chemical weapons and the population centers around them  should be given special status with all the concomitant  guarantees, as is the case in the United States for instance.    The demand for regular environmental and medical monitoring  is also natural. During the first stage, before the  experimental installations begin work, the intention is to study  the state of the environment and carry out a comprehensive  screening process involving residents in Volskiy and  Krasnopartizanskiy Rayons, which include Shikhany and Gornyy, in  order to determine the consequences of the storage and testing  of chemical weapons on the environment and the population's  health.    The importance of the social and environmental aspects can  be  judged from the funding structure, where expenditure on  monitoring and the social everyday sphere in Shikhany, Volsk,  and Gornyy amounts to 67 billion rubles [R] of the R72 billion  that the oblast administration deems it necessary to allocate  for the entire first phase of the program, a phase culminating  in the construction and testing of the experimental-industrial  facility for the destruction and recycling of chemical agents  and the creation of the requisite support infrastructure.    Nadezhda Saratovtseva, head of administration of the  settlement of Shikhany, has a better knowledge of the whole set  of problems than anyone else. She takes part without fail in  all the meetings and talks on this topic and has even addressed  parliamentary hearings.    ""The state program for the destruction of chemical weapons  has been in the process of being written and draft laws have  been in the process of being harmonized since 1989,"" she said.  ""Presidents, governments, and parliaments have come and gone,  but still there are no laws and no program. There is no concept  and no funding. The SIOST has not been paid for three months  and that unique institution is on the verge of stoppages. The  social sphere -- the burden of which is borne entirely by the  institute -- is going to pieces.""    Judging by the center's unhurried approach, one can  confidently assume today that the schedule proposed by the  Saratov administration in its draft government decree will also  be disrupted.    ""You produced the chemical weapons, you destroy them,""  Saratovtseva was told by one highly-placed Moscow official.    Meanwhile the chemical bomb planted almost on the very banks  of the Volga may spring its surprise at any minute. In that  case it would not only be the residents of Saratov on the Volga  who would suffer.     "

0,FT932-16391 ,"FT932-16391 _AN-DDFCIAEHFT 930406   FT  06 APR 93 / Leading Article: Russia after the summit   'THE WORLD cannot afford the strife of the former Yugoslavia replicated in a nation as big as Russia, spanning 11 time zones with an arsenal of nuclear weapons that is still very vast.' Thus did President Clinton explain the importance of the subjects under discussion with President Yeltsin over the weekend. But they were no less important a year ago when actions now being contemplated by western leaders might have made faster reform feasible. The west chose to be timid when it should have been bold. Now it may be too late. A legally justified anarchy obtains in Russia. Unhappily, it is likely to endure. Mr Yeltsin is likely to win a majority of those voting in the plebiscite of April 25. That would give him the moral victory, but it would not give him the unquestioned authority he needs to implement reforms, for which he must obtain a majority of those registered to vote. The west cannot directly influence the outcome, though its moral support must help. Should Mr Yeltsin win either a decisive victory or merely a moral one, western assistance will be essential. First, the West cannot offer just one kind of assistance. There will have to be humanitarian relief, technical assistance and project finance. But there must also be help with economic stabilisation. Without a currency worth earning, a budget that can be closed without use of the printing press, and a social safety net, assistance will largely be wasted. Second, aid must be coordinated more effectively. The summit decision to establish a G7 coordinating office in Moscow is welcome and overdue. Third, substantial assistance will be needed to make stabilisation even conceivable. With its proposed temporary financing facility to help Russia and other former Soviet republics 'facing particularly disruptive systemic shocks', the IMF seems to have recognised at last that the orthodox approach is not workable in the former Soviet Union. Fourth, Russia will need markets. But access to western markets is in the interest of the west as well, since Russia will export in order to import. The European Community should reach generous free trade agreements with all the countries of the former Soviet Union as quickly as possible. Finally, President Clinton needs to remember his own words about the security threat posed by Russia. Dollars 900m of the Dollars 1.6bn he offered is merely disguised assistance to US farm exports. Help for Russia should be seen as an alternative to western military spending. It is only in this context that assistance on the required scale could be justified without sacrificing the interests of other, arguably worthier recipients. President Clinton has shown he is aware of the seriousness of the challenge. That is a welcome start. The G7 must now show the determination to help take Russian reform forward.

But First They Must `Scare Up' 1  Billion Rubles and Eight Meters of Heavy-Weight Concrete""]    [Text]    Details    ""The Russian side will provide for financing and performance  of the entire complex of work for dismantling the nuclear device  and the material part of the physics experiment FO-100-SZhR in  adit 108-k at the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground according to a  schedule agreed upon by the parties."" So goes the first article  of the ""Agreement Between the Russian Federation Government and  the Republic of Kazakhstan Government for Dismantling the  Nuclear Device Placed at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Testing  Ground Before It Was Closed,"" signed in Moscow on 28 March 1994.    Effective 25 October 1990, a year's moratorium was  unilaterally introduced on nuclear testing. This step was  undertaken by the country's top leaders without serious  consultation with members of parliament and specialists. As a  result, a nuclear device with a capacity of 0.4 kilotons  (equivalent to 400 tonnes of trotyl charge) was left prepared  for underground testing in adit 108-k.    The time period of the moratorium had not even expired when  on 29 August 1991, Nursultan Nazarayev, by an order to close the  Semipalatinsk Testing Ground, ruled out the possibility of using  it further for conducting underground tests. This situation  applied fully to the physics experiment OF-100-SRZh that had  been prepared at site 108-k.    Thus this nuclear charge, small by today's standards, lay in  the adit cut in the granite monolith of Degelen at a depth of  126 meters. Incidentally, the verb ""lay"" does not quite fit the  real state of affairs. Without careful continuous technical  service this unintentional unique experiment--never before in  world practice has a nuclear charge remained so long, four  years, outside warehouse premises--threatened to end with an  uncontrollable nuclear explosion at any moment. With the  collapse of the USSR the situation at the Semipalatinsk test  site, which had become a constituent part of Kazakhstan's  national nuclear center, evoked constantly growing alarm. Last  winter, as a result of a series of accidents in municipal  utility networks, the system for maintaining the normal vital  activity of the city of Kurchatov--the capital of the test site,  as they called it--was put almost completely out of commission.  Consideration was also given to the question of emergency  evacuation from it of the Russian military unit that served,  among other things, the nuclear charge in adit 108-k (see  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 24 November 1993). (Before that 27,000  people had already left the city, mainly military and civilian  specialists providing support for nuclear research.)    Work on the present agreement began in the autumn of 1992.  But in reality up until the last moment it was not completely  certain that it would be signed during President Nazarbayev's  official visit to Russia. The fact is that at the end of January  1994 Kazakhstan made a proposal to include in the text an  additional article making it incumbent on the Russian side to do  ""special work to clean up after the activity related to the  nuclear device."" The Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic  Energy would not agree to this proposal and was able to convince  the Kazakh side to withdraw it.    Be that as it may, by the end of 1994 the nuclear charge was  to have been dismantled and removed from the adit, and all the  material part of the experiment was to have been moved unimpeded  to the Russian Federal Nuclear Center (All-Russian Scientific  Research Institute of Technical Physics--VNIITF) in  Chelyabinsk-70. Specialists of the VNIITF in conjunction with  the All-Russian Scientific Research and Planning Institute of  Industrial Technology carried out the project entitled ""Opening  and Eliminating Object 108-k.""    It is possible to judge the seriousness of the task facing  them if only from the fact that as of the first half of 1993 the  estimated cost of the work was R650 million. In the opinion of  certain of the experts at the Ministry of Atomic Energy of the  Russian Federation, the real cost would exceed a billion.  Incidentally, there is nothing surprising here: After all, adit  108-k is essentially an extremely complex engineering and  technical structure. It is 592 meters long. The nuclear device  is housed in the so-called end box (KB). The protective  shock-absorbing complex, which is actually supposed to guarantee  maximum safety when conducting the nuclear explosion, consists  of several load-bearing elements: the first section--a concrete  ring 49 meters long, and 19.5 meters--from especially  heavy-weight concrete with a metal filler; the protective  sealing element seven meters in length made of concrete, and  several other sealing elements.    The project envisions opening the adit and drilling a  bypass.  This working should provide access to the end box from the rear  side through an eight-meter concrete wall. The opening of  concrete protective elements and drilling the bypass were to  have been done by the blast-hole drilling method. The concrete  wall in the immediate area of the end box was to have been  opened with mechanical picks. The overall volume of mining work  will amount to about 1,233 cubic meters, and the volume of work  for dismantling cable lines and metal elements--about 114 tonnes.    The agreement also envisions a scenario if for one reason or  another it is impossible to extract the nuclear device. In this  case it is to be destroyed right in the end part of adit 108-k  with an applied charge of chemical explosive that will  completely preclude the release of nuclear energy.    On 12 April of this year the deputy prime minister of the  Russian Government, Oleg Soskovets, signed an order to the  Ministry of Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation, the  Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the  Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of  Internal Affairs, and the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear  and Radiation Safety: ""Request that you take measures to  implement the agreement.""    From NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Files    Since 1961 at the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground 348  underground nuclear explosions have been conducted, of which  five were under the program for working on the application of  nuclear explosive technologies for industrial purposes.  Underground explosions were conducted with nuclear explosive  devices placed in both horizontal (215 explosions) and vertical  (133 explosions) workings.     "

The Alliance of the Palestinian Forces has held a meeting in  which it discussed the latest political developments given the  determination of 'Arafat and his team to plunge deeper into the  quagmire of the liquidatory Oslo-Washington agreement and to  make concession after concession in order to meet the Zionist  enemy leaders' conditions, the latest of which was 'Arafat's  declaration in Davos that he had no intention of establishing a  Palestinian state, but that he was working to establish a  confederation with Jordan.    On the occasion of the beginning of the 75th month of the  intifadah, which coincides with the arrival of the blessed month  of Ramadan, the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces extends its  greetings and appreciation to the sons of the brave intifadah,  who are stepping up their heroic deeds in the face of the  growing violence of the enemy's soldiers and its herds of  settlers. This is, in fact, a practical retaliation in order to  topple the Gaza-Jericho agreement and to continue and escalate  the intifadah against the invaders.    In light of these developments, the Alliance of the  Palestinian Forces assert that the Palestine question is not the  property of 'Arafat and his men and, therefore, he cannot do  with it whatever he wishes because it belongs to the Palestinian  people and their national forces, who reject liquidatory  solutions, and who struggle to achieve our people's goals of  repatriation, self-determination, and full national  independence. What 'Arafat says basically means an annexation  by Jordan of the partial self-rule authority, which is being  rejected by the overwhelming majority of the sons of our  Palestinian people.    This statement is aimed at reassuring the Zionist enemy.  'Arafat no longer speaks for or expresses the will of the  Palestinian people. Therefore, his opinions and positions are  no longer binding on our people.    The alliance again urges the sons of the Arab and Islamic  nations, as well as all the forces that love freedom and peace,  to take practical positions in support of our people's  legitimate rights and to put an end to the rampage of Zionism,  which uses the defeatism of 'Arafat and his team -- this only  represents a slight minority of our people inside and outside  the occupied homeland -- as a pretext to entrench its occupation  of the Palestinian and Arab territories.    The alliance urges the exposure of the United States' use of  double standards and the extension of all sorts of support to  the Zionist enemy in order to develop its military arsenal and  to consider the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories as  disputed territories.    The alliance will resolutely continue its policy to topple  the Oslo-Washington agreement, strip 'Arafat and his team of  their popular legitimacy, rebuild the PLO's institutions on  democratic bases, and secure every means to prolong and escalate  the brave intifadah and its unity under the banner of the  unified national and Islamic unity of the intifadah.

Mr Kozyrev, on a visit to Ukraine, told the official Russian news agency Tass that he had been given 'extremely alarming information about the technical state of a number of rockets' by Ukrainian officials soon after arriving in Kiev yesterday. He gave no details of the information but Russia has complained about the 130 ageing SS-19 strategic missiles and 46 more modern SS-24 missiles in Ukraine, suggesting they are being kept in unsafe conditions. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry confirmed last week that 20 of its older generation SS-19 strategic missiles should be destroyed immediately. 'We know ourselves that 20 missiles are now reaching the end of their operational life. The question has already arisen of how to destroy them and where the money is to come from to do so.' Ukraine, concerned about political instability in Russia, is now dragging its heels about transferring the weapons and says it wants more compensation and firm security guarantees. The issue of destroying the missiles is involved a struggle between Ukraine and the US government, which has agreed to put up the money needed for dismantling but only in stages while Ukraine carries it out. Ukraine argues that it should know the total financial package before it embarks on the project. Agreements were made between the Kiev government and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, at the end of last month during the latter's visit to Kiev - but none has been put into practice. Ukraine has promised to become a non-nuclear power, to sign the non-proliferation treaty and the Start 1 and 2 agreements but has yet to do so. President Leonid Kravchuk, who has often shown impatience with the refusal of his parliament to sign the necessary agreements, is under pressure from nationalist politicians not to get rid of the 176 missiles but to retain them as a deterrent to other powers, especially Russia.

""The public's anti-chemical attitude and changing regulatory climate that bans  pesticides has made the time right for using this technology in areas once  considered unprofitable ventures, such as termite control,"" he said.

In politics, this ""agility"" has enabled him to  slide from one ideology to another without losing face -- or not  too much, at least. The Ukrainian Houdini has elevated the  quick-change act to an art: Secretary of the Communist Party  Central Committee until 1991, he did not say a word in defense  of Gorbachev during the time of the attempted ""August coup""; but  after the coup failed he sided with the Ukrainian independence  movement and was elected president by a landslide vote a few  months later . Now he is seeking reelection by flirting with  the communists (he appointed one of them prime minister), but he  is also wooing the moderate nationalists. A man for all seasons  who has the good fortune always to appear like the ""lesser  evil,"" helped by the absence of worthy alternative candidates  and by an unscrupulous exploitation of power.    [Franceschini] During your two-and-a-half years as president  Ukraine has plummeted into an abyss. Do you not feel  responsible?    [Kravchuk] I disagree. Only those who do nothing make no  mistakes. We have made some, but we have also done a great deal  -- building from nothing an independent state, without wars or  disasters, with democratic structures and its own Armed Forces,  earning the respect of the international community. The worst  is over. We have a long way to go, but we are on course, and in  two or three years' time everything will be resolved.    [Franceschini] Are you in favor of forming a Slavic  confederation between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, as some  people have been suggesting recently?    [Kravchuk] It is a dangerous idea. It could spark a tide of  pan-Slavism and nationalism from Eastern Europe to Kazakhstan,  in all the countries where millions of Slavs live. It is  impossible to create unions on the basis of the ethnic-national  principle. But we do want to have good relations with Russia,  especially in the economic field.    [Franceschini] Crimea and East Ukraine, where 10 million  Russians live, are pressing to return to Russia's orbit. Could  this prompt a conflict between Moscow and Kiev?    [Kravchuk] Russia and Ukraine have lived together for 350  years, have never taken up arms against each other, and will  never do so. To resolve the issue of Crimea's autonomy we will  not resort to force under any circumstances. We are in favor of  a peaceful solution of the problem, and I think we are moving in  this direction.    [Franceschini] Will Ukraine sign the nuclear  nonproliferation  treaty and thus pledge to consign its arsenal to Russia?    [Kravchuk] With me as president, the treaty will be  immediately submitted to Parliament for ratification as soon as  possible. It is an essential duty that we have taken on with  respect to the international community.     "

They include computers, photocopiers, TVs, video recorders and microwave cookers. But most of them contain untapped wealth in the form of metals and plastics which can be recycled. The material produced in Britain alone is worth about Pounds 50m a year and if re-used it would save industry Pounds 10m a year. The problem has been examined by the Centre for Exploitation of Science and Technology (Cest), an independent organisation funded by 19 companies and working with government and higher education. Cest has established a technical advisory group to encourage industry to develop solutions to recycling these materials. It includes large companies like Dow and IBM and local authorities and the Departments of the Environment and Trade and Industry. The report says there is a market for reclaimed metal but the market for recycled plastics has only been for inferior applications. This is because the manufacturers of plastics, electronic equipment and waste processors have spent little effort to use high-quality plastics that could be recycled. Modular construction of equipment makes dismantling much easier. Loewe, the German TV manufacturer, makes televisions which divide easily into four main sections. Various methods to encourage recycling are examined in the report. These include levies on electronic equipment and plastics to finance recycling. National governments and the EC should co-operate with industry to implement a recycling policy, it says. If manufacturers fail to respond to environmental pressures they will lose out because consumers will buy products from companies with a better environmental message.

Armed with an arsenal of ideas contributed by the  parliaments  in the workplace and the report presented by Jose Luis  Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, Cuban deputies had  enough arguments to propose solutions to reduce the deficit and  the amount of excess money in circulation, which jeopardize the  island's economic efforts.    In the midst of this heated debate, Cuban President Fidel  Castro spoke in his role as deputy. Fidel said the policy of  justice and social solidarity, maintained by the revolution even  during times of crisis, is basically responsible for the  imbalance that now afflicts our internal finances, adding that  the time has come to solve the situation once and for all.    [Begin Castro recording] Above all, we must be courageous.  We must be not only intelligent but courageous. If we are  afraid, we are lost. If we implement half measures we are lost.  History has given us the responsibility of solving this  problem. We have to solve it, and in the end we must assume the  responsibility with political sense, with revolutionary sense,  and with an (?technological) sense. [end recording]    Referring to this, he said we must adopt the necessary  measures, even those that are unpopular.    [Begin Castro recording] This is not a matter of simply  putting our finances on a sound basis; it is also a matter of  revaluing money. It is necessary to revalue workers' salaries;  to revalue the peso. They are equally important issues. They  are (?decisive) things, and I believe we should be willing to  adopt whatever measures are necessary [applause] even if no one  wants to speak to us the next day. [applause] Even if they do  not want to greet us the next day or even in the coming months.    None of the measures will be welcome, nor will they be  understood in only one day. Only the sum of these measures will  be understood. Only the sum of these measures will yield results  and increase the people's understanding. These measures must  have an order. It is not a matter of adopting any measure today  and any other measure tomorrow. The measures must have a [word  indistinct] order, because the order of the steps has an impact  on the results in this case. [end recording]    To conclude, Fidel Castro emphasized that every effort has  been made to carry out the most democratic process of  discussions, to hear various criteria, and to take the people's  opinion into consideration. In other words, the strategy is  well-known, but discretion must prevail at all times, he said.    The special session will continue tomorrow with the  discussion of a draft agreement on the issue, which will be  undoubtedly improved by the contributions from Sunday's debate.     "
0,FT943-3018 ,"FT943-3018 _AN-EIPC9ABAFT 940916   FT  16 SEP 94 / Opposition to nuclear treaty grows      By FRANCES WILLIAMS      GENEVA   An indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, desired by most western nations and four of the five nuclear powers, has run into stronger-than-expected Third World opposition. Mr Isaac Ayewah of Nigeria, chairman of a meeting in Geneva to prepare for the NPT extension conference next spring said yesterday that a majority of states appeared to favour only a limited extension of the treaty, accompanied by clear moves by the five declared nuclear-weapons states towards nuclear disarmament. This was later refuted by Mr Thomas Graham, head of the US delegation, who said about 60 countries were committed to making the NPT permanent while the remainder of the treaty's 164 members had yet to make up their minds. However, he admitted that the prospects of indefinite extension, while 'reasonably good', were 'not assured. Among the nuclear powers the US, Russia, France and Britain support indefinite extension. China has not declared its position. A decision to extend the NPT requires a simple majority of treaty members and can be taken only once. The options are an indefinite extension, or extension for one or more fixed periods after which the treaty lapses. The West argues that the NPT has been crucial in curbing nuclear proliferation. Opponents of indefinite extension say the treaty unfairly discriminates against non-nuclear weapons states and does not provide adequate means to tackle new proliferation concerns. Critics single out what they see as the failure of the nuclear powers to abide by their NPT obligations to enter 'good faith' negotiations to end the nuclear arms race and work for eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. A number of developing nations this week called for a strengthening of the non-proliferation regime, to include a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT), a prohibition on production of fissile materials for weapons purposes and a dismantling of stockpiles, guarantees to non-nuclear weapon states that nuclear weapons will never be used against them, and a commitment by the nuclear powers to negotiate the elimination of nuclear arms within a fixed time-frame. A CTBT is being negotiated in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations disarmament conference, but is unlikely to be ready in time for the NPT extension conference.

By CAROL WISE, Carol Wise is a research associate with the Inter-American  Dialogue in Washington and a visiting professor in the political science  department at UCLA.      When the forces of political and economic liberalization were unleashed in  Eastern Europe last year, the international financial community quickly turned  cool to Latin America. Yet it is Latin America that is now showing itself to be  better positioned to shoulder the tough challenges immediately ahead of both  regions: a huge debt overhang, a new round of energy price shocks and the  consolidation of the 12 countries of the European Community into a powerful  common market in 1992.    Both Latin America and Eastern Europe are straining to service a large external  debt. Neither has been able to obtain the necessary levels of new financing or  to secure significant reductions in interest or principal. Yet, during this  time of fierce international competition for capital and relatively few breaks  from the commercial banks or official lenders, Latin America is coming out  ahead. Bob McCormack, head of Citicorp's country debt review committee,  explains that bankers are leaning toward ""known quantities, like a Mexico, a  Venezuela or a Brazil rather than sink themselves very deeply into a region  whose future economic outlook could remain uncertain for a good part of the  next decade."" The statement shows just how fickle the international financial  community can be -- a lesson that the Eastern European countries are learning  the hard way.    On the energy question, the volatility of the price of intermediate crude oil  could be disastrous for both regions, but probably more so for Eastern Europe.  The price disruptions have hit at a time when Poland and Hungary, like Brazil  and Argentina, are buckling down to complete stringent economic stabilization  programs, while the East Europeans are also trying to make a difficult  full-scale transition to market capitalism. At the same time, the East  Europeans are being called on to devise a set of remedies for ""stagflation,""  the combined effect of rapid inflation and immediate recession. This problem,  familiar to Western officials from previous oil price shocks, is one that the  East, long buffered by state controls, has had little practice in solving. The  East's energy plight is compounded by its oil dependence on the Soviet Union,  which has begun charging its former satellites world prices in hard currency  for petroleum imports.    Latin America's track record in managing oil price hikes has been far from  exemplary. It was, of course, the reckless borrowing of recycled petrodollars  in the 1970s that landed the region in its present debt quagmire. Yet Latin  America does not have to start from scratch in designing the financial  institutions and policy tools for managing the crises commonly related to  energy price shocks. It also has indigenous oil supplies and alternative fuel  resources to fall back on in the event of a long-term supply crunch. In view of  the harsh economic impacts felt the world over from the two major oil supply  disruptions of the 1970s, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that the  latest shocks could set Eastern Europe's market reform effort back several  years.    Finally, for all the economic synergy surrounding ""EC 1992,"" Eastern Europe has  not had much luck getting in on the action. Despite the signing of a joint  declaration that normalized relations between Eastern and Western Europe in  1988, Eastern Europe's trade with the EC stands exactly where it did in 1958,  at just 2.9% of Western Europe's trade balance.    Moreover, Eastern European exporters are still six times more likely to be  hassled by EC ""anti-dumping"" measures than producers from elsewhere. The  improvement of East-West trade ties will be hampered by the comparatively poor  quality of most Eastern products, and because of tensions related to shared  export structures between the East and new EC members like Portugal and Spain.    Latin America, though braced for the worst, has done slightly better with the  EC. Though its highly protectionist barriers on agriculture and other consumer  products show no signs of loosening soon, the EC still purchased 21% of Latin  America's exports in 1988.    Some of the region's more sophisticated firms have begun to operate directly  within the EC, an option that would probably be unthinkable for firms from the  East. This is so with producers of Argentine foodstuffs and several Brazilian  paper-industry companies, all of which have moved into production niches left  empty by investors who could no longer hold costs down within the EC's  hyper-competitive environment.    As West European transnational companies become stronger under the thrust of EC  1992 and seek to expand their production networks into low-cost foreign  locations, Latin America is frequently mentioned as a preferred candidate for  subsidiary component supply operations. Mexico and Brazil are already  successful in that role, producing for U.S. transnationals in such sectors as  motor vehicles, computers and pharmaceuticals.    Again, until a convincing set of price signals and investment norms is in  place, Eastern Europe will not make this short list.    A year ago, the development debate was leaning in favor of a debt bailout for  Latin America, while Eastern Europe was hailed as virgin territory for private  initiative and capital. Now the tables have turned: Although both regions still  need a break on debt, Eastern Europe is clearly going to need a bigger break  from public and private lenders and its immediate neighbors in Western Europe.

One of the aims of my visit is to persuade the Polish  parliamentarians to engage themselves more closely in the  formulation of the future Europe, said Martinez after meeting  Sejm and Senate Speakers Jozef Oleksy and Adam Struzik  respectively.    Speaking after his meeting with Jozef Oleksy, Martinez said  that Poland is playing an important role in the Council of  Europe which will help facilitate and speed up Poland's  integration with the European structures.    Jozef Oleksy said that Poland no longer needed to fight to  justify its place in Europe, and said that he and Martinez were  agreed that Poland should be a driving force for initiatives in  the Council of Europe. Oleksy proposed that the Council of  Europe should open a representative office in Warsaw along with  the lines of the office of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    Adam Struzik said after meeting Martinez that their talks  covered Poland's role in creating a bridge between Western  Europe and eastern neighbours of Poland.    The situation in Poland following the September 1993  parliamentary elections was also touched upon during the  meeting. The visiting president of the Parliamentary Assembly  of the Council of Europe met Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski  to discuss Poland's participation in the Council of Europe's  efforts aimed at European integration and stabilization of  democratic institutions on the continent. The two politicians  reviewed European security issues and the situation in Russia  and Ukraine.    Martinez also met with leader of the parliamentary caucus of  the Democratic Union (UD) Bronislaw Geremek and discussed with  him the question of a possible admission of Russia and Ukraine  to the Council of Europe.    Despite expectations, the talks did not touch upon the  subject of UD's resignation from participation in the Polish  delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of  Europe. The UD's decision came in protest over the election of  Tadeusz Iwinski, an SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) mp, as deputy  president of the assembly.    The principle that decisions on the composition of the  Polish  delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of  Europe are taken in parliament and not outside of it, is the  condition of the presence of Confederation for an independent  Poland (KPN) in the delegation, party leader Leszek Moczulski  said after meeting Martinez.    Moczulski claimed that such decisions should be made by all  parties represented in the Sejm on a consensus basis. He added,  however, that ""from the point of view of a political rivalry in  Poland, the KPN's condition is impossible to be met.""    KPN has been assigned one place in the 12-member delegation  but the party decided not to appoint a party candidate and said  it wants an equal number of delegation members. They are  elected or appointed by the Sejm from among its members and  political parties in the delegation follow the proportion of  their strength in the Sejm.     "

The long negotiations over the Generalised  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, incorporating the Dunkel  proposals, have ended in Geneva, and in Delhi our government,  having accepted the Geneva document, has defended its decision  to accept it. It is one thing to accept the new global trade  regime as a fait accompli and another to espy in it virtues  which do not exist. When the Minister, in defence of the Geneva  outcome, talks of globalisation and gain in world trade  turn-over of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, he is repeating the  obvious, without hazarding even a guess at India's likely share  in this rise. What India's agriculture and the pharmaceutical  industry would lose is by now known. Is there any justification  for understating this grievous loss? India gains nothing if the  government's spokespersons gloss over this side of the reality.    The West's agribusiness and food industry would gain the  most--at the expense of Third World farming countries. If GATT  ensures world trade expansion of even $2 billion a year, that  would be only one per cent of the world's gross national  product. A large part of this gain, to judge by the concessions  the US has extracted under the Dunkel proposals, would go to  Euro-American food MNCs--BSN Groupe, Unilever NV, UBS, among  others. These will have ensured access to Asian markets which  were closed to them. Even the concessions the US was obliged to  make to the French farmers would give protection to temperate  zone farm produce, not to the tropical agricultural products.  Euro-American pharmaceutical companies have reason to celebrate  the occasion. At last they would be able to extract the pound of  flesh from countries like India which have made considerable  progress in being self-sufficient in the manufacture of basic  life-saving drugs. These MNCs have long been demanding that  India pay them royalty for ""imitating"" their unpatented drugs.  Prices of medicines are bound to increase if the Indian  pharmaceutical industry is made to cough out royalty for the  drugs it has long been manufacturing on its own. One only hopes  that in his natural anxiety to welcome the Geneva outcome the  Commerce Minister did not understate the effect the new GATT  regime will have on India's pharmaceutical industry. Already  Zeneca, a drugs MNC, is talking of the money it would recover  from Third World ""imitators."" When France threatened to block  the Dunkel proposals on farming the US made concessions and the  European Community loosened the purse strings to give more  subsidy to French farmers. When Portugal said that it [would]  walk out rather than endanger its uncompetitive textiles  industry, the EC allayed Portugese opposition by guaranteeing  $455 million as compensation for five years. The Indian  defenders of Dunkel have not said how the Geneva meeting has met  India's grievances concerning farm produce, compulsory food  import, patenting of seeds, cut in fertiliser and electricity  subsidies and the continuance of non-tariff protectionist  measures affecting low-cost, labour-intensive commodities  export. While non-tariff measures will continue to deter India's  export of textiles and stitched garments, European manufacturers  of better quality clothes will benefit because the raw material  prices will decline and the Europeans will gain access to the US  market. If the protectionist wall favouring Europe's chemicals  MNCs like BASF AG, ICI of the UK, and DSM NV of the Netherlands  is lowered, these large firms might be persuaded to relocate  their production units to low-income countries where  anti-pollution laws are lax, wages low and the governments are  bending over backwards to please the large foreign companies. A  similar propulsion for relocation of manufacturing business of  labour-intensive industrial products may be generated in other  areas also. Illustratively, textiles unit may move out of Europe  to seek relocation in Afro-Asia. Some ""dirty"" industries  currently under pressure of Europe's anti-pollution laws would  probably seek new homes in Third World countries.    In a world without the cold war and the developing  countries,  including the newly industrialised nations, in no position to  put up a common front against a global trade regime tooled  largely to favour the OECD countries of the northern hemisphere,  India alone cannot tilt against the windmills. But what is  expected of the government of the day is not adventurism but  frankness--the gumption to tell our people that these are the  areas where GATT is going to be inequitous to the less developed  countries, especially India.    If the Indians have decided that discretion is the better  part of valour, the French suffer from no such demoralisation.  Without the Soviets' shadows over West Europe, the Europeans are  able to stand up to the US to say that globalisation cannot mean  Americanisation of the globe, and that Europe's culture is not  going to be swamped by America's audiovisual floods. France  blocked the doors to US films, TV and radio outpourings. Unlike  Indians who have gleefully surrendered to the sky-piracy by  foreign TV networks, France has managed to exclude the  audiovisual products from the new GATT. Europe is not going to  be America's cultural colony. If France has reason to resist  foreign intrusion of European culture (through opening Europe to  US films and TV), India had a great deal more at stake in the  Uruguay Round of talks. The pity of it is that we have stopped  bothering about our stakes. Had we fought for them and lost,  that would have been a different matter. It is clear that we  have no stomach for a fight.     "

The male  pilot was not injured. According to U.S. Forces and Ishikawa  Police Station sources, no cars or people were in the car park  when the plane made its emergency landing, despite the fact it  was Saturday. The airplane was not damaged. And, despite the  fact any slight miscalculation in the maneuver could have caused  disaster, the public relations office of the 18th Flight Wing at  KAB did not file a report on the incident to the prefectural  government until 1700 on 27 March and then provided no details.

Soon, however, other members of the aeroclub  and the U.S. military police arrived at the beach in a truck,  dismantled the wings of the plane, loaded everything onto the  truck, and took the plane back to KAB. Villagers at the beach  for recreation watched the dismantling in wonder.    According to the 18th Flight Wing, its security office is  currently carrying out an investigation into the cause of the  accident.

The aeroclub was discussed at last year's prefectural  assembly session for its alleged involvement in providing  fee-charging sightseeing flights to Japanese.

As a result, it has become likely that there  will be a considerable delay in settling the issue.    The situation is the result of mounting tensions regarding  the issue of the DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons development  program. Trading company officials thus must sit back in despair  while saying, ""It was just a bad time for this business deal.""    The Toen Trading Company (based in Tokyo and capitalized at  30 million yen) acted as the brokerage agent for the submarine  dismantling contract. The company concluded a deal with the  Russian Defense Ministry to take control of 12 old Russian  submarines. When the first submarine was transferred to North  Korea, U.S. intelligence agencies and other relevant agencies  questioned the deal because they suspected that ""North Korea may  possibly recommission the submarines."" MITI then put a ""hold""  on the remaining 11 submarines. If these submarines can  actually be recommissioned, the trading company would be  violating the Foreign Exchange Control Law, which prohibits  commission trade involving weapons.    In response to MITI's inquiry about the submarines, the  Russian Government said that ""they cannot be used as  submarines."" The same conclusion was drawn when photos of the  submarines submitted by the Toen Trading Company were analyzed.    However, MITI recently requested the Russian Government to  permit it to send officials to conduct on-site inspections. A  senior ministry official said, ""If North Korea had not been  involved, it would not have been necessary to confirm matters to  this extent."" He thus admitted that the nuclear issue has much  to do with this situation.    The Russian Government has not yet responded to MITI's  request. This is fine as far as MITI is concerned because it  thus can stall for more time. MITI officials have reportedly  told Toen Trading Company officials, ""Let us take our time and  do it gradually.""     "

This was said by Director of the president's  service on international affairs, Anton Buteyko, at a briefing  on the results of the Ukrainian governmental delegation's visit  to the U.S. in Kiev on Tuesday [1 February].    In his opinion, the signed documents reflected that the U.S.  had finished the assessment and working out of the policy  towards Ukraine. The joint communique and the supplementary  documents underline that the U.S. will pay primary attention to  the democratic and market reforms in Ukraine. The documents  emphasize that Ukraine plays the role of a stabilizer in the  region. That is why its political and economic security is of  exceptional importance for the U.S. and Europe.    Buteyko believes that the U.S. party has decided to allot  economic aid to Russia while taking into consideration these  factors. In his words, the funds will be allotted for  dismantling of nuclear and conventional weapons, for support of  the agricultural reforms and for overcoming of the difficulties  stemming from the transition period.    The briefing's organizers said that the sums of economic aid  would be announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president  to the U.S. planned for March, 1994.    Chief of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's Information  Department, Yuriy Sergeyev, said that he had received the  official authority to comment on the statement of Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the meeting on the foreign  policy of CIS and Baltic States in Moscow. Kozyrev estimated  the ""defense of the rights of Russians in the neighboring states  as one of Russia's priority strategic interests.""    Sergeyev expressed Ukraine's deep concern over the tendency  in Russia of toughning its foreign policy towards the new  independent states.    According to Sergeyev, ""Ukraine understands the necessity to  defend human rights of people not living on their native  territory and tries to guarantee all their rights including the  one for a cultural autonomy."" However, ""we firmly stand against  the intention of any state to resolve the issue on human rights  of the nationalities living beyond its frontier.""    In his words, Ukraine considered it unacceptable that other  states' armed forces be on its territory and supported the  demands that ""all foreign troops"" be withdrawn from Moldova and  Baltic states.

0,FT932-8520 ,"FT932-8520 _AN-DESCQAAUFT 930519   FT  19 MAY 93 / Soviet coup leaders may walk free      By LEYLA BOULTON      MOSCOW   THE trial of the 12 Soviet coup leaders seemed set to disintegrate yesterday after a judge ordered the dismissal of the prosecuting team for prejudging the outcome by publishing a book about the defendants. Presiding judge Anatoly Ukolov granted a motion by the defence that the prosecutors should be removed from the case because of 'serious violations' of legal procedure by the Russian prosecutor-general, Mr Valentin Stepankov, and his deputy, Mr Yevgeny Lisov. Defence lawyers had argued for the prosecutors' dismissal on grounds of bias. They alleged that Mr Stepankov and Mr Lisov had violated defendants' rights last year when they published a book, Kremlin Plot, that described them as criminals. Mr Stepankov is not personally prosecuting the case, but was responsible for appointing the prosecution lawyers. The decision by the military branch of the Supreme Court to suspend the trial pending a decision by parliament on what to do next is a stinging indictment of the prosecution's incompetence and an embarrassment for President Boris Yeltsin. It is now unlikely that the men who declared a state of emergency on August 19, 1991, and brought tanks into Moscow to prevent what they saw as the collapse of the Soviet Union will ever be brought to justice. There were bad omens from the very start, when Mr Stepankov had the 12 indicted on the charge of betraying the Soviet motherland - which the defendants argued they were trying to save. The charges had to revised subsequently in order to make them more likely to stick. In the meantime, video-taped interrogations of the accused were sold to the media and the culprits in the prosecutor's office were never discovered. Having already degenerated into near farce, the trial is unlikely to recover from this latest blow. Deputies, locked in confrontation with President Yeltsin over his determination to dissolve the conservative-dominated parliament, are unlikely to take any decision to help the trial along. Even if it does, the defendants' lawyers have a an arsenal of other delaying tactics, including the ability to declare any of the elderly defendants too ill to attend. The trial only resumed yesterday after being suspended three days after it opened when Mr Alexander Tizyakov, the 67-year-old former leader of a hardline industrialists' union, was taken to hospital with heart trouble. But despite being released from jail on grounds of illness pending the final judgment, two of the other defendants, Mr Vladimir Kryuchkov, the former KGB chief, and Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, head of the Soviet parliament, have been attending anti-Yeltsin demonstrations and meetings of the recently-unbanned Communist party. The popular scorn they faced at the time has now given way to mixed feelings in society, with many people regretting the passing of the Soviet Union despite the fact that its demise was accelerated by the coup attempt. Intended to provide a lesson in democracy, the trial has become a victim of the fragility of Russia's democratic institutions - in this case an incompetent and unfocused prosecutor general's office.

""The presidents have reached a consensus that this plan should go forward right  away,"" President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said during a break in the talks in  this Caribbean banana port.    Other presidents withheld comment and kept meeting to complete details of an  updated regional peace accord, but senior Costa Rican and Salvadoran aides  confirmed the decision.      Quick Start to Disarmament    John Biehl, a close adviser to President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica,  said the process of disarming Nicaraguan rebel troops would start ""almost  immediately,"" as soon as a commission is set up by the United Nations and the  Organization of American States and dispatched to the Contra bases in Honduras  to supervise the plan.    The disarmed rebels would be repatriated to Nicaragua if they wished or  relocated in third countries. How long this process would take is still under  discussion, Biehl said, but the issue is expected to be settled before today's  scheduled conclusion of the three-day summit.    The tentative agreement, if signed today, would apparently defeat a White House  effort to keep the idled, 11,000-member Contra army intact in its bases until  after Ortega's Sandinista government holds national elections next Feb. 25.    It would also bring pressure on the U.S. Congress to divert what is left of the  Contras' current $47.9 million non-lethal aid package to the exclusive purpose  of assisting their return to civilian life.    Bush telephoned Arias and presidents Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador, Vinicio  Cerezo Arevalo of Guatemala and Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras last week to press  his view that a large Contra army is the only way to hold Ortega to his promise  that the election will be fair.    But some Central American officials said that Bush's publicized appeal was  probably aimed more at soothing his right-wing critics at home than swaying his  allies in the region.    ""Nobody here was convinced that Mr. Bush wants to continue supporting the  Contras,"" one official said. ""Everybody knows that the Contras are finished as  a fighting force.""    Rebel bands began fighting in Nicaragua a year after the Sandinistas seized  power in a 1979 guerrilla uprising. They have received U.S. aid and direction  since late 1981.    The movement has been steadily weakened by peace accords signed at three  previous regional summits over the past two years. Most rebel troops withdrew  to Honduras last year after their U.S. military aid was cut off and a  cease-fire pact signed with the Sandinistas in March, 1988, broke down over the  issue of democratic reforms.    Under the last summit accord, signed six months ago, the five presidents agreed  to draft, at the current meeting, a plan for closing the Contra camps in  exchange for free elections in Nicaragua nine months ahead of schedule.      Dramatic Gesture    With that trade-off topping the agenda here, Ortega strengthened his hand with  a dramatic gesture in Nicaragua on the eve of the summit.    In an all-night session with 22 anti-Sandinista parties that was televised live  in his country, he achieved a landmark agreement on political and electoral  reforms to ensure a fair campaign.    Among Ortega's concessions were a suspension of military conscription during  the six-month campaign period, abolition of Sandinista police powers to conduct  arbitrary arrests and summary trials, and a series of technical reforms making  it easier for opposition parties to monitor the February vote.    Opposition politicians in Nicaragua hailed the accord as a vindication of the  Contra cause and urged Central American leaders to adopt a plan to dissolve the  insurgency.    ""The agreement reached in Nicaragua was absolutely decisive,"" Biehl said. ""It  cleared away 90% of the agenda here.""    Ortega arrived here Saturday and handed a copy of the 40-point agreement to  Azcona, saying the electoral guarantees ""remove all pretexts"" for allowing  armed Contras to remain on Honduran soil.      Push for Deadline    In the meeting here, Ortega pushed for a 90-day deadline for disarming the  rebels and closing the camps.    He won qualified support from Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for  starting the regional peace process and who helped set up the negotiations that  produced the election reforms.    Arias said that dismantling the Contras should be gradual ""but not conditional  on the Nicaraguan elections.""    At first it appeared that Azcona and Cristiani might block the peace plan.    The Honduran leader said the electoral agreement in Nicaragua was ""not enough.""  He offered his own plan for a lengthy inspection by international observers of  political conditions in Nicaragua before disarmament could start.    But that plan was largely abandoned, with Azcona's acquiescence, when other  presidents failed to back it, Central American officials said.      Impatient With Administration    The United States has long depended on Honduras to carry U.S. views in Central  America. But Azcona has become impatient over the Bush Administration's failure  to come up with its own plan for getting the Contras out of his country,  fearing that they will dissolve into uncontrolled armed bands.    He was also reported to be uncertain whether Washington's withholding of $70  million in promised economic aid was meant to force him to make an unpopular  currency devaluation or to keep the Contras around -- either of which would  damage his party's candidate in Honduras' scheduled November elections.    ""Azcona doesn't want to be remembered as the president who stuck Honduras with  the Contras,"" an official of another Central American country said in  explaining the unanimous backing for an early demobilization.    Like Azcona, Arias will leave office early next year and was eager to see the  Nicaraguan conflict settled by then.    Cristiani's new right-wing government in El Salvador, however, had threatened  to complicate a peace accord by insisting that leftist guerrillas in his  country be disbanded in tandem with the Contras.    But other presidents rejected any linkage in resolving the two very different  guerrilla conflicts. They were reported near an agreement to call for peace  talks in El Salvador -- the first in nearly two years -- as an unrelated item  of the final summit accord.

But Azcona has become impatient over the Bush Administration's failure  to come up with its own plan for getting the Contras out of his country,  fearing that they will dissolve into uncontrolled armed bands.    He was also reported to be uncertain whether Washington's withholding of $70  million in promised economic aid was meant to force him to make an unpopular  currency devaluation or to keep the Contras around -- either of which would  damage his party's candidate in Honduras' scheduled November elections.    ""Azcona doesn't want to be remembered as the president who stuck Honduras with  the Contras,"" an official of another Central American country said in  explaining the unanimous backing for an early demobilization.    Like Azcona, Arias will leave office early next year and was eager to see the  Nicaraguan conflict settled by then.    Cristiani's new right-wing government in El Salvador, however, had threatened  to complicate a peace accord by insisting that leftist guerrillas in his  country be disbanded in tandem with the Contras.    But other presidents rejected any linkage in resolving the two very different  guerrilla conflicts. They were reported near an agreement to call for peace  talks in El Salvador -- the first in nearly two years -- as an unrelated item  of the final summit accord.

Naturally, when local authorities decide to rid their residents  of an enhanced radiation danger source, the latter react to this  as manifestation of special care being shown to them. There is  nothing bad about this, yet it is not always that the best  possible methods are found to resolve such problems.    As RIA Novosti reported, the radiation aboard the TNT-5  tanker, filled with radioactive waste from Pacific Fleet nuclear  submarines, has deteriorated. The vessel, moored at the Zvezda  plant in Bolshoy Kamen Bay, has developed a leak in its  drainage, pipe, and valve system, as a result of which the  radiation level in the aft engine room since the previous check  (on 28 December 1993) has doubled, reaching 1,400  microroentgen/hr.    This conclusion, according to the news agency, was made  yesterday by a team of specialists created on orders of the  Maritime Kray administration. Experts believe that in April-May  the situation could aggravate rapidly; in the end this could  lead in particular to the shutdown of the Zvezda plant, which is  engaged in dismantling nuclear submarines under the START II  Treaty. RIA Novosti also reported, citing Yevgeniy Stomastyuk,  chairman of the Maritime Kray Environmental Protection  Committee, that in order to avoid a major ecological catastrophe  the commission deems it expedient to dump the liquid nuclear  waste aboard the TNT-5 tanker into the Sea of Japan this May.    SEGODNYA's correspondent managed to obtain a comment from  employees at the State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear  and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor], an organization in charge  of radiation safety on a Russia-wide scale. Gosatomnadzor  representatives believe that because matters of ecological and  radiation security come under the jurisdiction of federal  authorities, such a decision by a local commission can be only  of a recommendatory character. SEGODNYA's correspondent also  learned that Gosatomnadzor has decided not to allow the dumping  of radiative substances into the sea but to pump the liquid  waste from the tanker to other vessels which are in good  condition; the TNT-5 itself, after corresponding treatment, will  be towed to a safe place.

Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, welcomed what he called 'yet another attempt' to come to grips with 'signs of aggressive nationalism, xenophobia and ethnic and religious intolerance.' But he then underlined that 'the decisive role' in constructing a new Europe with Russian participation should be played by the 52-Nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and Nato's 'Partnership for Peace (PFP)'. In a speech which reinforced the call for a new European security order by General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister at this week's Nato meeting in Brussels, Mr Kozyrev said: 'Enhancing the effectiveness of the CSCE, making it the supreme political organisation on the continent, is the key element in our proposed concept of European partnership.' The three former Soviet Baltic states were looking for a clear Russian commitment to the withdrawal of the remaining Russian troops and equipment from Estonia and Latvia. But Mr Kozyrev merely left open the possibility of Russian participation in the proposed Baltic 'round table'. This is designed as a forum to facilitate an equitable solution to the protection of the rights of Russian and other minorities in the Baltic states and the total withdrawal of Russian forces. The Russian minister described the stability conference as a 'unique' process but noted that it involved the 12 current and nine aspiring members of the EU but did 'not create additional obligations for states which are not directly involved in it.' Russia, which this week agreed to join the Partnership for Peace, is not an applicant for EU membership. For Russia to participate in the round table's work he made clear that it should not dwell on the military aspects but 'concentrate on specific steps to improve inter-ethnic relations and to ensure the rights of national minorities .. especially in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.' The military and political dimensions of Europe's security, he said 'should find its place within a framework of broader efforts' than the EU-sponsored security pact conference. 'We attach serious significance to the forthcoming Istanbul ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council (NACC),' he added. The main focus of the proposed security pact, as outlined by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, in his opening statement is to resolve contentious ethnic and border issues and prevent future Yugoslav-style eruptions. But the foreign ministers of Poland, the Czech republic and other central European and Baltic participants rejected suggestions that eastern European countries that want to join the EU be subjected to special treatment with regard to minority rights but be subject to what Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's foreign minister, described as 'accepted pan-European standards.'

The veiled threat was contained in the report the European  Union executive presented here today on the state of  restructuring plans by European public steel concerns, approved  by the European Industry Council last December.    The warning was also aimed, sources at the European  Commission said, at Germany and its plan for Ekostahl, and  Spain's plan for CIS.    Karel van Miert, the European Commissioner responsible for  competition, on Wednesday [27 April] stressed the need to have  ""all information necessary, from interested countries, to verify  progress made in the restructuring plans for which state aid has  been authorized. The overall credibility of the plans, in fact,  will depend on the respect of these conditions."" Van Miert went  on to say that not all countries in question have offered the  full data requested in the time required.    This question was already raised by the European Commission  last week, during the Industry Council in Luxembourg, at which  time Italian Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta promised to  promptly forward lacking data from IRI [Institute for Italian  Reconstruction] on the application of the Ilva plan. He also  reiterated Italy's determination to respect the commitments made  last December on the time-table and methods to restructure the  country's public steel sector.    Nations in the process of restructuring their public steel  companies were to have forwarded to the European Commission, by  March 15, data on the reduction of production capacity,  investments, job cuts, market conditions, financial results and  on privatization drives.    The plan the European Union approved for Ilva foresaw the  closure in Taranto, by the end of June, of two blast furnaces,  for a production cut of 1.2 million tons, and a further 500 ton  cut through the sale of ILP. The plan also called for the total  dismantling of the Bagnoli plant, outside Naples, while the  sales if ILP and AST must take place before the end of the  current year.     "
0,FT944-17654 ,"FT944-17654 _AN-EJGDBABHFT 941007   FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: EU urged to shift focus to Asian markets      By EMMA TUCKER      BRUSSELS   The European Union yesterday turned its attention eastwards, amid mounting criticism that Europe risks losing out on Asia's 'economic miracle' by being too slow to develop political and economic ties. At a conference in Brussels, Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner responsible for foreign affairs, warned the European Union needed to shift its focus rapidly towards greater trade with Asian markets. 'The task is now to make a reality of what we all accept as an objective - better economic ties between the EU and Asia,' said Sir Leon. But Mr Nicolas Maclean, the chairman for Asia of Unice, the European employers' federation, said: 'This forum is about 20 years overdue. For far too long, many EU companies have held Asian markets at arm's length and have now woken up to the fact that they are missing out.' Over the summer, the Commission published its first ever strategy document on Asia designed to launch a radical rethink of EU strategy. It warned that if European companies were unable to earn an adequate share of Asian growth over the next decade, their worldwide profits and competitiveness would be affected. This in turn could exacerbate calls for more protectionist policies from those in Europe who view Asia as a threat, rather than a lucrative opportunity. Last month, foreign ministers from the EU and the six Asean countries agreed to intensify political and economic relations, as well as to reinforce dialogue in such areas as security and the environment. However, significant differences in view also emerged from the meeting, in particular Asean opposition to EU efforts to link trade to human rights and the conditions of workers. At yesterday's conference of 150 business leaders, organised by the European Commission and the Financial Times, the opening speeches by Sir Leon and Mr Manuel Marin, commissioner responsible for co-operation and development with Asia, avoided such issues. Both speakers concentrated instead on Europe's enthusiasm to develop links. Mr Marin said a positive message on Asia had to be communicated to Europe's citizens: 'Increased demand in Asia for European products, services and expertise will obviously boost job growth and prospects in Europe.' However, he pointed out that collaboration with Asian companies did not appear to be a top priority with most European companies. According to the Commission paper, a number of factors are at play. These include a lack of understanding of the Asian business environment and the lack of a clearly defined image of Europe in Asia. Mr Maclean said three things had to happen if Europe was to be truly effective in trading with Asia. First, bureaucratic pressure had to be eased in Europe, to allow companies to be as competitive as possible. The member states also had to act in co-ordination, and make real attempts to understand the different Asian cultures. 'If we ignore this, then culture will remain the greatest non-tariff barrier to our chances of strengthening our economic presence in Asia,' he said.   Countries:-  BEZ  Belgium, EC.

0,FT933-9379 ,"FT933-9379 _AN-DHJCNAELFT 930810   FT  10 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Soft on the hard Ecu   THE BRITISH proposal for a hard Ecu, originally put forward by Mr John Major when chancellor in 1990, was not without its merits. But whether it will become more than a marginal talking point again in the aftermath of the near-terminal upheaval in the exchange rate mechanism seems altogether questionable. The case for a parallel currency which would never depreciate against any existing currency within the ERM was originally made in the context of a very powerful impetus towards economic and monetary union. While the Maastricht timetable for Emu remains theoretically intact, monetary union inevitably looks more remote after recent events. The D-Mark - a softer option than the hard Ecu - has anyway proved too much even for the franc fort. In short, the problems of the EC after Maastricht are not ones to which the hard Ecu looks relevant. The important thing now is to ensure that Europe gets its larger priorities right. The first essential is to absorb the message implicit in the ERM's loss of credibility in the markets. The pressure on the system came mainly from the idea that the attempt on the part of France and other countries to retain a fixed relationship with the D-Mark in the period of German unification was doomed to failure. With Germany running a combination of tight monetary policy and lax fiscal policy, the ERM became a mechanism for transmitting a needless recession across Europe. Macro-economic stringency was thus added to the micro problems of Europe's over-rigid labour markets. The resulting upward pressure on unemployment numbers raised doubts about the political commitment to a hard ERM, notably in France. On this the markets judged better than the politicians. And in seeking to establish what can be salvaged, it is important to recognise that the level of interest rates appropriate for the German economy is unlikely to make sense for much of the rest of Europe for some time to come. It follows that any response to the ERM debacle that involves the French government in seeking a swift dash for monetary union would simply compound the damage. It would also perpetuate the chief political error in the Maastricht process, whereby the integrationist instincts of Europe's political elite ran far ahead of public opinion. It seems unlikely that such a move would anyway appeal to Germany, where opinion polls suggest considerable hostility to the loss of the D-Mark. Nor will an early narrowing the ERM bands amount to much more than an invitation to market participants to test the resolve of the central banks once again. The more pressing need is for some wider rebalancing of economic policy. A more responsible German fiscal policy will no doubt take time. But the Bank of France's decision yesterday to cut short-term rates by a quarter of a point was a modest but useful step in a sensible direction: a lot more of the same is required.

But he conceded that the 12 finance ministers were far from a consensus on all  the delicate issues involved in abandoning such currencies as the British  pound, the German mark and the French franc.    EC President Jacques Delors proclaimed himself optimistic that European heads  of state could advance the cause of monetary union when they meet in Rome in  December.    Delors is the author of a 1989 report urging movement toward a single European  currency promptly after the 12 EC nations create a single market for goods and  services as of Jan. 1, 1993. A single currency, in Delors' view, would bind the  European economies more closely together and eliminate the cost of exchanging  money from one currency to another as it crosses borders.    Although France and some of Europe's smaller nations have signed on to the  Delors formula, officials in Germany and, more particularly, Britain have  balked.    Pohl, less favorably disposed toward currency union than German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl, has argued that Germany's vigilantly anti-inflationary monetary  policy might fall victim to a common monetary policy for all of Europe.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has warned that to accept a common  European currency would be to abandon an important aspect of national  sovereignty.    Earlier this year, Major launched an alternative proposal to establish not a  single currency for all of Europe but a pan-European currency that could be  used even as the existing 11 currencies (Belgium and Luxembourg share the  Belgian franc) stayed in use.    A single European currency cannot work, Major said after Saturday's meeting,  unless all nations adopt matching economic policies. Although conceding that  none of the other finance ministers supported the British position in full, he  said many of them expressed support for elements of the plan.    The 12 EC members range from the German juggernaut to the relatively weak  economies of Greece and Portugal, and Major said the weaker nations would face  massive unemployment and a collapse of asset values if they were yoked to the  tight monetary policies that the larger European nations would demand.

0,FT933-13300 ,"FT933-13300 _AN-DGTCCADVFT 930720   FT  20 JUL 93 / Bonn urged to support free EC labour market: Clarke rules out retreat into a 'fortress Europe'      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor of the exchequer, last night sought to win Germany as an ally for the UK government's policy of freer trade and deregulation of European labour markets to reduce unemployment. The European Community, he told an audience in Munich, could 'either compete or retreat'. Ruling out retreat into a 'fortress Europe', Mr Clarke stressed the need for the EC to become more competitive rather than try to preserve its high labour costs behind a protectionist wall. 'Every regulation that adds costs, loses jobs,' he told the Deutsch-Englische Gesellschaft (Anglo-German Society). Underlining the government's opposition to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, he said the UK would 'continue to fight hard against the legal imposition on all enterprises, big and small, of shorter working weeks, statutory paternity leave, higher social security benefits, regulated pay bargaining systems, the forced introduction of new technology and so on'. Speaking just three days before the crucial House of Commons vote on the treaty's social chapter, Mr Clarke said the chapter 'would impose unnecessary extra costs on business and act as a barrier to employment'. He defended the UK's social provision 'as one of the best all-round systems of welfare in Europe', saying that Britain 'had no intention of going back to an era of sweatshops and poverty labour'. Mr Clarke's visit to Germany, less than two months after he became chancellor, is a clear demonstration that he sets greater store by close ties with Britain's EC partners than did his Euro-sceptic predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont. But his trip, which included meetings with Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president-designate, and business leaders, had a strategic purpose. Building on UK initiatives at last month's EC summit in Copenhagen and the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo two weeks ago, Mr Clarke was seeking German backing for a campaign to move EC policy in the direction of labour market reform and deregulation, and freer trade. 'Labour markets are the crux of Europe's economic woes. Over-rigid, over-regulated and overpriced,' Mr Clarke said. 'The first step must be for EC governments to look at the whole range of extra costs we force on businesses by excessive regulation,' he declared. European unemployment had grown 'inexorably', he said. The 17m unemployed in the Community were 'the best measure of two decades of European economic decline'. Mr Clarke said it was a measure of Europe's loss of self-confidence that emerging economies such as in China and Latin America were regarded as a threat. The way forward for Europe, he said, was 'to compete, to look outwards, open our markets further, train our labour force better and believe that we can take the share of opportunities which the widening of economic prosperity presents'.

Final      Business; Part P; Page 3; Column 5; Late Final Desk      416 words      SOVIETS TELL COMECON IT MUST END ISOLATION      From Associated Press      SOFIA, Bulgaria      The Soviet Union today proposed that the Comecon trading bloc begin trading on  a hard currency basis at world prices next year to end four decades of  isolation from the world economy.    The proposal came on the first day of a private meeting of Soviet and Eastern  European leaders, joined by leaders of Mongolia, Vietnam and Cuba. East  European leaders welcomed the idea but said it should be implemented slowly.    Comecon officials who briefed reporters after the session said the Soviets  suggested hard currency trading at world market prices begin in 1991, replacing  trading in the non-convertible Soviet ruble.    Members of the 10-nation Soviet-led trading bloc, founded in 1949, have agreed  that a radical overhaul is needed if the group is to survive and keep pace with  changes under way in Eastern Europe, where democracy is taking hold and members  are abandoning central planning.    Vladimir Dlouhy, a reform Communist who chairs Czechoslovakia's state planning  commission, told reporters the Soviet proposal would be ""a disaster"" if  introduced immediately and said a transitional period is essential.    Poland's non-Communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said the transition  period for fuels and raw materials should run until 1995. Other trade should be  carried out on the basis of bilateral agreements, Mazowiecki said.

The proposal came on the first day of a private meeting of Soviet and Eastern  European leaders, joined by leaders of Mongolia, Vietnam and Cuba. East  European leaders welcomed the idea but said it should be implemented slowly.    Comecon officials who briefed reporters after the session said the Soviets  suggested hard currency trading at world market prices begin in 1991, replacing  trading in the non-convertible Soviet ruble.    Members of the 10-nation Soviet-led trading bloc, founded in 1949, have agreed  that a radical overhaul is needed if the group is to survive and keep pace with  changes under way in Eastern Europe, where democracy is taking hold and members  are abandoning central planning.    Vladimir Dlouhy, a reform Communist who chairs Czechoslovakia's state planning  commission, told reporters the Soviet proposal would be ""a disaster"" if  introduced immediately and said a transitional period is essential.    Poland's non-Communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said the transition  period for fuels and raw materials should run until 1995. Other trade should be  carried out on the basis of bilateral agreements, Mazowiecki said.

Indeed GEC could well save money by buing those Ferranti operations it wants from the receiver instead of footing an Pounds 11.4m acquisition bill and assuming responsibility of Ferranti's net debts, contingent liabilities and overdue creditors' payments totalling about Pounds 155m. The dismantling of Ferranti actually began in 1989 following the discovery of huge fraud in International Signal and Control, the US subsidiary which Ferranti acquired in 1987. The ISC fraud blew a massive hole in Ferranti's balance sheet and forced Ferranti's management, led by Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman, to embark on a Pounds 500m asset sale programme to try to keep Ferranti afloat. In the process its workforce was cut from 22,000 to less than 3,700 and bank debts were reduced from Pounds 689m in 1989 to about Pounds 100m at the end of September. GEC picked the prize fruit of the Ferranti empire after the ISC debacle, paying Pounds 310m in 1990 for its radar division. The business included the project leadership for the radar to equip the European Fighter Aircraft. Last year, GEC-Marconi bought the company's missile business for Pounds 38m. In its offer document for Ferranti issued at the start of November, GEC identified four other areas where a combination of both group's operations would result in business units 'better placed to win orders for defence equipment at home and overseas.' These are combat management systems for surface ships and submarines; air defence command, control and communications systems; ship and submarine sonars; simulation and training products. It is assumed that these are the businesses which GEC might be interested in acquiring from the receivers. Among these assets Ferranti's sonar operations were folded into a joint venture with Thomson-CSF, the French defence group, in 1990 and its investment was valued at Pounds 25.7m in the latest accounts. Putting a value on Ferranti's other assets is difficult, particularly since much of the potential value to a purchaser probably lay in the experience of its workforce which may now be dissipated.

0,FT932-12221 ,"FT932-12221 _AN-DD2CUAEAFT 930429   FT  29 APR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Iron curtain in the way of trade      By SAMUEL BRITTAN   Let us imagine that someone had predicted 10 years ago the collapse of Europe's communist regimes. He would have been dismissed as an optimistic fool. Suppose that he had then gone on to say that after a hard struggle to reform their economies, the former communist countries would find their goods banned by a European Community that claimed to be operating a single market? He would have been dismissed this time as a Soviet agent trying to fob off dissidents with horror stories. Unfortunately, horror stories have a habit of coming true. According to an analysis by Jim Rollo and Alastair Smith in the April issue of Economic Policy (published by the Cambridge University Press), between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the exports of central and eastern European countries fall in the 'sensitive' category. This means they are liable to face EC barriers over and above the modest common external tariff. For Hungary, the worst hit country, the proportion may be as much as 58 per cent. For Poland and the former Czechoslovakia it is about 44 per cent. The percentages are based on the last 'pre-transition' year, 1989. Since then exports of these sensitive products have risen less than total exports, Poland being an exception. The high level of EC protection is the most likely cause of the poor performance of these sensitive sectors. Three of the most advanced central European countries - Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia (as it then was) - signed 'Europe' agreements with the Community which came into effect on March 1 1992. Romania and Bulgaria have subsequently followed suit. These agreements committed the signatories to industrial free trade to be achieved within 10 years. In principle, the EC countries will dismantle their barriers faster, in about five years. Unfortunately, as Rollo and Smith put it, 'there remains a core group of goods for which substantial protection remains in place, either permanently or for some years, or for which past protectionist behaviour on the part of the EC suggests that liberalisation may be more apparent than real. These are generally characterised as 'sensitive' products.' The protective instruments used by the EC are all too familiar: tariff quotas, import ceilings, 'voluntary' restraints and anti-dumping procedures. The six main sensitive manufacturing sectors are: processed foods, textiles, clothing, footwear, steel and chemicals. Free access to agricultural produce would not be possible without dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy - good sense we cannot expect. The characteristic instrument of the CAP is the variable import levy designed to achieve a target level of EC farm-gate prices. The main form of concession to non-member countries would normally be a levy-free quota. A more radical solution, short of abolishing CAP, would be actual membership of the Community for the central Europeans, which still remains an aspiration without a timetable. Rollo and Smith attempt to measure the effects of extensive liberalisation on EC producers and consumers. The loss to EC farm producers is put at 3 per cent of total revenue spread over a period. This is much less than the falls in real farm prices between 1985 and 1991 and very much less than the cuts under CAP reform negotiated in conjunction with the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. The effects will be most severe in Greece, Ireland and certain regions of Italy and France. The authors estimate that the gains to consumers and taxpayers in the EC from lower agricultural prices will be sufficient to compensate the farmers who lose and still leave Community consumers and taxpayers better off. The same would be true in manufactures, although the size of producers' losses would be less. What could happen without liberalisation was outlined by Hans-Werner Sinn, of Munich University, in the same issue of Economic Policy. He did not believe that the patience of former communist countries was infinite. If they did not enter a self-sustained growth process in the next few years, new nationalist movements might gain power, which would revert to centralised decisions or even dictatorship. This would be the end of the reform process. Western Europe would again be forced to increase its military spending, borders would be closed and the cold war would return. 'This would create huge welfare losses for the west which dwarf the temporary difficulties of some sensitive sectors.' Signs that central European politicians were indeed running out of patience were evident at a conference in Copenhagen in April between ministers of the EC and some former communist countries. The atmosphere was not improved by an EC temporary ban on meat and dairy products from that region because of foot-and-mouth disease. The Czech foreign minister, Mr Pavel Bratinka, noted that there had been no foot-and-mouth disease in his country since 1974. He added: 'From now on, the almost automatic support given hitherto by the Czech republic to anything bearing the label EC will exist no more.' There were several cases of foot-in-mouth from the Community side. The new French minister for European affairs, Alain Lamassoure, pleaded for greater commercial integration in the east to teach la vie communautaire. He thought it an absurd paradox that eastern Europeans were demanding free trade with the west while maintaining barriers with their neighbours. He received a prompt answer from the forthright Hungarian foreign minister, Geza Jeszenszky, who said: 'East-west trade is simply superior to east-east trade.' Hungary, Poland and the former Czechoslovakia have indeed launched the Visegrad project, which involves mutual free trade over 10 years. But western attempts to get them to include more former communist countries in the arrangement as an alternative to turning west are misguided. Why this is so is well explained in another publication, this time by Daniel Gros and Alfred Steinherr (Redesigning Economic Geography After the Fall of the Soviet Empire, Centre for European Policy Studies, Brussels). The authors show that the normal development of trade is between rich countries with large amounts of capital relative to labour, and less developed countries with less capital. At this stage, there is little trade between countries with similar capital and labour endowments. That comes later when countries are developed enough to specialise in the industrial goods exchanged among the rich. The authors illustrate the point with the example of the Baltic states. Until recently more than 80 per cent of the total trade of the Baltic countries was with the former Soviet Union. On the other hand, Finland, which is in a very similar position, conducted only about 11 per cent of its trade with the former Soviet Union and 45 per cent with the Community. The reason, of course, was that the Baltic states had no choice while Finland could mostly follow its commercial advantage. The inference is that left to themselves, the Baltic states will want to switch the bulk of their trade towards western Europe. The two Brussels authors make a strong plea for a wider free trade area, including not only central and eastern Europe but most of the former Soviet Union. This should surely be the next project after the Maastricht treaty is out of the way. This need not prevent those European countries that are ready from going full-speed ahead towards monetary union. But they need an economic framework not provided by Maastricht for a much bigger new single market covering most of Europe, and a looser political framework in which subsidiarity would be more than a word.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PRODUCTS FACING EC BARRIERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SHARES IN TOTAL EXPORTS TO EC 1989 (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Czechoslovakia  Hungary  Poland  Bulgaria  Romania  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Iron  steel                    12.5      4.9     5.3      10.5      5.0 Chemicals                       11.6     10.0     6.7      11.8      4.4 Footwear, textiles    apparel                     12.6     17.6    11.7      11.6     19.5 Food  live animals              8.0     25.3    19.9      16.3      3.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                           44.8     57.8    43.8      50.2     32.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EXPORT DESTINATIONS 1989 (% OF TOTAL EXPORTS)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Czechoslovakia    Hungary    Poland  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                                15.7       25.0      28.9 USSR                              30.5       25.1      24.5 Other Eastern Europe              23.3       15.9      16.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Rollo and Smith, Economic Policy, Cambridge University Press, April 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Diplomats and politicians engaged in intense backroom  wrangling over the succession to French Socialist Jacques Delors  as President of the European Commission. Gathering in huddles,  journalists talked of little else.    ""Sometimes, the interests of the media and the interests of  political people do meet,"" Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen  told reporters here.    ""I'm afraid that today they don't. And I'd rather prefer if  we talk about unemployment or how to make concrete means  available to ordinary people.""    The economy was the main topic of discussion at the  afternoon  session of talks between EU leaders, British officials stressed  Friday.    ""And we have talked about unemployment many times in the  past.""    The discussions among leaders and finance ministers  concentrated on four main topics, the British  said.     -  Macroeconomic policy, covering price stability, sound  public finances and labour market flexibility.    -  A report by  European Commissioner Martin Bangemann on liberalisation of the  markets, particularly in telecommunications.    -  Discussion of ways  to implement the European Commission's Trans European Networks  proposals, covering 11 road, rail and telecommunications  projects across Europe.    -  And a German proposal to set up a task  force on deregulation, tackling the ""difficulties of creating  jobs in Europe, and for small- and medium-sized businesses.""     The projects for Trans European Networks formed a key  element  in Delors' white paper on unemployment, issued last year, which  set out a massive investment programme for the community.    At a Brussels press conference earlier this week, Delors was  critical of ""two or perhaps three EU countries,"" which have  blocked his plan for significant public sector involvement in  funding the projects.    This was a reference to Britain, France and Germany, which  do  not want to raise their public debt in order to pay for an  ambitious multimillion dollar investment programme for  transport, energy and telecom networks.    Delors said he feared that EU leaders might ditch a  Commission proposal for measures to increase competitiveness and  create jobs, because of signs that their countries were emerging  economic recession.    Even annual economic growth of 2.5 or three percent was not  enough to bring down unemployment which is expected to peak at  11.6 percent in 1995 -- meaning nearly 20 million people will be  out of work, he said.    Officials close to Delors admit that the Commission's plans  -- to pay for the investment programme and to reduce social  charges levied to pay for social programmes and raise the money  through a new energy tax -- have been largely gutted.    Of the 11 projects which were expected to be approved at the  summit, many have already been all but decided, and they  represent just a small slice of Delors' original plans,  Commission officials said.    ""Unemployment has not been dropped from the summit. It is  just that the ideas coming to the fore are of a different  political complexion than those that were previously in the  front,"" a source close to the Commission said.     "

Nursultan Nazarbayev said this in Kiev, where he is on an  official visit. The Kazakh president pointed out that he is  ready to sign a new agreement with Russia either on a bilateral  basis or on a quadrilateral basis involving Ukraine and Belarus.  In the next few days he will be going to Washington to discuss  these problems with Bill Clinton.    Russia believed that the matter of compensation for the  nuclear material in the strategic missiles due for removal from  Kazakhstan was in principle closed. There are agreements on  this point. Almaty, like Kiev and Minsk, should receive its  share after deduction of expenditure on the reprocessing of  highly enriched uranium and its transportation and storage at  Russian plants.    However, all the indications are that the method of  calculation adopted earlier does not suit the Kazakh side. It  intends to follow the example of Ukraine, which succeeded a week  ago in obtaining $1 billion on signing the trilateral agreement  with Russia and the United States in Moscow. This money is  being given to Ukraine out of the sum appropriated by the U.S.  Congress for the nuclear disarmament of the CIS countries under  the START I treaty. It has become known that Almaty is hoping  for similar compensation.    In other words, Kazakhstan, like Ukraine, has decided not to  wait for funds to come into its account from the sale of uranium  by its Russian partners, whom it is not inclined to trust very  much. It is obviously safer to get insurance now, in the form of  a guaranteed billion out of the U.S. quota.    Experts believe that in that event Russia will have to take  on additional expenditure for the safe dismantling of nuclear  warheads in the possession of its CIS neighbors. It cannot be  rule out that Belarus will demand its share in the same way,  although some of the uranium has already been shipped out of its  territory to Russia for reprocessing. When it hosted Bill  Clinton recently, Minsk received $100 million from this same  package. But now, REUTER reports, Belarus is laying claim to a  further $500 million.     "

0,FT933-5289 ,"FT933-5289 _AN-DIEAAAACFT 930904   FT  04 SEP 93 / Ukraine set to surrender its nuclear arsenal: Russia offers debt deal on fleet and warheads      By JOHN LLOYD and DAVID WHITE      MOSCOW, LONDON   UKRAINE appeared ready yesterday to surrender its status as a nuclear power when it agreed in principle to transfer all its nuclear warheads to Russia for dismantling. It is also to sell the Ukrainian share of the jointly-controlled Black Sea fleet to Russia, which will rent the port of Sevastopol, the main Black Sea base. In return, Moscow will write off a substantial amount of Ukrainian debt to Russia and supply uranium for its power stations. The surprise agreement came at talks in the Crimea between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. It must still be ratified by the two countries' parliaments, where it will face opposition from nationalist deputies, especially in Ukraine. If implemented, the agreement will come as a relief to the US and its allies, which have become increasingly concerned about the potential emergence of Ukraine as a nuclear-weapon state. Anxiety over the future of the weapons stationed in Ukraine was increased by recent reports that the Ukrainians were trying to gain operational control over the missiles. The strategic arsenal on Ukrainian territory consists of 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles with a total of 1,240 warheads, and at least 30 bombers and their nuclear armaments. It has been feared that Ukraine might seek to retain at least the more modern of the missiles, 46 SS-24s, each carrying 10 warheads. Ukraine's delay in ratifying the 1991 US-Soviet Start 1 arms agreement and joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has held up implementation of both Start 1 and the follow-up Start 2, which the US signed with Russia in January this year. The deal, if ratified, also removes the largest sources of enmity between the two states - and appears to cede to Russia the senior role in a future relationship. The 300-ship fleet, which the two presidents had agreed to split at a summit meeting last year, has remained a political football, as the mainly Russian officer corps protested against the division. Both agreements appear to have been dictated by the rapidly worsening economic position of Ukraine, where inflation has risen to around 40 per cent a month and all attempts at reforms have stalled. Russia will set its payment for the Ukrainian half of the fleet - to be worked out by a joint commission in the coming months - against an estimated Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.65bn) Ukrainian debt to Russia, mainly for oil and gas. 'If the balance is in Ukraine's favour, then Russia will pay,' Mr Yeltsin said after the three-hour talks. Mr Kravchuk, speaking after the talks which were described by members of his delegation as 'tense', said that the previously adopted decision on splitting the fleet 'no longer corresponded to the real situation'. If confirmed, the deal could pave the way for closer economic union between the two states - a strategy to which Mr Kravchuk was once resolutely hostile, but which he now appears to support under pressure from his own industrial lobby.

""We hope the three-month operation really starts when  promised,"" Tarand said.    The government today set concrete tasks to several  ministries  to guarantee safety of the operation. The environment minister  told BNS the Cabinet is now ""organizationally ready"" for the  removal of fuel.    ""It is most unlikely that an accident should occur in  Paldiski, but we must be prepared for any eventuality,"" Tarand  said. ""For example, a fire may break out, which may involve  leakage of radioactive substances, and in this case people will  have to be evacuated. Estonia must guarantee the safety of the  population.""    The environment minister said the government laid main  responsibility for safety on the Rescue Department, the  Environment Ministry, the Estonian Railways, and the Economics  Ministry.    ""The dismantling of the two nuclear reactors in Paldiski  does  not directly concern Estonia, since we lack specialists for this  and, besides, Russia regards the reactors as a state secret,""  Tarand said. ""We are, however, interested in everything that  concerns the removal of fuel.""    Tarand claimed Estonia and Russia haven't yet agreed on what  is to become of Paldiski after the fuel has been removed.    ""What remains is the shells of the reactors, purification  systems, and some solid and liquid nuclear waste,"" the  environment minister said. ""Russia asks for five years to  eliminate them, which we think is too long. On the other hand,  we cannot make too stiff demands (on Russia), since Estonia  lacks a radioactive waste depository and the cost of building  one would be enormous. To resolve the issue, probably pressure  from third countries is needed.""    Russia plans to use new, TK-18 type containers for the  removal of nuclear fuel from Paldiski. This is the first time  they will be used in such operations.    Tarand said he has heard rumors that the containers ""were a  couple of weeks ago shipped off to Estonia from Vladivostok or  some other faraway place,"" but that they ""were stuck halfway.""    ""The new containers are a better alternative if only because  they haven't previously been used for transporting nuclear fuel  and they are not radioactive,"" Tarand said.     "

Naturally, when local authorities decide to rid their residents  of an enhanced radiation danger source, the latter react to this  as manifestation of special care being shown to them. There is  nothing bad about this, yet it is not always that the best  possible methods are found to resolve such problems.    As RIA Novosti reported, the radiation aboard the TNT-5  tanker, filled with radioactive waste from Pacific Fleet nuclear  submarines, has deteriorated. The vessel, moored at the Zvezda  plant in Bolshoy Kamen Bay, has developed a leak in its  drainage, pipe, and valve system, as a result of which the  radiation level in the aft engine room since the previous check  (on 28 December 1993) has doubled, reaching 1,400  microroentgen/hr.    This conclusion, according to the news agency, was made  yesterday by a team of specialists created on orders of the  Maritime Kray administration. Experts believe that in April-May  the situation could aggravate rapidly; in the end this could  lead in particular to the shutdown of the Zvezda plant, which is  engaged in dismantling nuclear submarines under the START II  Treaty. RIA Novosti also reported, citing Yevgeniy Stomastyuk,  chairman of the Maritime Kray Environmental Protection  Committee, that in order to avoid a major ecological catastrophe  the commission deems it expedient to dump the liquid nuclear  waste aboard the TNT-5 tanker into the Sea of Japan this May.    SEGODNYA's correspondent managed to obtain a comment from  employees at the State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear  and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor], an organization in charge  of radiation safety on a Russia-wide scale. Gosatomnadzor  representatives believe that because matters of ecological and  radiation security come under the jurisdiction of federal  authorities, such a decision by a local commission can be only  of a recommendatory character. SEGODNYA's correspondent also  learned that Gosatomnadzor has decided not to allow the dumping  of radiative substances into the sea but to pump the liquid  waste from the tanker to other vessels which are in good  condition; the TNT-5 itself, after corresponding treatment, will  be towed to a safe place.

The meeting was attended by Danish  Ambassador Christian Faber-Rod, Norwegian Ambassador Oyvind  Nordsletten, Finnish Ambassador Erik Ulfstedt, and Swedish  Ambassador Martin Halquist. The Swedish ambassador presented  the Ukrainian legislative speaker with a letter reporting on a  25-26 February meeting of foreign ministers from Scandinavia and  Iceland in Stockholm. The ministers discussed a number of  issues, including European security. In the communique adopted  on the results of the conference, the ministers hailed the  tripartite Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. declaration signed on 14  January 1994 and the appendix to the declaration stipulating the  dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal. The ministers pointed  out that the implementation of these documents will  significantly contribute to strengthening European security and  the nonproliferation of nuclear arms. The ambassadors were  instructed to inform the Ukrainian legislative chairman about  that declaration and the unanimous support for the tripartite  accord on the part of the governments of their states and  Iceland. The governments also hope that the accord will be  implemented soon. It was underlined that Ukraine should sign  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the immediate future.    In his turn, Ivan Plyushch provided an in-depth analysis of  Ukraine's current economic and political situation, pointing out:    [Begin Plyushch recording] Ukraine has been facing three  global problems -- Chernobyl, conversion of the Army and the  military-industrial complex, and the structural reshaping of the  economy. [end recording]    The Supreme Council chairman answered his interlocutors'  questions regarding, in particular, dates of practical  implementation of the agreements reached with Russia and the  United States. Ivan Plyushch emphasized that it is vital for  Ukraine that the provisions of the declaration and its appendix  be observed by all sides. This would correspond with the spirit  of every document adopted in Moscow.    [Begin Plyushch recording] For me, the problem is: When will  we begin receiving practical compensation? Thus far, we have  not received a cent; thus far, these documents are just pieces  of paper and simple discussions.

Now it is being suggested that the UK - post-devaluation - is technically poor enough to apply for extra European Community cash from the Cohesion Fund. This was agreed at Maastricht for Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece - the treaty says handouts are applicable to EC member states whose per capita income is below 90 per cent of the EC average. Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour Party, yesterday wrote to Mr Major (with copy to the European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors), pointing out that UK per capita income at the purchasing power parities of today's rate for sterling is at 87 per cent of the EC average. Bingo. Ergo, could we have some of this Cohesion Fund - which Brussels wants to endow with Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.8bn) in today's money - for Northern Ireland please? Mr Hume could not resist being a bit more mischievous. Under EC regional policy rules, the purchasing power parity formula was used to make sure that Northern Ireland is defined as among the most backward regions in Europe, so it can get the most generous EC regional aid grants, even though average income is higher than the qualifying threshold. This deal has already had some highly charged political implications. Last year the EC formed a free trade zone with the seven rich Nordic and Alpine countries of the European Free Trade Association. The treaty in question, the European Economic Area, requires the new partners to help backward areas of the Community catch up, and defined Ireland, both north and south, as one unit: 'The island of Ireland', equally eligible for such hand-outs. Mr Hume reminds Mr Major of this precedent, saying 'access to the Cohesion Fund would underpin the proper planning of an integrated environmental and transport infrastructure on the basis of the needs of the island of Ireland'. Should Mr Major choose to take up the opportunity offered by the UK's relegation, his alternatives are not appealing. The Cohesion Fund applies to countries, not regions, so he would have to acknowledge that the UK as a whole is in Europe's poorhouse. Or he could say that Northern Ireland should be treated - economically at least - as part of Ireland.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Nursultan Nazarbayev said this in Kiev, where he is on an  official visit. The Kazakh president pointed out that he is  ready to sign a new agreement with Russia either on a bilateral  basis or on a quadrilateral basis involving Ukraine and Belarus.  In the next few days he will be going to Washington to discuss  these problems with Bill Clinton.    Russia believed that the matter of compensation for the  nuclear material in the strategic missiles due for removal from  Kazakhstan was in principle closed. There are agreements on  this point. Almaty, like Kiev and Minsk, should receive its  share after deduction of expenditure on the reprocessing of  highly enriched uranium and its transportation and storage at  Russian plants.    However, all the indications are that the method of  calculation adopted earlier does not suit the Kazakh side. It  intends to follow the example of Ukraine, which succeeded a week  ago in obtaining $1 billion on signing the trilateral agreement  with Russia and the United States in Moscow. This money is  being given to Ukraine out of the sum appropriated by the U.S.  Congress for the nuclear disarmament of the CIS countries under  the START I treaty. It has become known that Almaty is hoping  for similar compensation.    In other words, Kazakhstan, like Ukraine, has decided not to  wait for funds to come into its account from the sale of uranium  by its Russian partners, whom it is not inclined to trust very  much. It is obviously safer to get insurance now, in the form of  a guaranteed billion out of the U.S. quota.    Experts believe that in that event Russia will have to take  on additional expenditure for the safe dismantling of nuclear  warheads in the possession of its CIS neighbors. It cannot be  rule out that Belarus will demand its share in the same way,  although some of the uranium has already been shipped out of its  territory to Russia for reprocessing. When it hosted Bill  Clinton recently, Minsk received $100 million from this same  package. But now, REUTER reports, Belarus is laying claim to a  further $500 million.     "

Several members of the commando are  well-known members of the FLNC [Corsican National Liberation  Front]-Historic Channel, a source close to the investigation in  Paris explained. They apparently include a journalist from the  Marseilles press and a nationalist wanted for a 1988 Christmas  murder committed in a bar in Ajaccio, who went underground after  being sentenced in absentia.    Should the operation mounted by the island's gendarmerie and  police, backed up by the RAID [Research, Assistance,  Intervention, and Dissuasion Unit of the national police force],  on the night of Sunday 27 March in Bonifacio be seen as a kind  of tit-for-tat response, as is being suggested in Corsica by  some observers who think that the government has so far tried to  play for time by handling the nationalists carefully? On 16  February, the FLNC-Historic Channel announced the end of the  truce in assaults which it had observed since 22 June 1993.  [passage omitted]    However, the first major operation by the FLNC in Corsica  failed on Sunday 27 March because of the steps taken by Police  Chief Jean-Pierre Lacave. Several dozen men were asked to take  part in a major assault intended to destroy the village of  Piantarella (26 residential apartments) built in the tourist  center of Sperone, which contains the island's only big golf  course. The operation seems to have been meticulously organized  and the deployment of these men involved the use of land and sea  resources. But police headquarters had specific information  which justified the dispatch of the RAID to Corsica.    Impressive Arsenal    In all, 120 police and gendarmes were involved. First, four  individuals responsible for neutralizing the guards were  detained, then 10 others who were to plant explosives in the  development. Shots were exchanged without anybody being injured.  Some members of the commando group were probably able to flee.  During the day, two vehicles, one of which had been set on  fire, and an 11-meter motor boat, also set on fire -- it had  probably been used to bring some of the commandos to the spot --  were discovered in the area. An impressive arsenal was seized:  60 bottles of butane gas, around 60 kg of explosives (dynamite  and plastic explosives), six assault rifles, and 10 handguns,  grenades, and detonators.    The success of this operation, the first of its kind since  Corsica has suffered clandestine nationalist violence, suggests  that following the lengthy period of dialogue launched by Pierre  Joxe and continued by [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua, the  government is now determined to put an end to erroneous methods  which do not have the public's approval. The supporters of the  FLNC, who are found within Cuncolta Naziunalista and its  satellite organizations, gathered outside the Ajaccio police  headquarters where the 14 people detained are being held.

This was revealed during Prime Minister Carl Bildt's  two-day visit to Estonia. Our correspondent in Helsinki  Christina Gustafsson reports:    [Gustafsson] The Baltic News Service, BNS, reports that  Prime  Minister Carl Bildt said -- somewhat surprisingly -- that  Estonia should not sign an agreement like the one between Russia  and Latvia. Prime Minister Bildt did not say which aspects of  the agreement should be different. The Estonian criticism of  the agreement between Russia and Latvia has mainly been that all  retired officers are allowed to stay in Latvia. Ever since the  agreement was signed, the Estonians have stressed that such an  agreement will never be topical for Estonia. Estonia cannot  accept the fact that those officers who have, for example,  worked in the intelligence services, the KGB, or the GRU, would  be allowed to stay on Estonian territory. This constitutes an  all too great security risk, according to the Estonians.    Parallel to Prime Minister Carl Bildt's visit, there was a  new round of talks on the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Estonia. Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin headed the  Russian delegation. He expressed a certain optimism when the  talks were over. He did not think it impossible that an  agreement will be reached enabling the Russian soldiers to leave  Estonia before the last day of August. During the last few  weeks, this timetable has been questioned by the Russians,  because time is starting to run out. The negotiations will  continue next week in Moscow.    The training submarines at the Russian military base in  Paldiski, with two nuclear reactors, are another growing problem  in the negotiations. Prime Minister Carl Bildt visited the top  secret base today and said later that it is easily possible to  tear it down in a couple of weeks. The Russian side says that  it will take from three to 10 years to dismantle the base.  Because the Russians consider that Paldiski contains military  secrets, neither Estonian nor foreign experts will be allowed to  enter the base. The Estonian negotiators are of the opinion  that Paldiski and all other bases should be handed over to  Estonia on the last day of August.     "

""We will not be frightened by the appearance of any export  control apparatus,"" the spokesman said.    The spokesman made this stand clear, answering a question  put  by KCNA today concerning the moves of the United States and  other Western countries to bring into shape the second ""Cocom"",  another export control machine, in the wake of the dismantling  of the ""Cocom"".    The spokesman said:    ""In making haste with the formation of a new export control  apparatus, the United States seeks to bar the developing  countries from making an independent progress through economic  and scientific- technological development and subjugate them  and, at the same time, restrict and control the economic and  trade relations of the Western countries with the developing  countries through the medium of this apparatus. Judging from  this, the `development' and `prosperity' of the international  community harped on by the United States are all an empty talk  intended to conceal its wild design to establish its domination  and gain world supremacy.    ""It must not go unnoticed that the DPRK and other developing  countries have been designated as objects of control by the  export control machine to be knocked into shape under the  pretext of `preventing threat to world peace'.    ""As far as the threat to world peace is concerned, it comes  from the United States and its followers, not from the  developing countries. This is an undeniable fact.    ""The developing countries are on guard against the scheme of  the United States and other Western countries to frame up the  second `Cocom' for economic blockade on them.

Nursultan Nazarbayev said this in Kiev, where he is on an  official visit. The Kazakh president pointed out that he is  ready to sign a new agreement with Russia either on a bilateral  basis or on a quadrilateral basis involving Ukraine and Belarus.  In the next few days he will be going to Washington to discuss  these problems with Bill Clinton.    Russia believed that the matter of compensation for the  nuclear material in the strategic missiles due for removal from  Kazakhstan was in principle closed. There are agreements on  this point. Almaty, like Kiev and Minsk, should receive its  share after deduction of expenditure on the reprocessing of  highly enriched uranium and its transportation and storage at  Russian plants.    However, all the indications are that the method of  calculation adopted earlier does not suit the Kazakh side. It  intends to follow the example of Ukraine, which succeeded a week  ago in obtaining $1 billion on signing the trilateral agreement  with Russia and the United States in Moscow. This money is  being given to Ukraine out of the sum appropriated by the U.S.  Congress for the nuclear disarmament of the CIS countries under  the START I treaty. It has become known that Almaty is hoping  for similar compensation.    In other words, Kazakhstan, like Ukraine, has decided not to  wait for funds to come into its account from the sale of uranium  by its Russian partners, whom it is not inclined to trust very  much. It is obviously safer to get insurance now, in the form of  a guaranteed billion out of the U.S. quota.    Experts believe that in that event Russia will have to take  on additional expenditure for the safe dismantling of nuclear  warheads in the possession of its CIS neighbors. It cannot be  rule out that Belarus will demand its share in the same way,  although some of the uranium has already been shipped out of its  territory to Russia for reprocessing. When it hosted Bill  Clinton recently, Minsk received $100 million from this same  package. But now, REUTER reports, Belarus is laying claim to a  further $500 million.     "

0,FT942-5651 ,"FT942-5651 _AN-EFCDVADLFT 940603   FT  03 JUN 94 / Poverty of vision: Europe's reluctance to give direct aid to the poor      By ALAN PIKE   Social policy is the Achilles' heel of Europe,' Mr Raphael Chanterie, a Belgian member of the European Parliament told a conference on the subject last week. His audience of government officials, academics and industry representatives murmured assent, but could have spent hours disagreeing with each other over what the statement meant. It might have been possible to thrash out an agreed definition of 'Achilles' heel'; 'social policy' would have presented greater difficulties. Their confusion is partly understandable. European Union social policy has traditionally been dominated by employment-related issues. Alongside these, however, a clutch of policies concerned with the poor - or, in the EU's preferred term, the 'socially excluded' - has grown in significance. Anti-poverty organisations are increasingly looking to Europe for initiatives to attack deprivation. But they fear that EU involvement in this area of social policy is about to collapse. Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU social affairs commissioner, is currently sifting through hundreds of responses to a green paper on options for the future of social policy, before presenting final proposals to the Commission in a white paper next month. The green paper sounded powerful warnings about the dangers of excluding large sections of Europe's population from a reasonable share of wealth and opportunities. Violence, drug abuse, racism, political extremism and social unrest were, it said, all likely to result. Mr Flynn made it clear last week, however, that against a background of high unemployment, job creation would 'dominate the whole agenda' arising from his white paper. He emphasised his opposition to the emergence of a 'dual society' of advantaged and disadvantaged in Europe, but argued the best way of supporting the most needy groups was through measures to attack long-term unemployment. With the number of the EU's poor variously estimated at between 50m and 70m, anti-poverty organisations regard the idea of relying on labour market policies alone to tackle 'social exclusion' as wishful thinking. The green paper itself concedes that a return to full employment is 'unlikely in the foreseeable future' without significant policy changes. Europe created 9m jobs between 1985 and 1991 but unemployment fell by only 3m. The European Anti Poverty Network, which represents voluntary organisations in the 12 member states, wants the introduction of rules requiring poverty and its social consequences to be taken into account in all EU policies, in the way that environmental factors are considered. But campaigners' fears that their efforts will fall on deaf ears have been compounded by signs that the financial help the EU gives to the poor may be under threat. Although relief of poverty is a responsibility of individual states, the EU supports experimental projects aimed at changing the lives of the poor. Poverty 3, its current five-year programme, ends this month, and last year Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, expressed hopes that it would be followed by a more ambitious Poverty 4 with its budget doubled to Ecu110m (Pounds 85m). But Germany, in what started as a dispute between the federal government and Lander over responsibility for running anti-poverty programmes, has blocked the introduction of the initiative. Behind the dispute are wider reservations, shared by some UK and Dutch ministers, about the appropriateness of EU involvement in this area of social policy. Mr Delors is believed to have tried to rescue Poverty 4 in talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl - without success. Unless there is an unexpected breakthrough at a meeting of social affairs ministers on June 22, there is little chance of the programme being launched during the six-month German EU presidency, which begins next month. With the specialist teams that worked on Poverty 3 already breaking up because of the uncertainty, this could mark the end of the programme. The resistance to Poverty 4 is also giving rise to doubts about the future of other EU social initiatives such as its work with the elderly. Most of Europe's poor would not immediately notice the loss of the programmes - budgets have never been big enough to relieve much poverty. But Poverty 3 has helped fund schemes for former prisoners in Italy, itinerant families in Ireland, narcotics addicts in Greece, single parents in Bristol. A House of Lords sub-committee concluded last month that it had led to work which would not otherwise have been done, relieving poverty and starting to 'rebuild the economic and social lives of some severely deprived communities'. Although the invigoration of local economies was beyond the capacity of small projects, the committee said it was 'impressed by the determination and ingenuity' shown by Poverty 3 initiatives in creating limited numbers of new jobs. The local government centre at Warwick University, which has co-ordinated and monitored the UK projects included under the Poverty 3 umbrella, lists a series of small but significant practical achievements. They include a scheme to train black people for voluntary work in Bristol, development of a new childcare centre at Pilton, Edinburgh, and changes in Liverpool city council's policies to encourage the employment of local labour. But supporters say the programme's most significant contribution has been its direct involvement of needy and deprived people in efforts to rebuild their communities. The encouragement and prestige of having the EU flag flying over little local initiatives in Scottish housing estates and Portuguese mountain villages has, they say, been worth as much as the money. Mr Dennis Preston, who chairs the Brownlow Community Trust, says Poverty 3 has provided a local test bed for national urban aid policies. Warwick University researchers say it has enabled people to 'participate in the process of change, rather than becoming resentful objects of it'. Europe's anti-poverty groups fear that, if the EU abandons such initiatives, the dangers of that resentment being expressed in the dark forms described in its green paper will come at least a little closer.

A historic event is taking place today. For the first  time a delegation of the Bosnian parliament is going to be at  the Council of Europe assembly, and the new Russian delegation  will also be attending. Miguel Angel Martinez, president of the  assembly of members of parliament of the Council of Europe, is  on the line. Today is an important day for the assembly of  members of parliament of the Council of Europe. The  representatives of the Bosnian parliament will be at this  assembly for the first time.    [Martinez] Yes, with the president of the Bosnian parliament  leading them, they are going to take their place for the first  time as specially invited guests, that is, a candidate member  country to affiliation to the Council of Europe.    [Announcer] There is also more news. For example, Boris  Yeltsin is in Spain. Russia, with these problems about the  Black Sea Fleet, the complaints about not having been informed  about NATO air strikes around Gorazde, and the new Russian  delegation taking its place in the assembly of the Council of  Europe. What do these two developments mean for this  organization, the assembly of the Council of Europe?    [Martinez] What this means is the new role of the Council of  Europe and the new dimension of the European contruction --  which now far surpasses the narrow and almost subregional  framework of the European Union, the EC, and Europe, now that  the world divided into blocs is over -- is expanding to all the  countries, interpreting their aspiration to live in freedom and  democracy. I refer to the countries on the map of the  continent. They identify that aspiration with participating in  the construction of Europe, and here we have important countries  such as Russia with which, obviously, the dimension of  construction is growing in terms of countries, of people who are  going to come under the blue starred flag, and, as you can  imagine, the complexity of our work increases.    [Announcer] There is another important bit of news which  goes  slightly beyond Europe's sphere and it is the participation,  that presence, of Yasir 'Arafat, who is going to be at the  Council of Europe shortly. Will the Council of Europe have much  capacity to intervene or support the Middle East peace process?    [Martinez] One of the responsibilities practically falling  on  us, without us having made any request, is to be Europe's voice  in dialogue and, if you like, negotiation with the other big  countries or other big blocs of countries with which, by  necessity, Europe has to speak to construct the world order and,  above all, to keep peace in the world. I have just returned  from China as part of a very high-level delegation. Yesterday I  saw the U.S. ambassador to France in my office; she was carrying  a message from President Clinton. Today I am receiving a  delegation of 15 Arab countries, and tomorrow Yasir 'Arafat is  coming. Europe must speak, talk. It must be a partner with  these others to create a world in peace, and naturally it would  appear that the Council of Europe is the most representative  instrument because we are all here.     "

The reason, it says, is that 'considerable uncertainty' surrounds the nuclear industry's ability to pay. Scottish Nuclear will become technically insolvent some time after March 1995 if the government does not intervene, partly because of future decommissioning costs, the NAO said. Nuclear facilities have a limited lifetime and safely dismantling them will be one of the nuclear industry's biggest financial burdens. The report, which is the most comprehensive government study of decommissioning costs to date, estimated it would cost Pounds 18bn to decommission all of the industry's facilities, but said that is 'affected by a wide range of uncertainties'. While it is difficult to estimate total costs, the report said they would be spread over more than 100 years. Some disposal plans have not yet been approved by the regulators, and the UK has not yet decided which method to use for long-term disposal of radioactive waste. However it pointed out its estimates do not discount the amount of money to be spent in the future. It calculated the undiscounted decommissioning costs for Nuclear Electric, Scottish Nuclear and British Nuclear Fuels, which make up most of the civil nuclear sector, to be Pounds 14.5bn and the discounted value at Pounds 5.9bn. The Atomic Energy Authority also has undiscounted costs of Pounds 3.5bn. Nuclear Electric told the NAO that it expected 'to be able to meet all decommissioning liabilities as they fall due'. However the office warned that if operating costs rose - particularly for disposing of waste from regular operations - the generators could be unable to meet long-term decommissioning liabilities. It added that 'the present electricity supply market provides no mechanism through which any increases in costs can be passed on directly to consumers'. Nuclear Electric said yesterday: 'We believe we can cover liabilities without any extension of the nuclear levy' - paid by electricity consumers and worth more than Pounds 1.2bn a year, the levy ends in 1998. Scottish Nuclear said yesterday that its financial results would show that it was not technically insolvent. The Cost of Decommissioning Nuclear Facilities. Commons Paper 692, HMSO, Pounds 7.40.

0,FT941-14322 ,"FT941-14322 _AN-EAYDAAHFFT 940120   FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (31): Shopkeepers suffer a fall in fortunes - Europe's leading companies now face a challenge from US warehouse operators / Sector Analyses - Retailing      By NEIL BUCKLEY   On the evidence of the FT500, Britain really does appear to be a nation of shopkeepers. Of the 37 retailers in the table, 17 are British, and UK companies fill seven of the top 10 positions in the retail list. Next comes France with nine, Germany with six, Belgium with two, and Spain, Italy and the Netherlands with one each. That gives a slightly misleading impression of the UK's retailing strength. The reason is that several of Europe's biggest retailers, such as Germany's Tengelmann and Metro, are private companies or co-operatives, and so do not appear in the list. Based on turnover rather than market capitalisation, nine of the top 10 European companies are German or French, with only one UK company - J. Sainsbury - sneaking into the table. But the FT500 does accurately reflect the less than sparkling fortunes of many of Europe's top retailers last year, thanks to continuing recession and slow growth in consumer consumption. Some 20 of the 37 have gone down, while only 13 have gone up. The UK's Marks and Spencer, still the highest-placed retailer in the 500, is unchanged at 22. There are, however, three new entries. Highest, at 303, is Pinault-Printemps, the group formed in December 1992 by the merger of France's Pinault and Au Printemps. The UK fashion retailer Next, one of the most successful retailers of the 1980s, has re-entered the list at 445. After over-expanding and over-borrowing by the end of the decade, it is now staging a recovery, having closed some stores and cut costs, and announced in September an almost three-fold increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 23m. The third new entrant, at 458, is La Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer, and one of the few big players in one of Europe's least-developed retail markets. It has spent L300bn a year for the past four years on expansion, and turnover in its supermarkets and hypermarkets has more than doubled, while sales in its DIY chain have more than trebled. But the main feature of the retailing list is the number of fallers. Five of the 25 biggest fallers in the FT500 are retailers. It is perhaps not surprising that two are UK food retailers. The food retailing sector underperformed the UK stock market by more than 30 per cent in 1993, amid fears that the creeping saturation of the superstore market, the rapid growth of discount retailers - several of them recent entrants from continental Europe such as Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and France's Ed - and the resulting upsurge in price competition, meant the biggest players' profits growth was under threat. It is perhaps more surprising that the two chains should be Kwik Save, the UK's leading discounter, and Wm Morrison Supermarkets, the regional superstore chain voted the UK's top performing company by the Institute of Directors in 1992. Ironically, Kwik Save remains one of the most profitable companies in Europe on a return on capital employed basis, achieving 44.4 per cent. But the retailer's share price has been hit by fears that it may be squeezed between the new generation of discounters and the more price-aggressive superstores, while Morrison's shares declined after disappointing results in September and a warning that pressure on its margins meant profits were unlikely to rise in line with sales over the next year. The UK's three biggest food retailers were all affected. J. Sainsbury fell from 26 to 39, Tesco from 63 to 95, and Argyll from 73 to 114. Other large fallers include Belgium's two biggest retailers, Delhaize and GIB. The latter, which fell from 176 to 327, has suffered from the malaise affecting the Belgian retail sector. That resulted from a significant slowdown in the growth of private consumption in 1993, due to higher taxes on income, energy and stock exchange transactions. The biggest factor in the decline of Delhaize, from 300 to 437, is probably the performance of US subsidiary Food Lion, which accounts for 64 per cent of group earnings. Sales were affected by a highly negative US television documentary, which centred on the problems of food handling and sanitation in the meat area of Food Lion stores. In another recent setback, Food Lion had to pay Dollars 16.2m to the US Department of Labor for violating federal overtime and child labour laws. In addition to its fallers, however, the UK provides the only two retailers in the top 25 biggest risers: Burton, the country's second-largest clothing retailing group, and Asda, the fourth-biggest grocery superstore chain. Both  -like fashion retailer Next - are leading retailers of the 1980s which lost their way at the end of the decade through over-expanding and over-borrowing and are now staging a recovery. Another big riser was France's Castorama Dubois - a newcomer to the FT500 last year. The outlook for European retailers remains tough, however. With powerful discount formats such as warehouse club operator Costco now crossing the Atlantic, and several others likely to follow, European groups may face a significant challenge in their home markets just as they start to pull out of recession.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Leading retailers by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Company                           dollarsm   Rank  Sector  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1   Marks and Spencer                  16380.8     22     491 2   Sainsbury J                        11694.0     39     493 3   Great Universal Stores              8482.0     67     493 4   Carrefour                           7696.7     75     493 5   Boots Company                       7601.3     78     492 6   Kingfisher                          6583.8     84     491 7   Tesco                               5906.5     95     493  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 8   Argyll Group                        5035.4    114     493 9   Karstadt                            2840.8    200     491 10  Promodes                            2828.6    201     491 11  Sears                               2575.9    222     492 12  Asda Group                          2553.2    224     493 13  Ahold                               2434.2    230     493 14  Kaufhof                             2345.2    240     491  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 15  Centros Comerciales Pryca           2087.4    264     493 16  Redoute (La)                        1950.2    279     491 17  Smith (WH) Group                  1825.9    297     495 18  Pinault-Printemps                   1798.1    303     491 19  Delhaize                            1653.0    327     492 20  Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus              1647.7    329     491 21  Casino                              1646.9    330     493  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

His audience of government officials, academics and industry  representatives murmured assent, but could have spent hours  disagreeing with each other over what the statement meant. It  might have been possible to thrash out an agreed definition of  ""Achilles heel""; ""social policy"" would have presented greater  difficulties.    Their confusion is partly understandable. European Union  [EU] social policy has traditionally been dominated by  employment-related issues. Alongside these, however, a clutch  of policies concerned with the poor -- or, in the EU's preferred  term, the ""socially excluded"" -- has grown in significance.  Anti-poverty organisations are increasingly looking to Europe  for initiatives to attack deprivation. But they fear that EU  involvement in this area of social policy is about to collapse.    Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU social affairs commissioner, is  currently sifting through hundreds of responses to a green paper  on options for the future of social policy, before presenting  final proposals to the Commission in a white paper next month.  The green paper sounded powerful warnings about the dangers of  excluding large sections of Europe's population from a  reasonable share of wealth and opportunities. Violence, drug  abuse, racism, political extremism and social unrest were, it  said, all likely to result.    Mr Flynn made it clear last week, however, that against a  background of high unemployment, job creation would ""dominate  the whole agenda"" arising from his white paper. He emphasised  his opposition to the emergence of a ""dual society"" of  advantaged and disadvantaged in Europe, but argued the best way  of supporting the most needy groups was through measures to  attack long-term unemployment.    With the number of the EU's poor variously estimated at  between 50 million and 70 million, antipoverty organisations  regard the idea of relying on labour market policies alone to  tackle ""social exclusion"" as wishful thinking. The green paper  itself concedes that a return to full employment is ""unlikely in  the foreseeable future"" without significant policy changes.  Europe created 9 million jobs between 1985 and 1991 but  unemployment fell by only 3 million.    The European Antipoverty Network, which represents voluntary  organisations in the 12 member states, wants the introduction of  rules requiring poverty and its social consequences to be taken  into account in all EU policies, in the way that environmental  factors are considered. But campaigners' fears that their  efforts will fall on deaf ears have been compounded by signs  that the financial help the EU gives to the poor may be under  threat.    Although relief of poverty is a responsibility of individual  states, the EU supports experimental projects aimed at changing  the lives of the poor. Poverty 3, its current five-year  programme, ends this month, and last year Mr Jacques Delors,  Commission president, expressed hopes that it would be followed  by a more ambitious Poverty 4 with its budget doubled to ECUllO  million (85m pounds).    But Germany, in what started as a dispute between the  Federal  Government and laender over responsibility for running  antipoverty programmes, has blocked the introduction of the  initiative. Behind the dispute are wider reservations, shared  by some UK and Dutch ministers, about the appropriateness of EU  involvement in this area of social policy.    Mr Delors is believed to have tried to rescue Poverty 4 in  talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl -- without success. Unless  there is an unexpected breakthrough at a meeting of social  affairs ministers on June 22, there is little chance of the  programme being launched during the six-month German EU  presidency, which begins next month. With the specialist teams  that worked on Poverty 3 already breaking up because of the  uncertainty, this could mark the end of the programme. The  resistance to Poverty 4 is also giving rise to doubts about the  future of other EU social initiatives such as its work with the  elderly.    Most of Europe's poor would not immediately notice the loss  of the programmes -- budgets have never been big enough to  relieve much poverty. But Poverty 3 has helped fund schemes for  former prisoners in Italy, itinerant families in Ireland,  narcotics addicts in Greece single parents in Bristol.    A House of Lords sub-committee concluded last month that it  had led to work which would not otherwise have been done,  relieving poverty and starting to ""rebuild the economic and  social lives of some severely deprived communities."" Although  the invigoration of local economies was beyond the capacity of  small projects, the committee said it was ""impressed by the  determination and ingenuity"" shown by Poverty 3 initiatives in  creating limited numbers of new jobs.    The local government centre at Warwick University, which has  co-ordinated and monitored the UK projects included under the  Poverty 3 umbrella, lists a series of small but significant  practical achievements. They include a scheme to train black  people for voluntary work in Bristol, development of a new  childcare centre at Pilton, Edinburgh, and changes in Liverpool  city council's policies to encourage the employment of local  labour.    But supporters say the programme's most significant  contribution has been its direct involvement of needy and  deprived people in efforts to rebuild their communities. The  encouragement and prestige of having the EU flag flying over  little local initiatives in Scottish housing estates and  Portuguese mountain villages has, they say, been worth as much  as the money.    Mr Dennis Preston, who chairs the Brownlow Community Trust,  says Poverty 3 has provided a local test bed for national urban  aid policies. Warwick University researchers say it has enabled  people to ""participate in the process of change, rather than  becoming resentful objects of it.""    Europe's antipoverty groups fear that, if the EU abandons  such initiatives, the dangers of that resentment being expressed  in the dark forms described in its green paper will come at  least a little closer.

0,FT921-3057 ,"FT921-3057 _AN-CCQBDAACFT 920317   FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (3): Strategies which yield inadequate results - Why the trade gap is widening      By PAUL TAYLOR   EUROPE'S semiconductor manufacturers have been forced to play a desperate game of catch-up with their Japanese and US rivals, computer makers are struggling for survival, and the consumer electronics groups have yet to show that they can translate big spending in the laboratory into timely commercial products. These problems are not new. In November, 1988, the European Commission presented its first report on the state of science and technology in Europe and concluded that Europe was still gripped by technological dependency in key areas. The report said that in spite of a dramatic increase in research and development spending in Europe, Japan and the US were well ahead in terms of the amount of RD spending, the number of research scientists and engineers, and in successfully enticing the private sector to invest in RD. It then identified three main targets for research, improving competitiveness, improving quality of life and concentrating on basic research. In their attempts to revitalise Europe's flagging IT and electronics sectors Europe's policy makers have consistently emphasised RD. In particular, they have encouraged IT companies to pool their RD efforts, particularly in the area of 'pre-competitive' research. This policy is set to continue with the EC planning to spend Ecu5.7bn between 1990 and 1994 to support research and development, 40 per cent of it on collaborative research in IT. The Commission wants to channel this money into fewer, larger schemes, but complains that its spending is diffused because its member governments each insist on a share of the pie. There is no doubt that companies have rushed to join EC-subsidised research programmes such as Esprit and Race as well as pan-European programmes like Eureka which includes costly flagship projects such as the Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative (Jessi) and the High Definition Television (HDTV) project. But there is a continuing debate over whether the EC has got its RD strategy right, not least because the results are at best inconclusive - and there seems to be much more research than development of commercial products and processes, something Europe has recently fallen down on. Last year, the European Court of Auditors joined the fray arguing that in spite of Ecu5.4bn spent on research between 1987 and 1991 only a small fraction of research work had resulted in concrete applications. The Court of Auditors report recommended diverting more funds into the practical application of research and reorganising the manner in which research findings are disseminated. Supporters of the EC, strategy, however claim that although EC funding for European collaborative research is tiny compared with many national, or even some corporate RD budgets, it has encouraged the European IT industry to increase its RD spending significantly. Nevertheless, the performance of the Europe's indigenous IT and electronics industries has shown little improvement. Europe's IT trade deficit has continued to deteriorate in the past decade, most of the region's large computer and semiconductor companies are losing money, their share of the global IT market is disproportionately small and falling, and despite higher RD spending there are still very few developing product markets in which European electronics companies can claim to be world leaders. Europe's large semiconductor companies, Philips of Holland, Siemens of Germany, and the French/Italian SGS Thomson, produce only about 10 per cent of the world's output of chips and are dwarfed by their US and Japanese rivals. All three continue to be heavily subsidised in their efforts to catch up in chip technology and Siemens has now turned to IBM as a partner to develop 64Mb D-Rams, the next generation of memory chips. Similarly, nearly all the large European computer companies are in financial trouble because of falling sales, increased competition, the high cost of research and development, and demands from larger customers for open systems which yield inherently lower gross margins than proprietary systems. In Europe, the situation has been worsened by the plethora of small national markets, which has made economies of scale difficult to achieve, and a tendency to support 'national champions' which has hampered collaboration and co-operation. The sale of a controling stake in ICL of the UK to Japan's Fujitsu in 1990 effectively ended any hopes for a pan-European coalition which might have linked ICL with the other leading players - Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, Groupe Bull of France and Olivetti of Italy. By 1995, according to some estimates, the European-owned full-line computer makers could have less than 7 per cent of the worldwide market for data-processing equipment, compared with just over 10 per cent at present. As Groupe Bull's recently announced technological and marketing agreement with IBM indicates, it is probably only a matter of time before they are forced into strategic alliances with foreign competitors to ensure their survival - but at the expense of their independence and national identity. Inadequate home demand has been blamed for the industry's weaknesses, including its difficulties in producing innovative products. Although Europe's spending on IT has been rising, it is still lower per head than in the US and Japan, and large European information systems users are notoriously cautious about pioneering leading-edge applications. Brussels is now considering plans to boost demand by persuading national authorities jointly to back a plan hatched by the big European computer companies for a multi-million-dollar computer network to span Europe. The intention is to provide both an IT infrastructure for the Continent and at the same time provide a boost for the ailing computer companies. But there are already doubts about whether the large contracts it would generate could legally be reserved for the European-owned suppliers it is intended to benefit, and whether it would not simply repeat at the regional level European countries' largely unsuccessful use of public procurement to bolster national champion suppliers. A similarly gloomy picture emerges in Europe's consumer electronics industry where competition has dramatically shortened product cycles. In order to compete, therefore, companies must get innovative products out of traditional RD labs and into the marketplace fast. The need to address this and other pressing challenges, like responsiveness to customer demand, has now been recognised in some European boardrooms. Philips has just announced it managed to swing back into profit in 1991 following the record Fl4.24bn loss sustained in 1990 which prompted an ambitious restructuring including the sale of non-core businesses, and the re-focusing of the company's technological strengths on new consumer products. In order to maintain a foothold in the fiercely competitive global consumer electronics marketplace Philips has been investing heavily in the three emerging technologies of Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), High Definition Television (HDTV) and, in conjunction with Sony, Interactive Compact Discs (CD-I). The Dutch group's performance is being carefully watched as a barometer of Europe's electronics industry. As one of the few remaining diversified European electrical and electronics companies, Philips is a champion of a cause - the maintenance of an independent European capability in electronic technologies. The only electronics equipment sector in which Europe consistently boasts profitable world leaders is telecommunications, where the long established monopoly procurement of network equipment in most countries shelters entrenched suppliers from competition and maintains high margins. Two other possible growth areas for European IT are custom-chips, and the parallel processing field in which European companies are believed to have an edge. Europe is also well represented by software development houses and IT service companies. There are some 13,000 computing software and services companies in Europe and, if the region has a future in IT, it probably lies with these companies rather than the troubled giants of the hardware business. As Mr Vittorio Cassoni, Olivetti's managing director, said recently when referring to Europe's weakness in computer technology, the Commission should not spend money trying to catch trains that Europe had already missed. What is certain is that competition for indigenous European IT companies will intensify, and that US and Japanese companies will continue to be active in establishing plants in Europe. If Europe's industrial strategists fail to halt the decline, the future of European IT and electronics may rest in these foreign owned plants.  The Financial Times   London Page II  "
0,FT944-16295 ,"FT944-16295 _AN-EJND7ABDFT 941014   FT  14 OCT 94 / UN ready with system of weapons monitoring      By MARK NICHOLSON      BAGHDAD   The report on the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons systems handed to the UN yesterday marks the culmination of an unprecedented effort to destroy one of the world's biggest national arms efforts. The slim report handed by Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN special envoy, to the Security Council declared 'provisionally operational' a monitoring system designed to ensure Iraq can never again produce or acquire chemical, biological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction, in accordance with the Gulf war ceasefire resolution 687. The political consequences of this report have still to be worked out, though Iraq claims it represents proof it has complied fully with the UN's post Gulf war strictures and that they should thus be rewarded by an easing of sanctions. The scale of the enterprise in finding, destroying and monitoring President Saddam Hussein's deadly arsenal, designed to make Iraq an Arab superpower, has been colossal. It has involved the destruction of hundreds of Scud missiles, hundreds of tonnes of chemical weapons and the detection and dismantling of at least 82 separate sites identified as part of an effort to create nuclear weapons. Mr Jaako Ylitako, chief field officer for the UN Special Commission, says over 8,000 people were employed in the chemical weapons industry alone, most at the al-Muthanna complex south of Baghdad, a plant the size of a big car factory. He estimates 12,000 were employed in Iraq's nuclear programme, now halted. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency will remain permanently in Iraq, monitoring among other things all Iraq's main rivers to test for abnormal levels of radiation as a sign of any attempts to cheat. Experts are to arrive soon to set up similar monitoring systems for Iraq's biological weapons programme. More than 45 inspectors are starting to monitor data from 50 cameras installed at missile production plants and air chemical sensors installed at chemical works. Weekly flights by a US spy plane, and routine patrols by two helicopters are designed to ensure Iraq is unable to rebuild elsewhere. Mr Ylitako says the senior Iraqis who watched destroyed what was once their most advanced enterprise did so largely impassively. 'But I got the feeling some of them, as they destroyed all this, were glad to be out of this business,' he says.   Countries:-  IQZ  Iraq, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT921-656 ,"FT921-656 _AN-CC0BDAGBFT 920327   FT  27 MAR 92 / Plugging into each other's strengths: The trend to international strategic alliances      By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO   Last week, Philips, the Dutch electronics group, and Grundig, the German consumer electronics company in which it owns a 32 per cent stake, said they would join their video and cordless telephone operations. On the same day, Olivetti, the Italian computers and office equipment group, announced an alliance with Canon, the Japanese camera and electronics group, to produce bubble ink-jet printers. These moves are part of a growing trend among Europe's ailing electronics manufacturers to seek alliances in the hope of regaining their competitiveness in the marketplace. They include another recent announcement by Philips that it was joining forces with Motorola, the US group, to design and develop semiconductor chips for Compact Disk Interactive, a new CD-based medium combining graphics, data, CD audio and video. The Dutch group is now also looking for a partner to invest in a plant to manufacture liquid crystal displays, a product of increasing strategic importance. A spate of similar links has also taken place in Europe's semiconductor and computer industries over the past year as difficult market conditions forced companies to adopt measures to stem failing fortunes. Earlier this year Groupe Bull of France, the computer group, announced a link with IBM of the US to develop advanced semiconductor chips. And SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor group is to collaborate with GEC Plessey Semiconductors of the UK in chip development, and with Philips in a semiconductor plant in Grenoble. Nokia, the Finnish group, has been restructuring its consumer electronics division, and has also been talking to a number of unnamed parties about possible links. Such partnerships have been spurred by the growing recognition among Europe's indigenous manufacturers that their US and Japanese competitors could be the main beneficiaries of the single European market. European electronics companies have accepted they need help to survive in increasingly competitive markets otherwise they will not be able to fund the RD needed to keep pace with technology. This is particularly true in the semiconductor industry, where most European companies are suffering losses. 'That is the area in which European companies are crying out for help,' says Mr Andrew Haskins, industry analyst at James Capel. Even cash-rich Siemens has realised it cannot afford the investment needed to stay in the race and recently announced ventures in chip development with both IBM and Toshiba of Japan. The move towards alliances follows the failure to build a European electronics champion through the merger of the semiconductor activities of Siemens, SGS-Thomson and Philips. The three groups were unable to reconcile their differences and, after months of talks, Siemens decided to link with IBM, effectively dashing hopes for a major European electronics group. It is not only that the Europeans find it difficult to agree on broad co-operation; there has also been a spreading conviction that simply joining the weak operations of three big groups will not lead to a strong business. Having abandoned the idea of a European champion, manufacturers have embraced less grand alliances, both among themselves and with outside groups, as the logical solution to their problems. Olivetti has set up a division specifically to look for possible technological co-operation. Such alliances offer manufacturers the chance to pool resources and rationalise operations, at a time of spiralling costs and stagnant growth of key markets. The situation is particularly dire for financially stretched European groups. Last year, although Philips returned to profitability, its income from consumer electronics declined 33 per cent. Thomson, Nokia and Olivetti also suffered losses last year and the situation is equally bleak among European semiconductor and computer manufacturers. If they are to remain in the invest in RD, Europe's manufacturers need to join forces or seek help from outside. Ms Angela Dean, industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, expects Philips to announce further alliances as it moves to rationalise its operations. 'What we hear from Philips in the future will be more general and not just restricted to video equipment,' she said. Alliances with strategic partners also offer manufacturers the chance to tap demand outside their own national markets. This is important for European manufacturers, which have often blamed their woes on the lack of a large indigenous demand base to support economies of scale. Pan-European alliances will help to rationalise operations and share costs. But they will have limited impact on raising the competitiveness of European manufacturers. For that, European companies will have to look to US and Japanese companies for the key technologies necessary to remain competitive and profitable.  The Financial Times   London Page 21  "
0,FT944-9128 ,"FT944-9128 _AN-EKQEIAARFT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / Ukraine falls into line on nuclear arms      By MATTHEW KAMINSKI      KIEV   Ukraine's parliament yesterday ratified the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and closed a chapter in the country's hesitant moves to give up for good nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet Union. The long-awaited vote, passed by a wide margin, looks set to improve often strained relations with the west and Russia. It also marks a significant political victory for President Leonid Kuchma a week before his US summit with President Bill Clinton. Ukraine will formally accede to the 1968 treaty as a non-nuclear state once security assurances from the US, the UK, France and Russia are, as expected, given at next month's CSCE summit in Budapest. Mr Hennady Udovenko, foreign minster, said 'guarantees of political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity' are all but assured from the four NPT nuclear states . The former Soviet republic's ratification also is crucial because Moscow and Washington have delayed carrying out strategic arms reduction treaties until Kiev ratifies the NPT. The world's third largest nuclear power, Ukraine last January gave up its nuclear arsenal under an agreement signed with Russia and the US in exchange for about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 633m) in nuclear fuel supplies and disarmament assistance. Parliament ratified the Start-1 treaty in February; NPT was the last step. The conservative parliament for three years hedged on ratifying NPT, viewed by many nationalists and communists as Ukraine's last bargaining chip, but yesterday's debate was brisk. 'Ratification will make us hostage to politics in other countries - like Russia,' said Mr Oleh Vitkovich, a rightist deputy. But, after only a dozen deputies, Mr Kuchma significantly spoke last. He told the chamber that, as a former director of a nuclear missiles factory, he found the argument for keeping a nuclear deterrent an 'illusion' held by 'false patriots'. 'By signing this treaty, Ukraine shows we don't blackmail the world community,' he said. Although Ukraine inherited 176 inter-continental missiles and 41 strategic bombers - the warheads are now being transferred to Russia - Moscow controlled the launch codes and Kiev lacked both the technology and financing properly to store the weapons or gain control. Ukraine never made nuclear weapons, only missiles, and never reprocessed spent nuclear fuel - although hard-liners claimed it boasted the scientific know-how to do so. Mr Kuchma warned the deputies that developing Ukraine's nuclear capability would require up to Dollars 200bn and help from Russia. The president instead asked for further western aid to dismantle the nuclear weapons. On Tuesday, 14 western states and the European Union promised Dollars 234.38m in disarmament aid on top of Dollars 500m already pledged. The funds are for military conversion, resettling and retraining military personnel, environmental clean-up, missile dismantlement, non-proliferation safeguards and nuclear reactor safety. Earlier this week Mr Kuchma said Russia put further pressure on Ukraine this week by cutting off nuclear fuel supplies - needed to power Ukraine's five nuclear power plants - until Ukraine ratified the NPT, according to news agency Interfax. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Krylov yesterday welcomed the Ukrainian decision. 'This is an extremely positive step, so necessary now for strengthening security and stability in Europe,' he said.   Countries:-  UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.

0,FT943-2173 ,"FT943-2173 _AN-EIUDKAAJFT 940921   FT  21 SEP 94 / Road-map sought for EU applicants      By DAVID BUCHAN and LIONEL BARBER      PARIS, BRUSSELS   France and Germany agreed yesterday to ask the European Commission to produce a white paper next spring setting out a road-map for enlarging the European Union to eastern Europe. The idea is to emulate Lord Cockfield's celebrated 1985 white paper which set out a list of measures for the European Union to adopt in order to complete the single market by 1992, a Brussels official said yesterday. EU officials hope the detailed pre-accession strategy will give the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe fresh incentives to consolidate economic reform, while persuading them that their aspirations for EU membership are taken seriously. The Franco-German initiative was unveiled yesterday at the end of a two-day meeting in Paris of both countries' foreign ministers and ambassadors to the six EU candidate countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania) as well as the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The aim of the conference was to pool information on eastern Europe, but also to ensure greater harmony between France and Germany on the EU's next enlargement to the east than was evident earlier this year on entry negotiations with Nordic countries and Austria. French complaints that Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, had put candidate countries' interests ahead of those of the EU had sparked a diplomatic row. Mr Kinkel, the current president of the EU's Council of Ministers, said the white paper 'should map out the road ahead' for East Europe's eventual integration. Among other elements, it should cover the difficulties of adapting its economic, banking, legal and transport systems to EU norms. One likely approach is for the Commission to draw up a list of between 100 and 150 measures for the East Europeans to adopt in order to make their legislation compatible with EU standards. In return, the EU would phase out progressively anti-dumping measures and thereby expand the single European market eastwards. Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister of France which takes over the EU presidency from Germany in January, said the white paper idea would be broached with Mr Jacques Santer, the Commission president-elect. Both foreign ministers claimed that their governments were at one on enlargement the east, but differences of emphasis emerged over how far the EU should try to lift eastern Europe's standard of living to its own. Mr Kinkel suggested that it was important to treat eastern Europe as a whole, with reference to former East Germany, now incorporated in the European Union. 'We cannot have wages in Dresden that are twice as high as in Budapest, which are twice as high as in Bucharest.' However, the French side emphasised possible costs involved. Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's EU affairs minister, cited the alarming, though hypothetical, example that if all east European and Baltic countries were next year to enter the Union with unchanged farm and structural funds rules, the Union budget would have to double.

0,FT921-15171 ,"FT921-15171 _AN-CAKAKADCFT 920111   FT  11 JAN 92 / France signals reversal of nuclear weapons doctrine      By IAN DAVIDSON      PARIS   FRANCE signalled a historic reversal of its national defence doctrine yesterday, offering for the first time to discuss its nuclear capability with its European Community partners as part of the development of a common defence policy. The offer departs from France's long-standing insistence that its nuclear weapons and nuclear doctrine could only be matters of French concern. The abandonment of this central tenet of French independence, a constant of defence policy since General de Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic 33 years ago, could break the national consensus on nuclear strategy which has largely protected France from anti-nuclear movements. It will provoke controversy among the conservative Gaullist party, and is likely to stir debate on the prospects of a European defence policy in the rest of the EC, particularly Britain - western Europe's other nuclear-armed state. Launching a debate on the treaties agreed at last month's Maastricht summit, which include a long-term commitment to the development of a European defence policy, President Francois Mitterrand said the debate over the defence of Europe would raise issues which had to be resolved, notably that of nuclear weapons. 'Only two countries in the Community have nuclear weapons,' he said. 'Is it possible to conceive a European doctrine? This will very quickly be the major question of a common defence policy.' President Mitterrand's question clearly implies that France at least would be prepared to discuss the possibility of such a European doctrine. He did not indicate what such a doctrine should consist of, but the inference is that the other members of the 12 would be invited to take part in the formulation of the doctrine which would in future govern French (and no doubt British) nuclear weapons. His proposal is quite different from the suggestion repeated yesterday by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, that French nuclear weapons should one day be transferred to a 'very strong European political union'. On the contrary, President Mitterrand's proposal would appear to combine French national control with a European doctrine. President Mitterrand said the nuclear question needed to be tackled 'very quickly'. This is no doubt due to the civil war in Yugoslavia, and the political struggles between the nuclear-armed republics of the former Soviet Union. However, the nuclear issue may also be critical for unlocking Europe's internal defence debate. In the past, French practical insistence on a purely national nuclear policy has not only been poles apart from its rhetoric over the need for a European defence policy, but has also been a point of friction with Germany.

0,FT931-17028 ,"FT931-17028 _AN-DACAXADUFT 930102   FT  02 JAN 93 / Skiing: Hidden menace of summer meadows      By ARNOLD WILSON   JUST BEFORE the snows came in Switzerland's picturesque Grisons region, the farmers of Davos and Klosters brought their herds of cattle down from the Alpine pastures in a ceremony known locally as die Schwiegermutter begraben  -'burying the mother-in-law'. The mother-in-law, in this slightly uncomfortable analogy, is the symbol of the barren and empty alp. The arrival of snow changes the whole personality of a ski resort. Most skiers rarely worry about what lies beneath the snow they are skiing on. But it is often useful for high-mountain guides to 'walk' off-piste terrain during the summer or early autumn months to complement the understanding of snow conditions, depths and hidden hazards they may encounter with skiers during the winter. It is especially useful in glacier regions to gauge the extent and drift of crevasses. Seeing a ski resort without snow can be a fascinating experience. The universally-feared Streiff run on Kitzbuhel's Hahnenkamm looks almost idyllic without the layer of sheet-ice deliberately engineered to prevent racers breaking through and catching a potentially-disastrous edge. Zermatt's steep slopes are awash with colour as wild flowers delight the eye and scent the breeze. Like a steep-sided meadow, the dreaded Gotschnawang area in Klosters - where five years ago an avalanche killed Major Hugh Lindsay and came close to engulfing his friend, the Prince of Wales - looked extraordinarily bland and innocent as the late afternoon sun lingered lazily on its leafy banks. It is dangerous because it is prone to avalanche rather than because it is technically difficult. We walked up and over the great Grisons alps between Davos and Arosa, a tour undertaken over a century ago by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the first Briton to accomplish this route on skis. His wife was being treated for tuberculosis at a clinic in Davos, a town that acquired a name as a centre where TB sufferers could convalesce. In Conan Doyle's day, Davos was just beginning to earn its reputation as one of Europe's classic winter sports regions, a natural progression from its earlier fame as a health resort. The walk is long and arduous but the scenery, wild flowers and plants are sufficiently stirring to compensate. Occasionally we glimpsed giant ski-lift pylons in the distance which seemed out of place without snow on the ground. Conan Doyle made light of his epic tour in an article he wrote for Strand Magazine 100 years ago. 'You adjust your body for a rapid slide', he wrote, 'but your 'ski' stick motionless and over you go upon your face. Or you stop for an instant to tell a group how well you are getting on and they suddenly find that their congratulations are addressed to the soles of your 'ski' tied tightly round your neck]' His ski tour de force was only one of many 'firsts' at Europe's highest town (5,118ft) and Switzerland's largest ski resort. The first English ski club was formed here in 1903 and the world's first tow bar was built by a young German engineer, Gerhard Mueller, with the help of some old motor cycle parts. In 1931, the first funicular railway specifically for skiers was installed up to the Weissfluhjoch and three years later Erich Constam installed the world's first 'proper' drag lift. Some of Europe's first recreational skis were tried out here, too. A pair found their way to Davos from Norway and the village carpenter set out to try to make duplicates. Some of the local youths tried them out and struggled manfully to control them, in spite of their vast length and lack of edges. Although it is famous principally for its Parsenn mountain (skiing up to 9,300 ft), the long run down to Kublis and beyond (14 km) and the exhilarating Derby run down to Kublis or Klosters, Davos has a wealth of skiing spread in almost all directions. There are five main ski areas - Parsenn, Jakobshorn, Rinerhorn, Schatzalp/Strelpass and Pischa, with almost 90 runs between them totalling 320 kilometres of pistes. The Madrissa side of Klosters provides gentler skiing and an opportunity to make moderately easy tours into Austria's Silvretta region. The Parsenn/Weissfluh slopes provide the heart of the Davos skiing, linking with Strela above Davos Platz and the Gotschna area above Klosters. There are long, picturesque and not particularly difficult runs fanning out in almost all directions. Some of the north-facing runs down to Klosters are testing, particularly Drostobel. And, of course, there is always the Wang. If it is open, ski it. If it is closed, stay well away. As for the tour to Arosa, it is doubtless easier, cheaper and safer in summer than winter. After all, climbing on skins is much more difficult than bounding up in decent walking boots.

The UN  Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1991 until the country  met all demands of Resolution 687. To date, Iraq has entered  into the last phase of its destruction program. If by initial  difficulties it has cooperated with the UN inspectors over its  nuclear arsenal site. The majority of the Security Council  members and nonmembers are in favor of lifting sanctions. These  countries are satisfied that Iraq had met all the conditions.  But the United States and Britain want to impose political  conditions before the sanctions were lifted. This is beyond what  was agreed to originally under Resolution 687. It is unfair to  impose new conditions. After all, the sanctions were imposed to  punish Iraq for invading Kuwait in August 1990. By now, the  Iraqis would have learned their lesson. They know very well  that having designs of future invasions would be met with tough  retaliatory military measures.    Therefore, those obstructing the lifting of sanctions are  not  being fair to Iraq. Questions are being raised over the  discrimination and policy selectivity with regards to Iraq's  vis-a-vis UN's policies on Bosnia, Somalia, and the Israeli  occupation of Palestine. So, is the Security Council fair in  continuing to impose the trade and arms embargo on Iraq? Also,  are the council's decisions dominated by the one or two  countries and not the majority?    By now, the sanctions will have served their purpose.  Continuing to punish Iraq will merely cause further hardship on  its people. Through the sanctions, the people of Iraq have been  facing an acute shortage of food and medicine. Although the  sanctions do not include food and medicine, the inability to  trade means the lack of financial resources. So, it does not  have enough money to buy the much required supplies. The  country is also lacking humanitarian aid. Thousands of people  will die if the sanctions are not lifted. Besides this, the  country plunged into an economic doom since the Gulf war for  which it finds difficulty to recover.    It is about time some of the permanent members realize that  the embargo is no longer justified. Only then will Iraq be able  to put back its economy on the road to recovery.    However, for Iraq, the lifting of the sanctions must not  mean  going back to old ways. Malaysia, along with the majority of  the UN members, did not condone its invasion of Kuwait. This is  more so since Iraq along with Kuwait and Malaysia are Muslim  countries and members of the Organization of Islamic Countries,  OIC. At the same time, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and certain Arab  countries say that Iraq is still a threat to region's security.    Three years after the Gulf war, Iraq still does not  recognize  the borders with Kuwait and refuses to free Kuwaitis it holds.  Iraq, therefore, needs to be more forthcoming in meeting the  demands of Resolution 687. It also needs to show sincere  peaceful gestures to its neighbors in the Gulf. This is because  Iraq's good ties with the OIC members will be crucial to ensure  its survival in world trade. Also, Arab countries do not want a  repeat of the invasion of Kuwait.     "

Gorbachev ended a whirlwind visit to Britain on  Friday with one of his familiar unilateral disarmament gestures and a fresh  warning to Western politicians that it is time for them to respond more  positively to his ""new thinking.""    The gesture -- a halt in production of nuclear weapons-grade uranium and the  closing by 1991 of two reactors used to make weapons-grade plutonium -- was  quickly dismissed by independent experts and the Bush Administration as  relatively meaningless in military terms.      Could Strain Alliance    But his warning that a North Atlantic Treaty Organization plan to modernize its  short-range nuclear arsenal could force the Soviet Union to follow suit and  jeopardize conventional arms reduction negotiations in central Europe is  considered likely to put further strain on a Western alliance already at odds  over the modernization issue.    Gorbachev's moves came amid a dazzling display of traditional British pomp and  circumstance that culminated with lunch at Windsor Palace, where Queen  Elizabeth II accepted the Soviet leader's invitation to visit Moscow at an  undetermined future date.    The monarch's acceptance, which required the approval of Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher's government, underlined the extraordinary warmth that has  come to coexist with continued, sharp policy differences in the complex  Soviet-British relationship.    A visit to Moscow by the Queen, the first since her distant relatives of the  Russian royal family were overthrown in the 1917 Russian Revolution, would  represent a highly symbolic endorsement by Britain of the changes that  Gorbachev has wrought in the Soviet system. At the same time, Thatcher's  government hopes that the prospect of the visit will become another incentive  for the transformation to continue.    Earlier Friday, Gorbachev assured several hundred invited dignitaries at  Guildhall, the ornate and historic seat of the City of London's government,  that ""there is no turning back"" from his program of reform, known in Russian as  perestroika. And he hailed Britain as ""the nation whose political experience  has enriched the history of the world.""    Thatcher responded by praising the Soviet leader as ""one of those rare people  who has the vision, the boldness and the sheer power of personality to change  the whole future of his country, and to have a profound effect on the wider  world as well.""    In a subsequent television interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., she  added: ""I do think he's a man of destiny.""    For all the superlatives, however, Gorbachev's Guildhall speech was a  disappointment to those who had expected him to announce some major new arms  control initiative or to expound his vision of a future ""common European home""  for the peoples of East and West.    Instead, he stressed what he described as the bankruptcy of the Cold War  ""philosophy of confrontation"" and called for a new era of ""international  interaction"" that will be necessary to solve the ""various dangerous and  pressing problems facing mankind.""    Continuing the Soviet commitment to reduce weapons arsenals, Gorbachev said, ""I  take this opportunity to tell you that we have recently decided to cease this  year the production of enriched weapon-grade uranium.""    ""In addition to the industrial reactor for the production of weapon-grade  plutonium shut down in 1987,"" he added, ""we plan to shut down two other such  reactors this year and next year without commissioning new units to replace  them. This is yet another major step towards the complete cessation of  production of fissionable materials for use in weapons.""    However, independent experts said the Soviets already have a sufficient  stockpile of nuclear materials. Also, materials contained in the warheads of  the medium-range missiles being dismantled under Intermediate-range Nuclear  Forces reduction agreements with the West can be reused.    ""I don't think that anybody at this point believes that this will have any  effect on their ability to produce nuclear weapons,"" commented Hans Bennendyk,  an arms control expert at London's International Institute for Strategic  Studies.    Thatcher told reporters here that the Soviet move ""is unlikely to have an  effect for some years,"" and in Washington, State Department spokesman Richard  Boucher dismissed the announcement, saying at a news briefing that ""the  measures will leave the Soviet Union with substantial production capabilities  for nuclear materials.""    President Bush, asked at a press conference about Gorbachev's announcement,  replied that he hadn't seen it. But he rejected Gorbachev's criticism of the  day before that the United States is foot-dragging rather than moving forward  with the Soviet Union on arms control and that the Bush Administration is  taking too long with its review of foreign policy.    ""Let me simply say we're the United States of America,"" the President said.  ""We're making a prudent review, and I will be ready to discuss that with the  Soviets when we are ready. Mr. Gorbachev knows that there is no foot-dragging  going on . . . ,"" he said.    In issuing his warning on tactical nuclear weapons, Gorbachev said, ""There can  be no doubt that if NATO goes ahead with its (modernization) program, . . .  this is bound to affect the Vienna (conventional arms) talks,  confidence-building measures, and the situation in Europe in general. This is  bound to devalue much of what has been achieved under the INF  (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) treaty. . . .    ""We strongly oppose any plans for the modernization of nuclear weapons,"" he  added. ""We are not modernizing, nor do we intend to modernize them unless we  are made to.""    One British analyst termed Gorbachev's statement ""a shot across the bow"" of  NATO at a time that both the United States and Britain are pressing the allies  to commit to modernization. They argue that the Soviets have already brought  their tactical nuclear arsenal up to date, leaving NATO far behind. West  Germany, however, wants to postpone the decision, and the debate is expected to  come to a head within the next few weeks.    Underlying the modernization issue is a fundamental difference between Thatcher  and Gorbachev over the future of nuclear weapons. Gorbachev has stated that his  goal is to have a world without such weapons by the year 2000. Thatcher argues  that it will be impossible to put the nuclear ""genie"" back in the bottle, and  that furthermore, nuclear weapons have been an effective deterrent to war in  Europe for 40 years.    Earlier, the Soviet leader appeared slightly uncomfortable during most of a day  in which he was surrounded by a British pageantry little changed through many  centuries.    Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, were greeted at the entrance to Guildhall by  Christopher Collet, the Lord Mayor of The City, the square-mile area that is  the oldest part of the capital and now mostly its financial district. Collet,  who was robed in blue, gold, and ermine and wore a plumed, tricorn hat, walked  beside the Soviet leader, who wore a dark pinstripe business suit, into the  splendid main chamber. They marched behind more robed men carrying the huge,  ceremonial golden mace and sword as the state trumpeters sounded their arrival.    As he reached his chair next to the podium, Gorbachev began to sit just as the  first notes of the British national anthem were played. He recovered quickly.    He also appeared uncertain on arrival at Windsor Castle, nervously  straightening his coat as he stepped out of his armor-plated Zil limousine to  shake hands with the waiting Queen. He was again out of place for the start of  the national anthem before Prince Philip, the Queen's husband, guided him back  to the proper spot.    Invited to review a battalion of bearskin-capped Coldstream Guards on the  castle's immaculately manicured internal quadrangle, Gorbachev scurried past  the ranks without even looking at the troops in their gray greatcoats on either  side.    He did take an interest during a brief royal tour of the castle in portraits of  Czar Alexander I and half a dozen other Russian military heroes who helped  defeat Napoleon in 1812. He also stopped to admire a huge suit of armor said to  have been made for King Henry VIII.    But Gorbachev seemed his happiest when, for the second time in his brief visit,  he ordered his limousine stopped in downtown London so he could get out and mix  with the crowds of British well-wishers.

He also appeared uncertain on arrival at Windsor Castle, nervously  straightening his coat as he stepped out of his armor-plated Zil limousine to  shake hands with the waiting Queen. He was again out of place for the start of  the national anthem before Prince Philip, the Queen's husband, guided him back  to the proper spot.    Invited to review a battalion of bearskin-capped Coldstream Guards on the  castle's immaculately manicured internal quadrangle, Gorbachev scurried past  the ranks without even looking at the troops in their gray greatcoats on either  side.    He did take an interest during a brief royal tour of the castle in portraits of  Czar Alexander I and half a dozen other Russian military heroes who helped  defeat Napoleon in 1812. He also stopped to admire a huge suit of armor said to  have been made for King Henry VIII.    But Gorbachev seemed his happiest when, for the second time in his brief visit,  he ordered his limousine stopped in downtown London so he could get out and mix  with the crowds of British well-wishers.

Although historic exploratory talks between the UK government and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, were seen as constructive, sharp differences emerged over the timing of the disposal of IRA arms and explosives. After the first public talks between UK officials and Sinn Fein in 25 years of troubles, the two sides appeared on a collision course. The government insisted that the decommissioning of the IRA's arsenal would be a condition to Sinn Fein being allowed to enter all-party talks on the future of Ulster. Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland political affairs minister, said after a briefing by Mr Quentin Thomas, head of the UK's five-man delegation, that 'their continued retention will constitute a barrier to other political parties, as well as to the government itself, in joining with Sinn Fein in substantive political negotiations'. The minister warned that if the talks are 'to be taken to a successful conclusion, then the question of the decommissioning of arms must be resolved to satisfaction'. Nevertheless, he called the meeting 'constructive and business-like' while Mr Martin McGuinness, leading the five-strong Sinn Fein delegation, said it was 'a good beginning'. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, however, warned the government that it should not place conditions on the talks process. 'History will judge the British badly if they make excuses for not moving the peace process forward,' he said. The exploratory meeting at the former Northern Ireland parliament building at Stormont Castle in Belfast came exactly 100 days after the announcement of the IRA ceasefire. Condemned by hardline unionists, the meeting is viewed as an important part of wider negotiations started by the British and Irish governments, which aim to bring all the political parties in Ulster into discussions to craft a constitutional framework for the province. Mr John Major, who received a report on the meeting at the European Union summit in Essen, told other EU leaders that contacts with the republicans were designed to turn a 'ceasefire into a lasting peace'. He underlined that London and Dublin were close to a framework agreement to provide the basis for round-table talks on a new political settlement. Mr Ancram said yesterday's discussion had raised a 'very large areas of subjects'. Both sides had 'a good trot around the course', he said. Mr McGuinness, said the talks 'should have happened a long time ago'. The two sides agreed to meet again on December 19. Meanwhile, the Ulster Democratic party, one of the loyalist groups invited to talks next week with UK officials, warned it was reconsidering the invitation because of the presence at the Stormont meeting of a councillor from the Irish Republic. Sinn Fein delegates, who included the Old Bailey bomber Mr Gerry Kelly, called for an end to British military operations and a speedy release of all political prisoners. Sinn Fein said these issues should be addressed as a matter of urgency. Sinn Fein comes in from the cold, Page 6 New tune for Irish reel, Page 9   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

This, he added, falls within the context of the Arab states'  demand to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons.    In a news conference he held this afternoon at the Arab  League headquarters, al-Shar' said that the Arab League Council  had agreed on a unified Arab position when the time comes to  renew the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, so that Israel may  not be excluded from signing this treaty. He noted that weapons  of mass destruction are dangerous to pan-Arab security and,  therefore, it is natural for the Arabs to defend their interests.    On the Arab position toward France following its recent  agreement on military and security cooperation with Israel,  al-Shar' said: We were surprised by the noticeable  consolidation of French-Israeli ties recently and following the  Israeli massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It came at a time  when we are discussing the peace process and despite the fact  that Israel possesses a large arsenal of all types of weapons  and is occupying Arab lands, he added. Al-Shar' emphasized that  the matter had been brought up during the meetings of the Arab  League Council, which unanimously denounced this step as one  that does not serve the peace process in the region and harms  Arab-French ties, which were marked by friendship and balance.    The Syrian foreign minister noted that it had been agreed  within the Arab League Council not to debate the issue of the  Arab boycott of Israel during the current session. He stressed  that the boycott cannot be lifted without Israel's withdrawal  from the occupied Arab territories. He added: The boycott is a  law, and the law is indivisible. Besides, there is no Arab  decision to lift the boycott, and if some states have made  unilateral decisions in this regard, this has nothing to do with  the Arab League.    Discussing peace, al-Shar' said Syria rejects the  step-by-step policy and seeks to achieve a comprehensive and  just peace that will secure the Arabs' legitimate rights. He  noted that Syria's stand stipulates that Jerusalem is part of  the occupied Arab territories and Syria demands a complete  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for a comprehensive  peace.    He said Israel has not yet agreed to this measure and he  affirmed that, as long as the peace is not comprehensive, it  will not lead to security and stability in the region.    He pointed out that the Arab League Council discussed the  water issue and expressed its support for the Syrian stance on  the Tigris an Euphrates Rivers, two international rivers to  which international laws and norms apply. He said the council  asked Syria to present legal and political studies on this  problem because water security is vital to the Arab countries.    He added that the Arab League Council reviewed numerous  problems facing the Arab countries, such as Iraq, Libya, Sudan,  Yemen, Algeria, and Somalia. He noted that such discussion is a  positive factor in openness among the Arabs to push things in  the direction of Arab reconciliation. He said the Arab nation  should not pause at the Gulf crisis and that it must work to  remedy the current serious disorder.     "
0,FT941-3644 ,"FT941-3644 _AN-ECODSAFXFT 940315   FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: On the threshold of a third phase - Asea Brown Boveri is looking for expansion      By ANDREW BAXTER   Mr Percy Barnevik may court controversy with his opinions on thorny issues such as western aid for the former Soviet Union, but he has always preferred to hit the headlines by announcing good news from Asea Brown Boveri. Last week, he wasted no opportunity to do so. Reaching the UK table on a whistle-stop tour of a Copenhagen dining room, where journalists from 35 countries were tucking in at ABB's annual results shindig, Mr Barnevik revealed with some pleasure that ABB UK had notched up the group's biggest improvement in earnings last year. The president and chief executive of Europe's largest electrical engineering group is in confident, almost sprightly mood by his standards these days, and not only because of the performance of ABB UK. The entire group's pre-tax profits after financial items rose by 7 per cent last year to Dollars 1.19bn, in spite of a 4 per cent fall in revenues to Dollars 28.3bn. In dollar terms, that may not look too exciting - ABB's pre-tax earnings have, after all, hovered around Dollars 1.1bn since 1990. Mr Barnevik, though, sees a deeper meaning in the result than simply marking the return to rising profits after a slight dip in 1992. For one thing, he points out, profits expressed in local currencies rose by an average 25 per cent on a 6 per cent increase in revenues, a better indication of underlying trends. More significantly for the long-term future of the company, its 206,000 employees and Europe's role in the world engineering industry, he believes ABB is standing on the threshold of a new phase in its short corporate history. Phase one, from 1988 to 1990, saw the creation of the company from the engineering interests of Sweden's Asea and Brown Boveri of Switzerland, followed by heady growth and acquisitions in an expanding market. Phase two, from 1991 to 1993, was one of consolidation and selected growth. Amid deep recession in Europe and North America, 47,000 jobs were cut amid restructuring and reorganisation in western countries. On the other hand growth opportunities mainly in Asia and the former communist countries of eastern Europe and, more recently the old Soviet Union, have added 35,000 new jobs. The aim has been to exploit fast-growing new markets while laying the foundations for profitable growth in western countries when they emerge from the recession. This culminated last year with a reorganisation designed to improve global co-ordination and efficiency, and a net Dollars 596m non-recurring charge due mainly to restructuring in the second half of the year. Now, says Mr Barnevik, ABB has reached another turning point, and a third phase - expansion - is beginning. With the recession over for practical purposes, he says, ABB can go for growth and reap the benefits of restructuring which will be completed by this autumn, and will save Dollars 200m in a full year. Mr Barnevik may be one of Europe's most admired industrial strategists and visionaries, but hard-nosed City analysts judge ABB by its financial performance. By hitting the accelerator now, though, they believe he has every chance to achieve the expansion profitably. 'If ABB can't deliver earnings growth after all their restructuring, it's pretty well lights out for everyone else,' says Mr Russ Mould of S. G. Warburg Securities. Mr Barnevik is in sight of achieving a cherished financial target that looked even beyond him two years ago - a 10 per cent operating margin (return on operating profits after depreciation) and thus come closer to the profitability of its big rival General Electric of the US. The margin rose from 6.1 per cent in 1992 to 7.7 per cent last year, and Mr Mould believes ABB could get very close to reaching 10 per cent within a couple of years. A lot more restructuring goes on behind the scenes, he says, than is apparent from ABB's publicly announced reorganisation measures, such as the 1992 dismemberment of the old environmental services business segment. There is also considerable scope for synergies, and hence savings in the newly created power transmission and distribution segment and the biggest new segment, industry and building systems, which employs nearly 86,000 people alone. Here, in particular, Mr Barnevik will be under pressure to prove he has not created a conglomerate within a Leviathan. Better market conditions in western markets will help lift profits but the biggest contributions to earnings improvement will come from new markets. The fact that ABB is already making good profits in countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic is a hopeful sign for the future, says Mr Mould. In the Asia Pacific region, ABB is trying to boost its already significant presence - Dollars 3.6bn of sales last year - by becoming a true 'insider'. In power transmission and distribution alone, for example, it has 20 plants and plans another 23 over the next few years. And it may not matter that all ABB's competitors - General Electric and Westinghouse of the US, Siemens and GEC Alsthom from Europe - are doing much the same, because the growth prospects are so mindboggling. China, says Mr Barnevik, needs to increase its power capacity by 15,000MW to 18,000MW a year - compared with the 15,000MW built by Switzerland over the past 100 years.

Markovic: ""Air Defense of the Republic of  Srpska Ready for Attack; Respond to Fire With Fire""]    [Text] The military of the republic of Srpska have the  powerful ""Kub"" and ""Volhov"" missile systems, which are effective  at altitudes up to 30 kilometers. U.S. officers compare military  action in Bosnia to searching for a needle in a haystack, but  Serbian commanders see it as an adventure endangering the entire  region.    The latest threats of military intervention and NATO air  strikes did not surprise the military of the republic of Srpska.  The military air defense of this youngest Serbian republic was  in full readiness even before the threats. The military  commanders, who take these new threats very seriously, are  inclined to believe that ""all this serves to pressure the  Serbian side before the pending talks in Geneva.""    However, if the threats of the trigger-happy Western war  planners were to be fulfilled, resulting in a military action,  it would be dangerous for the entire region. The military of the  republic of Srpska, who are known to have a mass of antiaircraft  artillery weapons and night-capable missile systems, believe  that nobody needs this kind of adventure.    The first thing the soldiers of the republic of Srpska like  to display are the most modern antiaircraft ""Bofors""-type guns  made in Sweden. They have laser sights which guarantee maximal  precision in hitting aerial targets. They are also capable of  high fire concentration, several thousand rounds per minute.  Serbian fighters are also proud of their mass of portable  shoulder-launched ""Strela"" [arrow]-type laser-equipped devices.  ""Strelas"" are effective within a range of 3.5 kilometers against  approaching or departing targets; they represent a particular  threat to fighter-bombers because their range covers the  altitude most suitable for fighter-bomber attacks on ground  targets.    The ""Kub"" is a highly maneuverable missile system; it  consists of three launchers on a single vehicle; it is designed  for medium- and high-altitude targets. But the most powerful  missile system is the stationary ""Volhov""-type system. This  system involves the most powerful missiles in the air-defense  arsenal of the republic of Srpska military. The system has been  modified to incorporate new guidance devices. These missiles are  effective even at an altitude of 30 kilometers, and their speed  matches that of the most modern NATO planes.    The terrain configuration is very advantageous for the  Serbian air defense forces; it makes it very difficult for even  the most modern electronic equipment to detect targets. Thus,  our commanders feel that the probability of destruction is  negligible. Their views are supported by data which show that  such destruction of ground targets (as proposed by the Western  war planners) is hard to achieve even in training exercises. The  Gulf War experience also confirms this fact; there were only 17  percent direct hits there.    Higher-ranking U.S. officers compare the possible military  action against the Serbs in Bosnia to searching for a needle in  a haystack. They have publicly expressed their skepticism about  air strikes despite the variety of weapons possessed by NATO  forces. Although they are aware that the Serbian military does  not have fighter planes (interceptors), the high-ranking U.S.  officers respect the air defense of the republic of Srpska's  military, pointing out that the Serbs could easily conceal their  heavy weapons in wooded mountainous areas and settlements. U.S.  officers expressed the opinion that this would make pilots  reluctant to attack.     "

Clinton Draws Closer  to Europe""]    [Text] When President Clinton comes to Europe next week to  attend the NATO summit he is not going to offer much  satisfaction to the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians who are  knocking at the doors of NATO and demanding protection from a  possible resurgence of imperialism in Russia. But, to judge by  yesterday's major foreign policy speech in Milwaukee, delivered  by Vice President Al Gore because of the death of Mr Clinton's  mother, the President seems to have learnt a lot about the  dangers and challenges facing Europe -- and the importance of  facing them if America is to remain prosperous and secure.    In his ideas, if not yet in his actions, Mr Clinton clearly  wants his visit to Europe to mark a clean break from last summer  when Warren Christopher, his Secretary of State, could dismiss  the war in Bosnia as ""a humanitarian crisis a long way from home  in the middle of another continent.""    Europe's central importance for America was certainly the  welcome message yesterday from Milwaukee. ""Nothing is more  important than our relationship with Europe,"" declared Mr  Clinton. But what was more convincing, and potentially  significant, was his ability to justify this airy statement to a  domestic American audience which still shows every sign of  wanting to turn its back on the outside world. Predictably Mr  Clinton explained that Europe was an ""invaluable trading  partner"" and a market for exports. It was also a possible  source of security threats and global instability and therefore  a potential drain on American government finances. But Mr  Clinton went beyond these cliches to emphasise a more  intangible, and even more important, feature of America's  relationship with Europe: a feature which lies at the heart of  the challenge for Europe and explains why the Atlantic will  always be more important to America than the Pacific, regardless  of the future flows of trade and the balance of world economic  growth.    What Europe now needed above all else, said Mr Clinton, was  a  new form of protection, built not on walls and barbed wire, but  on free commerce, democracy and respect for human diversity and  political dissent. After the decades of Communist uniformity  and repression, Europeans had rediscovered their ethnic and  religious differences. They now had to transform Europe's  diversity from a source of conflict into its great strength.  America's indispensable contribution was to show through its  own historical experience that it was possible ""to build a  shared civic space large enough for all our differences."" But  this ideal of a civic society, embracing diversity instead of  suppressing dissent, was not an American creation. It was  actually an import by Jefferson from European liberal  philosophy. And that philosophy not only underlies the American  Constitution; it also ultimately made inevitable America's  reluctant involvement in the two world wars.    It is because America shares its fundamental political  philosophy with West Europe that so much of 20th-century history  has revolved around the Atlantic alliance. And as Mr Clinton  correctly asserted, the greatest challenge facing America, as  well as West Europe, in the coming years, is to ensure that the  politics of Central Europe and the former Soviet Union are cast  irreversibly into the same liberal mould. Mr Clinton may not  yet know how to complete this historic task. But at least, as  he said in Milwaukee, he is finally willing ""to put America's  shoulder to the wheel.""     "

In these essays -- most of which are drawn from the New York  Review of Books and the London Review of Books -- Cannadine may sometimes  appear breezy or glib. But in each piece he seeks to elucidate historical or  political problems, and he offers real insight into the current state of  history and historiography. However clever the phrases, they yet invite serious  reading. Beneath appearances, Cannadine is thoughtful, stimulating and one of  those rare historians to give the complexities of history their due. Benjamin  Kilborne      Book Review; Column    "

Mr Carter, who recently served as an intermediary to persuade North Korea to enter talks with the US on dismantling its nuclear programme, will be joined by General Colin Powell, the former chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, and Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee. The envoys are expected to meet General Raoul Cedras and other Haitian military leaders, and try to persuade them to leave. White House officials said the administration was 'making every conceivable effort for them to leave peacefully', but insisted that only the manner of their departure was negotiable. Earlier Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said a US-led invasion of Haiti was 'a matter of days away'. Mr Clinton, who on Thursday night laid out his justifications for intervention in a television address to the nation, yesterday cancelled a political trip to California scheduled for tomorrow. Mr Perry said US forces would be ready by the weekend and could maintain that state of readiness for several days. Washington was alive with rumours that one or more of the Haitian military junta was pre paring to leave the island. But Gen Cedras, who was interviewed live on US television after the president had finished speaking, said he was prepared to die for his country. Yesterday President Ernesto Perez Balladares of Panama said he would grant asylum to Gen Cedras if that would avoid an invasion. Mr Clinton held a White House meeting yesterday with Fr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Haitian president ousted by Gen Cedras in the 1991 coup, and representatives of more than 20 nations which are contributing to an international peacekeeping force that will take over after the US invasion. Fr Aristide, in a signif-icant concession to conservative critics of his leftwing politics and character, promised to step down when his term of office ends late next year. Although the Haitian constitution prevents him from seeking re-election, Fr Aristide had maintained that the clock should be stopped on his term at the 1991 coup. This would have given him more than four years after he is restored to power. Least worst option, Page 9   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.     CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.

0,FT944-9132 ,"FT944-9132 _AN-EKQEIAANFT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / Ukraine to ratify treaty on N-arms      By MATTHEW KAMINSKI      KIEV   Ukraine's parliament yesterday ratified the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and closed a chapter in the country's hesitant steps to give up the nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet Union. The long-awaited vote, passed by wide margin, looks set to improve the often strained relations with the west and Russia. It also marks a considerable political victory for President Leonid Kuchma a week before his summit with President Bill Clinton. Ukraine will formally accede to the 1968 treaty as a non-nuclear state once security assurances from the US, the UK, France and Russia are, as expected, given at next month's CSCE summit in Budapest. The assurances concern Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ukraine's ratification also is crucial because Moscow and Washington have been delaying implementation of the first and second strategic arms reduction treaties until Kiev ratified the NPT. Ukraine, which is the world's third largest nuclear power, last January gave up its nuclear arsenal under an agreement signed with Russia and the US in exchange for about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 641m) in nuclear fuel supplies and disarmament assistance. Parliament ratified the Start-2 treaty in February; NPT was the last step. The conservative parliament had for three years hedged on ratifying NPT, viewed by many nationalists and communists as Ukraine's last bargaining chip, but yesterday's debate was brisk. 'Ratification will make us hostage to politics in other countries - such as Russia,' said Mr Oleh Vitkovich, a right-wing deputy. But, after only a dozen deputies, Mr Kuchma significantly spoke last. He told the chamber that, as a former director of a nuclear missiles factory, he found the argument for keeping a nuclear deterrent an 'illusion' held by 'false patriots'. 'By signing this treaty, Ukraine shows we don't blackmail the world community,' he said, warning of diplomatic isolation. Although Ukraine inherited 176 inter-continental missiles and 41 strategic bombers - the warheads are now being transferred to Russia - Moscow controlled the launch codes and Kiev lacked both the technology and financing to store the weapons properly or gain control. Mr Kuchma warned deputies that developing Ukraine's nuclear capability would require up to Dollars 200bn and help from Russia. The president instead asked for further western aid to dismantle the nuclear weapons. On Tuesday, 14 western states and the European Union promised Dollars 234.38m in disarmament aid on top of Dollars 500m already pledged. The funds are earmarked for military conversion, resettling and retraining military personnel, environmental clean-up, missile dismantlement, non-proliferation safeguards and nuclear reactor safety. 'As Ukraine takes the final steps to move beyond the nuclear issue,' a joint statement read, 'its relations with western partners will rise to a new qualitative level with a focus on political and economic questions and on Ukraine's closer integration into the west.' Russia put further pressure on Ukraine this week by cutting off nuclear fuel supplies - needed to power Ukraine's five nuclear power plants - until Ukraine ratified the NPT. Western diplomats called the vote a break-through. 'Ukraine can now be a full player on the international scene,' one said The US wanted Ukraine on board to build momentum ahead of next spring's on NPT renewal, opposed by states such as Nigeria and India.

In Washington, President Bush and Congressional leaders began emergency talks  on the federal budget deficit Tuesday, even as the stock market hit yet another  historic high.    Experts say the stock market is rising because U.S. interest rates are headed  lower, but the budget summit is occurring because interest rates have stayed  high this year, when budget planners had counted on them being a full  percentage point lower.    The result is that the government's interest payments on the national debt may  rise by $30 billion to more than $200 billion. That's right, $200 billion in  interest. The understandable fear in Washington is that the deficit may be out  of control.    What does it all mean? You won't find out by looking at the U.S. economy in  isolation but only by seeing it as part of the mosaic of the world economy. And  there the news is challenging, yet hopeful -- the U.S. faces a crisis of  confidence related to the government's handling of the budget deficit but could  turn the situation around the way Europe did in the 1980s.    The old continent is now the chief attraction for global business investment --  with $10 billion a year flowing from Japan alone -- just as the United States  attracted such investment in the early 1980s.    ""To some extent, investment is being diverted from Latin America and the U.S.,""  says Peter Rogge, senior vice president of Swiss Bank Corp. And investment in  Europe is only increased by the opening of Eastern Europe. The result, says the  Swiss Banker, is that global demand for investment capital has made interest  rates 1.5 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be.    So the U.S. deficit has been hit by a double whammy -- the foreign investment  that made it easier to finance the deficit in the '80s is no longer flowing  this way, and Europe's demand for investment capital is keeping interest rates  relatively high.    Moreover, says Rogge, that pattern may continue for at least five years -- with  the West German economy growing 6% a year and many of the other European  countries growing 4% -- compared to slower growth, perhaps 2% a year, for the  U.S. economy, in the estimate of Swiss bankers.    It's a picture of a changing world. At those rates, the combined economies of  the 10-nation European Community will be as large as the U.S. economy in five  years -- with Japan third, at roughly 60% the size of the United States or  Europe.    But rather than worrying about waning influence, the United States would do  better to look where Europe came from. Half a dozen years ago, Europe's  economies were moribund and lagging in investment -- which was then flowing to  America. ""The world thought Europe's only future would be as a theme park for  visiting Japanese business people,"" says Peter Sutherland, a former member of  the European Commission, the EC's ruling body, and now chairman of Allied Irish  Bank in Dublin.    But the Europeans woke up. In 1984, at a conference outside Paris, the EC  nations set a goal of true economic union by 1992 and have been working toward  that vision ever since. Yet investment capital started flowing immediately  after they set the goal, says Sutherland. ""Capital is an incident of  confidence, really,"" he says. ""If there is confidence, investment follows.""    Which is just the point. Capital seems very scarce in America these days. Both  Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Sen. James  Sasser (D-Tenn), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, talk of a ""capital  shortage.""    But confidence also seems in short supply. Swiss banker Rogge, who has visited  America for years, says he misses the old dynamism. ""I find American business  people skeptical these days -- skeptical that prosperity will continue  indefinitely, skeptical that U.S. industry is really competitive . . . ""    What accounts for that? Observers foreign and domestic trace the problem to the  budget deficit, which they see in terms of national will more than economics.    The Economist magazine calls the U.S. deficit ""an unmistakable symptom of a  dishonest political culture."" Its strong words refer to all the tricks of  off-budget financing, use of Social Security funds and borrowing from abroad  that U.S. administrations have used to mask the true size and impact of the  deficit.    And Herbert Stein, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, says  the budget deficit -- by limiting funds for private industry -- curbs growth in  U.S. investment, productivity and incomes. Stein, 73, says the idea that the  United States lacks capital is nonsense. ""In an economy with a gross national  product of $5.5 trillion, it is not credible that we do not have the money to  deal with our national and social needs,"" he says. But Stein blames cowardly  politicians, afraid to raise taxes or cut programs for people who are not poor  -- including many elderly -- for sapping of the nation's confidence.    Now, however, the diverted flow of foreign money and the deficit's frightening  rise may force a change. The aftermath of the budget summit will likely see  some higher taxes -- possibly a gasoline tax, although not the 50 cents a  gallon that Easterners call for and Westerners oppose. Alcohol and tobacco will  be taxed. Changes in Social Security taxes and capital gains will be closely  argued, at least.    Will taxes be bad for the economy? Not if they represent an honest attempt to  narrow the budget deficit. The very action itself could restore confidence,  bring down interest rates and spur investment. The rising stock market may be a  hopeful sign -- but then it had better be.    The stakes are high. Six years ago, as EC commissioners gathered near Paris,  the rest of the world thought Europe was finished -- but it is disproving that  judgment. Now many people and nations think the United States is in decline.  Whether they can be disproved may depend on Americans asking why they think  that way.

0,FT922-4064 ,"FT922-4064 _AN-CFHAXABHFT 920608   FT  08 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Europe's broken bond   The flag of dissent hoisted over Maastricht last week was a particularly grim sight for participants in the Ecu bond market. Denmark's vote against the treaty sent investors scurrying to sell, and left would-be issuers of the fledgling Euro-currency looking distinctly glum. Their fear is that if the Emu bandwagon really comes off the rails, the Ecu will prove a basket case in more senses than one. It will revert to its original status as a basket of currencies, useful merely as a convenient short cut to investing separately in each of the component parts. Until the first half of 1991, Ecu bonds generally traded around their theoretical, or synthetic yields. But when it became clear that the Ecu could be transformed one day into a proper parallel currency, spreads between the actual and theoretical yield began to reflect more than the mere saving on transaction costs. The signing of the Maastricht Treaty by heads of government last December prompted a rash of new Ecu bond issues and saw spreads on some maturities reaching 60 to 80 basis points over the theoretical yield. In retrospect it is hard to account for the euphoria. But a premium at the time seemed justified on the grounds that Ecu depreciation was a lesser risk than individual currency depreciation in the run-up to monetary union. That was based on a political calculation which, following the Danish vote, can no longer be taken for granted. Hence Friday's further fall-out in the Ecu bond market, when spreads fell below 10 basis points. On the basis that the Ecu is still destined to be Europe's currency but that the date has been pushed into the next century, the longer-dated issues may still be worth holding. Until the dust settles, fair value for shorter maturities must surely be close to the theoretical yield.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

THEIR RELATIONS WILL AFFECT THE CONTINENT.      By TYLER MARSHALL and MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      BONN      The German chancellor called it a special responsibility of his generation.    The Soviet president described it simply as realpolitik.    Whatever the description, those who crowded into the stuffy little auditorium  in the northern Caucasus spa town of Zheleznovodsk on July 16 and heard  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev report on results of  their two-day meeting knew they had witnessed history.    The Soviet Union and Germany -- Europe's biggest power and its richest -- had  with chilling suddenness buried half a century of bitter differences that had  dragged them through Europe's bloodiest war and estranged them during a  prolonged, uneasy peace.    From a thinly disguised fear of German revanchism, Moscow had embraced the  inevitability of German reunification as a cornerstone of ""the new political  order"" that Gorbachev is counting on so heavily.    In the process, the door has opened to a new and hugely important relationship  -- as rich in potential as it is loaded with uncertainty.    ""We stem from different parts of global civilization, but we feel that we  belong together,"" Gorbachev explained to those listening in Zheleznovodsk.    Anyone witnessing the champagne and euphoria that filled the chancellor's  aircraft as it winged its way home from the Caucasus last July would be left  with little doubt that Kohl believed the same.    How these two nations manage this new beginning will do much to influence the  future shape of a continent in the midst of greater change that at any time in  nearly two centuries.    If it succeeds, analysts believe that the new relationship could become the key  element in overcoming the economic and political differences of Europe's long  East-West division. Failure would likely deepen them further.    ""Germany is a huge force in the center of Europe,"" Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze told the Supreme Soviet last month. ""The future of  Europe largely depends on how we relate to this giant.""    History and the weight of numbers alone make Shevardnadze's assessment hard to  reject.    Including the Soviet Union's Asian mass, the two nations account for half of  Europe's population and nearly half of its total production. Together, they  have a land area twice that of Europe alone.    Later this month, Gorbachev is expected to make his first trip to the newly  united Germany and sign a 20-year Soviet-German treaty of ""good-neighborliness,  partnership and cooperation"" that will act as a framework for the new ties.    Rich and warm in its language, the treaty symbolizes the historical watershed.    ""With this treaty there will be a partnership, and that is fundamentally new,""  said Valentin M. Falin, secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Central  Committee and Gorbachev's principal adviser on German policy. ""And we will be  serious partners, economically and politically.""    Added another foreign policy specialist at the Central Committee: ""We decided  on friendship. Now we are waiting, rather expectantly, to see what that  friendship brings.""    So are many others.    The direction and intensity of this new German-Soviet relationship remains one  of the biggest question marks in a fast-changing European order -- its future  as uncertain as that of the Soviet Union itself.    Certainly, great potential is there.    As the Soviet empire lurches from crisis to crisis, it is the economically  strong, politically resurgent Germany that seems to have the most of what  Moscow so desperately needs if it is to survive as a stable nation.    With a trade volume of $34 billion last year, Germany is already the Soviets'  largest trading partner.    In a new political climate, German deutsche marks, not Soviet missiles, have  become more immediately relevant to the preservation of Moscow's empire.    So far this year, Germany has pledged more than 20 billion marks (about $13  billion) to the Soviets in one form or another.    German loans last summer -- among them a $3-billion bank credit that  constituted the single largest transaction of its kind ever extended to the  Soviet Union -- were essential in ensuring the smooth flow of imports necessary  to keep key sectors of the Soviet economy from total collapse.    Given domestic political uncertainties in the Soviet Union, little time has  been spent trying to assess the long-range potential of Soviet-German trade.  However, Heinrich Machowski, an analyst at the German Economic Institute in  Berlin, speculates that overall Soviet trade potential could eventually triple,  with Germany getting more than its share of the increase.    Bonn and Moscow now also share more common political goals than any other two  nations across Europe's old East-West divide.    A stable Soviet Union, well integrated into Europe, is accepted along the Rhine  as essential for Germany's own prosperity.    Noting the 600,000 Soviet military and civilian personnel still remaining in  eastern Germany and the growing emigration pressures among the 2-million-strong  German minority in the Soviet Union, a senior Foreign Ministry official in Bonn  said: ""We have a vested, almost material interest in what happens in the Soviet  Union. If there are problems there, we'd feel it physically.""    Moscow has already benefitted from these shared interests.    Both Kohl and German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher were key figures  in breaking down American resistance to institutionalizing the 35-nation  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe -- the only platform in which  all Europeans, including the Soviet Union, plus the United States and Canada  are represented.    The decision eased Moscow's worries of being shut out of a new Europe.    ""When the Germans speak of Europe, they include the Soviet Union as part of  it,"" Genscher said.    Kohl was also instrumental in winning a European Community commitment to  provide financial help for the Soviet reforms and in pushing through softer  language on Western alliance nuclear doctrine that makes nuclear arms ""weapons  of last resort.""    ""There's more interest in Germany than in any other Atlantic Alliance country  to integrate the Soviet Union into the European order and stabilize its 15  republics,"" summed up Fred Oldenburg, an analyst at Germany's Federal Institute  of East European and International Affairs in Cologne. ""That is a fact now and  will be for the next five to 10 years.""    Aside from new political imperatives, personal chemistry between German and  Soviet leaders has helped accelerate the pace of change.    Kohl has recovered from his initial blunder of comparing Gorbachev to Nazi  propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and has now established what one aide calls  a ""strong and very positive"" relationship with the Soviet leader.    During their historic talks in July, Kohl became the first Western leader  invited to Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol.    About two-dozen Genscher-Shevardnadze meetings so far this year have also built  a mutual respect among the two foreign ministers that goes beyond professional  duty.    Genscher's gesture last June of placing a wreath at the grave of  Schevardnadze's 21-year-old brother, Akaki, killed in the Soviet city of Brest  during the first hours of Nazi Germany's 1941 invasion the Soviet Union, is  seen as a measure of this respect.    However, despite the infusion of goodwill and intensity of mutual interest,  hard realities and age-old suspicions seem bound to limit relations between  Europe's two giants.    The Germany of the Iron Chancellor Otto von Bismarck that wove the Three  Emperors' Alliance together with Russia and Austria, or the post-World War I  Germany, whose overtures to Moscow ended their mutual isolation with the 1922  Treaty of Rapallo, are more than outweighed by the deceptions, intrigues and  the blood of two world wars.    For both Russians and Germans, it is a love-hate relationship of near-total  cultural opposites, in which the overriding emotion tends to be a mixture of  fascination and fear.    ""This country basically is afraid of Russia, but at the same time is attracted  by its culture, its soul,"" noted Michael Stuermer, director of the Ebenhausen  Institute near Munich, a government-funded foreign policy think tank. ""This  fundamental ambiguity goes back for centuries.""    Russian children at play rarely fight the Americans or Chinese in their  make-believe conflicts. The enemy is invariably German.    There are other problems, too.    The seemingly near-perfect fit of Soviet and German economic interests is  overshadowed by some compelling realities.    The mounting chaos in the Soviet Union makes Moscow an increasingly uncertain,  confused trading partner with shifting needs, declining incomes, slumping oil  production and a sharply rising hard-currency debt that combine to cast doubts  on its ability to pay.    At the same time, German economic strength has been sapped by the staggering  costs of restructuring the country's eastern region and by the demands of other  East European countries such as Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, which also  see Germany increasingly as their financial savior.    ""We had decided, even two years ago, to look to Germany, but so is everyone  else,"" lamented a Soviet diplomat.    The supervisory board chairman of the Deutsche Bank, Wilhelm Christians, may  visit the old East Prussian port of Koenigsberg -- now renamed Kaliningrad and  part of the Russian Federation -- and talk grandly about turning the military  port into the Soviets' first international free-trade zone. But as he does,  longstanding Soviet-German contracts are unraveling.    Soviet exports to what was East Germany dropped 19% during the first half of  1990, while East German exports dropped 4% during the same period as major  change gripped both economies.    Kersten Oschmann, a Soviet specialist at the German government-sponsored East  European Trade Committee, noted in an interview that in the Ukraine alone,  about 120 longstanding links between German suppliers and Soviet customers have  either lapsed or are in danger of lapsing despite efforts to revive them in the  short term.    Overall trade is expected to decline before it grows again.    Politically, the new German-Soviet ties are also limited, as much by other  relationships as by the suspicions and fears of a troubled past.    Although Moscow has begun to retreat from the global engagements of a  superpower, its links with the United States remain the priority, at least as  long as it holds broader responsibilities.    For Germany, it is only Bonn's firm anchor in the West -- in the Atlantic  Alliance and the European Community -- that enables its leaders to lobby so  effectively among its allies for Soviet interests.    The nature of unification, a de facto West German takeover of the East, with  the old West German leadership now ruling the reunited country with a few token  former eastern Cabinet ministers, has eased traditional worries about any  eastward German drift.    The open, affluent Germany of 1990 about to sign a major treaty with Moscow is  a far cry from the demoralized, outcast Germany of 1922 whose Rapallo treaty  with the Soviet Union was seen as a conspiracy against the West by two  powerful, but maverick, nations.    German diplomats are also careful to note that, despite the reconciliation,  distance between Bonn and Moscow remains.    ""There is a fine difference between what we're doing with our Western partners  and what we're doing with the Soviet Union,"" explained one senior German  diplomat. ""We have friendship with (a country like) France, where there are  shared democratic, cultural values. We want friendly relations with the Soviet  Union.    ""Soviets who talk freely admit that we are starting here, now, what we began  with France 30 years ago,"" the diplomat added.    There is also a series of potentially explosive trouble spots in the new  relationship, including the continued Soviet troop presence in eastern Germany.    Many analysts see the way in which these forces are withdrawn as a first major  test of the new relationship.    It is likely to be a sensitive task as morale sags among the low-paid, poorly  treated Soviet troops and tempers shorten among eastern German residents now  free to say what they really feel about their uninvited guests.    Some commentators believe the inevitable friction can only fuel dangerous  nationalistic emotions on both sides.    ""It's going to demand a high degree of sensitivity and understanding . . . ,""  Genscher warned the German Parliament.    O Added Machowski, the senior economist and Soviet analyst at the German  Economic Institute here: ""If it's done well, it can be a kind of  confidence-building measure.""    Other issues, including treatment of the so-called Volga German minority in the  Soviet Union, revelations of Stalinist atrocities in Germany during the early  postwar years, and demands for compensation from Soviets used as slave labor in  Nazi factories, all are potential flash points.    Falin warned that claims for compensation could slow the upcoming Supreme  Soviet's ratification of the treaty ending Moscow's World War II occupation  rights in Germany.    Whatever its eventual fate, few doubt that the success or failure of the new  German-Soviet relationship will be pivotal in shaping the Continent's future.    Many familiar with both countries agree with Falin's assessment that the new  Soviet-German relationship ""will likely be a central element of European  developments, a central aspect of international affairs in the 21st Century . .  . just as it was, very unfortunately, in the experience of the 20th Century.""

THEIR RELATIONS WILL AFFECT THE CONTINENT.      By TYLER MARSHALL and MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      BONN      The German chancellor called it a special responsibility of his generation.    The Soviet president described it simply as realpolitik.    Whatever the description, those who crowded into the stuffy little auditorium  in the northern Caucasus spa town of Zheleznovodsk on July 16 and heard  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev report on results of  their two-day meeting knew they had witnessed history.    The Soviet Union and Germany -- Europe's biggest power and its richest -- had  with chilling suddenness buried half a century of bitter differences that had  dragged them through Europe's bloodiest war and estranged them during a  prolonged, uneasy peace.    From a thinly disguised fear of German revanchism, Moscow had embraced the  inevitability of German reunification as a cornerstone of ""the new political  order"" that Gorbachev is counting on so heavily.    In the process, the door has opened to a new and hugely important relationship  -- as rich in potential as it is loaded with uncertainty.    ""We stem from different parts of global civilization, but we feel that we  belong together,"" Gorbachev explained to those listening in Zheleznovodsk.    Anyone witnessing the champagne and euphoria that filled the chancellor's  aircraft as it winged its way home from the Caucasus last July would be left  with little doubt that Kohl believed the same.    How these two nations manage this new beginning will do much to influence the  future shape of a continent in the midst of greater change that at any time in  nearly two centuries.    If it succeeds, analysts believe that the new relationship could become the key  element in overcoming the economic and political differences of Europe's long  East-West division. Failure would likely deepen them further.    ""Germany is a huge force in the center of Europe,"" Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze told the Supreme Soviet last month. ""The future of  Europe largely depends on how we relate to this giant.""    History and the weight of numbers alone make Shevardnadze's assessment hard to  reject.    Including the Soviet Union's Asian mass, the two nations account for half of  Europe's population and nearly half of its total production. Together, they  have a land area twice that of Europe alone.    Later this month, Gorbachev is expected to make his first trip to the newly  united Germany and sign a 20-year Soviet-German treaty of ""good-neighborliness,  partnership and cooperation"" that will act as a framework for the new ties.    Rich and warm in its language, the treaty symbolizes the historical watershed.    ""With this treaty there will be a partnership, and that is fundamentally new,""  said Valentin M. Falin, secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Central  Committee and Gorbachev's principal adviser on German policy. ""And we will be  serious partners, economically and politically.""    Added another foreign policy specialist at the Central Committee: ""We decided  on friendship. Now we are waiting, rather expectantly, to see what that  friendship brings.""    So are many others.    The direction and intensity of this new German-Soviet relationship remains one  of the biggest question marks in a fast-changing European order -- its future  as uncertain as that of the Soviet Union itself.    Certainly, great potential is there.    As the Soviet empire lurches from crisis to crisis, it is the economically  strong, politically resurgent Germany that seems to have the most of what  Moscow so desperately needs if it is to survive as a stable nation.    With a trade volume of $34 billion last year, Germany is already the Soviets'  largest trading partner.    In a new political climate, German deutsche marks, not Soviet missiles, have  become more immediately relevant to the preservation of Moscow's empire.    So far this year, Germany has pledged more than 20 billion marks (about $13  billion) to the Soviets in one form or another.    German loans last summer -- among them a $3-billion bank credit that  constituted the single largest transaction of its kind ever extended to the  Soviet Union -- were essential in ensuring the smooth flow of imports necessary  to keep key sectors of the Soviet economy from total collapse.    Given domestic political uncertainties in the Soviet Union, little time has  been spent trying to assess the long-range potential of Soviet-German trade.  However, Heinrich Machowski, an analyst at the German Economic Institute in  Berlin, speculates that overall Soviet trade potential could eventually triple,  with Germany getting more than its share of the increase.    Bonn and Moscow now also share more common political goals than any other two  nations across Europe's old East-West divide.    A stable Soviet Union, well integrated into Europe, is accepted along the Rhine  as essential for Germany's own prosperity.    Noting the 600,000 Soviet military and civilian personnel still remaining in  eastern Germany and the growing emigration pressures among the 2-million-strong  German minority in the Soviet Union, a senior Foreign Ministry official in Bonn  said: ""We have a vested, almost material interest in what happens in the Soviet  Union.

Apart from Monday's [10 January]  NATO summit, President Bill Clinton plans three further European  forays in the next 12 months. Yet the frequency with which the  White House reminds the Europeans about the President's many  coming engagements is a sure sign of transatlantic problems.    The Administration claims that, despite all the criticism,  its foreign policy remains a success. Washington is now at the  forefront of efforts to reform the NATO alliance and its  unstinting support for Russia's reforms is bearing fruit. In  fact, the last year has been marked by a litany of errors and  badly executed policies which have only increased the Europeans'  doubts about the Administration's competence.    A president elected on the slogan ""It's the economy,  stupid!""  displayed little interest in foreign matters and an alarming  capacity to giggle every time he answered foreign policy  questions. Ronald Reagan was hardly an intellectual giant, but  he compensated for his deficiencies by choosing the right people  for the appropriate slots. Not so with Mr Clinton. For months  on end, the Administration did not fill the middle-level  positions in the State Department, and those expected to run  foreign and security policies assumed that they were still on  the university benches. Hefty documents poured out of the White  House, all advocating ""engagement"" or the ""enlargement of  democracy."" Beautifully crafted, they nevertheless remained  irrelevant: abstract notions intended to paper over confusion  and weak personalities. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  remains the lawyer he always was: good with a client's brief;  useless without one.    Most of the animosity generated in transatlantic relations  remains of the worst kind: carelessness born out of sloppiness.  Mr Christopher's remarks last November that America's policies  have been unduly Eurocentric and need to be redirected towards  Asia was followed by a flood of statistics on trade, all  supposedly indicating that, at least in economic terms, Europe's  importance is eclipsed by the potential of the Pacific ""tigers.""  While it is true that America trades more with Asia than with  Europe, the same applies to the European Union, which exported  goods worth $73 billion to Asia last year, compared with only  $67 billion to the United States. Constructing a new security  pecking order out of this is childish and counterproductive.    Furthermore, co-ordination on foreign policy with the  Europeans continues to be appalling. The Germans, for instance,  who sent troops to Somalia after a long and anguished debate at  home, learnt of Mr Clinton's decision to withdraw U.S. soldiers  from the area not in a diplomatic communication but from the  media. Careless talk, coupled with sudden shifts: Mr Clinton  and his foreign policy advisers have given the concept of  megaphone diplomacy a new meaning.    Washington's dispute with the Europeans over the handling of  the Yugoslav war is another example of misunderstandings. Like  the Europeans, Mr Clinton thought that the Balkans civil war  challenged basic security principles. But, like the Europeans,  he wished to see someone else's soldiers punish the Serbs. One  moment the Administration swore it would not tolerate any  further outrages; the next day its officials asserted that  Bosnia was not, after all, America's concern. The result was  the worst of both worlds.    Insisting on the principle that aggression must not be  allowed to succeed, Washington scuppered two peace plans for  Yugoslavia but offered no viable alternative apart from the  traditional drop of food parcels intended to expiate everyone's  consciences. An offer of peacekeeping forces was quietly  withdrawn, but this did not prevent the Administration from  unleashing a barrage of accusations against spineless Europeans,  supposedly unable to ""solve"" conflicts in their own backyard.  Have the Americans done better in their own vicinity, in places  such as Cuba, Haiti, or much of Latin America? The dispute over  Yugoslavia would have been entirely avoidable if Mr Clinton had  understood that, the moment he ruled out the introduction of  American ground forces in the Balkans, he also forfeited the  right to lead the West in that conflict.    Yet there is a more fundamental problem with Mr Clinton's  European policy which the tussle over Yugoslavia also exposed.  Americans respond well to grand visions and clearly defined  dangers, such as those prevailing during the Cold War. The  U.S., however, is ill-equipped to deal with the much more  ambiguous challenges of today's Europe. For a country created  by people who chose to leave their nationalism behind, ethnic  and territorial disputes are regarded as diseases of the past,  problems artificially encouraged by unscrupulous leaders.  Remove Slobodan Milosevic and people in Yugoslavia would live  happily ever after; support Boris Yeltsin and all will be well.  The search for simple solutions for Europe's complex problems  is an old American trait. Current American policies reveal the  same mixture of New World idealism and detachment from realities.    Mr Clinton's proposal for the reform of NATO is appealing  -- on the surface. The countries of East Europe cannot join the  alliance immediately: the proposed Partnership for Peace  programme neither promises nor precludes future membership, but  offers all former Communist states time to accustom themselves  to military cooperation with the West. Yet, far from avoiding a  new division of Europe, as Washington likes to claim, the plan  simply maintains the old East-West division, the lowest common  denominator on which all NATO partners can agree.    But the problem with the Partnership for Peace goes much  deeper. The U.S. Administration assumes that it could dictate  the pace of change in NATO, carefully calibrating its interests  against commitments. Far from it. Washington or London may  have the luxury of musing about the future, but Germany, as the  frontline state most exposed to potential trouble from the East,  does not.    Either NATO tackles these problems collectively, or it will  become irrelevant for the most important European member,  Germany. By refusing to understand this, the Americans may be  forfeiting their ability to influence European events for a long  time to come.    Leaving the East Europeans in suspended animation will bring  no security to either Russia or the West. Without a firm  anchoring in NATO, the region will only descend into turmoil and  a competition for spheres of influence. The Americans have an  opportunity to fashion Europe's new security structure, but seem  unable to seize it.    Having announced his Partnership for Peace without  consulting  anyone, Mr Clinton is now reduced to hoping that the East  Europeans will accept this paper exercise, thereby sparing his  embarrassment. But it is curious that a plan intended to solve  the security problems of the region is mistrusted by precisely  the people who are expected to benefit from it. Partnership for  Peace will achieve only a brief postponement of Europe's real  security debate.    Yet everything pales into insignificance compared with  Washington's relations with Russia. Its single-minded obsession  with supporting Mr Yeltsin is not a policy but a religion, faith  that Russia will become a democracy, because it must become a  democracy. Having spent 40 years confronting a strong Soviet  Union, America is now concentrating on appeasing a weak Russia.  The Russian economy is collapsing not because it was subjected  to shock therapy, but because it was exposed to little real  economic change. Now, though, the U.S. is counselling a  slowdown in the pace of economic reform, and blames  international financial institutions for failing to help. But it  was Washington which first insisted on strict aid conditions,  and it was the White House which limited the powers of the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to extend aid  according to political rather than purely financial  considerations.    Moreover, America's concentration on limiting the  proliferation of nuclear weapons, the only systems that can hit  the U.S. directly, has succeeded only in alienating Ukraine.  What would the U.S. do if, after giving up its nuclear arsenal,  Ukraine were destabilised from within by the same techniques  Russia has already employed in the Caucasian republics and  Central Asia? Send Secretary of State Warren Christopher on a  ""goodwill"" mission or convene a solemn meeting of the  Partnership for Peace? A policy which consistently views Russia  as the central interlocutor and conveniently ignores Mr  Yeltsin's ever-growing demands for a sphere of influence  throughout the former Soviet empire will lead to disaster.    To be sure, confusion about foreign policy is not confined  to  the United States. But the U.S. is not just any state;  leadership of the West carries special responsibilities and a  high price. By seeking to conduct a foreign policy on the  cheap, by doggedly upholding the rosiest of scenarios about the  future of Russia, Mr Clinton's policies may end in catastrophe.  The chances are that the biggest question this ""domestic""  president will face in his next electoral campaign will be ""Who  lost Europe?"" East and West. By then, something considerably  more than giggles will be required.     "
0,FT944-14383 ,"FT944-14383 _AN-EJXDSAAEFT 941024   FT  24 OCT 94 / Single currency should be delayed, says EU bank chief      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   The European Union should consider fixing the exchange rates of its currencies irrevocably, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, says. But the head of the precursor of a European central bank believes there should be a delay before introducing a single European currency in the third and final stage of the EU's planned move to economic and monetary union. Until now, the presumption has been that the Ecu would be introduced rapidly as a single European currency once exchange rates were locked. But Mr Lamfalussy said in an interview that a phased introduction of stage three would ease many potential technical difficulties surrounding Emu, such as agreement on common European banknotes. 'The threshold of stage three of Emu is the locking of the exchange rates,' he explained. 'You cannot do that halfway. That means a European central bank, one monetary policy, and harmonised interest rates on wholesale money markets.' Other things could be 'left open', he said. 'There need not be a swapping of domestic banknotes for notes denominated in European currency units (Ecus). I could imagine that taking place months or years after locking the European exchange rates.' Mr Lamfalussy conceded there would be some drawbacks in locking exchange rates without then moving to a single currency with its own banknotes. But a phased introduction of the final stage of Emu would have advantages. Companies would have the benefit of locked exchange rates without having to wait for the EU to overcome the technical difficulties of the banknote change. The idea had political attractions because people would have time to adjust to a single currency rather than having Ecus thrust upon them. Also Europe's commercial banks, which have expressed concern at delays in tackling the practical aspects of Emu, would be reassured. Mr Lamfalussy said the process of adaptation would be fostered if the individual EU currencies were made legal tender in all the countries of the union in the early stages of a phased introduction of a single currency. He said the phased approach to stage three was not specifically his idea, but was being discussed among officials preparing for Emu and was compatible with the Maastricht treaty. Mr Lamfalussy said that his institute, which has been in temporary premises in Basle, Switzerland, would begin work in its new headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, next month. The EMI would then concentrate on fostering co-operation among EU central banks and preparing the planned European central bank so it could begin operating once political agreement has been reached to complete Emu. While Mr Lamfalussy said the prospects for Emu had improved over the past year, he did not expect stage three to begin as soon as 1997, the earliest date envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty. Instead, he said he believed that there would be stage three and a European central bank 'in five, six or 10 years' time'.

0,FT943-10163 ,"FT943-10163 _AN-EHGAUAC8FT 940806   FT  06 AUG 94 / Deep burial 'best way' to rid Britain of N-waste: Extend cooldown period for old stations, says report      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   Deep burial remains the government's preferred way of disposing of the radioactive waste generated by Britain's nuclear power stations and research installations. In a consultation document on radioactive waste management policy released yesterday, the Department of the Environment said this provided the safest, and most economical, permanent solution to the more dangerous forms of waste, such as spent fuel rods and contaminated equipment. It also said that the period over which retired power stations are allowed to cool down before final dismantling could be extended from 100 to 135 years, in some cases. The document was welcomed by the nuclear power industry because it stressed both commercial and safety factors at a time when the two state-owned nuclear power generators, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, are hoping to be privatised. Mr Roger Hayes, director-general of the British Nuclear Industry Forum, the trade group, said it showed the industry was on the right track. But it was quickly condemned by opposition parties and the environmental movement for putting financial factors above environment and safety. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said the government was 'trying to cut down the cost in order to get shot of the problem'. The 100-page document forms part of the government's review of nuclear policy. Although much of it reaffirms existing policies, the results will have a key bearing on whether Britain builds any more nuclear power stations as ageing reactors are shut down. The government's preferred method of dealing with high level nuclear waste from Britain's 30 nuclear sites is to use a process called 'vitrification' to transform it into a kind of glass. It will then be left for 50 years to cool before being consigned to a permanent deep store several thousand feet underground. But the paper also says that nuclear operators can leave the spent fuel to cool in a dry store, if it makes more commercial sense. The main shift in policy hinted at in the document is allowing nuclear operators to decommission spent power stations over a longer period. Both Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear have been pressing for this. Stations could be left to cool down for 35 years after closure, and then left for another 100 years before final removal, rather than doing the whole job in 100 years.

The net loss at Glaverbel, Europe's third-largest flat glass producer, was BFr2.06bn (Dollars 58.4m) in 1993, compared with a BFr715 profit in 1992. However, BFr1.78bn of this loss was incurred in the first half of the year. The improved performance in the second half meant losses here were kept to BFr154m. Glaverbel blamed its poor performance in the first half on falling prices, an extensive programme of redundancies and restructuring, and the heavy losses at AFG Industries, its North American subsidiary. Overall sales in 1993 reached BFr30.75bn, down 7.2 per cent on the previous year.   Companies:-  Glaverbel.   Countries:-  BEZ  Belgium, EC.   Industries:-  P3211 Flat Glass.

Several members of the  commando are well-known members of the FLNC [Corsican National  Liberation Front]-Historic Channel, a source close to the  investigation in Paris explained. They apparently include a  journalist from the Marseilles press and a wanted nationalist  who went underground after being sentenced in absentia for a  murder committed on Christmas day 1988 in a bar in Ajaccio.    Should the operation mounted by the island's gendarmerie and  police, backed up by the RAID [Research, Assistance,  Intervention, and Dissuasion Unit of the national police force],  in the night of Sunday 27 to Monday 28 March in Bonifacio be  seen as a kind of tit-for-tat response, as is being suggested in  Corsica by some observers who think that the government has so  far tried to play for time by handling the nationalists  carefully? On 16 February, the FLNC-Historic Channel announced  the end of the truce in assaults which it had observed since 22  June 1993. [passage omitted]    However, the first major operation by the FLNC in Corsica  failed on Sunday 27 March because of the steps taken by Police  Chief Jean-Pierre Lacave. Several dozen men were asked to take  part in a major assault intended to destroy the village of  Piantarella (26 residential apartments) built in the tourist  venue of Sperone, which contains the island's only big golf  course. The operation seems to have been meticulously organized  and the deployment of these men involved the use of land and sea  resources. But police headquarters had specific information  which justified the dispatch of the RAID to Corsica.    Impressive Arsenal    In all, 120 police and gendarmes were involved. First, four  individuals responsible for neutralizing the guards were  detained, then 10 others who were to plant explosives in the  development. Shots were exchanged without anybody being injured.  Some members of the commando group were probably able to flee.  During the day, two vehicles, one of which had been set on  fire, and an 11-meter motor boat, also set on fire -- it had  probably been used to bring some of the commandos to the spot --  were discovered in the area. An impressive arsenal was seized:  60 bottles of butane gas, around 60 kg of explosives (dynamite  and plastic explosives), six assault rifles, and 10 handguns,  grenades, and detonators.    The success of this operation, the first of its kind since  Corsica has suffered clandestine nationalist violence, suggests  that following the lengthy period of dialogue launched by Pierre  Joxe and continued by [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua, the  government is now determined to put an end to erroneous methods  which do not have the public's approval. The supporters of the  FLNC, who are found within Cuncolta Naziunalista and its  satellite organizations, gathered outside the Ajaccio police  headquarters where the 14 people detained are being held. In  the night of Monday 28 to Tuesday 29 March, they were dispersed  by the police, who used tear gas in response to stone-throwing  and trash can fires. The detained activists will be transferred  to Paris to appear before the 14th section of the public  prosecutor's office responsible for terrorist cases.     "

By PAUL WEBSTER, THE GUARDIAN      PYRENEES NATIONAL PARK, France      This is the story of a dozen bears with pretty names like Papillon, Zoe,  Dominique and Camille, who have become the center of one of Europe's fiercest  environmental debates.

The head of the national park's scientific committee, Michel Clin, a Bordeaux  geological professor, agreed with this view. He resigned in anger in July,  saying that the valley's 13 local councils were going ahead with development  plans that will destroy one of Europe's last bear colonies.    Visitors to the Pyrenees Park might think that this has already happened. A  game warden has just retired after 45 years' service without ever sighting the  animal.

The enormous popularity of  Jean-Jacques Annaud's film, ""The Bear,"" which was pre-released here to a  background of violent controversy, has done much to aid his cause.    ""It is not just an ecological argument"" he said. ""The presence of bears and  their increase could contribute to bringing back prosperity to the region"".    This is a minority view in a valley of 3,000 people that has lost 75% of its  population in 90 years. The bear is a natural enemy of high altitude sheep and  cattle farmers. Last year there were 39 cases of bear attacks on sheep, but  shepherds say there were many unproved cases where animals died of fright. Turn  of the century photographs of villagers tormenting or maltreating 10-foot-high  bears show how deep the resentment goes.    In 1982, two bears were shot dead despite fierce protection measures in which  large areas are inaccessible to local communities. One village received  compensation of 40,000 francs last year because a forest was put out of bounds  so that bears would not be disturbed by timber work. Some of the money was  spent on flying in food, including half a cow, by helicopter in an attempt to  lure the animals away.

Now  the nation is about to join the ranks of plutonium users, with a  fast-breeder reactor in western Japan scheduled to reach  criticality early next year.    It is against this backdrop that Japan faces the idea of  placing plutonium storage and use under international control.    Of all nuclear-energy sources, plutonium is feared because  of  its potential use in nuclear weapons. Even where a nation  intends to use the substance for peaceful purposes only, it is  important to make the utilization process sufficiently open to  leave no room for international suspicions.    Another effective way to curb nuclear proliferation is for  user countries to refrain from holding more plutonium than is  necessary for power generation and other non-military uses.    Worldwide plutonium stocks are estimated by Japan's Atomic  Energy Commission at 911 metric tons, 257 tons for military  purposes and 654 tons for civilian. Of the civilian-use  holdings, 532 tons are in the form of spent fuel, while  reprocessed plutonium accounts for 72 tons. Japan holds 1.6 tons  of the reprocessed variety.    At a time when the world's supply of reprocessed plutonium  is  already high, the scrapping of nuclear arms suggests a growing  surplus. Particularly worrisome is a possible outflow of the  substance from the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union.    It is time to give serious consideration to the concept of  internationally organized supervision of plutonium use and  storage. Japan stands to benefit from such a global framework as  it moves into the next, practical phase of its plutonium program.    The idea of putting plutonium under some form of  international custody is nothing new. The issue was debated by a  panel of experts at the International Atomic Energy Agency from  1978 through 1982, with the results submitted for consideration  by the IAEA board. The initiative got nowhere, however, because  it was too difficult to reconcile conflicts of national  interests while the Cold War was still going strong.    Global circumstances have undergone a sea change since then,  and the possibility of reaching international nuclear accords  has improved significantly. This has prompted moves inside the  IAEA, albeit unofficial, to look at international plutonium  control in a fresh light.    The issue needs to be approached from a variety of  perspectives: Should control extend to all plutonium or just to  surplus stockpiles? How should military-use plutonium be dealt  with? What criteria should be followed in allowing a country to  use the substance? These and other questions are bound to expose  considerable differences among countries and touch off heated  debate.    Japan is the only plutonium-using nation that has no nuclear  weapons. It is also the only nation that has every fallen victim  to nuclear bombing. These conditions uniquely qualify the  country to actively advocate an international system to tame the  potentially lethal material, rather than passively follow the  lead of others.    In order to play such a role, Japan must not allow itself to  be blinded by narrow national interests, and must exhibit a  clear vision of what exactly international control of plutonium  means for world peace and energy demand. Tokyo also must have  the courage to stand up to the brazen pursuit of self-interest  by the nuclear powers, such as was seen during efforts to  enhance the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.     "

The decision was taken at the first formal summit of the the Community and the so-called Visegrad group of countries, soon to be expanded from three to four members after the split of Czechoslovakia into two separate republics. Though closer political consultations, including joint meetings of foreign ministers, were welcomed by the central European leaders, they made clear that they were hoping for more specific commitments on the timetable for their future entry into the Community as full members. Mr Joszef Antall, Hungary's prime minister, drew attention to central Europe's broader economic and security concerns and called on the EC to 'retain a sense of solidarity and not treat the region as Europe's backyard.' Despite the collapse of the Soviet empire, Europe still needed 'a solid political and military organisation like Nato and a continuing US military presence.' Mr John Major, the British prime minister and current president of the EC, on whose initiative the meeting was held, went out of his way to assure them of the Community's support for 'the tough political and economic reforms' which they had undertaken. Their meeting symbolised the EC's wish to work together with the central European countries and to cement the new relationship it had forged with them through association agreements signed last December. All shared a common commitment to democracy and human rights and to free trade across the whole European continent. They would 'eventually' become full members, once they could face the competition from the more developed western European countries, he said. Though it was unlikely that a timetable for their entry into the Community would be fixed in the foreseeable future, Mr Major said that clear criteria for membership would be drawn up in time for the December EC summit in Edinburgh. Yesterday's meeting provided Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak prime minister, with his first exposure to international politics at the highest level. It also allowed Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, to explain the details of the customs and monetary agreements worked out between the two republics which will become separate states on January 1. Behind the scenes Czechoslovak and Hungarian negotiators worked with Community officials to seek a solution to the increasingly embittered conflict between Hungary and Slovakia over the Gabcikovo dam. Later Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said both new states would become full members of the bank in the New Year.

Dinandro intelligence agents caught the woman, who was at  large, as she was leaving one of her properties in Chorrillos.    The ""firm"" of the Cachique Rivera brothers, which also  includes brothers Segundo, aka ""Capitan"" or ""Guno""; Adolfo, aka  ""Alferez""; Nicolas, aka ""Mayor""; and their father Gaudencio  Cachique Sajami, is considered the Cali cartel's main cocaine  hydrochloride supplier. According to Directorate estimates, the  gang sends to Colombia 1,000 kg of cocaine and 20 tons of  cocaine base per month.    Margarita Cachique Rivera, her father, and her brothers are  wanted by the Seventh Court and by the 30th Lima Court on drug  trafficking charges. Born on 7 May 1964 in Rupa Rupa district,  Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco, Margarita's job was to contact  international drug traffickers' organizations in Lima, perform  financial operations, and buy the chemicals for the production  of cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride.    She was captured last Sunday, in the evening, in the  vicinity  of Alameda Premio Real Avenue, in block J, lot 16, of the La  Encantada neighborhood in Chorrillos. She was carrying neither  arms nor drugs, and did not resist arrest.    The source said: ""We are aware of the Cachique Riveras'  movements,"" adding that ""the Margarita's arrest will give us  positive clues for finding her brothers. Undoubtably, it is a  very important arrest."" The Cachique Riveras, who are led by  ""Abelardo"" or ""Teniente,"" is an organization that, according to  some specialists, is the third most important ""firm"" after  Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka ""Vaticano,"" whose firm is now  led by his brother Elias, aka ""Quichin"" or ""Sony,"" and Colombian  Walter Simeon Vargas Arias, aka ""El Ministro."" [passage omitted]    According to Dinandro, ""Teniente"" was spotted last February  in Boca del Manu, Madre de Dios. He is believed to have  travelled to that area to personally collect money obtained  through drug sales from the Colombian ""Pablito,"" who has  operated in this department since October 1993.    Antinarcotics agents have learned that ""Pablito"" refused to  honor his debt, resulting in a shootout between the henchmen of  both mafia members. The Colombian, however, finally decided to  honor his debt. The Dinandro official said that ""if 'Pablito'  had to go to Madre de Dios, the debt must have been very large,  and also the drug shipment that was sold to the Colombian.""     "
0,FT942-2466 ,"FT942-2466 _AN-EFSAXAABFT 940618   FT  18 JUN 94 / Nuclear site clean-up costs more than double to Pounds 8.2bn      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   The cost of cleaning up the UK Atomic Energy Authority's nuclear sites has more than doubled, according to government estimates released yesterday. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said the authority's liabilities were now estimated at Pounds 8.2bn, against a previous estimate of Pounds 3.4bn. That consisted of about Pounds 6bn to decommission the authority's own sites, and a further Pounds 2bn for fuels and wastes and for cleaning up British Nuclear Fuels sites. Mr Eggar said that the increase was because of: Inclusion of new costs - for example, looking after sites during the various phases of decommissioning, which can last 100 years. Costs for assessment studies and research and development. The completion of fuller studies of dismantling costs and the volumes of waste created. Greater allowance for contingencies. The authority's sites are mainly experimental nuclear reactors at Windscale, Dounreay, Harwell and Winfrith. Since April, responsibility for decommissioning has been with UKAEA government division. The remainder of the authority, renamed AEA Technology and comprising the technology and consultancy operations, is now being prepared for privatisation. Its sale value has been estimated at Pounds 250m. Mr Derek Pooley, chief executive of UKAEA government division, said yesterday he hoped the decommissioning work could be completed below the estimates. 'It's our job to get the costs down,' he said. The actual, or discounted, cost of the UKAEA clean-up will be Pounds 5bn. It is normal practice in the nuclear industry to set aside financial provisions well before they are needed, and allow them to grow with compound interest. The discount rate used is 2 per cent. The latest estimates suggest that the total undiscounted cost of decommissioning the UK's existing nuclear installations will be about Pounds 22bn-Pounds 23bn. A year ago, the National Audit Office put the total cost at Pounds 18bn, using the AEA's earlier estimates. But it warned that those estimates were 'understated because of optimistic assumptions and significant omissions'. The British Nuclear Industry Forum, a trade group, said the new AEA figures had no bearing on estimates for other nuclear installations owned by Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two state-owned utilities. The government is conducting a review of the nuclear industry to see whether further expansion can be financed by the private sector. Decommissioning costs are one of the key issues determining the economic viability of nuclear power.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

According to Sedena reports, the total  number of weapons the Mexican Army and Navy seized during the  first six months of 1994 reached 5,626.    Reports indicate that of the total seized, 95 percent  entered  Mexican territory through so-called small-scale smuggling,  especially through Chihuahua, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Jalisco, and  Nayarit.    Meanwhile, Navy Secretary Admiral Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo  has said the weapons the Mexican Army and Navy seized belong to  drug traffickers, ""but we have not found caches of weapons or  anything similar.""    Interviewed during the inauguration of the 15th Navy Health  Medical Campaign, Ruano said the drug traffickers have economic  resources to buy weapons, but ""too much propaganda is being  given to what you call goat horns [AK-47 submachine guns].""    [LA JORNADA] In light of these circumstances, which are  being  denounced in the United States, isn't it necessary to change  surveillance measures?    [Ruano] There really is no need for that. Wherever weapons  are being smuggled, it will be stopped.    According to Sedena reports, only 5 percent of the weapons  that enter Mexico are brought in legally. Those weapons are  given to state governments to supply their police forces, and a  small portion winds up in the hands of civilians. The cost of  the weapons varies in accordance with their brand, caliber,  condition, and use, and prices range from approximately  300-7,000 pesos    Mexican Army figures indicate that during the government of  President Salinas de Gortari, the Armed Forces seized 54,208  rifles and 60,673 handguns. In addition, 98,644 weapons, both  rifles and handguns, that were seized are available to Sedena.  The report adds that in the first six months of 1994, Sedena  seized 2,591 rifles and handguns in addition to another 3,035  that are at the disposal of civilian authorities. The Army  seized 5,626 weapons during that period.    According to Army reports, most of the arsenal comes,  presumably, from the United States, China, and the former Soviet  Union. Reports also indicate that the weapons enter the country  by land, sea, air, and in small amounts; that is, through  so-called small-scale smuggling.    Reports reveal that the federal organizations that receive a  greater portion of the weapons are in Chihuahua, Michoacan,  Sinaloa, Jalisco and Nayarit. The weapons presumably enter  these states mostly by land and in an ""organized"" manner.  Meanwhile, Sedena makes, through its General Directorate of  Factories, weapons under a German trademark exclusively for the  Mexican Army.    Sedena stipulates the requirement that a citizen must meet  to  legally buy a weapon. Requirements include that the person live  honestly, comply with military service, and have no record of  being sentenced for weapons use. Permits to bear weapons can  also be obtained based on the nature of the person's occupation,  the special circumstances of his place of residence, or any  justifiable reasons that merit it.    A document in which the Mexican Army warned the Government  Secretariat on the possible illegal entry of 20,000 AK-47  submachine guns, better known as goat horns, was disclosed  recently. The first shipment would reportedly consist of 2,000  weapons of this type of (rifles). Later, Sedena stated the entry  of those weapons, which would represent less than 20 percent of  the weapons seized in the past six months, into Mexico has not  been detected so far.     "

Mr. Lamassoure was to complete a  three-day tour of the region in Riga (Latvia) on Saturday 22  January, following his visits to Tallinn (Estonia) and Vilnius  (Lithuania).    The French minister, who had originally not planned to make  the tour until the spring, finally decided, after the Russian  elections and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's emergence, to bring the  visit forward to ""try and reassure the Baltic states and convey  to them our solidarity at a time when they could be frightened  by what they are hearing from Moscow."" The French minister was  able to gauge at first hand the concern of his interlocutors  (not to mention their youth: The Estonian prime minister is 35  years old, and his foreign minister is 27) in the light of  recent statements made by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev on the subject of the regions, which include the Baltic  states, and ""which over the centuries have constituted the  sphere of influence of Russia."" These statements -- even if  they have been denied -- added to those of the Russian  nationalists, who feel that they have the wind in their sails,  show glimpses of a rebirth in Russian imperialism which gives  the Baltic states constant cause for concern.    Notion of `Close-by Foreign State'    In addition, many Baltic leaders consider that certain  Western powers, and in particular the United States, implicitly  show too much complacence with regard to Moscow's favorite  ""close-by foreign state"" notion. Estonian President Lennart  Meri told us on Friday 21 January: ""If you accept this Russian  notion of the close-by foreign state, then one day it will be  extended to France itself...."" He added that all indications  were that Catherine the Great's imperialist dream had not  deserted Moscow: ""That is the tragedy of Russia, which has  always believed that it had a special mission for the world.  This vision is very popular today with the Russian generals.""    He continued by saying that now there is a great threat of  Russia trying to make people forget its domestic problems ""by  rallying the Russian people around a nationalist flag."" At the  risk of using ""language that is too romantic,"" Mr. Meri stressed  the fact that Europe's problem was not, currently, a question of  military strategy but more of a moral problem: ""Does Europe  still have the will to remain European? Here we are in Europe's  front line, but for a front line to be solid we need to feel  that behind us we have a Europe that wants to remain faithful to  its guiding principles."" In Vilnius, former President  Landsbergis also stressed to Mr. Lamassoure the need to ""not  harbor any illusions about Russia."" He warned of ""the  Kozyrev-Zhirinovskiy doctrine"" and spoke of his fear that one  day Europe would again be split into areas of Russian and  American influence.    The French minister for European affairs tried to reply to  these fears. He assured his interlocutors of France's desire to  establish closer ties between Europe and the Baltic states and  pointed out that France will play its part in ensuring that the  planned trade agreement between the European Union and each of  the Baltic states also has a political aspect, the content of  which would be similar to the agreements concluded concerning  the four countries in the Visegrad group (Hungary, Poland, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia), and Romania and Bulgaria.

He is 60 years  old and was born in the countryside. He graduated from the  Moscow physical engineering institute. He is a doctor of  technical sciences, a professor, and the author of over 260  scientific works and a winner of Lenin and state prizes. He is  the founder of the scientific school for the physics of nuclear  explosive fission and the diagnosis of single-pulse penetrating  radiation processes. Since March 1992 he has been Russian  Federation minister of atomic energy. He gave his recently  published autobiography the title I Am a `Hawk.'    [Khokhlov] In recent years only lazy politicians, deputies,  and journalists have failed to attack our nuclear scientists and  defense industry officials. You actively favor the conservation  and development of the military-industrial complex, nuclear  power, and nuclear weapons. Does it not seem to you that today  this is a voice crying in the desert?    [Mikhaylov] No. Today a change is taking place in Russians'  public awareness. Finally it is becoming clear to the majority  that in a changing world Russia can be preserved only as a state  with progressive technologies, with a powerful industry and  modern weapons. The majority of high technologies have been  developed and continue to be developed at the scientific centers  of the Ministry of Atomic Energy and the State Committee for the  Defense Industry. Why kill the goose that lays the golden eggs?  We have had enough ""revolutions!"" And it is very important  today to preserve what has already been achieved -- in the  economy and in the military sphere.    [Khokhlov] But should we continue to produce nuclear  weapons, of which Russia already has enough to destroy the world  several times over?    [Mikhaylov] No one intends to destroy it. On the contrary,  by the year 2003 Russia's nuclear arsenal will have been reduced  tenfold. We will have 3,500 nuclear warheads left -- highly  effective warheads capable of defending the country reliably  against any encroachments.    I have believed and continue to believe that nuclear weapons  remain the only means of maintaining global stability on earth.  Yes, there is an alternative -- complete trust in the world.  But is that feasible now? I doubt it....    The postwar world was held up on fear of the use of nuclear  weapons. That is bad. But would it really have been better for  World War III to break out? The USSR has now disintegrated,  there is no longer a Warsaw Pact, the Berlin wall has been  dismantled for souvenirs. Has the world become more peaceful?  No, alas, it has not. Today the new military-political map of  the 21st century world has started to take shape. Spheres of  influence and the strategic interests of many states and  military-political alliances are being reviewed. The terms  ""global country"" and ""regional country"" are becoming commonplace  in politics. I was born in a great country and I do not want to  see my motherland a raw-material tributary in the next century.  That is my ""hawk's song.""    [Khokhlov] Then you probably do not greatly welcome the  Russian-U.S. accords on the broad-scale reduction of nuclear  arsenals?    [Mikhaylov] We saw long ago that there are too many weapons.  They must be reduced. But we must have a realistic approach  toward the pace of disarmament.    The dismantling of one nuclear warhead costs $100,000. And  no one abroad will help us here. They do not have the technical  and financial potential, they do not have the technologies. And  what politician will allow foreign warheads to be brought into  his country and dismantled?    Today Russia is spending up to 1,000 billion rubles [R] a  year on the dismantling of the nuclear warheads to be reduced.  Developing the scale of this undoubtedly necessary business is  an extremely difficult problem. We need investments, enormous  investments. And there can be no talk here of any profits  allegedly ""extracted"" by Russia. The agreement with the United  States on the processing of weapons-grade uranium over the  course of 20 years for use as fuel for nuclear electric power  stations is only partial compensation for the expenses we have  already incurred by destroying the warheads of Ukraine,  Belorussia [Belarus], and Kazakhstan. As a whole, there is  still food for thought for the politicians and economists of the  whole world.    [Khokhlov] Previously everything connected with nuclear  problems was strictly secret. Is the Ministry of Atomic  Energy's ""iron curtain"" being opened today?    [Mikhaylov] We are simply doomed to cooperation with the  scientists of other countries. Russia has actively joined in  work to create international cooperation in the field of  scientific research and the dissemination of new technologies.    We have also started to use foreign investments. A number of  developments in the Ministry of Atomic Energy's scientific  research institutes and enterprises are financed by foreigners,  and the results are being used jointly. In 1993 we attracted  about $80 million by this means for additional financing for  scientific and technological developments.    [Khokhlov] Will this openness not lead to the leakage of  secret information?    [Mikhaylov] We show only what we want to show.    [Khokhlov] And no one tries to ""take a peek"" at anything?  Or to bribe our scientists going abroad?    [Mikhaylov] I am not involved with spies. But competent  organs assure me that there are no spies in the Ministry of  Atomic Energy system. With an increase in the exchange of  specialists there has indeed been an increase in the relevant  organizations' intelligence interest in them. But I think it is  not yet known who can ""spy"" more on whom.... Indeed, it is not  my sphere of activity.    [Khokhlov] Not so long ago there was a noisy story about the  attempt by a group of our nuclear scientists to leave for North  Korea....    [Mikhaylov] They did not include a single nuclear scientist.  Another case of misinformation. There is not a single nuclear  physicist from the weapons complex who would flee or try to flee  Russia. As far as I know, specialists in the development of  carriers, that is rocket specialists, intended to go to North  Korea.    [Khokhlov] The Americans have now ""taken up"" North Korea  very seriously. In your view, is it a case here of politics or  has the Asian state indeed become the possessor of nuclear  weapons?    [Mikhaylov] The nonproliferation of nuclear weapons is a  very sensitive question. A large group of states is seeking to  create nuclear weapons or already has them.    One can say quite confidently that India has nuclear weapons  -- it has carried out two warhead tests. The Republic of South  Africa has admitted that it has ""military atomic energy.""  Pakistan, Iraq, Israel, and a number of other countries deny  they have such weapons but are actively involved in creating  them. The technological and scientific potential of many states  now enables them to design and produce primitive nuclear devices  which could be used for military purposes.    [Khokhlov] What is ""primitive"" for you? For instance, the  kind of devices which the United States used in 1945 to destroy  Hiroshima and Nagasaki?    [Mikhaylov] Perhaps these devices are even simpler. As for  North Korea, I doubt that it could create nuclear warheads in  the very near future. Its scientific potential is not high and  its technologies are far from progressive. Perhaps there is the  accumulation of certain quantities of uranium.    [Khokhlov] Bought from us?    [Mikhaylov] Including some bought from us. But let us treat  this as calmly as possible, without strewing our heads with  ashes, as is customary now. For instance, we have sold nothing  to Pakistan but that has not prevented it from developing its  own military nuclear program. Incidentally, West European  companies which sold dual-purpose technologies and output helped  Iraq very considerably in its nuclear developments. I state  absolutely categorically that among the developed states Russia  has the smallest contribution to the proliferation of nuclear  technologies across the planet.    [Khokhlov] Viktor Nikitovich, let us turn from the  ""military"" atom to the ""peaceful"" atom. Although since  Chernobyl that term sounds ambivalent....    [Mikhaylov] New technologies always involve risk. The  Chernobyl tragedy taught us a lot. Questions of the safe  operation of nuclear electric power stations are a priority now.  But however unpleasant it is to remember Chernobyl, the use of  nuclear energy for peaceful creation is the natural path of  mankind's progress.    The date of 27 June is the jubilee of nuclear power  engineering. The world's first nuclear electric power station  was commissioned 40 years ago in Obninsk. Today, 17 percent of  electricity on the planet and 30 percent of electricity in  Europe is generated at nuclear electric power stations. In our  country the figure is 12 percent but in some countries it is up  to 80 percent. Incidentally, the economic ""miracles"" of Japan,  Germany, and South Korea are the direct consequence of those  countries' use of the cheap energy from nuclear fission.  Whether there will be a resurrection of Russia also depends to  a considerable degree on our efforts today in the development of  this type of energy. Nuclear energy is ecologically clean  energy. There is no alternative. The combustion of large  quantities of organic fuel leads to the emergence of the  greenhouse effect and destroys the planet's ozone layer.    Rapidly developing mankind can retain a sensible compromise  with the environment only if nuclear energy is developed. The  main thing, of course, is to make it safe.    [Khokhlov] Is something being done?    [Mikhaylov] Russia is cooperating actively with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The safety of  nuclear electric power stations is a problem for all mankind and  the developments of the scientists of any country should serve  all people.    Most important in world cooperation has been work to  increase  the safety of existing first-generation Russian reactors. The  United States, Britain, the FRG, and Japan are taking part in  this work. A fundamentally new approach -- the ""station""  approach -- has been agreed for technical assistance to the  safety of Russian nuclear electric power stations, whose  implementation has been initiated within the framework of the  European Union commission's budget. The ""station"" approach will  be implemented directly at the Kalinin, Balakovo, Kola,  Smolensk, Leningrad, and Beloyarsk nuclear electric power  stations.    But we nonetheless regard our own developments are the  priority ones. There are already plans for stations with their  own natural safety. The products of fission at these stations  in any unforeseen situations will be localized within the  reactor block. An uncontrolled nuclear fission chain reaction is  in principle impossible at nuclear electric power stations of  the new generation.    [Khokhlov] Incidentally, about nuclear waste. Recently the  ""greens"" have tried to prevent their import into Russia from  Finland. Why should our country become the world's ""nuclear  garbage heap?""    [Mikhaylov] This is all idle talk: Russia is allegedly  putting a time bomb under itself. The Soviet Union has  constructed several nuclear electric power stations abroad and  the waste at these stations can be stored for no more than five  years. Under the terms of treaties with Bulgaria, Finland,  Hungary, and the Czech Republic Russia, as the USSR's legal  heir, is continuing to import it and process it at enterprises  of the Ministry of Atomic Energy.    [Khokhlov] Where exactly?    [Mikhaylov] Where the fuel was produced -- near Krasnoyarsk,  Tomsk, and Chelyabinsk. After special processing the nuclear  electric power station waste is enclosed in glass and stored in  concrete bunkers. That is absolutely safe for people and the  environment.    [Khokhlov] A sudden earthquake?    [Mikhaylov] We do not expect earthquakes in the places where  nuclear electric power station waste is stored for the next  millenium. In 1,000 years time, is some cataclysm were to  occur, the processed nuclear fuel will no longer present a  danger.    New methods are now being developed for destroying nuclear  waste -- its burning in special devices and its use in  fast-neutron reactors.    [Khokhlov] But can you explain why then Finland is reluctant  to bury the waste from its ""Lovisa"" nuclear electric power  station somewhere in the tundra and is exporting them to us?    [Mikhaylov] It does not have the conditions and technology  for processing; we do. And it is economically advantageous for  Russia to accept waste! They pay for it, they pay very well. A  fight is now under way on the nuclear waste market between the  United States, France, and Britain. Russia is also taking part.  It means big money, which we invest in, inter alia, the  improvement of the safety of Russian nuclear electric power  stations. Incidentally, the Finns are already considering  whether to pay us money or to keep their waste in their own  country.    [Khokhlov] Does Russia bear responsibility for the safety of  nuclear electric power stations in CIS and Baltic states?    [Mikhaylov] No. Since the collapse of the USSR these have  been domestic problems for sovereign states. Politicians treat  this very zealously. But we Russian nuclear scientists are open  to cooperation with everyone. Armenia has decided to resume the  operation of its nuclear electric power station -- we are  helping.    [Khokhlov] One more problem connected with the collapse of  the USSR: An underground nuclear charge ready for explosion  remains in Kazakhstan. What will happen to it?    [Mikhaylov] We are preparing to dismantle the driving  mechanism [zabivochnoye ustroystvo] and we shall either remove  the nuclear device or destroy it on the spot. It is small in  terms of yield -- less than one kilotonne. It is not a military  charge but a simulator. Anticipating a question about the  ecology, I shall say there will be no problems.    [Khokhlov] On the other hand, it seems many problems are  arising in connection with the raising of the sunken  nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets?    [Mikhaylov] The din raised over this submarine in my opinion  is in direct proportion to the sums which certain groups of  people could obtain for carrying out the raising operation.  There is a very great deal of speculation surrounding the  Komsomolets and its nuclear ""stuffing....""    Raising a ship from such a depth and under such extreme  conditions is impossible. I said so back in 1992. Especially  as there is no need. There is no leakage of plutonium -- all  the tests show that. We should leave the Komsomolets on the sea  bed. The ship will disappear into the silt and nature itself  will do a better job than people of neutralizing the nuclear  weapons in it.    [Khokhlov] How many people are now employed in the Russian  nuclear weapons complex?    [Mikhaylov] Over 100,000. These people are one of Russia's  chief resources. Unfortunately, they are now having quite a  difficult time living and working. The total ""marketness"" into  which they have tried to push the nuclear sector, the shortage  of funds and our utterly primitive conversion have markedly  reduced the return from both science and industry. The sector's  steady development can be achieved only with state economic  regulation. Yes, we can produce the world's best saucepans which  will be competitive on markets from Africa to America, but do we  really need to enter the new century with saucepans?    In the very near future only those countries in which high  technologies are developed will be able to live properly. I  want Russia to be one of them.    [Khokhlov] In June the Russian defense industry intends to  go on strike. Will the nuclear scientists support them?    [Mikhaylov] We are forbidden by law to go on strike.    [Khokhlov] What is the average wage in the sector now?    [Mikhaylov] In the industry, specialists receive an average  of R230,000, at a nuclear electric power station they get  R420,000. Our scientists are poorer -- the average salary is  R150,000. It is true that we have been able to increase wages  at the Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 federal nuclear centers to  R250,000. In 1993 some 6-8 percent of what were not the worst  specialists left the Ministry of Atomic Energy for commercial  structures. A pity.    But it is surprising that given the miserly salaries and the  paltry ""grants"" from the state budget for the development of  science and industry, given the fact that fixed capital is more  than 50 percent worn out, the Ministry of Atomic Energy is  working with an exceptional return. On many salients we are  still ""ahead of the whole planet."" Research and applied work is  under way in the field of nuclear physics, high-energy and  superconductivity physics, thermonuclear fusion, and  electronics.... Only patriots can work in these conditions. If  the sector is allowed to survive now it will be of enormous  benefit to Russia.    [Khokhlov] Viktor Nikitovich, no one has yet denied the  famous formula ""if you want peace, prepare for war."" Our first  atom bomb was created by Kurchatov, our first hydrogen bomb by  Sakharov, and third-generation weapons are our ""baby."" Is the  appearance of a new type of weapon in the very near future  possible?    [Mikhaylov] I think so. If mankind is unable to renounce  military atomic energy completely, then such a weapon could  appear by the year 2000.    [Khokhlov] How will it differ from existing models?    [Mikhaylov] The nuclear warheads now available are usually  called highly effective. The new, fourth, generation will be  guided weapons [napravlennogo deystviya].    [Khokhlov] Can you predict who the inventors of this weapon  will be -- Russian or U.S. scientists?    [Mikhaylov] It is hard to say. Breakthroughs in science  depend little on the economic or political situation in a  country. And our scientists' brains work no worse than those of  the Americans.    [Khokhlov] What does Russia's chief ""hawk"" dream of?    [Mikhaylov] Of peace. But we still have a powerful struggle  for it.     "

Might it have come from a  Russian military arsenal?    [Dyakov] That cannot be ruled out. But controls over  radioactive components in Russian military nuclear facilities  are still quite stringent. The quantities of plutonium that  have appeared on the black market and can be used in weapons are  very small. No one can make a bomb out of that.    [Rybak] Can plutonium for use in weapons be obtained during  the process of dismantling warheads?    [Dyakov] Russia destroyed some 2,000 warheads last year.  This took place under strict supervision.    [Rybak] In that case, where are the loopholes? The theft  and smuggling of radioactive substances is reaching frightening  proportions!    [Dyakov] The situation is fully under control in all the  facilities under the authority of the Nuclear Ministry. But  because the wages of most employees are not enough to subsist  on, many of them try to earn extra money. Unfortunately, one  way of doing that is by stealing and selling radioactive  substances.    [Rybak] Can one not control the handling of these substances  more stringently?    [Dyakov] That is very difficult. Noone knows exactly how  much plutonium and uranium are produced in civilian reactors.  That does not apply only to Russia. In the entire world there  are no exact figures, just estimates.    [Rybak] Weapons-grade plutonium is still being produced in  Russia. When will the military reactors be shut down?    [Dyakov] Weapons-grade plutonium is produced in three  reactors in Russia. The press claims that they will be closed  down this year. That is nonsense. These reactors also produce  electricity and provide heating for the neighboring cities of  Krasnoyarsk and Tomsk. Only when there is an alternative can  they be shut down. That is out of the question before the year  2000. But we are prepared to place under intentional control  every gram of plutonium we produce. The relevant document has  already been drafted.    [Rybak] Could the West offer more effective help?    [Dyakov] The Americans have already promised us lots of  money just to dismantle the warheads. Now they want to provide  us with gas-fueled power stations in exchange for the shutdown  of the nuclear ones. I am skeptical about that, because so far  we have only received a smidgen of this loudly proclaimed  assistance.     "
0,FT934-1664 ,"FT934-1664 _AN-DLQC8AEPFT 931217   FT  17 DEC 93 / Pooling funds to ease the pain of change: Negotiations among Europe's petrochemicals producers to cut loss-making capacity      By PAUL ABRAHAMS   Europe's petrochemicals industry is in agony. Profitability has fallen for five years and not a single producer is covering reinvestment costs. Today the sector's most important manufacturers will tackle the cause of the suffering. Delegates from Europe's most important manufacturers of ethylene, the basic building block of plastics, are gathering in Brussels under the auspices of the Association of Petrochemicals Producers in Europe to discuss closing capacity. The 10-strong subcommittee is expected to make a final decision about whether to recommend a Europe-wide rationalisation programme. The problem facing the sector is deceptively simple. There are 53 ethylene crackers in western Europe with capacity of 18.4m tonnes a year. Next year the figure will rise to 19.34m tonnes because of BASF's new 650,000-tonne-a-year plant in Antwerp. In contrast, demand, hit by the European recession, is expected to be only 15.6m tonnes next year, according to Trichem consultants, the London-based industry specialists. Given the massive imbalance between supply and demand, prices of ethylene derivatives remain grim and capacity utilisation rates during the fourth quarter have drifted below 80 per cent. Polystyrene prices have tumbled from more than DM2.60 (Pounds 1.03) a kilo in 1989 to less than DM1.50 while polypropylene prices have plummeted from DM2.30 a kilo in 1990 to just over DM1. Efforts by manufacturers to raise prices this autumn have been largely unsuccessful. Increases were almost immediately undermined by discounting. The only exception was PVC, which has gone up 20 per cent since September, but from a devastatingly low base. The solution appears obvious. The industry must cut capacity. The proposal being discussed today is that between 1.5m tonnes and 2m tonnes a year of ethylene capacity should be shut down. This would be achieved by setting up a DM500m fund based on a levy of about DM30 per tonne of installed capacity. Those manufacturers wanting to close capacity would then bid for part of the fund in return for shutting down their plants. Some derivative production would also need to be closed. According to estimates by brokers James Capel, Enichem of Italy would pay DM63m into the scheme for its capacity of 2.1m tonnes a year; Shell DM51m for its 1.7m tonnes; Dow DM48m for its 1.6m tonnes; BASF and Elf Atochem DM45m each for their 1.5m tonnes; the Fina-Neste joint-venture DM30m for its 1m tonnes; DSM DM30m for its 1m tonnes; and Imperial Chemical Industries DM18m for its 600,000 tonnes. Mr Jukka Viinanen, APPE president, is optimistic about the plan's prospects. But the barriers to rationalisation remain considerable. These include environmental clean-up and redundancy costs, as well as the political obstacles to closing state-owned plants. Last month members of the APPE general council members voted 20 to three in favour of the plan, with two abstentions. But if the plan is to work, unanimity is needed. Ethylene producers have remained unwilling to discuss prospects for the meeting. The sticking points appear to be: Whether the capacity closures would be sufficient to justify the fund's creation. Whether producers, which closed capacity in the 1980s at their own expense and are now cost-efficient, should pay for others to close plants. ICI, for example, closed 650,000 tonnes of capacity during the 1980s. Whether a moratorium on new capacity could be agreed. There would be little point in closing capacity if other manufacturers added new production soon afterwards. The APPE is determined that a decision on whether or not to press ahead with the plan should be made today. Delaying it further could be counter-productive, preventing rationalisation that would take place anyway. Mergers of individual businesses - such as between Shell and Himont, Enichem and BP Chemicals, and Neste and Statoil - appear to be in limbo. Even if the steering committee does give the green light to the plan, it has to be approved by the members' boards and by the European Commission. Earlier this month Mr Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner, said he needed to be convinced the situation facing the industry was not merely a dip in the business cycle, but rather a true structural crisis with no hope of a reasonable recovery without rationalisation. He also warned that any restructuring should not be used to create an anti-competitive cartel. If that was the case, the Commission would not hesitate to take appropriate action, he said. If the proposals go ahead, the question remains whether they will have any real impact. Over the past decade, Europe, with its high labour, energy, environmental and logistical costs, has become a net importer of plastics. Attempts at price rises may inevitably be undermined by greater imports from low-cost manufacturers in the US and Middle East. In other words, the present unprofitability may be the consequence of structural change in the sector, rather than its traditional cyclicality. If so, the petrochemicals manufacturers' efforts to close capacity and swap or merge businesses may prove of little use.

However, the request is unlikely to be entertained by the US government, diplomats in Haiti said this week, as the move could bring the 12,000 troops in the country in direct confrontation with armed Haitians, leading to US casualties and fatalities, and increasing pressure for the troops' withdrawal. Mr Aristide's request suggests growing concern about the security situation in Haiti, which has been generally quiet since the president was reinstated last month after three years in exile. However, Senator Robert Dole, who will lead the Republican majority in the new Congress, has said disarming of Haitians should be done by the Haitian police. There is yet no adequate local constabulary to do this as the reorganisation of Haiti's armed forces, one of the first tasks of the recently reinstalled government, will take longer than was first assumed. This has raised questions about public security and the timing of the pullout of the US troops who are currently responsible for law and order. Haitian and US officials say the recruitment and training of the security forces, mainly a new constabulary, is already proving more difficult than first thought. The unpopularity of soldiers and policemen, repeatedly accused of widespread abuses during the three years of the military dictatorship, is deterring many prospective officers. With a likely rise in pressure from Republican legislators for an early pullout of US troops, Haitian officials fear a security vacuum in the country if the refashioned army and police are not ready by the time foreign troops leave. Such a situation would be 'destabilising' as it could be exploited by 'anti-government forces and bandits,' said one official. A programme agreed by Mr Aristide will see the dismantling of Haiti's 7,000 member army, and creation of a new militia of 1,500. The police force of 1,500, which is an arm of the military, will be placed under civilian control and increased to about 10,000 members. Concerns about security led Mr Aristide to bring forward the appointment of new chiefs for the army and the police. He appointed Brig Gen Bernadin Poisson, the former head of the military's fire fighting unit, as the army's new commander-in-chief. The fire services are part of the military.

0,FT924-6928 ,"FT924-6928 _AN-CKSC7AAKFT 921119   FT  19 NOV 92 / Community's social action plans succumb to sabotage and recession: How some high hopes have been brought down to earth      By DAVID GOODHART   THE 'social dimension' of the European Community relaunched by Mr Jacques Delors in 1989 is proving a disappointment to many of its supporters, especially Europe's trade unions. Slower growth in Europe and successful sabotage by Britain has ensured that only a small number of the key measures contained in the 1989 social action programme have been adopted. If the Maastricht treaty is passed, its 'social chapter', which excludes Britain, should make it easier to push through more social and employment legislation by majority vote. But even that looks unlikely as some of the leading strategists inside the European Commission's Directorate-General 5 - the social affairs directorate  -privately speculate about a less ambitious approach to legislation. Social affairs officials appear to have taken some of the British criticisms about over-centralised, over-prescriptive, legislation to heart. They are thus concentrating their attention on the idea - included in the social chapter - that the European Trades Union Congress (ETUC) and Unice, the European employers' body, should agree the details of European social and employment law between themselves. This idea, with the Commission itself merely laying down general objectives, is likely to appeal to whoever takes over from Ms Vasso Papandreou, the current social affairs commissioner from Greece. The idea does not, however, appeal to the ETUC. At a recent conference in Greece, Mr Jean Lapeyre, its deputy general secretary, said: 'The trouble is European employers are only willing to negotiate with us if there is a threat of legislation.' There is, nevertheless, some evidence that the idea is sticking. The Commission recently withdrew a health and safety directive on transport because it was not flexible enough. Even more shocking to Europe's unions were recent comments made by Mr Hermanus van Zonneveld, a senior Commission official, who appeared to suggest at a conference in the UK that the EC was losing interest in legislating on European works councils - consultation committees in European multinationals. The Commission insists that it has not dropped its commitment to legislation and was merely encouraging unions to use the potential leverage in the social chapter. But IG Metall, the main German union, is said to be ready to 'drive tanks into Brussels' to make sure that the commitment to works councils is maintained. And Mr Marcello Malentacchi, general secretary of the International Metalworkers' Federation, has written to the Commission saying that works councils are the most important part of the social dimension. The reason why unions are so obsessed by works council, which are merely consultative bodies, is that they see them as the first step towards the long-held goal of cross-border collective bargaining. It was the Maastricht treaty's ability to deliver on works councils, plus the fact that the social partners, unions and employers, were given formal recognition in a major international treaty, that persuaded union leaders around Europe to give their qualified backing to Maastricht. On the face of it that support is rather surprising. The anti-inflation, anti-devaluation, principles built into economic convergence mean that wages and employment will have to take the strain of adjustment in Europe's less successful economies. Even the pre-Maastricht moves towards convergence are causing a wave of strikes in Spain and Italy led by the very unions that are supporting the even more stringent convergence conditions of the treaty itself. If the social dimension sweetener is now being taken away as well, it is no wonder that Europe's unions are feeling a bit exposed on their Europhile flank. But arguably the unions are interpreting the social dimension too narrowly. Since 1989 about 60 per cent of the social action programme has been passed. Admittedly much of the legislation, for example on maternity pay or working time, has been watered down, but there is still much of value from a union point of view. There has been a consistent trickle of health and safety legislation, with another batch due for implementation at the beginning of next year. The written proof of employment directive, passed last year, could also significantly improve the rights of the most vulnerable workers. Even the working time directive, which is unlikely to be passed this year under the British presidency but will probably be passed early next year, has some useful protection for workers forced to work dangerously long hours, and might encourage more job creation and less overtime when the upturn comes. Further, in Britain, the government's current drive to contract out central government services has been thrown into confusion by one of the oldest pieces of EC employment legislation known as the acquired rights directive. Like so much else in the EC, enthusiasm for the social dimension waxes and wanes. After the spurt of the late 1980s the outlook for the social dimension is currently bleak, but it would be foolish to write its obituary.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

The Swiss-Swedish engineering group yesterday announced a 4 per cent decline in 1992 pre-tax profits after financial items to Dollars 1.11bn from Dollars 1.15bn. The result was in line with expectations, and reflects two years of recession in western Europe. The group had 213,400 employees at the end of last year, and has shed 35,000 jobs since the spring of 1990. Net of acquisitions, jobs are still being shed at a rate of 1,000 a month, said Mr Percy Barnevik, ABB's president and chief executive. He stressed that the job cuts were one of a number of factors that had strengthened ABB through the past two years of recession. The group had reduced its net debt by Dollars 2bn to zero over 1991 and 1992, and had increased research and development spending by Dollars 450m. Last year's RD spend was Dollars 2.4bn, 8 per cent of its Dollars 29.6bn revenues. Yesterday's figures underlined the large differences in financial performance of ABB's business segments. The best performer was power plants, which lifted profits to Dollars 444m last year from Dollars 366m in 1991. In contrast, the struggling transportation business, which includes the former Brel railway rolling stock builder in the UK, plunged to a Dollars 40m loss from a Dollars 21m profit. Mr Barnevik said it would take a couple of years for ABB's restructuring efforts to bring earnings in transportation up to average levels for the group. In regional terms, Asia was the star performer for ABB last year, with orders up 34 per cent to Dollars 6.6bn. Mr Goran Lindahl, executive vice-president with responsibility for Asia, said the goal was to double the order intake over the next five years. ABB has 21,000 employees in Asia, and Mr Lindahl said ABB was involved in joint venture talks with about 50 companies in the region. Mr Barnevik said the group could finance its Asian and eastern European expansion internally by reducing working capital. He said he did not see the need to raise any new equity, and would not comment on long-rumoured plans for an ABB share issue - the two parent companies Asea and BBC Brown Boveri each own half of ABB and are publicly-quoted, but ABB is not. Overall, ABB's orders rose 7 per cent last year to Dollars 31.6bn. Increased non-recurring items left net income down 17 per cent at Dollars 505m compared with Dollars 609m for the same period in the previous year. On the outlook, Mr Barnevik said he expected profits after financial items to be about the same this year as the Dollars 1.11bn achieved in 1992. The US market for consumable items would pick up slowly, he said, spilling over into Europe by the end of the year. But domestic conditions would remain tough in Scandinavia, and there would be a further decline in demand in Germany. The latest figures from ABB round off the first five years of trading for one of Europe's most important manufacturing companies. Since ABB was formed in 1988, it has undergone both heavy restructuring in Europe and North America and significant expansion elsewhere - especially in eastern Europe and Asia.

Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds met at Chequers yesterday, accompanied by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister After the meeting, the two prime ministers said they had made 'steady progress' in the framework document intended to promote talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. But the two men acknowledged that sticking-points remained and declined to set a date for the document's completion. 'There are still some very important issues that remain to be resolved,' Mr Major said. Mr Reynolds said: 'You can take it that the gap (between the two sides) is narrower after today's meeting than it was yesterday.' Officials will continue talks today on what Mr Major described as the 'logistics and mechanics' of arranging for weapons in the hands of paramilitaries to be handed over. Acknowledging that there were 'self-evident difficulties' in the process, partly because weapons were hidden in Ulster and the Irish Republic, Mr Major said: 'Clearly it is desirable to have a co-ordinated approach.' He declined to say whether the handing over of weapons was likely to begin in advance of talks between the government and Sinn Fein before the end of the year. The IRA has not yet agreed to hand over any weapons. Questioned on his remarks last week, which appeared to irritate Dublin, that plans for an Ulster assembly were separate from the framework document, Mr Major said it would be a 'misreading' to suggest he was trying to detach one from the other. The process is seen as falling into three 'strands'. One covers the assembly; strand two concerns north and south relations; and strand three covers relations between London and Dublin. Mr Major said on Friday that the framework document would cover strands two and three. Mr Reynolds declined to say whether he would push for changes in the Irish constitution, which enshrines Dublin's territorial claim to Ulster. Mr Major is thought to have told his Irish counterpart that hopes for a settlement depended on a revision of this claim. Moderate unionists, whose support is vital to efforts to forge a settlement, are expected to insist on such a move. Ulster spending plea, Page 9   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Among the other weapons questioned on safety grounds was the W-88 warhead, the  nuclear tip of missiles carried aboard the Navy's Trident submarines.    The Washington Post, which first reported the nuclear dangers in its Wednesday  editions, said that Energy Department investigators found that if the  propellant of the missiles carried aboard Trident submarines caught fire, the  W-88 warhead could spread nuclear debris or even detonate.

The United States, however, does not  accuse Yeltsin personally. The Clinton administration believes  that he is ""not in the loop.""    According to an anonymous source from Clinton's inner  circles, the White House allegedly has ""irrefutable proof that  Russia has a biological warfare program."" Specifically,  according to the newspaper, the point is the existence in Russia  of some ""biological infrastructure of noncommercial purpose.""  According to the same anonymous source, information on the  existence in Russia of a program to develop and produce  biological weapons had been received from sources in the United  States in Great Britain, including from a Russian scientist who  immigrated to the United States last year. However, another  anonymous source from the American White House, whose opinion  THE WASHINGTON POST also quotes, believes that there is no proof  to support such a sensational accusation. In his opinion, what  may be meant here is the existence in Russia of ""specialized  equipment of nonmilitary purpose,"" which nevertheless ought to  be dismantled along with the military one.    So far there is no reaction from Russia. It is interesting,  however, that the scandalous newspaper item in the United States  coincided with the resignation of Anatoliy Kuntsevich, the  chairman of the Committee on Convention-Related Problems of  Chemical and Biological Weapons under the president of Russia.  Lately he had been Russia's ""chief chemist,"" and many varieties  of second-generation toxic agents had been developed with his  direct participation. His functions included the development of  a chemical weapons destruction program and monitoring its  implementation (Moscow had always denied that it had biological  weapons but nevertheless had a committee on its ""convention"" on  the grounds of ensuring compliance with the 1972 Convention).  The reason for Kuntsevich's resignation, given yesterday at a  briefing by Vyacheslav Kostikov--""giving consent to  transportation and storage of a serious consignment of toxic  agents within the limits of a large city""--is questioned by  everyone who is even minimally familiar with the chemical  weapons problem. It is laughable to remove from the job a  person, who in the past had sanctioned transportation and  destruction of entire arsenals of toxic agents in densely  population areas of the Volga region, just for giving consent to  carry out only part of this program.    An interesting suggestion came from one of KOMMERSANT's  competent sources, according to whom there is a connection  between Russia being accused of continuing work on biological  weapons and Mr. Kuntsevich's resignation (the assumption is that  there has been a leak of certain information, which was the true  reason for resignation). This assumption is indirectly supported  by the fact that at the hearings in the former Supreme Soviet  and in the State Duma Kuntsevich persistently understated the  true size of Russia's combat toxic agents arsenal by a factor of  seven or eight at a minimum (according to estimates by  independent observers).    There is only one way, however, to counter Washington's  accusations: The Yeltsin-Clinton joint statement, issued in  Moscow in January, allows for the ""possibility of mutual visits  to facilities and holding meetings of experts in order to  monitor compliance with the Convention on Banning Biological and  Toxic Weapons.""

In a presentation to the Copenhagen summit which was designed to capitalise on what he sees as a new mood of 'realism' in the Community, Mr Major also took a further sideswipe at Germany for preventing a European-wide reduction in interest rates. Emphasising the advantages that Britain now enjoyed from a combination of low inflation and low borrowing costs, Mr Major said that high real interest rates elsewhere were 'penalising growth, stopping investment and damaging business and consumer confidence'. He also warned against any relaxation of Maastricht treaty guidelines on fiscal deficits, even though he regarded as 'fanciful' the timetable set for European monetary union. However, the prime minister reserved the thrust of his speech for a frontal attack on the damaging impact of high employment costs on competitiveness and on job-creation. Contrasting Europe's failure to create jobs during the 1980s with the success achieved in the US, he told other leaders: 'The choice before us is a stark one. We surely do not want the 17m unemployed in Europe to become 20m or more people without jobs. We must compete or we shall contract.' He called for new procedures under which any proposed EC legislation affecting industry or employment would be accompanied by a full analysis of its impact on competitiveness. In parallel, the European Commission should carry out a thorough audit of existing directives to gauge their impact on business costs and jobs. In what his aides described as an attempt to dislodge the notion that Europe could prosper 'through trade with itself', Mr Major offered a litany of figures to underline the EC's weakening competitiveness and rising structural unemployment. The Community share of the industrialised world's exports had fallen by 10 per cent during the 1980s. EC unit wage costs had risen by 4 per cent a year over the same period. In the US, the rise had been 1 per cent a year. In Japan there had been no increase. As a result, average labour costs in manufacturing in the EC were now 20 per cent higher that in Japan or the US. Offering his prescription, Mr Major called for greater labour market flexibility and mobility, an end to wage indexation and the promotion of flexible work patterns and employment contracts. That provided the basis for a sharp attack on efforts to harmonise social policy across the Community. With the non-wage costs of European employers nearly twice the level of their competitors in the US, the priority should be to reduce the regulatory and social burdens on industry. Seizing on four directives either passed or under consideration - covering working time, acquired employment rights, young people and part-time workers  -Mr Major warned: 'There is a real danger that harmonisation at Community level is locking us in to costly labour market rigidities and driving away business to our competitors.' Backing in principle Mr Jacques Delors' plan to produce a report for the Brussels summit next December, he said that the main focus should be on improvements to the functioning of labour markets and lightening the burdens on industry.

Arriving in Miami, an immigration department agent--after  looking through the passenger's passport and consulting the  computer--asked him to wait, ordered a [member of] customs  personnel to bring his suitcases and invited him to a nearby  office. The visitor, somewhat alarmed, asked: ""What is wrong?""  The customs official explained: ""Your name coincides with that  of another person who appears on the screen. Moreover, he is  your age--the customs official complicated matters even more  so--and he is registered as a drug trafficker."" The foreign  visitor indignant, surprised, and desperate protested: ""That  cannot be."" He complained: ""I was president of the republic and  fought drug trafficking with the U.S. Government's cooperation.  Let me phone the U.S. ambassador in my country.""    The former president managed to get through: ""Ambassador, I  am being delayed here in Miami because the computer registers a  drug trafficker with my name."" He explained his problem  sounding rather terrified. The ambassador confirms: ""Yes, they  have informed me that your name appears in the computer. It is  a computer problem."" The ambassador promises to do his best,  saying: ""We will resolve the problem.""    It is said that finally after 40 minutes, or after some 90  minutes according to more exaggerated witness reports, the  former president was able to comply with the immigration red  tape and visit the United States under the uneasy impression  that the incident, caused by who knows what, was a warning.    This anecdote is an example of the political language of  ""demonstrations,"" like military maneuvers, street  demonstrations, cabinet changes, retirements, etc., whose  goals--which exceed their disclosed purposes--are uncovered,  sometimes correctly and others erroneously, through analysis or  speculation.    The case of the former president delayed by an immigration  agent reminds us of the unfulfilled promises General Andres  Rodriguez--who perfectly fits the anti-hero in the  anecdote--made to the U.S. Government about handing over the  protectors of drug trafficking and dismantling their  infrastructure.    If for the political process the transition meant building  the legal framework of democracy to assure the free action of  the political institutions and elect--based on these  conditions--the first civilian president, for the U.S.  Government it also meant eliminating the protection system for  drug traffickers.    The United States was especially concerned about this  because  the transition process was begun by a totally corrupt Armed  Forces whose rebellious commander presided over the executive  branch. The proposal to ""dignify"" the Armed Forces by the  rebels was not restricted merely, under the terms of the U.S.  aid for the new government, to prohibiting military men from  engaging in partisan activities, eradicating illegal activities  in general, and controlling the misuse and draining of state  resources, but specifically to the handing over of those who  protect traffickers.    The concern was and is very logical. U.S. experts wonder if  military men are capable of dignifying the Armed Forces. Who  will cast the first stone? Who is clean enough of any charges,  of any links, or of protecting anyone to cast the first stone?  More than four years of transition government have elapsed and  the strategists received the expected answer: The process to  dignify the Armed Forces failed--we have the disastrous example  of Colonel Gonzalez Rojas, or the replacement of General Bernal  who at the time was defense minister, or the dismantling of the  Antinarcotics Secretariat's leadership which greatly upset the  United States; Rodriguez was supposed to have cast the first  stone, but did not, he never did; and, finally, most of the  members of the high command were and are trapped by links  related to commitments and protection.    The responsibility for throwing the great quantity of stones  that should have been cast was transferred to [President Juan  Carlos] Wasmosy. Yes, to a civilian government, but under the  vertical domain regarding military issues of a very ambitious  general. The situation remains unchanged: The process to  dignify the Armed Forces continues in the hands of the Armed  Forces, but the difference is that it now has the ludicrous  facade of a civilian government.    So, in view of the careful protection granted from high  spheres to traffickers--detected and monitored by U.S.  intelligence--it was decided to materialize a plan under which  U.S. Southern Command servicemen based in Panama would build  schools, water wells, health posts, and repair roads in San  Pedro Department as ""training for the shipment of construction  material for future actions similar to the Persian Gulf War,"" as  Ambassador Glassman explained on one occasion. Who says this  project has concealed objectives? The message is clear and  direct: One typical ""demonstration"" that the U.S. troops  sometime use, when justified, is to carry out a ""Persian  Gulf-type"" intervention in Paraguayan territory.    Everyone understood the message of the ""demonstration"" of  the  military social actions. The less discreet commented that  ""there are concealed purposes,"" without understanding the  opportuneness of the maneuver.    ""There are no concealed purposes and it will benefit the  country,"" commented others with a sense of opportuneness, thus  supporting the opportunity to pressure the protectors and  allowing the Armed Forces to become dignified and overcome the  dispute the opposition maintains with the ambitious general.  For the first time most opposition legislators applauded the  arrival of U.S. troops and were willing to grant them all the  privileges and immunity requested, because they have interpreted  the ""demonstration.""    Undoubtedly some ambitious general assumed the role of  protector, took it personally, and overcame Wasmosy's first  impression that the South Command's offer was beneficial. So,  on Wednesday, 2 February, a letter of conditions was sent to  Ambassador Glassman, which he was made to sign. According to  the letter, the Paraguayan Army was to participate in the joint  actions, that the cost of the project had to be clearly  established--Congress having approved the project it should be  noted that this plan affects the nation's sovereign rights--the  operation zones must be restricted, the importation of weapons  restricted, detailed information of the U.S. personnel to enter  the country should be disclosed, and that it should be clearly  established whom will be granted privileges and immunity.  Wasmosy and his subordinates have again picked up the old  yankee anti-imperialist wave.    This never crossed Southern Command's mind. Glassman, taken  aback by the offense, commented that ""similar offers to other  Latin American countries were never rejected."" General Oviedo,  as a champion of the national liberation, on Thursday, 3  February, asked journalists: ""Do you think we would reject  something that benefits the Armed Forces?"" Military strategists  read between lines: ""The interests of the protectors?"" The  almost dramatic answer was: ""We have withdrawn the draft bill,  but beware the consequences."" Watch out.    That same evening a cable television channel showed a  documentary on U.S. military operations in Panama when Noriega  was arrested. Was that mere coincidence or another  ""demonstration?""    One can expect anything if this relationship between the  United States and the military leadership continues to be simply  horrible. What other names and prospects will appear on the  computer screens in the future?     "

Mr Smith told a rally of London Labour candidates and MPs that the party's plans for economic revival would win votes in 'massive numbers' at the elections. He promised better transport and health services for the capital, and confirmed Labour's plans for a city-wide local government to replace the defunct Greater London Council. But Mr Smith's speech concentrated on increases of 287 per cent in burglaries and 174 per cent in violent crime in London since the Conservatives came to power in 1979. He ridiculed the fresh approach to crime prevention outlined last week by Mr John Major, the prime minister, which included plans for prickly bushes around buildings to deter thieves. 'Burglars throughout Britain are now quaking in their boots at the prospect of this latest bold, indeed draconian, initiative by the prime minister,' he said. Mr Smith said the government had no strategy to combat crime except 'talking tough'. At the same time, it was dismantling programmes such as the safer cities and urban redevelopment initiatives which helped to prevent crime. 'Drug education officers' posts are being cut; local authorities are being forced to cut youth services; mentally ill people are left to roam the streets with tragic consequences. And the prime minister shakes his head and wrings his hands at the rising crime rates,' said Mr Smith. Mr Smith promised a 'concerted strategy to smash the culture of despair, hopelessness, drugs, violence, poor education and poor job prospects in which so many young people live'. He said Labour would establish a separate London police authority, create a new category of racial violence offences, and set up a national campaign to combat drug abuse. Mr Smith said no one should seek excuses for criminal behaviour, but Labour would tackle the poverty, deprivation, and squalor that provided fertile soil for crime to flourish. The tone of Mr Smith's speech reflects a growing belief among Labour leaders that the party has neutralised the Tories' traditional advantage on law and order issues. Mr Smith carefully followed the approach pioneered by Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, who has promised that Labour would be tough on both crime and the causes of crime.

The association called on EU industry ministers, who will discuss the Commission's decision on November 8, to maintain the plan.

'These figures show that the results achieved up to now cannot be considered a failure,' it said.

The total number of weapons the Mexican Army and  Navy seized reached 5,626, according to Sedena reports, during  the first six months of 1994.    Of the total seized, 95 percent entered Mexican territory  through so-called small-scale smuggling, especially through  Chihuahua, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Jalisco, and Nayarit, reports  indicate.    Meanwhile, Navy Secretary Admiral Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo  has said the weapons the Mexican Army and Navy seized belong to  drug traffickers, ""but we have not found caches of weapons or  anything similar.""    Interviewed during the inauguration of the 15th Navy Health  Medical Campaign, Ruano said the drug traffickers have economic  resources to buy weapons, but ""too much propaganda is being  given to what you call goat horns [AK-47 submachine guns].""    LA JORNADA: In light of these circumstances, which  are being denounced in the United States, isn't it necessary to  change surveillance measures?    Ruano: There really is no need for that. Wherever  weapons are being smuggled, it will be stopped.    According to Sedena reports, only 5 percent of the weapons  that enter Mexico are brought in legally. Those weapons are  given to state governments to supply their police forces, and a  small portion winds up in the hands of civilians.    The cost of the weapons varies in accordance with their  brand, caliber, condition, and use, and prices range from  approximately 300-7,000 pesos    Mexican Army figures indicate that during the government of  President Salinas de Gortari, the Armed Forces seized 54,208  rifles and 60,673 handguns. In addition, 98,644 weapons, both  rifles and handguns, that were seized are available to Sedena.    The report adds that in the first six months of 1994, Sedena  seized 2,591 rifles and handguns, in addition to another 3,035  that are at the disposal of civilian authorities. The Army  seized 5,626 weapons during that period.    According to Army reports, most of the arsenal comes,  presumably, from the United States, China, and the former Soviet  Union. Reports also indicate the weapons enter the country by  land, sea, air, and in small amounts; that is, through so-called  small-scale smuggling.    Reports reveal federal organizations that receive a greater  portion of the weapons are in Chihuahua, Michoacan, Sinaloa,  Jalisco and Nayarit. The weapons presumably enter these states  mostly by land and in an ""organized"" manner.    Meanwhile, Sedena makes, through its General Directorate of  Factories, weapons under a German trademark exclusively for the  Mexican Army.    Sedena stipulates the requirement a citizen must meet to  legally buy a weapon. Requirements include that the person live  honestly, comply with military service, and have no record of  being sentenced for weapons use. Permits to bear weapons can  also be obtained based on the nature of the person's occupation,  the special circumstances of his place of residence, or any  justifiable reasons that merit it.    A document in which the Mexican Army warned the Government  Secretariat on the possible illegal entry of 20,000 AK-47  submachine guns, better known as goat horns, was disclosed  recently. The first shipment would reportedly consist of 2,000  weapons of this type (rifles).    Sedena stated later the entry of those weapons, which would  represent less than 20 percent of the weapons seized in the past  six months, into Mexico has not been detected so far.     "
0,FT943-6013 ,"FT943-6013 _AN-EIAD1ABWFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Cautious response urged on Major - UK reaction      By ROLAND RUDD and Our Belfast Correspondent   The prime minister was yesterday urged by rightwing Conservatives not to embark on constitutional talks with Sinn Fein until the IRA agreed to a permanent ceasefire. Among Northern Ireland politicians, nationalists greeted the ceasefire announcement with delight while unionists voiced suspicion that the statement did not signal a permanent end to the IRA's terrorist campaign. Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 group of Thatcherite Tory MPs, warned of the risk of 'igniting opinion in the majority of Northern Ireland' if ministers moved too fast in response to the IRA ceasefire. Mr Andrew Hunter, a member of the Commons Northern Ireland committee, feared it could be 'a tactical ploy - a pause in the killing'. He said: 'You cannot possibly sit at a table and negotiate with people who will resume killing if they don't get what they want in those negotiations - that is an impossible situation.' An indication of the potential Tory opposition to constitutional talks with Sinn Fein came with the publication of a pamphlet by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who argued against involving Sinn Fein in talks. The pamphlet, written before yesterday's announcement, said Sinn Fein's participation in a constitutional conference would put ministers 'in the position of being held responsible for the next round of terror if they do not give in to the IRA blackmail of threatening to pull out'. On the left of the Tory party Mr Peter Temple-Morris said people were 'afraid of peace'. Another Tory backbencher urged unionists to 'seize the opportunities of peace' and break the 'hatred of the past'. Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, gave a cautious welcome to the IRA ceasefire, but stressed the test would come in whether it led to a permanent renunciation of violence. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'If the IRA has at last realised that it cannot achieve its aims through violence, then this is a very important moment for peace in Northern Ireland.' In Northern Ireland, unionist politicians said the IRA should surrender its arsenal of weapons and explosives to prove it was serious about ending terrorism for good. But Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, who put his reputation on the line by talking with Sinn Fein, said the ceasefire would be 'welcomed by Irish people everywhere, but particularly by the people in the streets of Northern Ireland. Now we face the primary challenge which is to reach agreement among our divided people.' The Rev William McCrea, an MP from the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the IRA was not seeking peace but trying to blackmail the government for more concessions. Dr John Alderdice, leader of the moderate Alliance party, commented that actions would speak louder than words. Mr Terry Carlin, regional officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, called on 'all paramilitary organisations to halt the violence. There's a lot of work to be done in healing the wounds and the mental and physical scars of social deprivation.' A number of broadcasters, led by Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, last night called on the government to reconsider broadcasting restrictions on Sinn Fein members in view of the ceasefire.

0,FT933-16308 ,"FT933-16308 _AN-DGECMAASFT 930705   FT  05 JUL 93 / Exchange rates main factor in European car price comparisons: The European Market - European motorists are paying not for profiteering but for the industry's lack of competitiveness      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   On May 1 this year Italy and Spain were easily the cheapest markets in which to buy most new car models, according to the first comparative European Community price lists for selected new cars, published last week at the behest of the European Commission. A year earlier, the Commission's own study showed Spain as the highest priced market, with Italy third highest. Early last year UK consumer groups were vocal in their condemnation of the excessively high prices asked of British motorists; Last week's lists show the British market to be the cheapest in Europe for many executive and luxury cars, and about the EC average for many 'ordinary' vehicles. What has happened to change the picture? The answer to the past year's price upheavals disclosed by the lists is to be found almost entirely within the currency markets - as the Brussels-based industry lobby group, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, leaped to point out the moment the comparisons were published. What they have demonstrated conclusively, the EAMA trumpets, is that it is unrealistic to make meaningful price comparisons - let alone have 'harmonised' prices - when some currencies remain so volatile. Between July last year and the middle of May, the main EMS currencies - German, French, Belgian, Dutch and Danish - rose 22 per cent against the lira (briefly touching 32 per cent in April), 20 per cent against the peseta, 17 per cent against sterling and 15 per cent against the Portuguese escudo. 'Manufacturers - particularly non-local manufacturers - cannot be expected to make instant double-digit price changes,' the EAMA contends. The lists come as close as possible to comparing 'like for like' in terms of models and prices. They provide information on 55 European and 17 Japanese popular models, based on recommended retail prices, adjusted for equipment differences and with prices given in local currencies both before and after tax. Supplements for options such as air conditioning and power steering are given, as well as the premium for right-hand-drive models for the UK market. Differentials are arrived at by converting the local currency prices into Ecus. As an EC-wide comparison, the lists have inbuilt compromises. One is that they take no account of the widely varying discounts available in individual markets. More important, the lists exclude Denmark and Greece, because local taxation  -of over 100 per cent - is seen as excessively depressing pre-tax prices. But Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal are included even though national taxation in each can add 50 per cent to the cost of a new car. Manufacturers selling in these countries, too, have a strong incentive to keep pre-tax prices down in order not to have tax-inclusive prices beyond the reach of consumers. Given such an obvious distortion, the Commission indicated after last year's report that governments with such high tax regimes would have to be 'leaned on' to reduce such large obstacles to the internal EC trade in cars. But so far, there is no real sign that Brussels is doing any leaning. And until there is, the underlying probability remains that one government's high tax take on a car, and the manufacturer's low pre-tax price in that market in order to sell it, stand to be subsidised by a higher pre-tax price (and fatter manufacturer profit margin) in relatively low-tax countries like the UK, where the only tax now paid on a new car purchase is the standard 17.5 per cent VAT. And that consideration underlines the biggest flaw in the EC's drive for price 'transparency'. The lists should let consumers see at a glance roughly what they can expect to pay for given models in Europe's main markets and where they might most fruitfully go for the best deal. Thus they now know that, for example, that there is no point going to Germany to buy an Audi 100, because it is cheaper in the UK than anywhere else. On the other hand, they could save up to 35 per cent by buying various Fiats, Rovers, Vauxhalls and Volkswagens in Italy. And with even consumer groups acknowledging that manufacturers are being less obstructive towards private cross-border purchases, taking advantage of cheaper markets should be no problem. But the lists cannot tell consumers what they should pay in each market, based on the fundamentals of manufacturers and their dealers receiving an equitable return on investment. Not surprisingly, no manufacturer wants to disclose its exact profit - or loss - margin on each car in individual markets, particularly if, as is almost certainly the case, low-tax countries are shown to be higher-margin ones. But given the sea of red ink washing over most European producers, the tendency of consumer groups to see profiteering round every corner strikes a jarring note with many industry analysts. As a number of studies have already shown, European car prices as a whole are high measured against those of Japan and North America. What this year's plunge in the European new car market has exposed is the signal failure of much of Europe's car industry properly to attack costs and efficiency during the boom years of the 1980s. The bottom line appears to be that Europe's motorists are paying the price not of profiteering but of the European industry's lack of competitiveness and the disparities in EC taxation and currency regimes.

0,FT944-8609 ,"FT944-8609 _AN-EKUDAAGIFT 941118   FT  18 NOV 94 / UK and France to set up air defence unit      By DAVID BUCHAN and REUTER   Leaders of France and Britain are today expected to unveil a new planning unit to co-ordinate use of their air forces in peacekeeping missions. Greater defence co-operation will be the main theme at today's one-day summit meeting in the city of Chartres between the two countries, which have otherwise found it hard to find much common ground on other issues of European integration. Prime Minister John Major and several other UK ministers will be holding some six hours of talks with the French side, led by the ailing socialist President Francois Mitterrand, now in his last year of office, and by gaullist Prime Minister Edouard Balladur who shares many of Mr Major's views on European Union institutions, though not on most of the policies those institutions should carry out. On defence, however, there is a communion of interest between France's ambition for a strong EU defence effort and the UK's desire to play a positive role in foreign and defence policy discussions in advance of the EU's 1996 constitutional conference that may pit London and Paris against each other on other issues. Underscoring their countries' diplomatic partnership, Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, will breakfast in Paris tomorrow with their Russian counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, to discuss the situation in Bosnia, following the US decision to drop out of enforcing the arms embargo. The air planning unit will only initially involve about a total 10 officers from both air forces. But it is part of a broader defence dialogue which has involved contacts between French and UK rapid deployment forces, and a continuing discussion of nuclear doctrine between Europe's only two atomic weapon powers. The Anglo-French nuclear working group is not, however, tackling anything as far reaching or sensitive as joint nuclear submarine patrols or missile targeting. On joint arms projects, France will be keen to press the UK to join it and other Europeans in building the Future Large Aircraft, a new troop transport designed to give European armies the capacity to project power overseas. UK ministers are still weighing whether to join the FLA project or to go the traditional route of buying Lockheed transport aircraft from the US again, and they will be keener to review progress on the trilateral Horizon frigate project with France and Italy. Both France and the UK are ready to help African states with peacekeeping missions, and one idea is that France focus on better equipping and training two or three francophone African countries, and the UK do the same with some anglophone countries. Reuter adds from Paris: While Britain, Washington's most faithful ally in Europe, did not join the Franco-German inspired European army corps, officials on both sides say close political and military co-operation in Bosnia and concern at a perceived US drift towards disengagement have brought Britain and France, western Europe's main military powers, closer together. 'The British were up to now extremely reticent about European defence co-operation. Now it seems we can progress together,' a French official said.

The United States, however, does not  accuse Yeltsin personally. The Clinton administration believes  that he is ``not in the loop.''    According to an anonymous source from Clinton's inner  circles, the White House allegedly has ``irrefutable proof that  Russia has a biological warfare program.'' Specifically,  according to the newspaper, the point is the existence in Russia  of some ``biological infrastructure of noncommercial purpose.''  According to the same anonymous source, information on the  existence in Russia of a program to develop and produce  biological weapons had been received from sources in the United  States in Great Britain, including from a Russian scientist who  immigrated to the United States last year. However, another  anonymous source from the American White House, whose opinion  THE WASHINGTON POST also quotes, believes that there is no proof  to support such a sensational accusation. In his opinion, what  may be meant here is the existence in Russia of ``specialized  equipment of nonmilitary purpose,'' which nevertheless ought to  be dismantled along with the military one.    So far there is no reaction from Russia. It is interesting,  however, that the scandalous newspaper item in the United States  coincided with the resignation of Anatoliy Kuntsevich, the  chairman of the Committee on Convention-Related Problems of  Chemical and Biological Weapons under the president of Russia.  Lately he had been Russia's ``chief chemist,'' and many  varieties of second-generation toxic agents had been developed  with his direct participation. His functions included the  development of a chemical weapons destruction program and  monitoring its implementation (Moscow had always denied that it  had biological weapons but nevertheless had a committee on its  ``convention'' on the grounds of ensuring compliance with the  1972 Convention). The reason for Kuntsevich's resignation, given  yesterday at a briefing by Vyacheslav Kostikov--``giving consent  to transportation and storage of a serious consignment of toxic  agents within the limits of a large city''--is questioned by  everyone who is even minimally familiar with the chemical  weapons problem. It is laughable to remove from the job a  person, who in the past had sanctioned transportation and  destruction of entire arsenals of toxic agents in densely  population areas of the Volga region, just for giving consent to  carry out only part of this program.    An interesting suggestion came from one of KOMMERSANT's  competent sources, according to whom there is a connection  between Russia being accused of continuing work on biological  weapons and Mr. Kuntsevich's resignation (the assumption is that  there has been a leak of certain information, which was the true  reason for resignation). This assumption is indirectly supported  by the fact that at the hearings in the former Supreme Soviet  and in the State Duma Kuntsevich persistently understated the  true size of Russia's combat toxic agents arsenal by a factor of  seven or eight at a minimum (according to estimates by  independent observers).    There is only one way, however, to counter Washington's  accusations: The Yeltsin-Clinton joint statement, issued in  Moscow in January, allows for the ``possibility of mutual visits  to facilities and holding meetings of experts in order to  monitor compliance with the Convention on Banning Biological and  Toxic Weapons.''

0,FT923-14269 ,"FT923-14269 _AN-CGHATAFVFT 920708   FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cemex set to mix it with European heavyweights      By ANDREW TAYLOR and PETER BRUCE   THE pace of takeover activity in Europe's troubled cement sector shows little sign of slackening as producers struggle against falling sales and accusations that they have been involved in illegal market-sharing agreements. Yesterday's agreed offer by Cementos Mexicanos to buy Spain's largest cement producer, Valenciana de Cementos, for up to Dollars 1.7bn, represents the biggest takeover in Spain and the first significant purchase by a North American cement producer in Europe after a decade of heavy cement investments in the opposite direction. Spain is the second largest cement market in Europe, and the takeover bid by Cemex is a powerful challenge to European dominance of the industry on both sides of the Atlantic. It places Cemex in direct competition with the giants of the European Industry, Holderbank, Italcementi and Lafarge Coppee, which have all made big acquisitions in Spain in the past four years. But Cemex is entering a period of turmoil in the European cement industry. The European Community has written to 75 European cement manufacturers and their subsidiaries accusing them of breaching its competition laws. Investigations began three years ago after officials became concerned at the low level of cement exported between neighbouring European countries, particularly where works were situated close to borders. This has not prevented some of Europe's biggest building materials companies from buying substantial interests in cement industries in neighbouring countries. Acquisitions and strategic stake-building are increasing. A new development has been the recent arrival of Italian companies on the takeover trail. At the end of April, Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement company, paid FFr6bn (Dollars 1.07bn) for a controlling interest in Ciments Francais, France's second-largest cement producer. A month earlier, Calcestruzzi, the Italian maker of ready-mixed concrete which is a subsidiary of the Ferruzzi group, in a joint venture with the National Bank of Greece took control of Heracles, one of the two biggest cement makers in Greece. It is unclear whether the recent purchases by Italcementi and Calcestruzzi will prompt further cross-border moves by Italian cement and concrete companies. Conversely, it could draw the attention of other manufacturers to Italy, which remains a highly fragmented market and boasts the world's second highest per capita consumption of cement behind South Korea. The driving force behind many cross-border acquisitions has been the desire of manufacturers to reduce their vulnerability to sharp falls in domestic construction output. Holderbank of Switzerland, Lafarge Coppee of France and Blue Circle of the UK, for example, bought heavily in North America in the 1980s. European purchases, in some cases, may have been also dictated by a desire to gain control of previously state subsidised companies in eastern and southern Europe which could undercut local prices by exporting surplus capacity. Mr Laurence Amboldt, construction analyst with Carr Kitcat  Aitken, part of the Suez group, says: 'As the major groups look to spread their activities over a number of European regions in order to reduce the impact of local construction cycles, works with direct access to waterborne transport will be seen as particularly valuable as these provide economic transport of cement to various parts of Europe.' The result of all this activity has been to reduce the number of independent cement companies and to concentrate power in the hands of about eight large European cement groups. Italcementi, including its controlling interest in Ciments Francais, has overtaken Holderbank as the biggest seller of cement in Europe. Holderbank, however, is larger in the US and remains the world's biggest cement group. Cement prices, however, have remained surprisingly stable despite the recession in the construction industry, affecting many parts of Europe. This has led to accusations that relationships between the large cement manufacturers has become too cosy. Critics of the industry contrast the stability of cement markets with the very sharp price falls which have occurred for other basic building materials. Companies, meanwhile, have complained to the Commission that Turkish, Romanian and Tunisian companies have been dumping cut-price cement in Spain, damaging the local market. Cement prices along the Mediterranean coast of Spain fell by 15 to 20 per between June and December last year. Moves by Ciments Francais to establish strategic alliances with cement manufacturers in Romania - possibly as a prelude to an acquisition - is regarded by some analysts as a defensive measure to prevent cheap Romanian cement from flowing into other European markets. Spain, Europe's fastest growing construction market during the 1980s, has been a very attractive market for European cement manufacturers both for its size and the availability of local companies which traditionally have been family controlled. Most of the leaders have Spanish subsidiaries. Ciments Francais last month offered Dollars 44m to acquire the outstanding 22 per cent it does not own of Cementos Rezola the biggest cement producer in the Basque region of Spain. Unifund, a relatively obscure Swiss-based holding company with cement interests in Asia and South America, has just taken out an option worth more than Dollars 700m to buy Sanson, Spain second-largest producer, from the Banesto banking group.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               ESTIMATED EUROPEAN CEMENT SALES IN 1992                    (excluding associate companies)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                   Tonnes     Works controlled in                              (m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Italcemenit/Ciment F.       27.0     Italy, France, Spain, Belgium,                                      Czechoslovakia, Greece Holderbank                  15.7     Switzerland, Germany, Belgium,                                      France, Spain, Hungary,                                      Czechoslovakia Lafarge Coppee              13.5     France, Germany, Spain,                                      Czechoslovakia.

The  seizure has alarmed all drug traffickers, mainly due to the  large sum of money involved. The cocaine consisted of 1,771  individual packages, which were camouflaged to resemble spools,  and was found in a warehouse in Maracay. Another 60 kg in 48  additional packages was found in a warehouse belonging to  Expriven Company in Guarenas. Finally, three more kg in six  packages were seized in an apartment in the Santa Cruz  neighborhood in Maracay.    [Begin recording] [PTJ Chief Orlando Jordan Petit] There are  some spools around which one can wrap anything, such as wires,  paper, and so on. A number of rolls, for lack of a better  description, of the drug were wrapped around it ...    [Gonzalez, interrupting] To make it resemble what, Chief?    [Jordan Petit] The idea is to place the drug there to make  it pass for the content of a spool, normally something else, any  other product. This is perhaps one method they used nationwide  to export the drug from Colombia and to distribute it  nationally. This was also perhaps the mechanism they were using  to ship it to the United States. [end recording]    The names of the six persons who were arrested are: Agustin  Leon, a Venezuelan businessman; (Minges de Leon Janit), an  American citizen and manager of Baduca Company; Pedro Julian  Rosas, a Venezuelan driver for Expriven Company; Erlis Delgado,  a Peruvian woman in charge of that company; Pedro Jose Rosas, an  employee; and Carlos Ordones, businessman and local drug  distributor.    [Begin Narcotics Division Chief Nerio Rengifo recording]  This  is one of the most important cases the PTJ, specifically the  Narcotics Division, has worked on. It is the result of long  months of hard work and follow-up and surveillance operations by  members of the division. Their investigation of a number of  companies with prior drug trafficking records in the United  States led us to identify its members, and later, led us to  discover and seize this large amount of cocaine. [end recording]    Thus, the Narcotics Division of the PTJ dealt a heavy blow  to  international drug trafficking. To finish dismantling this  organization four persons belonging to one family are also being  tracked down. They are Aurelio Carmelo, Ivan Mauricio, Harold,  and Nabal, all members of the Villamizar family. They carry  Colombian, Venezuelan, and U.S. identification documents.     "

People voted in large numbers to replace the communist-dominated parliament that has blocked economic reform, but pro-communist forces in the east secured resounding majorities in 'opinion polls' favouring closer ties with Moscow. Belying predictions of voter apathy, 75 per cent of the electorate turned out at polls across the nation, taking all 450 parliamentary districts past the necessary 50 per cent threshold. President Leonid Kravchuk's advisers had been counting on a low turnout, enabling them to declare the elections invalid and setting the stage for presidential rule. However, although the vote was a confusing one for many Ukrainians - with some ballots carrying more than two dozen names - initial returns showed new opposition faces emerging into the lead throughout the country. The requirement that candidates also secure more than 50 per cent of the vote to win a parliamentary seat saw 90 per cent of seats unfilled, however, pending a run-off election on April 10 between the two leading candidates in each district. 'For the most part, it looks like it'll be the new wave - democrats, businessmen - versus the old guard in the run-offs,' said Mr Roman Zwarycz of the independent Elections 94 press centre. However, Crimea, the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, and the Lugansk region on the Russian border ignored a presidential ban and held votes on closer ties with Russia, which threaten to create new federal problems for Mr Kravchuk. The Crimean president's administration said more than 80 per cent of the voters had endorsed a survey to form a special, more independent relationship with Kiev and allow Russian-Ukrainian dual citizenship. General Valery Kuznetsov, adviser to Crimean president Yuri Meshkov on military affairs, said that the survey, which Mr Kravchuk had outlawed, 'showed once again that Crimea does not want to be prevented from living as Crimeans want to live'. A similar survey in Donetsk showed that 90 per cent of the electorate favoured joining the CIS economic union, making Russian an official language and decentralising the Ukrainian state, according to a preliminary estimate . In the 47 seats filled by an outright majority in the first round, a number of high-profile national leaders secured seats, including Mr Ivan Plyushch, parliamentary chairman, and Mr Victor Pynzenik, a market economist and former government minister. Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister, who favoured closer relations with Russia in his campaign, and Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the opposition nationalist Rukh party, also won seats. 'These elections have been a positive event. The people have shown the political will to improve their country,' commented Mr Vladimir Averchev, a Russian MP observer for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. 'I didn't realise how disillusioned Ukrainians were with the current parliament.' He added: 'I think the second round will go through and Ukraine will have a real chance to head on the road to reforms.' Ukrainian living standards have fallen rapidly in recent months, with incomes eaten up by hyperinflation. However, the current Ukrainian parliament, dominated by former communists, has been opposed both to economic reform and to relinquishing the country's nuclear arsenal - a condition of much western economic support.

The sum is approximately the same as in the current  fiscal year. Commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov:    When this announcement was made, some congressmen asked  themselves the question whether the already planned program of  cuts in defense spending would be possible. The program  provides for reducing defense allocations by $120 billion within  the next five years. The congressmen began to analyze President  Clinton's words that the United States must not cut defense  further. They came to the conclusion that the adopted plan of  cuts in defense spending remains in force, and the word further  meant there would be no more cuts except those already planned.  Senator Sam Nunn reacted positively to the conclusion.    The most important thing is that the U.S. military budget is  least of all linked with the relations between Moscow and  Washington. Russia and the United States, the two great nuclear  powers, do not consider each other as an adversary. Cooperation  in the military field replaced confrontation. This showed  itself in the agreement on the reduction of strategic arms and  in the U.S. assistance in dismantling the Soviet nuclear  arsenal. The level of mutual understanding is characterized by  the recent agreement, under which Russian and American nuclear  missiles will not targeted at each other's territory or any  other country.    So what's the reason for Washington's intention to cut the  Pentagon's budget even more than it was previously planned?  This is obviously attributed to difficulties of the military  conversion process. There have been a number of reports in the  American media on behind-the-scenes activities of congressmen  from the military industrial regions.    New threats is probably another reason: These are regional  conflicts. John Murtha, chairman of the House of  Representatives Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, believes  the United States may face a dangerous conflict on the Korean  peninsula, a conflict even more dangerous than Haiti, Bosnia, or  Somalia. In the meantime, the Pentagon insists on a strategy  calling for a military force ready to fight two major regional  conflicts simultaneously.    According to the mass media, there is no unanimity in the  Congress to give up cuts in defense spending. According to  experts and research institutions in the United States, the end  of the cold war and military confrontation between Moscow and  Washington has created a unique chance to direct material  resources to civilian programs, the more so since regional  conflicts can hardly be compared with the threat to life on  earth.    That was a commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov.     "

What does a  person think about this who, in his capacity as head of the  government commission that awards licenses for the export and  import of arms, should have a sufficient overview?    [Gerinec] Each businessman tries to find a buyer and, once  he finds him, he tries to keep his name a secret because many  possibilities exist to jeopardize a potential deal. The  producer or seller, let alone the buyer, therefore prefers not  to speak. I believe that it has been positive for Slovakia thus  far that one was talking less in this regard, and doing more.    [Sporer] Doing? On the basis of the small amounts of spare  parts produced in our arms factories (about 5 percent of the  original production volume from the time before conversion) to  which the factory managers admit, this ""doing"" could not involve  large-scale deals?    [Gerinec] I agree. Besides, the sales have been restricted  to excess equipment from the arsenal of the Army of the Slovak  Republic, and these sales are gradually coming to an end, owing  to the available time frame, which is limited by international  agreements.    [Sporer] The state used to sell heavy weapons manufactured  in Slovakia through the Omnipol foreign trade company. This  company was and still is represented by people who now live in  the Czech Republic. These businessmen have contacts with  specific countries and, within these countries, with specific  customers. It is logical that, when an Arab client or another  customer used to conclude agreements on deliveries with someone  from Omnipol during a dinner, he will not turn to the prime  minister or the arms factory director with an order today, but  to the man with whom he once cooperated. Is the loss of Omnipol  a big loss?    [Gerinec] It represents not only a loss but, literally,  damage to Slovakia's interests. These people continue to work  for the benefit of those who pay them; their priority is to  conclude contracts for the benefit of their own  organization--that is, Omnipol. They trade in arms manufactured  in the Czech Republic, but, naturally, they also try to sell  weapons manufactured elsewhere. Business is business.  Naturally, they try to achieve the maximum financial profit for  Omnipol, also vis-a-vis our factories, for example. We are  trying to prevent this by means of the system we have created.  Only a Slovak firm or juridical person can trade in arms  commodities in Slovakia.    [Sporer] But cannot Omnipol still participate in business  transactions as a middleman?    [Gerinec] It could do so only through a Slovak firm that  would make the purchase for it. Omnipol could then sell the  merchandise to a third party.    [Sporer] The most ideal solution would perhaps be to enlist  people from Omnipol for a similar firm in Slovakia, or am I  wrong?    [Gerinec] Omnipol is a well-established organization. The  people working there have certain guarantees. Slovakia does not  avail itself of a similar organization that would be established  on world markets. Our businessmen who have acquired some  reputation in this branch tried to enlist them, in a way. But  the offer of something that could only be successful in the long  run was too little, compared with the guarantees they now have.    [Sporer] How do you evaluate, from this viewpoint, the  activity of Mr. Luhovy, for example, former minister of general  engineering and, before that, director general of the ZTS [Heavy  Engineering Works] economic production unit?    [Gerinec] As far as I know, Mr. Luhovy is involved in  business while being retired. He lives in Slovakia and wanted  to help Slovakia.    [Sporer] Was he rejected?    [Gerinec] No. Of course, the question is how such  assistance can be realized. I do not know how Mr. Luhovy is  doing. I am not in touch with him.    [Sporer] The Armex company was established in Slovakia  almost seven months ago, as an alternative to Omnipol. The  former government placed Vitazoslav Moric, honorary deputy  chairman of the Slovak National Party, at the head of this  company. Yet, to this day, Armex has not received a license  from your commission....    [Gerinec] It is difficult to comment on this issue because  Armex has not yet applied for a license. It apparently had a  reason not to apply.    [Sporer] What reason?    [Gerinec] The state retained 100-percent participation in  Armex. An organization made up of representatives of five  government departments was to be established, whose task was to  take upon itself trade issues and also to coordinate these  activities, if possible. The launching of Armex was linked to  the launching of production in arms factories. The problem is  that not even the basic prerequisites have been met--I am  thinking, among other things, of the experience and initiative  of the people involved--so this organization does not work. It  was perhaps exaggerated to expect more of the state officials  who were charged with this duty.    [Sporer] Is it within the government's jurisdiction to  resort in Armex to personnel changes, for example?    [Gerinec] Of course. The government established the  company, it appointed its director general, and it can even  dissolve Armex.    [Sporer] How many companies trade in arms in Slovakia?    [Gerinec] This question is difficult to answer because it is  a question of obtaining a permit [koncese] for sale, which is  awarded by the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic.  Once the ministry grants someone a permit to sell and purchase  arms commodities, he can ask the government's licensing  commission for a license to engage in this activity. However,  there are private businessmen who sell weapons only on the  territory of the Slovak Republic on the basis of a mere trade  license. If they restrict their sales to the territory of the  Slovak Republic, they need not be holders of a license from our  commission. I emphasize, however, that those who export or  import weapons must ask our commission for a license. Firms  trading in short hunting weapons make use of this possibility  most. However, a license can be requested even by a company  that mostly trades in other commodities and wants to engage in  arms trade as a supplementary activity.    [Sporer] People in the Martin and Dubnica arms factories  claim that, after conversion, Poles rushed into the territories  that have been vacated by Slovaks. Russians, too, are very  active. Moreover, the Czechs have set up the RDP [Research,  Development, Production] Group [holding of arms manufacturers]  and try to assert themselves with a modernized T-72 tank. What  chances are there for our heavy weaponry to return to its former  markets?    [Gerinec] It is true that the Poles, who have not carried  out any conversion, entered the vacated space. The Russians  have not stopped developing tanks and have already mastered the  production of tanks of the T-80 and T-90 ranges. Moreover, they  own a great mass of excess weaponry [that they must discard to  comply with international agreements]. It must be admitted that  we have never manufactured any new models, but well-established  models that we were able to ""show,"" so to speak. That is also  true of the T-72 tank. If we want to be successful, someone  will therefore have to invest in development.    [Sporer] Which ""someone""?    [Gerinec] A customer interested in the commencement of  production. It is customary abroad that this task is assumed by  the army of the country that owns arms production. The army  replaces its equipment, and trade with other countries gradually  receives a chance. The problem is that our Army's budget, no  matter how high it may seem in comparison with the budgets of  other government departments, simply does not allow the Army to  supplement its arsenal with new weaponry. Therefore, the Army  is not able to help set arms production in motion. It is a  different matter, of course, when a factory starts an innovation  program and reconstructs a tank turret, for example (which is  the case at the Dubnica arms factory), and finds for it  customers in armies equipped with T-72 tanks. It is up to the  managers of these arms factories to calculate whether such deals  are worthwhile.    [Sporer] There is talk about the state having lost tens of  billions of korunas as a result of conversion. Plainly  speaking, how can the arms factories cover this loss, in your  opinion?    [Gerinec] Their managements are in the best position to  answer this question. However, it would probably be  inappropriate for me to reply only that the annual turnover of  special production used to represent some 20 billion  Czechoslovak korunas. People from the Martin factory cite a  better example. They say that, when they produced and sold a  single tank, they made the same profit they make from the  production and sale of 40 tractors today.     "

Mr John Major, the UK's prime minister, yesterday delivered this blunt verdict on the future of the Ecu as Europe's single currency. If he is right, then the Ecu bond market could finally be consigned to oblivion after its faltering performance of recent weeks. The condition of the Ecu market this week has been as bad as at any time since Danish voters first punctured the politicians' optimism about European monetary union at the beginning of June. The French referendum - the event which only a fortnight ago was expected to determine the future of the market - has come and gone, and things are no better. Marketmakers continue to sit on large stocks of the bonds with no investors in sight. If anything, more institutions have taken to liquidating their Ecu bond holdings since the ERM crisis intensified a week ago. As a result, liquidity has disappeared. Apart from benchmark issues such as those from the French and UK governments, trading has ground to a halt, pushing up the yield on the less-liquid bonds. The yield on Denmark's 10-year Ecu bonds, for instance, was yesterday quoted at 35 basis points above the French Ecu OAT, compared with a difference of 5 to 10 basis spread in more normal times. The yield spread between German government bonds and the Ecu OAT speaks volumes about how far investors' sentiment has changed. Immediately ahead of the Danish referendum, the yield spread had narrowed to as little as 61 basis points. The Ecu bond at that time was yielding considerably less than its constituent currencies. The reason: investors hoped that when the EC reached its deadline for currency union, set by the Maastricht treaty at 1999 at the latest, some of the higher-yielding currencies would not have met the convergence criteria. As a result, when the Ecu became Europe's new single currency it would comprise only the 'core', low-yielding currencies, making it more valuable than the wider basket of all EC currencies. That process would effectively have reversed the sort of adjustment made to the Ecu basket in 1989, the most recent of the Ecu's five-yearly adjustments. At that time, the Spanish peseta was brought in with a 5 per cent weighting and the Portuguese escudo with 1 per cent - adding 40 basis points to the yield on Ecu bonds overnight. Since the Danish referendum, Ecu bonds yields have soared back above their theoretical yield, reaching a spread of 50 basis points this week. The spread over German government bonds has levelled out this week at around 180 basis points. The Ecu's hopes are now pinned on two possible outcomes to the current crisis, both of them seemingly remote. One is that the Maastricht treaty will survive the current upheaval, and that European currencies will restart the march to union. The other is that, if Maastricht dies, a new - and perhaps even more determined - rush to monetary union will develop with the D-Mark and French franc at its core. If the EC were to use the Ecu as its single currency for this more limited monetary union, then holders of Ecu bonds would make a large and unexpected gain. Such hopes still look far-fetched. Most analysts agree that such a limited currency union would adopt its own single currency, leaving the Ecu as simply a reference basket for a wider group of EC currencies. In that case, the Ecu would never return to the position centre-stage that it enjoyed until June this year. The result is in the hands of Europe's politicians - though Ecu investors seem already to have made up their minds.  The Financial Times   London Page 27  "

In its first report during the present parliament, the committee sets out plans for a four-year programme to monitor the effects - 'both positive and negative' - of last year's measures and next April's community care changes. Included in its plans are questions about what citizens are entitled to demand from the health service and what resources are necessary to meet those demands. The Commons committee's programme was announced in an interim report on NHS trusts, which have day-to-day managerial responsibility for their own affairs, published yesterday. It concluded that it 'remains difficult at this stage' to distinguish benefits of trust status from the wider effects of the NHS reforms and the impetus likely to arise from any management restructuring. Some early concerns about the impact of trust status - including potential loss of the benefit of strategic planning - might not be said to have been totally allayed, the report says. But it complains of a 'lack of clarity in the government's policy towards future investment in the NHS'. In addition, it suggests that difficulties might arise from dismantling the national framework for negotiating terms and conditions of employment, the committee reports. It also highlights questions of accountability and involvement of NHS users in consultation on allocation of financial resources. Publication of the report gave rise to immediate political disagreement. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, interpreted the health committee's report as putting added weight behind growing acceptance of trusts as the model of NHS organisation for the future. 'The fact that trusts represent the future of NHS provision makes it more important that any problems, some of which the select committee has identified, are properly addressed. I welcome debate on these issues,' she said. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the report showed that the government's reforms were leading to fragmentation of strategic planning, the further destruction of accountability and the development of a two-tier health service.

0,FT923-10172 ,"FT923-10172 _AN-CG4BOAFVFT 920731   FT  31 JUL 92 / Europe's satellite makers are knocked out of orbit: US manufacturers have been able to achieve economies of scale and undercut rivals across the Atlantic      By DANIEL GREEN   Europe's satellite manufacturers have been left languishing on the launch pad by US rivals which are establishing dominance over the rapidly expanding industry. Over the past 18 months, only two of 27 international civil telecommunications satellite contracts went to European contractors. In Europe's deregulated satellite television market, six new satellites have been ordered, all American. Abandoned by their customers, European companies are being forced to restructure. British Aerospace last month cut 600 jobs - about half the workforce - at its Stevenage satellite-manufacturing plant. This week, Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) said it was interested in acquiring the satellite division, which has not won a new order since last year. To succeed, Dasa will have to beat off Matra-Marconi, a joint venture between GEC of the UK and Matra of France which has stalked BAe's space business since last year. The Matra-Marconi alliance was itself created as a response to the 'growing intensity of competition in space markets', says Mr Richard Wignall, its deputy managing director. Dasa's German rival ANT, the space subsidiary of Bosch, has also been in talks to join forces with Matra-Marconi. But even a three-way alliance between BAe, Matra-Marconi and ANT would be only half the size of Hughes Aircraft, the General Motors subsidiary that is the world's biggest telecommunications satellite maker. Even France, Europe's leader in space industries, has felt the pressure. Alcatel invested between Dollars 30m and Dollars 50m (Pounds 15.7m-Pounds 26m) over the past three years in a new telecommunications technology - very small aperture terminals (VSATs), which reduce the size of dish needed for satellite communications. Earlier this year it abandoned the project, blaming US competition. Alcatel now plans to market VSATs made by Hughes. The divergent fortunes on either side of the Atlantic are largely the result of US military spending and other government contracts. This has provided a stream of orders and allowed US satellite makers to achieve economies of scale. They have thus been able to undercut European rivals by up to 40 per cent in contract tenders. The size of the US industry and the importance of defence expenditure is clear in 'Aerospace Alley', an area surrounding the offices of the United States Air Force Space Systems Division in El Segundo, central Los Angeles. The division is devoted to procurement and has an annual budget of more than Dollars 7bn. Total US government space spending is four times that figure, and six times the combined amount spent by Europe's governments. Big money in US defence has created big companies. Hughes Aircraft, one of El Segundo's defence contractors, employs about 9,000 people working on a satellite order book worth about Dollars 3bn. It has the world's only mass production line for telecommunications satellites. The defence contracts which fuelled the growth of Hughes and its El Segundo neighbours have so far remained secure in spite of cuts in US defence spending. In particular, long-term projects - such as the Defence Department's 24-satellite Global Positioning System which allowed General Norman Schwarzkopf to navigate across a featureless desert in the Gulf war last year - are yet to be completed. Fears of a decline in military contracts however, have, pushed US manufacturers into the civil sector. 'Four years ago, we did 85 per cent of our business with US government agencies,' says Mr Steve Dorfman, president of Hughes Aircraft's Space Systems division. 'Now it is nearer 50-50.' This shift is visible across the US industry. TRW, another El Segundo satellite manufacturer, with annual sales of Dollars 3bn, is proposing to build a 12-satellite global mobile telephone network. Motorola, the electronics and cellular telephone company, plans to put 77 miniature satellites into orbit to provide a similar service. The US manufacturers' move into the civil sector is well timed. More civil satellite contracts are going to open tender and are not restricted to domestic manufacturers. The world market for civil telecommunications satellites, for example, worth about Dollars 8bn in the 1980s, will almost double in the next decade, says Euroconsult, the Paris-based space consultancy Over the next few years, the biggest buyers on the open market are likely to be the international communications co-operatives, Intelsat, Inmarsat and Eutelsat. These organisations, owned by national telecommunications bodies such as British Telecom, Deutsche Bundespost and ATT, provide most of the world's satellite telecommunications links. They owe no national allegiances, and are free to buy from anyone. European manufacturers fear that this freedom will result in more orders for US rivals. In response they are demanding protective measures. Eurospace, their trade association, has called for a 'comprehensive, collective space policy' in Europe to help 'resist foreign domination'. It seeks preferential treatment in international tenders from European satellite buyers. But protection is unlikely to provide a solution. Import controls are out of the question because satellites do not legally cross any frontiers. Even if such a policy could be enforced, international telecommunications co-operatives remain free from obligations to buy from particular suppliers. European satellite makers can rely on a trickle of orders from their own governments. BAe, for example, is expecting to win a Ministry of Defence contract for the Skynet IV military communications satellite. And there would still be some subcontracting work for US-based companies: Inmarsat's latest generation of satellites is being built by GE-Astro of the US with Matra-Marconi making the radio equipment. But for Europe's satellite industry this is survival in the second division and, in an industry where size is increasingly what counts, probably unsustainable. The response from senior executives in many European satellite companies is to seek co-operation and alliances with their American rivals. Some deals have already been struck. Alcatel and Aerospatiale of France, together with Alenia of Italy, last year paid Dollars 182m for a 49 per cent stake in Space Systems/Loral, the commercial satellite business of defence contractor Loral, the third-biggest US satellite maker. Last month, Dasa, the aerospace arm of Daimler Benz of Germany, paid Dollars 57m for its own 12 per cent stake in Space Systems/Loral. More alliances are likely to be formed over the next few years as European companies fight for a share of the growing market. For Mr Olof Lundberg, director-general of Inmarsat, they have little choice. 'In Europe, there is clearly too much satellite manufacturing capacity. A restructuring is inevitable,' he says.

0,FT922-12153 ,"FT922-12153 _AN-CDVA7AAEFT 920422   FT  22 APR 92 / An Ecu for Europe's poor: Delors wants to put poverty higher on the agenda      By ALAN PIKE   THE EUROPEAN Community's leading anti-poverty programme has a budget of Ecu55m (Pounds 38.6m), about one Ecu for each of the 50m-plus deprived people estimated to be living in EC countries. The EC's Poverty 3 programme is consuming its Ecu55m over five years, reducing annual expenditure to around one-fifth of an Ecu per poor person. This is, European Commission officials admit, a pitifully poor sum to be devoting to one of the most challenging social issues of the day. Both in the commission and among anti-poverty organisations, however, a wish is growing for the EC to become more involved in promoting measures to support Europe's disadvantaged citizens. Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, intends to produce a document on poverty and social exclusion aimed, first, at increasing political and public awareness of the issues and eventually establishing a charter of rights. Mr Delors admitted at a conference in Brussels this month that the fight against poverty is an area where the EC has little to boast about. National governments still took the view that 'each parish has its poor people' and did not want the next parish, much less the commission, involved. But he voiced a willingness to use the commission's influence to help lift issues of social exclusion and disadvantage to a higher point on Europe's political agenda. Poverty was a cumulative process, said Mr Delors, and 'if it takes place against a backdrop of indifference in society, at some stage the problem will become intractable.' Definitions of poverty are themselves the subject of frequent disagreement. Current EC estimates that some 50m of its population - 15 per cent of the total - live in poverty are based on a calculation of the number of people receiving less than half the average income in the country where they live. Some politicians would argue with this definition but Mr Wim Van Velzen, president of the European Parliament's social affairs committee, says that on the same basis 30m people were in poverty in 1978. In spite of economic growth and aid to less developed regions, the proportion of poor people in Europe has grown each year. This arises largely from the consequences of industrial restructuring and long-term unemployment, factors which have also helped change the nature of 'typical' west European poverty. Once traditionally associated with such groups as the elderly, it is now far more likely to afflict younger, unemployed families and single parents. The concept of what is meant by poverty is also changing - the phrase 'social exclusion' is increasingly used to indicate that poor people lack not only money but access to a range of other services and opportunities. Notions of poverty being about more than shortage of money have gained strength since the mid-1980s when Faith in the City, the Church of England's influential report on urban areas, described it as being about 'how people are treated and how they regard themselves; about powerlessness, exclusion and loss of dignity'. Some welfare campaigners are concerned that if this view is carried too far, however, the link with lack of money may be lost to such an extent that poor individuals are seen by others as being responsible for their own plight. 'It is right to talk about exclusion but poverty is still about money,' says Mr Quintin Oliver, president of the European Anti-Poverty Network which co-ordinates the work of the voluntary sector. 'It is caused by lack of money, and money helps solve many of the problems.' In late 1990 the EC set up a support group of independent specialists to examine the prospects for developing a European strategy to fight poverty and social exclusion. The group has concluded that the EC has a substantial and potentially useful part to play 'despite its meagre resources for direct action'. Although local projects funded by the EC were unlikely to add up to an effective policy for fighting poverty, they should continue as a means of supporting innovative approaches and exchanging information. The group recommends that the commission produce an annual report on the state of human development in the EC, enabling the social consequences of development to be measured alongside economic ones. Rising EC interest in the problems of poverty and social exclusion reflects fear about the potential consequences of leaving a large section of Europe's population living outside the mainstream, particularly at a time when extreme-right political parties have been gaining ground in some EC countries. Time may be short. The support group's report warns of a 'veritable explosion' for society, with parts of large towns tending to become urban ghettos for marginalised people where 'moonlighting, fraud, delinquency, prostitution and drug-trafficking seem infinitely more remunerative than all the benefits that could possibly be paid out by the welfare system.'

0,FT923-6493 ,"FT923-6493 _AN-CHZBBACTFT 920824   FT  24 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: European car market   Ford's decision to put its UK plants on short-time working is partly a reflection of the poor state of the British economy. But the move also says something about the weak state of Europe as a whole. Last year car manufacturers were relatively sanguine about depressed sales in Britain and France, because post-unification Germany was growing rapidly. This year Germany was expected to slow, with Britain, France and Spain taking up the slack. Germany, however, has now turned down sharply but the British and French markets at least remain stubbornly depressed. Excess capacity has a double impact on Europe's carmakers. German groups could comfortably sell much of their output at home last year, so had little need to chase market share elsewhere. That has now changed. Price competition was also subdued in markets outside Germany while non-German manufacturers could divert production to the German market. Now the worry is that German manufacturers will compete aggressively for a bigger share of export markets, sparking price wars. Manufacturers with dated or unpopular models - like Fiat and to some extent Ford - are likely to be hit hardest. Shares of Europe's carmakers have already fallen in anticipation of extra margin pressure. But there are still worries about the high labour costs of German manufacturers. While much of German industry can ease such costs by high productivity, carmaking technology is increasingly easy to transfer. Companies such as General Motors now find it cheaper to make a Cavalier in Britain rather than Germany, a problem exacerbated by the strength of the D-Mark. The problem is even greater for component makers. The tradition of German carmakers buying from German component manufacturers is being challenged because UK manufacturers now have a significant price advantage. Lucas, TN and GKN have all made gains in market share, and the opening of Japanese transplants will help further. In the short term cyclical pressure may depress profits, but further out Britain's component manufacturers look well placed.  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "

Arriving in Miami, an immigration department agent -- after  looking through the passenger's passport and consulting the  computer -- asked him to wait, ordered a customs personnel to  bring his suitcases and invited him to a nearby office. The  visitor, somewhat alarmed, asked: ""What is wrong?"" The custom  official explained: ""Your name coincides with that of another  person who appears on the screen. Moreover, he is your age --  the custom official complicated matters even more so -- and he  is registered as a drug trafficker."" The foreign visitor  indignant, surprised, and desperate protested: ""That cannot be.""  He complained: ""I was president of the Republic and fought drug  trafficking with the U.S. Government's cooperation. Let me  phone the U.S. ambassador in my country.""    The former president managed to get through: ""Ambassador, I  am being delayed here in Miami because the computer registers a  drug trafficker with my name."" He explained his problem  sounding rather terrified. The ambassador confirms: ""Yes, they  have informed me that your name appears in the computer. It is  a computer problem."" The ambassador promises to do his best,  saying: ""We will resolve the problem.""    It is said that finally after 40 minutes, or after some 90  minutes according to more exaggerated witness reports, the  former president was able to comply with the immigration red  tape and visit the United States under the uneasy impression  that the incident, caused by who knows what, was a warning.    This anecdote is an example of the political language of  ""demonstrations,"" like military maneuvers, street  demonstrations, cabinet changes, retirements, etc., whose goals  -- which exceed their disclosed purposes -- are uncovered,  sometimes correctly and others erroneously, through analysis or  speculation.    The case of the former president delayed by an immigration  agent reminds us of the unfulfilled promises General Andres  Rodriguez -- who perfectly fits the antihero in the anecdote --  made to the U.S. Government about handing over the protectors of  drug trafficking and dismantling their infrastructure.    If for the political process the transition meant building  the legal framework of democracy to assure the free action of  the political institutions and elect -- based on these  conditions -- the first civilian president, for the U.S.  Government it also meant eliminating the protection system for  drug traffickers.    The United States was especially concerned about this  because  the transition process was begun by a totally corrupt Armed  Forces whose rebellious commander presided over the Executive  Branch. The proposal to ""dignify"" the Armed Forces by the  rebels was not restricted merely, under the terms of the U.S.  aid for the new government, to prohibiting military men from  engaging in partisan activities, eradicating illegal activities  in general, and controlling the misuse and draining of state  resources, but specifically to the handing over of those who  protect traffickers.    The concern was and is very logical. U.S. experts wonder if  military men are capable of dignifying the Armed Forces. Who  will cast the first stone? Who is clean enough of any charges,  of any links, or of protecting anyone to cast the first stone?  More than four years of transition government have elapsed and  the strategists received the expected answer: The process to  dignify the Armed Forces failed -- we have the disastrous  example of Colonel Gonzalez Rojas, or the replacement of General  Bernal who at the time was defense minister, or the dismantling  of the Antinarcotics Secretariat's leadership which greatly  upset the United States; Rodriguez was supposed to have cast the  first stone, but did not, he never did; and, finally, most of  the members of the high command were and are trapped by links  related to commitments and protection.    The responsibility for throwing the great quantity of  stones that should have been cast was transferred to [President  Juan Carlos] Wasmosy. Yes, to a civilian government, but under  the vertical domain regarding military issues of a very  ambitious general. The situation remains unchanged: The process  to dignify the Armed Forces continues in the hands of the Armed  Forces, but the difference is that it now has the ludicrous  facade of a civilian government.    So, in view of the careful protection granted from high  spheres to traffickers -- detected and monitored by U.S.  intelligence -- it was decided to materialize a plan under which  U.S. Southern Command servicemen based in Panama would build  schools, water wells, health posts, and repair roads in San  Pedro Department as ""training for the shipment of construction  material for future actions similar to the Persian Gulf War,"" as  Ambassador Glassman explained on one occasion. Who says this  project has concealed objectives? The message is clear and  direct: One typical ""demonstration"" that the U.S. troops  sometime use, when justified, is to carry out a ""Persian  Gulf-type"" intervention in Paraguayan territory.    Everyone understood the message of the ""demonstration"" of  the  military social actions. The less discreet commented that  ""there are concealed purposes,"" without understanding the  opportuneness of the maneuver.    ""There are no concealed purposes and it will benefit the  country,"" commented others with a sense of opportuneness, thus  supporting the opportunity to pressure the protectors and  allowing the Armed Forces to become dignified and overcome the  dispute the opposition maintains with the ambitious general.  For the first time most opposition legislators applauded the  arrival of U.S. troops and were willing to grant them all the  privileges and immunity requested, because they have interpreted  the ""demonstration.""    Undoubtedly some ambitious general assumed the role of  protector, took it personally, and overcame Wasmosy's first  impression that the South Command's offer was beneficial. So,  on Wednesday, 2 February, a letter of conditions was sent to  Ambassador Glassman, which he was made to sign. According to  the letter, the Paraguayan Army was to participate in the joint  actions, that the cost of the project had to be clearly  established -- Congress having approved the project it should be  noted that this plan affects the nation's sovereign rights --  the operation zones must be restricted, the importation of  weapons restricted, detailed information of the U.S. personnel  to enter the country should be disclosed, and that it should be  clearly established whom will be granted privileges and  immunity. Wasmosy and his subordinates have again picked up the  old yankee anti-imperialist wave.    This never crossed Southern Command's mind. Glassman, taken  aback by the offense, commented that ""similar offers to other  Latin American countries were never rejected."" General Oviedo,  as a champion of the national liberation, on Thursday, 3  February, asked journalists: ""Do you think we would reject  something that benefits the Armed Forces?"" Military strategists  read between lines: ""The interests of the protectors?"" The  almost dramatic answer was: ""We have withdrawn the draft bill,  but beware the consequences."" Watch out.    That same evening a cable television channel showed a  documentary on U.S. military operations in Panama when Noriega  was arrested. Was that mere coincidence or another  ""demonstration""?

Arriving in Miami, an immigration department agent -- after  looking through the passenger's passport and consulting the  computer -- asked him to wait, ordered a customs personnel to  bring his suitcases and invited him to a nearby office. The  visitor, somewhat alarmed, asked: ""What is wrong?"" The custom  official explained: ""Your name coincides with that of another  person who appears on the screen. Moreover, he is your age --  the custom official complicated matters even more so -- and he  is registered as a drug trafficker."" The foreign visitor  indignant, surprised, and desperate protested: ""That cannot be.""  He complained: ""I was president of the Republic and fought drug  trafficking with the U.S. Government's cooperation. Let me  phone the U.S. ambassador in my country.""    The former president managed to get through: ""Ambassador, I  am being delayed here in Miami because the computer registers a  drug trafficker with my name."" He explained his problem  sounding rather terrified. The ambassador confirms: ""Yes, they  have informed me that your name appears in the computer. It is  a computer problem."" The ambassador promises to do his best,  saying: ""We will resolve the problem.""    It is said that finally after 40 minutes, or after some 90  minutes according to more exaggerated witness reports, the  former president was able to comply with the immigration red  tape and visit the United States under the uneasy impression  that the incident, caused by who knows what, was a warning.    This anecdote is an example of the political language of  ""demonstrations,"" like military maneuvers, street  demonstrations, cabinet changes, retirements, etc., whose goals  -- which exceed their disclosed purposes -- are uncovered,  sometimes correctly and others erroneously, through analysis or  speculation.    The case of the former president delayed by an immigration  agent reminds us of the unfulfilled promises General Andres  Rodriguez -- who perfectly fits the antihero in the anecdote --  made to the U.S. Government about handing over the protectors of  drug trafficking and dismantling their infrastructure.    If for the political process the transition meant building  the legal framework of democracy to assure the free action of  the political institutions and elect -- based on these  conditions -- the first civilian president, for the U.S.  Government it also meant eliminating the protection system for  drug traffickers.    The United States was especially concerned about this  because  the transition process was begun by a totally corrupt Armed  Forces whose rebellious commander presided over the Executive  Branch. The proposal to ""dignify"" the Armed Forces by the  rebels was not restricted merely, under the terms of the U.S.  aid for the new government, to prohibiting military men from  engaging in partisan activities, eradicating illegal activities  in general, and controlling the misuse and draining of state  resources, but specifically to the handing over of those who  protect traffickers.    The concern was and is very logical. U.S. experts wonder if  military men are capable of dignifying the Armed Forces. Who  will cast the first stone? Who is clean enough of any charges,  of any links, or of protecting anyone to cast the first stone?  More than four years of transition government have elapsed and  the strategists received the expected answer: The process to  dignify the Armed Forces failed -- we have the disastrous  example of Colonel Gonzalez Rojas, or the replacement of General  Bernal who at the time was defense minister, or the dismantling  of the Antinarcotics Secretariat's leadership which greatly  upset the United States; Rodriguez was supposed to have cast the  first stone, but did not, he never did; and, finally, most of  the members of the high command were and are trapped by links  related to commitments and protection.    The responsibility for throwing the great quantity of  stones that should have been cast was transferred to [President  Juan Carlos] Wasmosy. Yes, to a civilian government, but under  the vertical domain regarding military issues of a very  ambitious general. The situation remains unchanged: The process  to dignify the Armed Forces continues in the hands of the Armed  Forces, but the difference is that it now has the ludicrous  facade of a civilian government.    So, in view of the careful protection granted from high  spheres to traffickers -- detected and monitored by U.S.  intelligence -- it was decided to materialize a plan under which  U.S. Southern Command servicemen based in Panama would build  schools, water wells, health posts, and repair roads in San  Pedro Department as ""training for the shipment of construction  material for future actions similar to the Persian Gulf War,"" as  Ambassador Glassman explained on one occasion. Who says this  project has concealed objectives? The message is clear and  direct: One typical ""demonstration"" that the U.S. troops  sometime use, when justified, is to carry out a ""Persian  Gulf-type"" intervention in Paraguayan territory.    Everyone understood the message of the ""demonstration"" of  the  military social actions. The less discreet commented that  ""there are concealed purposes,"" without understanding the  opportuneness of the maneuver.    ""There are no concealed purposes and it will benefit the  country,"" commented others with a sense of opportuneness, thus  supporting the opportunity to pressure the protectors and  allowing the Armed Forces to become dignified and overcome the  dispute the opposition maintains with the ambitious general.  For the first time most opposition legislators applauded the  arrival of U.S. troops and were willing to grant them all the  privileges and immunity requested, because they have interpreted  the ""demonstration.""    Undoubtedly some ambitious general assumed the role of  protector, took it personally, and overcame Wasmosy's first  impression that the South Command's offer was beneficial. So,  on Wednesday, 2 February, a letter of conditions was sent to  Ambassador Glassman, which he was made to sign. According to  the letter, the Paraguayan Army was to participate in the joint  actions, that the cost of the project had to be clearly  established -- Congress having approved the project it should be  noted that this plan affects the nation's sovereign rights --  the operation zones must be restricted, the importation of  weapons restricted, detailed information of the U.S. personnel  to enter the country should be disclosed, and that it should be  clearly established whom will be granted privileges and  immunity. Wasmosy and his subordinates have again picked up the  old yankee anti-imperialist wave.    This never crossed Southern Command's mind. Glassman, taken  aback by the offense, commented that ""similar offers to other  Latin American countries were never rejected."" General Oviedo,  as a champion of the national liberation, on Thursday, 3  February, asked journalists: ""Do you think we would reject  something that benefits the Armed Forces?"" Military strategists  read between lines: ""The interests of the protectors?"" The  almost dramatic answer was: ""We have withdrawn the draft bill,  but beware the consequences."" Watch out.    That same evening a cable television channel showed a  documentary on U.S. military operations in Panama when Noriega  was arrested. Was that mere coincidence or another  ""demonstration""?    One can expect anything if this relationship between the  United States and the military leadership continues to be simply  horrible.

Can they  reasonably form the subject of a pact?    [Hurd] First, I would like to stress that the initiative  taken by Mr. Balladur is positive. Of course, it is appropriate  to examine all aspects of it. However, it must not lead to the  creation of a new world machinery. There are already enough  international meetings as it is. But, if it is possible to  prevent possible antagonism in Central and East Europe through  diplomacy, then it is worth the effort.    [Duplouich] Is this the right way of establishing a new  peaceful order in Europe?    [Hurd] Let us look at things in practice. Look at what is  happening in the Balkans and further east, in Crimea, for  instance. These are dangerous situations which may deteriorate  if no preventive action is taken. And another Bosnia could then  appear. It is therefore reasonable to invite all those primarily  concerned by a potential conflict to solve their differences  before they reach a critical threshold. This is the very  concept of the Pact for Security and Stability, and it is a good  concept. The problem is how to translate it into procedure.    [Duplouich] Russia has finally agreed to sign the  Partnership for Peace unconditionally. What is your view of  this promise?    [Hurd] I warmly welcome the Russian decision. This idea of  a partnership which will create links between Russia and NATO is  really very ingenious.    [Duplouich] But is there not reason to be worried when it  defense minister, General Grachev, publicly states: ""The CIS is  Russia!""?    [Hurd] I recently spoke with Gen. Pavel Grachev and I do not  recognize this statement which is attributed to him. No, Russia  accepts the sovereignty of its neighbors. Of course, it has a  special interest in its relations with them, and the  international community recognizes that. But this interest must  be demonstrated in the sphere of international law. Andrey  Kozyrev, my Russian counterpart, accepts, for instance, that the  peacekeeping interventions in the neighboring states must be  organized at the request of the states themselves and not  unilaterally decided by Moscow.    No Justification for Europessimism    [Duplouich] At present Europe is also about the renewal of  the Strasbourg Parliament. This is an election which is being  prepared amid virtually universal indifference. What is the  reason for this apathy?    [Hurd] The European Twelve continue to enjoy a prosperity  and stability which grateful future generations will admire.  The Union is now emerging from the recession. I therefore see  no justification for gloom or pessimism.    [Duplouich] The fact remains that the one feeling which is  shared by the Europeans is disillusionment.    [Hurd] Allow me to qualify that: There is disillusionment  with all those who promise too much in Europe's name! The  lesson is clear: We must beware of promising too much. With  the Maastricht Treaty, we have a good structure. We must now  build its success brick by brick on the three pillars on which  it rests: common foreign and security policy; cooperation on  crime, drugs, and terrorism; implementation of subsidiarity,  respect for strict budgetary discipline; and completion of the  single market. Let us avoid thinking of a new structure before  we have completed the other.    [Duplouich] So, is a pause vital?    [Hurd] One of Europe's weaknesses, when faced with  criticism, has always been to go further, to ""do more."" What the  Europeans want is not for us to do ""more!"" It is to do better  what is already being done. [passage omitted]     "

Responding to a statement from Mr Bob McMullan, Australian trade minister, who said on Sunday there was a better than 50-50 chance of an agreement, Mrs Rafidah said: 'I don't know that. Many countries do not subscribe to an Apec free trade agreement, not just Malaysia.' Mr McMullan said that despite differences on the pace of change within the 17-member Apec forum, leaders at the November 15 meeting would agree on a free trade initiat ive. 'My view is that the odds are better than 50-50 that we will get some agreement,' he said on television after attending an Apec trade ministers' meeting in Indonesia last week. Mrs Rafidah said even if an agreement was hammered out it would just be an 'academic exercise'. 'As I understand it, Apec operates on the basis of consensus,' she said. 'That means no country can be bound by anything that Apec decides. So this (trade agreement) would be just an academic exercise.' She said Malaysia preferred to realise free trade goals through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). 'We have, in fact, ratified Gatt, but many other countries in Apec, including the US, especially the US, have not,' Mrs Rafidah said. 'How can you you talk about free trade in Apec when you can't fulfil your obligations under Gatt?' She reiterated Malaysia's position that Apec should be a consultative forum focusing on trade facilitation, technology transfer and human resource management. Mr McMullan said that if the leaders agreed to a goal of 2020 for free trade in the Asia-Pacific region, as suggested by Apec's eminent persons group, it would be an historic achievement. However, the actual date was not important. 'I think that once the process starts it is almost certain that it will accelerate,' Mr McMullan said. The eminent persons group has suggested a timeframe which staggers dismantling trade barriers between 2000 and 2020 depending on whether a country's economy is developed, industrialising or developing. Australia, the US, Singapore and Indonesia favour fast-tracking trade liberalisation in the region, while Japan, along with Malaysia, have expressed some reservations at the pace of change and the formal development of Apec.

Looking at the sea through a window of the meeting hall, Mr.  Lamassoure said that the seascape reminded him of the Atlantic  coast of France. There the sea is rough but the land tranquil.  Here the sea is calm but the land restless. Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur has therefore asked him to visit the Baltic  states in precisely this situation which has evolved after the  elections in Russia. The elections brought about insecurity, to  a certain extent even threats to the Baltic states, therefore,  (?the minister said), France expresses support for Latvia.    Speaking about relations with the European Union, Alain  Lamassoure stressed that France and Germany are in favor of  Latvia becoming an associate member of that organization. He  indicated that France fully supports Latvia's demand for the  unconditional withdrawal of the Russian army, because Latvia is  a sovereign state.    An acceptable timescale should be laid down for the  dismantling of the Skrunda radar station; this has nothing to do  with the Russian community in Latvia.    President Guntis Ulmanis emphasized the security issue in  Latvia and all the Baltic states, which has come to the fore due  to the events of recent days. (?Therefore), the cooperation  which has already started with France is of special significance  for strengthening the Latvian defense forces.    Alain Lamassoure reported that he will confer with the  French  defense minister within the next few days to prepare a document  for signing on cooperation between the two countries in the  sphere of defense.    Speaking about the NATO Partnership for Peace plan and  Latvia's involvement in this program, the minister noted that  for countries which are not NATO member states this offers the  possibility for obtaining new security guarantees.    Touching on the issue of minorities, the French minister  stressed that if the Latvian Government relies on  recommendations made by the CSCE, France will be able to render  more palpable support.    At the end of the meeting the president recalled that France  has not yet resolved the issue of the Latvian Embassy. The  minister replied that action would begin quite soon to get out  of the deadlock.    Alain Lamassoure handed to Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs a letter from French Prime Minister Eduard Balladur with  an invitation to visit the French capital in the near future.  During the talks Mr. Birkavs stressed that Latvian security has  become the main priority of state policy and expressed support  for the draft of the European stability pact worked out by the  French prime minister.

According to estimates by the Directorate, the gang sends to  Colombia 1,000 kg of cocaine and 20 tons of cocaine base per  month.    Margarita Cachique Rivera, her father, and her brothers are  wanted by the Seventh Court and by the 30th Lima Court on drug  trafficking charges.

She was captured last Sunday, in the evening, in the  vicinity  of Alameda Premio Real Avenue, in block J, lot 16, of the La  Encantada neighborhood in Chorrillos. She was carrying neither  arms nor drugs, and did not resist arrest.

That means larger, heavier implements at both ends, and hence heavier engine blocks and transmission cases to carry the load. But, with the conventional block design of a tractor, this leads to a disproportionate increase in the overall weight, raising energy consumption and soil compaction. Deere, the big US tractor group, is now tackling the problem with its new 6000 and 7000 Series tractors, which incorporate an independent steel frame that forms the tractor's structural backbone.

'We have taken a quantum leap towards bringing the countries of east and central Europe into the European Union and it is for me personally a cause of great satisfaction and pride that we have been able to do so,' he said. Two days after learning that the prize task of negotiating Europe's enlargement to the east had been lopped off his Brussels portfolio, the smarting commissioner took the opportunity of an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg - attended by ministers from six east European countries - to sum up the great strides taken since Berlin's wall was knocked down.

But in spite of his evident irritation and disappointment, Sir Leon held fire and did not announce a resignation. Evidently friends, supporters and most especially the British government - horrified at the prospect of further domestic turmoil over Europe - had been to work on him. As Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, put it: 'I am extremely glad that he has decided to stay on in the Commission.' Sir Leon himself was putting on a brave face: 'After the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt negotiation, I turned myself increasingly to the affairs of eastern and central Europe of the former Soviet Union, so I was naturally disappointed,' he said. 'But I have received messages from governments asking me to stay on,' he said. 'The portfolio I have been offered does represent an important and major challenge. . . I am under no illusion about the magnitude of that task.' Mr Hurd and Sir Leon himself were not the only people praising the former conservative MP's two-year efforts as commissioner responsible for central and eastern Europe. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said: 'I have thanked Sir Leon for the excellent work done in producing a strategy paper which has in part prepared the way for accession.' There were diplomatic words, too, from the Polish foreign minister, Mr Andrezj Olechowski. 'We were very pleased with the work done by Sir Leon. We think he was, and continues to be, convinced about the future membership of our country and has done a great deal of work and made much contribution,' he said. But as he tactfully put it, the east Europeans were not losing a friend as a result of Mr Jacques Santer's division of labour, they were merely gaining a new one. 'We have no reason to think the new commissioner will not be as enthusiastic and able as the other.' Sir Leon is not a stranger to controversial, news-shattering resignations following his role in the Westland helicopter dispute of the Thatcher government. Yesterday he took unkindly to suggestions that he should have acted more decisively this time round. 'Maybe you have always found it easy to make big personal decisions,' he snapped at one journalist. 'Not everybody is in that happy situation.'

Every year, the EU Court of Auditors chronicles waste and chicanery in the spending of official funds and urges the European Commission to sharpen its controls. Every year, the Commission promises to crack down and recoup missing money. Meanwhile, large-scale abuse of the budget - especially of farm subsidies - continues unabated. This view may be a caricature, but it is sufficiently well established in the minds of European citizens to have become a blot on the EU's credibility. As pressure on the budget grows and the dismantling of borders within the Union provides increased opportunities for fraud, the problem can only intensify. More clearly needs to be done to tighten monitoring of the effectiveness with which taxpayers' money is spent. Fortunately, there are signs that the Commission and at least some member states are showing greater attentiveness to the issue. This week, Mr Peter Schmidhuber, EU budget commissioner, will unveil plans to step up the fight against fraud, with additional Commission staff devoted to the task, improved procedures for co-operation with national judicial and police authorities, and more extensive sanctions against wrongdoers. Separately, the British government will today put forward its own ideas, including a proposal that fraud against the EU budget be made a criminal offence across the Union, as is fraud against national budgets. These are steps in the right direction, but they do not demonstrate that the Union is treating the issue with quite the seriousness it deserves. It is far from sure that the Council of Ministers will unanimously back the British initiative. Nor can member governments be counted on to give the Commission the assistance it needs, especially when it comes to extending scrutiny from the agricultural budget to structural funds, often, perhaps unfairly, criticised for fostering corruption in the Union's poorer regions. Moreover, the suspicion persists that the Commission is running behind the issue rather than giving a lead. This week it has come in for withering criticism from the EU auditors for restricting their inquiries and behaving as if particular problems were isolated 'accidents'. It should be clear by now that various EU programmes offer opportunities for systematic fraud. The Commission can set an example in combating it by showing more systematic transparency to those with the job of monitoring its activities.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

0,FT931-4112 ,"FT931-4112 _AN-DCLBZAC3FT 930312   FT  12 MAR 93 / Technology: A freer flow of goods - How trucks of the future could transform freight delivery on Europe's congested roads      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Some shoppers travel across town in search of a favourite food item, but this is nothing compared with the distances the goods have to travel to reach the shelves. It is estimated the contents of the average weekend shopper's supermarket trolley have already covered 4,000km by truck or van. With freight volumes set to soar on Europe's already congested roads - the EC forecasts that the volume of freight on EC roads will reach 16.5bn tonnes by 2010, nearly double the 1989 level - truck makers are pushing for heavier trucks to be allowed on long-distance routes. They argue that a rise to vehicles of 48 tonnes or more from the 40 tonnes permitted at present would mean fewer journeys and thus a smaller number of trucks. Manufacturers have made considerable progress in increasing vehicles' carrying capacity through new designs and the use of lighter materials. But the problem goes beyond advances in truck design and raises questions about the way in which freight transport is organised on Europe's increasingly congested roads. For coming decades, some far-sighted executives argue that new types of truck must be developed to cut down on congestion and exhaust emissions. Prominent among them is Cor Baan, whose main energies in recent weeks have been devoted to helping stave off financial collapse, since he is chairman of Daf trucks. He also heads the new Daf company created with Dutch and Belgian backing. Baan has been thinking along lines which lead a long way from Daf's present troubles. In his view, the trucks of the future would have hybrid diesel-electric engines and all-wheel steering. They would be quiet and flexible enough to deliver standardised 'modules' of all types of goods to city stores and other urban businesses through the night, using automated reception and storage systems which would require no manning. These would complement larger trucks transporting goods across the EC. Urban goods movement is the area where the biggest problems occur due to congestion, smog and excessive noise, stresses Baan, who gave his views at a recent commercial vehicle symposium organised in Brussels by FEBIAC, Belgium's motor industry trade association. 'With road transport organised as it is at present, can you imagine a further growth of tens of per cent in transport volumes in and around cities such as Paris, Frankfurt or London,' he asks. In the small Dutch city of Maastricht, for example, with 116,000 inhabitants, some 5,200 consignments are delivered daily, of which more than 70 per cent take up less than one cubic metre. About 3,800 journeys are made, totalling 38,000km. Baan contends that as companies continue to cut the volume of stocks, deliveries will increase as consignments become smaller, requiring a 'totally new' approach to distribution. However, while urban centres cannot cope properly with this volume during the day, their streets are largely empty at night. Using this slack time could not only greatly increase distribution efficiency, but reduce vehicle exhaust emission problems. Emissions of pollutants like oxides of nitrogen are 65 per cent less in free-flowing traffic than when the roads are congested. In Baan's vision of a distribution system of the future, goods would be brought together at distribution centres on the outskirts of cities and packaged into consignments for individual recipients, thus eliminating many duplicated journeys. Intrinsic to the concept is a goods 'module' which would have to conform to an EC-wide specification on durability, easy handling and dimensions. Dutch universities have already researched such a module, based on two International Standards Organisation pallets. Their use would open the way to a new type of standardised goods reception system in shops or shopping centres. These would not require overnight manning. Roller-tracked chutes would accept new containers and return old ones, with 'paper work' carried out electronically between truck and shop computer. It is the clear unacceptability of noise in such an operation which has prompted the suggestion of diesel-electric hybrid trucks, capable of using battery-only operation in town. Apart from being near-silent, such trucks would have to be highly manoeuvrable, hence the idea for all-wheel steering. The loading/unloading system would also have to be capable of operating vertically and horizontally. Despite the concept's radical nature, Baan believes it is fully realisable in the 21st century. 'It may look very futuristic but in fact all the techniques used in it are already available.' Until such ideas are translated into practice, however, manufacturers' efforts will continue to be concentrated on maximising the carrying capacity of trucks. These have led to vehicles with very low chassis, and even low-profile tyres, to raise carrying space within overall EC length and height restrictions. But this only increases the volume of goods which can be carried. So manufacturers have shown equal adroitness in reducing unladen vehicle weight  -thus increasing the weight of goods which can be carried per vehicle - through the use of lighter materials and more efficient design. Leif Ostling, general manager of Scania, the Swedish group, says the unladen weight of one of its heavy trucks has been cut from 10 tonnes to nine tonnes over the past two decades and that scope still exists to save weight. Yet while today's vehicles undoubtedly can and will be improved, it is innovations like that proposed by Baan that will be closely studied for solutions to future traffic problems.

Underwater Currents in the Pacific...""]    [Text] Despite strict official explanations, many officers  at the Defense Ministry and the General Staff are more and more  often comparing the explosions of the Pacific Fleet arsenals  with those that rocked the North Caucasus during the withdrawal  of the Russian Army from the area. One is getting the  impression that the Defense Ministry is ""disarming"" itself in  this unconventional fashion by destroying excess reserves  without taking any unnecessary trouble. Suggestions that Admiral  Gurinov, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, may have been  fired for reasons other than the latest explosion also incline  one toward this theory.    The situation at the Northern Fleet, say, is hardly any  better, if not much worse. While an arsenal blew up at the  Pacific Fleet, the Northern Fleet saw a much more serious  incident: nuclear materials were stolen twice within a month  there. But the fleet commander has emerged from the incidents  unscathed.    Once he arrived in the fleet following the tragedy on the  Russkiy island last year, Admiral Gurinov launched a flurry of  activity, trying to create some semblance of a Navy out of the  Pacific Fleet, or rather out of its remnants. But the inertia  of disintegration had gone so far that the energetic admiral was  scarcely able to accomplish anything within so short a period.  Meanwhile, Grachev waited for reports of drastic change. But  no rosy reports were forthcoming. Gurinov reported to Moscow  that the situation was extremely unfavorable in virtually all  areas. Moreover, on that same Russkiy island several more  tragic incidents occurred, also because of paralysis; it was  ordered to keep them strictly secret. The fleet continued to  degenerate. Furthermore, the new commander appeared to have  decided to put an end to lavish receptions for ministerial  commissions, a move that added fuel to the fire.    But according to an old tradition of top authorities in  Russia it was ""something personal"" that appears was the last  straw. A Japanese company undertook to mediate the sale of the  Pacific Fleet's 12 decommissioned diesel submarines to North  Korea. Somehow the State Property Committee also stuck to the  deal drawing on support from a very high-ranking official at the  Defense Ministry. Once the first two submarines were sent to  North Korea for dismantling, a universal outcry was raised that  the North Koreans could use the submarines as combat ships  (after repairs and the installation of weapons). Journalists  demanded explanations from the Pacific Fleet command.    Then the angered admiral Gurinov took a step unheard of in  the Armed Forces. In his interview for a major news agency he  said that the deal was for some reason sponsored by the State  Property Committee and was struck at the consent of the defense  minister, who did not even think it necessary to advise the  Pacific Fleet commander of what percentage of the deal the fleet  would get. A number of informed sources at the Defense Ministry  started openly saying that Gurinov's career after that could be  considered finished.    At a meeting of the Defense Ministry collegium in early May,  where the level of combat training of the Army and the Navy in  the first six months of this year was assessed, Grachev, as the  saying goes, razed the Pacific Fleet to the ground.    Naval commanders are becoming increasingly petty. These are  not Ushakov, Nakhimov, or Kornilov. This time, Russia has lost  yet another ""unlucky"" admiral. To all appearances, he fell  victim to intrigues at the ministerial palace, not battles for  improving the fleet's combat readiness.     "
0," LA050789-0068   53734    May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 1; Foreign Desk      2602 words      NO MELTING POT;    EUROPE BUSY CLOSING DOOR TO FOREIGNERS      By TYLER MARSHALL, Times Staff Writer      ALGECIRAS, Spain      They come at night, braving the treacherous strait in leaky 20-foot fishing  boats called pateras.    Paying up to $1,700 for the nine-mile illegal crossing to Europe's southernmost  tip, many Moroccans ante up their life savings, gambling on a brighter future  in a land rich beyond their dreams.    Occasionally, winds and currents in the Strait of Gibraltar swamp the  overloaded boats, tipping their human cargoes into the sea and almost-certain  death.    Occasionally, the Moroccans are caught by Spanish authorities and returned.      Networks of Smugglers    But with luck, they reach the shadowy networks that smuggle them to Madrid, to  the French border and to menial black market jobs in the inner cities of  northern Europe.    Algeciras Police Chief Javier Fernandez calls them espaldas mojadas --  literally, those with wet backs -- and says it is almost impossible to stop  them completely.    ""The coast is too wide and we are too few,"" he said, shrugging.    Their numbers -- hundreds each week, according to most estimates -- are small  compared to the 850,000 Mexicans caught attempting to cross illegally into the  United States last year.    But for a continent where people already feel overwhelmed by a rising tide of  immigrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, they add a worrisome dimension to a  serious problem.      A Multicultural Europe    Western Europe's social democracies are only now digesting the sobering fact  that most of the estimated 10 million to 15 million foreigners among them are  no longer foreigners but part of a new multicultural, multiracial,  multireligious Europe.    The presence of these outsiders, the majority of whom arrived legally and by  invitation, represents one of the most fundamental and deep-seated social  changes in Europe since World War II.    Certainly Europe is accustomed to immigrants and refugees. Its catalogue of  wars, revolutions and persecutions has seen to that. But the resettlement of  large numbers of non-Europeans is a new and unsettling phenomenon.    Consider, for example, that:     -- By 1995, every second child born in Brussels, the self-proclaimed capital  of Europe, will be Arab.     -- Twice as many Britons speak Urdu, Punjabi or Gujarati as Welsh, the native  language of Wales.     -- In France, an estimated 700,000 Arabs will be eligible to vote in the next  presidential election, a number nearly twice as large as the margin that  separated the candidates in the 1974 presidential election.     -- In West Berlin, three of the city's television stations now broadcast in  Turkish.     -- In Spain, road signs have appeared in Arabic to ease confusion among the  estimated three-quarters of a million Moroccans who cross the country every  summer on vacation trips from cities to the north.    For a part of the world whose principal experience with non-Christians has been  in religious wars and colonial exploitation, the ramifications of this  population shift are considerable -- and occasionally disquieting.    Protests surrounding Salman Rushdie's novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" the death  threat against Rushdie by Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini, and the subsequent assassination of a leading Muslim clergyman in  Brussels sent shock waves across the Continent.    ""The Rushdie affair,"" Britain's Home Secretary Timothy Renton commented in an  interview, ""is a new dimension for a lot of people who haven't really thought  about . . . the idea that a distant prophet, a religious leader, can lay down a  fiat, a law that Muslims throughout Europe can take as a binding commandment. .  . .""    Aside from adding to social tension, what West Europeans call ""the foreigners  issue"" has complicated European attempts at unity, tilted the political  equation in several countries, raised questions about the future role of the  Continent's generous but hard-pressed welfare states, influenced demographic  trends and begun to change the way Western Europe views itself as a society.      Rooted in Economic Boom    Paradoxically, Europe's problem is rooted in its post-World War II economic  recovery. To ease crippling manpower shortages that threatened to strangle the  boom of the late 1950s and early 1960s, governments and large corporations  recruited cheap, unskilled labor abroad.    With the lure of a quick fortune, Turkish ""guest workers"" arrived to sweep  streets of Geneva or build Volvos in Goteborg, Sweden, at wage levels they had  only dreamed of. Moroccans and Tunisians came to dig coal in French Lorraine or  stoke the coking ovens of West Germany's Ruhr region.    Leaders of Britain's textile industry, in order to remain competitive, did not  buy costly machines but recruited cheap Pakistani labor to work the old ones.  Jamaicans answered ads in Kingston newspapers and took jobs driving London's  buses, trains and subways.    In more recent years, large numbers of illegal laborers, mainly from North  Africa, slipped into Spain and Italy and found work picking grapes and in  construction.      Influx From 'Colonies'    Adding to the influx, war and unrest in formerly colonial areas brought in  hundreds of thousands of additional refugees in the 1960s and early 1970s.    By the time the oil crisis pitched Europe into recession in the mid-1970s, many  guest workers had established roots, brought wives and started families.    Gradually, dreams of going home began to fade. And only then did the long-term  implications of Europe's massive recruitment begin to dawn on its  policy-makers.    Today, in an atmosphere where individual countries are desperately trying to  close their doors to more outsiders, ""the foreigners issue"" has complicated  European Community efforts to dismantle by 1992 the checkpoints on borders  dividing its member nations.    ""There are few issues in Europe more challenging,"" said C. D. de Jong, a senior  official in the Dutch Ministry of Justice. ""We're doing a lot of thinking.""    So are many others. Right-wing parties that appeal to anti-immigrant sympathies  have sprouted in several countries, including West Germany, France,  Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Belgium.    In recent West Berlin municipal elections, a party headed by a former member of  the Nazi SS shocked political observers by taking advantage of an  anti-immigrant backlash and winning 7% of the vote, enough to topple a  coalition headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats.    A few weeks later, an election in Frankfurt produced a similar result.    In a country that recently coined the word ueberfremdung, which means  ""overwhelmed by foreigners,"" the same issue could decide who will be chancellor  after next year's national elections.      Extreme Right Reacts    In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front revived the country's extreme  right with the simple message that France's 5 million residents of foreign  origin must either become completely assimilated or go.    Le Pen collected more than 4 million votes in last year's presidential election  on that theme, and from his hillside chateau on the western outskirts of Paris,  he recently launched, with the same idea, his party's campaign for June's  European Parliament elections.    ""The call for Europe is to defend the historic, ethnic, cultural and spiritual  identity of the European people,"" he declared.    The idea that 350 million West Europeans could feel overwhelmed by a minority  population representing barely 4% of their total number seems a puzzling  overreaction. Ethnic and racial minorities make up roughly five times that  percentage of the U.S. population.      Explosive Combination    But in Europe, the concentration of minorities in large urban areas, together  with intense competition for social services and jobs, makes for a potentially  volatile political cocktail.    In a region where indigenous populations have begun declining, high birthrates  among minorities inject additional fears of being overwhelmed.    ""Europe is subjected to a threat from the demographics of the Third World and  Islamic expansionism,"" Le Pen said.    But most important, Europe, unlike the United States, has developed no melting  pot to immerse new arrivals in its culture. Its instinct has been to isolate  rather than absorb new minorities.      Citizenship Strictures    In some instances, access to citizenship in Europe has been tightened. Official  discrimination is often demoralizing.    A West German-born son of Turkish parents living in the country for 20 years  may yearn to be like his peers, but he has no automatic right to citizenship,  and his special ""foreigner status"" prevents him, among other things, from  becoming a public servant, a doctor, a pharmacist, a policeman or even a  railroad locomotive driver.    ""Second-generation youngsters want to be the same as German kids -- study, play  and dream of a future, but everywhere there are limits,"" said Barbara John, who  runs an immigrant assistance office for the West Berlin city government. ""If we  don't open up and become more flexible, there's a danger of real difficulties.""      Immigration Cut Sharply    Except for family unification, European governments have virtually ended  immigration from Third World countries. (Immigration from Eastern Europe,  however, has increased sharply amid a more relaxed East-West climate, with  about 200,000 East Europeans arriving to resettle in West Germany alone last  year.) Authorities also scrutinize refugees and political asylum-seekers from  outside Europe far more closely than in the past.    In most countries, acceptance rates for political asylum-seekers have dropped  from between 80% and 90% in the mid-1970s to around 10% today. Some refugee aid  groups fear that tough new European Community proposals could effectively shut  the door completely.    People dealing with caseloads say the shift reflects not so much a hardening of  criteria as a new breed of applicant -- one not fleeing political persecution  but seeking a better life style.    But they admit that the public mood also plays a role.    ""It is a fact of life that (our) society wants us to say no,"" said De Jong, the  Dutch Justice Ministry official.      Strengthening Frontiers    As the European Community's 12 member states work to dismantle their internal  frontiers, the debate centers on how -- not whether -- to strengthen the  Community's frontiers with the rest of the world.    In the corridors at EC headquarters in Brussels, immigrants are a problem  usually lumped together with drug-runners and terrorists on the list of  headaches. Visa requirements have already been tightened, making visits by  foreigners' families more difficult to achieve.    In Madrid, Spanish officials talk of a new coast guard service to crack down on  illegal immigrants. They say that beginning next year Moroccans entering Spain  legally will be required to have visas, return tickets and minimum funds for  their European stay. Some predict that this will bring chaos.    ""We're under a lot of pressure from the other (EC) countries to resolve this,""  said Aquilino Gonzalez, a senior official in the Spanish Interior Ministry. ""If  the door is open in one of the 12, it's open in all 12.""      Second-Class Rights    For foreigners already resident here, the discussions have raised the prospect  that they will find themselves with a form of second-class rights in a  post-1992, border-free Europe.    At present, an Algerian legally a resident in France has as much access to the  French job market as his French counterpart, but if present EC thinking  prevails, he could be blocked from joining his French counterpart on a transfer  to work in Britain.    ""What 1992 represents is a transformation of nationalism into a white  continentalism, altogether more tight, resilient and with more power,"" said  Christopher Mullard, a professor at the University of Amsterdam.    When Europe sent out a call for guest workers in the 1950s and 1960s, ""no one  placed any limits on the residence of those recruited,"" noted Lutz R. Voss, a  senior official in the West Berlin Internal Affairs Department. ""People just  assumed the guest workers would return (home) after a few years, so officials  didn't even think along those lines.""    They do now.    With Western Europe struggling as hard today against unemployment as it once  did to recruit labor, several governments have offered lucrative incentives to  persuade these workers to go home.      Return Fare Offered    The Netherlands has even offered to pay the return fare for unemployed  immigrants, then send them Dutch social security benefits once they get there.    Some have gone, but far more have stayed.    In Britain and, to a lesser extent, France, social tensions have boiled over  into street violence. Bitter riots in London and some northern English cities  earlier in this decade shocked British authorities into drawing up one of the  Continent's few race-relations programs.    In most countries, however, community relations are characterized more by  mutual suspicion, subtle discrimination and low-grade hostility.      Bitter Reaction    ""Once we were well-liked; we helped build the 'economic miracle,' "" recalled  Serdar Yilmaz, a 26-year-old Turkish-born travel agent who, as a child,  followed his father to West Berlin 20 years ago. ""Now, people see there are 2  million unemployed and 4 million foreigners and say, 'Just ship 'em home.' ""    Azeddine Guessous, Morocco's ambassador to Spain, said: ""These countries came  to recruit workers for their boom and recovery, but the moment there are  problems, the first victims are those who contributed most. We don't think it's  just.""    But any serious discussion of repatriating Europe's foreigners has long since  been overtaken by the fact that to an increasing extent they are no longer  foreign.    French sociologist Juliette Minces estimates that at least 60% of the people  with North African roots living in France and widely viewed as immigrants, are,  in fact, French-born.      Feel They Belong    ""They feel this is where they belong,"" she said.    In Britain, roughly half the nonwhite population was born in the British Isles,  and two-thirds of West Germany's 1.5 million Turks are under 16.    But for Europe's new minorities, there are also some reasons for optimism.    Nonwhites now appear in British television ads, an important development,  according to civil rights groups, because many rural Britons have had no  contact at all with minorities.    In Britain and France, where an earlier, more liberal attitude provided  generations of colonials with citizenship, minority groups have created voting  muscle.    In Britain's 1987 general election, four nonwhite candidates, including the  first black woman, won seats in the House of Commons; while in France,  second-generation North Africans, called Beurs, achieved a major success by  winning more than 500 of the 36,000 seats in municipal elections last year.

Paying up to $1,700 for the nine-mile illegal crossing to Europe's southernmost  tip, many Moroccans ante up their life savings, gambling on a brighter future  in a land rich beyond their dreams.    Occasionally, winds and currents in the Strait of Gibraltar swamp the  overloaded boats, tipping their human cargoes into the sea and almost-certain  death.    Occasionally, the Moroccans are caught by Spanish authorities and returned.      Networks of Smugglers    But with luck, they reach the shadowy networks that smuggle them to Madrid, to  the French border and to menial black market jobs in the inner cities of  northern Europe.    Algeciras Police Chief Javier Fernandez calls them espaldas mojadas --  literally, those with wet backs -- and says it is almost impossible to stop  them completely.    ""The coast is too wide and we are too few,"" he said, shrugging.    Their numbers -- hundreds each week, according to most estimates -- are small  compared to the 850,000 Mexicans caught attempting to cross illegally into the  United States last year.    But for a continent where people already feel overwhelmed by a rising tide of  immigrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, they add a worrisome dimension to a  serious problem.      A Multicultural Europe    Western Europe's social democracies are only now digesting the sobering fact  that most of the estimated 10 million to 15 million foreigners among them are  no longer foreigners but part of a new multicultural, multiracial,  multireligious Europe.    The presence of these outsiders, the majority of whom arrived legally and by  invitation, represents one of the most fundamental and deep-seated social  changes in Europe since World War II.    Certainly Europe is accustomed to immigrants and refugees. Its catalogue of  wars, revolutions and persecutions has seen to that. But the resettlement of  large numbers of non-Europeans is a new and unsettling phenomenon.    Consider, for example, that:     -- By 1995, every second child born in Brussels, the self-proclaimed capital  of Europe, will be Arab.     -- Twice as many Britons speak Urdu, Punjabi or Gujarati as Welsh, the native  language of Wales.     -- In France, an estimated 700,000 Arabs will be eligible to vote in the next  presidential election, a number nearly twice as large as the margin that  separated the candidates in the 1974 presidential election.     -- In West Berlin, three of the city's television stations now broadcast in  Turkish.     -- In Spain, road signs have appeared in Arabic to ease confusion among the  estimated three-quarters of a million Moroccans who cross the country every  summer on vacation trips from cities to the north.    For a part of the world whose principal experience with non-Christians has been  in religious wars and colonial exploitation, the ramifications of this  population shift are considerable -- and occasionally disquieting.    Protests surrounding Salman Rushdie's novel ""The Satanic Verses,"" the death  threat against Rushdie by Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini, and the subsequent assassination of a leading Muslim clergyman in  Brussels sent shock waves across the Continent.    ""The Rushdie affair,"" Britain's Home Secretary Timothy Renton commented in an  interview, ""is a new dimension for a lot of people who haven't really thought  about . . . the idea that a distant prophet, a religious leader, can lay down a  fiat, a law that Muslims throughout Europe can take as a binding commandment. .  . .""    Aside from adding to social tension, what West Europeans call ""the foreigners  issue"" has complicated European attempts at unity, tilted the political  equation in several countries, raised questions about the future role of the  Continent's generous but hard-pressed welfare states, influenced demographic  trends and begun to change the way Western Europe views itself as a society.      Rooted in Economic Boom    Paradoxically, Europe's problem is rooted in its post-World War II economic  recovery. To ease crippling manpower shortages that threatened to strangle the  boom of the late 1950s and early 1960s, governments and large corporations  recruited cheap, unskilled labor abroad.    With the lure of a quick fortune, Turkish ""guest workers"" arrived to sweep  streets of Geneva or build Volvos in Goteborg, Sweden, at wage levels they had  only dreamed of. Moroccans and Tunisians came to dig coal in French Lorraine or  stoke the coking ovens of West Germany's Ruhr region.    Leaders of Britain's textile industry, in order to remain competitive, did not  buy costly machines but recruited cheap Pakistani labor to work the old ones.  Jamaicans answered ads in Kingston newspapers and took jobs driving London's  buses, trains and subways.    In more recent years, large numbers of illegal laborers, mainly from North  Africa, slipped into Spain and Italy and found work picking grapes and in  construction.      Influx From 'Colonies'    Adding to the influx, war and unrest in formerly colonial areas brought in  hundreds of thousands of additional refugees in the 1960s and early 1970s.    By the time the oil crisis pitched Europe into recession in the mid-1970s, many  guest workers had established roots, brought wives and started families.    Gradually, dreams of going home began to fade. And only then did the long-term  implications of Europe's massive recruitment begin to dawn on its  policy-makers.    Today, in an atmosphere where individual countries are desperately trying to  close their doors to more outsiders, ""the foreigners issue"" has complicated  European Community efforts to dismantle by 1992 the checkpoints on borders  dividing its member nations.    ""There are few issues in Europe more challenging,"" said C. D. de Jong, a senior  official in the Dutch Ministry of Justice. ""We're doing a lot of thinking.""    So are many others. Right-wing parties that appeal to anti-immigrant sympathies  have sprouted in several countries, including West Germany, France,  Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Belgium.    In recent West Berlin municipal elections, a party headed by a former member of  the Nazi SS shocked political observers by taking advantage of an  anti-immigrant backlash and winning 7% of the vote, enough to topple a  coalition headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats.    A few weeks later, an election in Frankfurt produced a similar result.    In a country that recently coined the word ueberfremdung, which means  ""overwhelmed by foreigners,"" the same issue could decide who will be chancellor  after next year's national elections.      Extreme Right Reacts    In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front revived the country's extreme  right with the simple message that France's 5 million residents of foreign  origin must either become completely assimilated or go.    Le Pen collected more than 4 million votes in last year's presidential election  on that theme, and from his hillside chateau on the western outskirts of Paris,  he recently launched, with the same idea, his party's campaign for June's  European Parliament elections.    ""The call for Europe is to defend the historic, ethnic, cultural and spiritual  identity of the European people,"" he declared.    The idea that 350 million West Europeans could feel overwhelmed by a minority  population representing barely 4% of their total number seems a puzzling  overreaction. Ethnic and racial minorities make up roughly five times that  percentage of the U.S. population.      Explosive Combination    But in Europe, the concentration of minorities in large urban areas, together  with intense competition for social services and jobs, makes for a potentially  volatile political cocktail.    In a region where indigenous populations have begun declining, high birthrates  among minorities inject additional fears of being overwhelmed.    ""Europe is subjected to a threat from the demographics of the Third World and  Islamic expansionism,"" Le Pen said.    But most important, Europe, unlike the United States, has developed no melting  pot to immerse new arrivals in its culture. Its instinct has been to isolate  rather than absorb new minorities.      Citizenship Strictures    In some instances, access to citizenship in Europe has been tightened. Official  discrimination is often demoralizing.    A West German-born son of Turkish parents living in the country for 20 years  may yearn to be like his peers, but he has no automatic right to citizenship,  and his special ""foreigner status"" prevents him, among other things, from  becoming a public servant, a doctor, a pharmacist, a policeman or even a  railroad locomotive driver.    ""Second-generation youngsters want to be the same as German kids -- study, play  and dream of a future, but everywhere there are limits,"" said Barbara John, who  runs an immigrant assistance office for the West Berlin city government. ""If we  don't open up and become more flexible, there's a danger of real difficulties.""      Immigration Cut Sharply    Except for family unification, European governments have virtually ended  immigration from Third World countries. (Immigration from Eastern Europe,  however, has increased sharply amid a more relaxed East-West climate, with  about 200,000 East Europeans arriving to resettle in West Germany alone last  year.) Authorities also scrutinize refugees and political asylum-seekers from  outside Europe far more closely than in the past.    In most countries, acceptance rates for political asylum-seekers have dropped  from between 80% and 90% in the mid-1970s to around 10% today. Some refugee aid  groups fear that tough new European Community proposals could effectively shut  the door completely.    People dealing with caseloads say the shift reflects not so much a hardening of  criteria as a new breed of applicant -- one not fleeing political persecution  but seeking a better life style.    But they admit that the public mood also plays a role.    ""It is a fact of life that (our) society wants us to say no,"" said De Jong, the  Dutch Justice Ministry official.      Strengthening Frontiers    As the European Community's 12 member states work to dismantle their internal  frontiers, the debate centers on how -- not whether -- to strengthen the  Community's frontiers with the rest of the world.    In the corridors at EC headquarters in Brussels, immigrants are a problem  usually lumped together with drug-runners and terrorists on the list of  headaches. Visa requirements have already been tightened, making visits by  foreigners' families more difficult to achieve.    In Madrid, Spanish officials talk of a new coast guard service to crack down on  illegal immigrants. They say that beginning next year Moroccans entering Spain  legally will be required to have visas, return tickets and minimum funds for  their European stay. Some predict that this will bring chaos.    ""We're under a lot of pressure from the other (EC) countries to resolve this,""  said Aquilino Gonzalez, a senior official in the Spanish Interior Ministry. ""If  the door is open in one of the 12, it's open in all 12.""      Second-Class Rights    For foreigners already resident here, the discussions have raised the prospect  that they will find themselves with a form of second-class rights in a  post-1992, border-free Europe.    At present, an Algerian legally a resident in France has as much access to the  French job market as his French counterpart, but if present EC thinking  prevails, he could be blocked from joining his French counterpart on a transfer  to work in Britain.    ""What 1992 represents is a transformation of nationalism into a white  continentalism, altogether more tight, resilient and with more power,"" said  Christopher Mullard, a professor at the University of Amsterdam.    When Europe sent out a call for guest workers in the 1950s and 1960s, ""no one  placed any limits on the residence of those recruited,"" noted Lutz R. Voss, a  senior official in the West Berlin Internal Affairs Department. ""People just  assumed the guest workers would return (home) after a few years, so officials  didn't even think along those lines.""    They do now.    With Western Europe struggling as hard today against unemployment as it once  did to recruit labor, several governments have offered lucrative incentives to  persuade these workers to go home.      Return Fare Offered    The Netherlands has even offered to pay the return fare for unemployed  immigrants, then send them Dutch social security benefits once they get there.    Some have gone, but far more have stayed.    In Britain and, to a lesser extent, France, social tensions have boiled over  into street violence. Bitter riots in London and some northern English cities  earlier in this decade shocked British authorities into drawing up one of the  Continent's few race-relations programs.    In most countries, however, community relations are characterized more by  mutual suspicion, subtle discrimination and low-grade hostility.      Bitter Reaction    ""Once we were well-liked; we helped build the 'economic miracle,' "" recalled  Serdar Yilmaz, a 26-year-old Turkish-born travel agent who, as a child,  followed his father to West Berlin 20 years ago. ""Now, people see there are 2  million unemployed and 4 million foreigners and say, 'Just ship 'em home.' ""    Azeddine Guessous, Morocco's ambassador to Spain, said: ""These countries came  to recruit workers for their boom and recovery, but the moment there are  problems, the first victims are those who contributed most. We don't think it's  just.""    But any serious discussion of repatriating Europe's foreigners has long since  been overtaken by the fact that to an increasing extent they are no longer  foreign.    French sociologist Juliette Minces estimates that at least 60% of the people  with North African roots living in France and widely viewed as immigrants, are,  in fact, French-born.      Feel They Belong    ""They feel this is where they belong,"" she said.    In Britain, roughly half the nonwhite population was born in the British Isles,  and two-thirds of West Germany's 1.5 million Turks are under 16.    But for Europe's new minorities, there are also some reasons for optimism.    Nonwhites now appear in British television ads, an important development,  according to civil rights groups, because many rural Britons have had no  contact at all with minorities.    In Britain and France, where an earlier, more liberal attitude provided  generations of colonials with citizenship, minority groups have created voting  muscle.    In Britain's 1987 general election, four nonwhite candidates, including the  first black woman, won seats in the House of Commons; while in France,  second-generation North Africans, called Beurs, achieved a major success by  winning more than 500 of the 36,000 seats in municipal elections last year.

0,FT942-1000 ,"FT942-1000 _AN-EF0DGABCFT 940627   FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Customer loyalty and clear policy top agenda      By PAUL TAYLOR and PETER MARTIN   Europe's most respected companies include a retailer which has stuck to its core business and an international engineering group largely created over the past six years. Marks and Spencer, the high street retailer, almost a national institution in Britain, and ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the pioneering Swedish-Swiss multinational industrial group, emerged as clear winners when top executives were asked to identify their most respected European companies, regardless of sector. Both companies won the praise of their peers, in particular for their leadership and management qualities. ABB's supporters highlighted the group's strategy, while MS's customer focus attracted much support. MS received particularly strong backing from UK-based respondents, while ABB won more broad-based support from executives across Europe. Both companies obtained the most votes from companies in their respective sectors. The survey asked senior executives in each sector - chairmen, chief executives and finance directors - to identify their most respected competitors on seven dimensions of excellence: customer focus, staff, products and services, business performance, leadership and management, strategy, and environmental issues. Respondents were invited to identify the qualities behind these judgments and to nominate the European company they most respected overall. Because this is the first peer group survey of its kind in Europe, year-on-year comparisons are not possible. In addition, response rates in some sectors, for example steel, property and entertainment sectors, were low and have been excluded from the sector results. The questionnaire was sent to 637 companies, achieving a response rate of around 30 per cent, relatively high for a postal survey. There was a slightly higher response from the UK. Since the results are based on the views of those executives who did respond, they are impressionistic rather than scientific. Nevertheless the results, which span 17 different sectors and nine countries across Europe, provide a unique snapshot of senior management attitudes and current thinking, providing some important insights into which qualities Europe's business leaders most admire. In particular the results highlight the willingness of many senior executives to vote for companies outside their countries. Italian and French executives tended to vote for international companies, suggesting a more pan-European focus. British and German executives were more inclined to vote for their domestic counterparts. A wide range of companies qualified for accolades. The overall top 25 companies irrespective of sector, include world-class competitors from most industry sectors and eight nations. Nine of the top 25 are based in Britain, four each are French and German, three are Swiss, two are Belgian and two of the top five, Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever, are Anglo-Dutch. Only one of the top rated companies - Virgin, the UK-based airline and entertainment group run by Mr Richard Branson - is not a quoted company. Another, L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics group, is quoted but majority controlled by Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, daughter of the group's founder. Some, like British Telecom, the UK-based global telecommunications group, have made the transition from government ownership to the private sector quite recently. Forty per cent of the top 25, including three financial stalwarts - Deutsche Bank, Union Bank of Switzerland and Zurich Insurance - are in service sectors, but the top 25 also includes heavyweight industrial players such as Rolls- Royce, Bayerische Motoren Werke, GEC and Siemens. Significantly most of the top 25 companies also headed the lists for executives' most respected companies in their own sectors, often by a large margin. For example, Royal Dutch/Shell, Unilever and Roche were all clear winners in their respective sectors. There were, however, surprises. For example, Reuters topped the media sector by a large margin, but did not appear in the top 25. Neither did Philipp Holzmann, which won the construction, homebuilding and building material group, or Muenchener Ruckversicherungs Gesellschaft which led the insurance sector. In general, respondents indicated the winning companies showed a commitment to their shareholders, customers, and employees. The most frequently cited qualities across all sectors were consistent growth and long-term profitability, clear business objectives and high customer loyalty. At the other end of the scale, demonstrations of commitment to equal opportunities, progressive qualities regarding childcare and taking a strong position on social issues earned little praise. Perhaps more surprisingly investing heavily in research and development also came low down the scale of respected qualities. Some cited characteristics stand out at country level. Customer loyalty was the most valued quality in the UK, but came lower down the scale of priorities for respondents from the other large European countries. Growth and profitability was the most important attribute for respondents from Germany and France, and ranked second in the UK and Italy, but came eleventh in Spain. A satisfied staff was rated the most important in the Netherlands and was high on most other country lists. But it was not regarded as being particularly important in either the UK or Italy. Training and development was rated as the third most important quality in Germany, but was only tenth for UK respondents. Providing staff with the resources to deliver high quality services and products was the top attribute in Italy, and fourth in the UK, but was less important in France and Germany. At sector level it was harder to draw firm conclusions. Nevertheless the survey produced some surprising and some predictable results. For example, it was predictable that customer loyalty was the most highly valued attribute in the retail sector and came first or second in construction, engineering and food processing industries. Customer service ranked as the most important or second most important attribute in the banking, chemicals, electronics and telecommunications. However, although research and development was rated the joint top attribute in pharmaceuticals it hardly received a mention in other sectors. The use of technology was the number one attribute for the media sector and ranked number three for telecommunications, but was lower ranked in other industries. More predictably pollution reduction was judged to be the most important factor for companies in the construction, electricity and water, and oil and gas sectors. Significantly in those sectors which are undergoing substantial regulatory change or technological development - for example electricity, water, and telecommunications - adapting to the needs of the 1990s was the top rated quality.

Officials say this is a test case of an EU treaty article designed to ensure that member states can, under certain circumstances, act to protect public health and the environment even when it could conflict with the free movement of goods within Europe's single market. Four governments including Germany's were outvoted on the 1991 modification of the toxic substances legislation, but in 1992 Brussels gave Germany a derogation, or time-limited exemption, for its tougher domestic rules. France launched a complaint, and the court has now upheld it, arguing that Brussels has failed to establish that the EU treaty's safeguard article applies in this case.

Some say  that the Arab situation does not allow this amendment now. When  will the Arab situation allow it?    [Al-Shar'] We in Syria adhere to and insist on rectifying  the  Arab situation. We always say, and I said it in front of the  Arab ministers, that the Arab situation is not in its best  shape, with Arab countries facing serious problems--Iraq,  Algeria, Somalia, southern Sudan. Even Yemeni unity is  threatened with collapse, God forbid, and there is the  possibility of a civil war in Yemen if the unity falters. All  this prompts us to work seriously and earnestly to rectify the  Arab situation and create the right atmosphere for better Arab  relations. This is our objective, anyway, and we must continue  to work to realize it. The Gulf war made things difficult, but  we in Syria believe that we should not consider the Gulf crisis  the end of the world. True, we must study all the negative  consequences of the Gulf war and address them in a positive and  constructive spirit with a view toward remedying the Arab  situation and serving common Arab interests.    [Hijazi] Do you think there is an international collusion to  disarm the Arabs and retain Israel's arsenal? What about the  elimination of the mass destruction weapons from the Middle  East? This was also a topic on the session's agenda.    [Al-Shar'] There are international inclinations, with Israel  behind them, to disarm the Arabs and retain Israel's formidable  arsenal of conventional and nonconventional weapons. You know  that Israel possesses and manufactures all kinds of mass  destruction weapons--nuclear, chemical, and biological. It has  so far refused to subject its nuclear weapons to international  supervision and to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and  the safeguards agreement. Therefore, we believe that 1995 will  see a review of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and this  gives the Arabs a chance to adopt a unified position regarding  the renewal of the treaty on the condition that Israel join it.  The Arabs must take a position regarding the renewal of the  treaty if Israel refuses to join it.    [Hijazi] The Arab boycott of Israel was also on the agenda.  What happened?    [Al-Shar'] We held contacts with many Arab foreign ministers  and sensed a unified and firm Arab position; namely, that the  boycott should continue until its causes--the state of war  between the Arabs and Israel and Israel's occupation of Arab  territory--are removed. As long as these causes remain, the  boycott must be maintained. This is a peaceful act and a  legitimate right of self defense against aggression and  occupation. It is strange that we, the Arabs, are asked and  pressured to lift the boycott, which is a legitimate act of self  defense, when no pressure is applied on Israel to end its  illegitimate occupation of the Arab lands. This is not a topic  for discussion; it was not discussed in the meetings. But there  was an item on the agenda concerning a report from the main Arab  Boycott Bureau in Damascus; this is an annual report on the  activity of the bureau and how to strengthen the boycott by  closing the gaps that may appear from time to time. The aim was  not to discuss lifting the boycott. So far, this item has not  been on the agenda with the purpose of lifting the boycott.  There was virtual Arab unanimity not to discuss the subject and  to maintain the boycott.     "

These will be involved in waste processing; dumping; recycling and burning; transport; water and sewerage services; and site clearance and cleaning. The last unit covers a growing business in highly-polluted industrial areas of eastern Germany and the former communist bloc. The bundling process, which excludes the plant construction division and the Lurgi engineering services business, is part of group strategy which focuses on high-margin and growing businesses. Metallgesellschaft's environmental divisions occupy important niches.

The measure, which is being strongly promoted by the Department of Health, is one of a number whose prospects would be improved by a decision not to go ahead with Post Office privatisation. The fate of the proposals to privatise Royal Mail and Parcelforce is now more firmly than ever in the hands of government business managers, who must decide whether the legislation could be pushed through without a high risk of damaging defeats in parliament. This follows a succession of critical responses to the government's plans for the mail service in recent weeks, including a formal submission by the nine Ulster Unionist MPs at Westminster saying they oppose them. Privatisation continues to enjoy strong support in cabinet, particularly from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, has not yet made up his mind. Downing Street said yesterday it would be surprised if a final decision on how to proceed would be made at Thursday's meeting of the cabinet - the last before next week's Conservative party conference in Bournemouth. A decision to press ahead with the introduction of a new power of supervised discharge for mentally ill patients would give the Department of Health under Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, a heavy legislative workload in 1994-95. Ministers have already given the go-ahead for a potentially controversial bill providing for the dismantling of regional health authorities and the extension of fund-holding by GPs. Other measures which may get better prospects of parliamentary time if the Post Office legislation is dropped could include the gas deregulation bill and a bill setting up a body to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice. Ministers are also still considering whether a bill implementing further reform of the unpopular Child Support Agency is needed. A senior Department of Social Security official is understood to have visited Australia during the summer to assess whether there is anything to be learnt from experience there. The government first announced its intention to introduce the new power of supervised discharge in August last year. This followed a review of the 1983 Mental Health Act and growing public concern over murders and other acts of violence involving former mental patients released into the community.

At a joint press conference with visiting U.S. President  Bill  Clinton, Yeltsin said the ""Partnership for Peace"" plan proposed  by Washington and endorsed at the NATO summit was ""a good  formula.""    The practice of accepting one member at a time was ""not  going  to do anyone good,"" he added.    Clinton, arrived here Thursday on a three-day visit, had  several meetings with Yeltsin and discussed a wide range of  issues.    They signed a trilateral agreement with Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk on dismantling the 176 nuclear missiles and more  than 1,500 nuclear warheads Kiev inherited from the former  Soviet Union.    Washington and Moscow also signed an agreement to stop  targeting their long-range nuclear missiles at each other and  other nations.    On Bosnian issue, Clinton and Yeltsin acknowledged they  reached ""no conclusive results"" but said they had had ""honest  and good conversations"" on the topic.    Trying to lower the expectations of a possible NATO air  attack on the Bosnian Serbs, Clinton emphasized that the new  NATO initiative was mainly designed to ""further the U.N.  mission"" rather than ""pretending"" to settle the conflict.    With Moscow facing an ailing economy, Clinton urged Russia  to  care more about its ordinary citizens and create security net to  cushion the hardship brought by the economic reform.    Stressing that he would press forward with radical economic  reform, Yeltsin said he had been upset by the slowness in acting  upon the assistance package agreed upon last July in Tokyo,  Japan, by the seven major industrialized nations.    However, Yeltsin singled out the United States for his words  of praise, saying most of the 1.6 billion U.S. dollars of aid  Clinton promised in Vancouver, Canada, in March of last year,  have been delivered.    Clinton was quick to add that the G-7 will speed up the pace  in helping Russia, saying Moscow's willingness to continue the  reform ""will be met positively"" by the West.    ""Billions of dollars"" of Western aid will flow to Russia in  years ahead, he promised.    This is Clinton's first trip to Europe since he took office  a  year ago. His later stops will be Minsk, Belarus, and Geneva,  Switzerland, where he is to meet with Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad on the Middle East peace talks.    He is expected to make two more trips to Europe later this  year, including participating in this year's G-7 meeting in  Naples, Italy, in July.    Clinton has invited Yeltsin to join him in Naples and to  visit Washington this fall.     "

""Who  could think five years ago that in 1994 I would speak in front  of a Bulgarian Parliament elected by democratic means, but even  then one could feel the first signs of the coming change,""  President Mitterrand said, recalling his previous visit to this  country in January 1989, several months before the downfall of  the communist regime. The French president came to Bulgaria on  condition that he would meet dissidents. He stressed that he  has good memories from this country, from his meetings with  Bulgarian students whose courage he then admired. Often Mr.  Mitterrand's address was interrupted by applause.    ""I want to express my admiration and respect for how much  you  have accomplished in such short terms, because you had to build  a new society, starting from nothing,"" the French guest said.  He stressed on his respect for the Bulgarian Parliament several  times. Mr. Mitterrand spoke in general terms, giving also his  personal evaluation, about the democratic values, freedom and  the hardships accompanying an economic reform.    The French president stressed that Bulgaria will be the  first  East European country to preside over the Council of Europe's  Committee of Ministers. ""Believe me, both Bulgaria and Europe  have made a progress,"" he said. The speaker went on to say that  France is most supportive of a speedy ratification of a number  of accords Central and East European states have signed with the  European Union (EU). He said that France may be expected to  ratify the agreement on Bulgaria's association with the EU by  the end of April. Mr. Mitterrand pledged to insist that this  issue be settled in the first days of the French Parliament's  session. These words were met with loud applause. The French  president evaluated in highly positive terms this country's  desire to join the European states. ""Europe belongs to you as  much as it belongs to us,"" Mr. Mitterrand said. He said that  Bulgaria has already found decisions to unsolvable problems and  went on to cite as an example the peaceful co-existence of  Bulgarians with the Turkish-speaking community here. ""The  Balkan Peninsula will probably hold you up as a model,"" the  French president stressed, adding that Bulgaria could have a  positive influence on the other Balkan countries. He praised  highly Bulgaria's stand on the Yugo-conflict and the strict  observation of the UN sanctions which costed this country a lot.  ""You lost profits but win international recognition and  Europe's respect,"" he said.    ""Any European country which sees a threat should rely on the  solidarity of the other democratic states,"" President Mitterrand  said, commenting on the Partnership for Peace plan. According  to him, it is unthinkable that Bulgaria could face any threat  and not have the support of the other democratic countries. Mr.  Mitterrand said that France had tabled a European security pact  to be put to discussion in Paris this April. He expressed his  hope that this conference would turn into a new forum, which  Bulgaria will choose to join. The speaker also expounded his  idea for an European confederation.    The French president traced back in history the roots of the  Bulgarian-French relations and commented on their future. He  concluded his address expressing the hope that Bulgarian  President Zhelev will pay an official visit to France sometime  soon.    Introducing French President Mitterrand to the Bulgarian  MP's, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov said that  they themselves could see how far Bulgaria had reached along the  road of deep democratic changes. During his visit at the  Bulgarian Parliament, Mr. Mitterrand was accompanied by his wife  Danielle Mitterrand. Bulgarian President Zhelev, Prime Minister  Berov and ministers were also present to hear President  Mitterrand's address.    Since 1990, the Bulgarian Parliament have been addressed by  Israeli President Chaim Herzog (June 1991), King Juan Carlos II  of Spain (May 1993) and Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  (July 1993).

KYODO NEWS SERVICE obtained a copy of the report, compiled  by  the panel of three economists and an industrialist who are  serving on the Information and Telecommunications Subcommittee  of a government council on deregulation, headed by Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata.    The report says the government ""should abolish or review  restrictions on participation in the telecommunications and  broadcasting fields, because curbs placed by the bureaucracy  that forecasts the supply and demand situation contravenes the  principles of a market economy.""    ""The government should eliminate a partition between  international and domestic telecommunications operators,"" the  report said.    At present, international telecommunication operators like  KDD and domestic telecommunication operators like Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) are barred from moving into  each other's turf.    The report also says the government should ""authorize  participation by local telecommunications operators in  long-range telecommunication fields by allowing the local  concerns to link up their networks with each other.""    The report featuring these recommendations will be submitted  for scrutiny and approval by Posts and Telecommunications  Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa and other related cabinet ministers at  their meeting, slated for Saturday [28 May], government sources  said.    However, the report cautioned that unusually rapid  deregulation in these fields might trigger confusion, urging the  government to take precautionary steps to prevent a possible  outbreak of chaos.    All or some of these recommendations will be included in a  package of economic measures to be announced by the government  in June. The pacakge is designed to eliminate possible seeds of  conflict between the Japanese economy and the international  community, the sources said.    The report also proposed changing a possible role of the  bureaucracy from a regulator to a mediator who would ""amend the  imbalance between those with ample information and those  without, while extending a helping hand to those who suffer  disadvantages.""    Demanding greater emphasis on consumers' interests, the  report also recommended creating a ""more flexible fee system as  well as a system under which the benefits of a lower cost  stemming from a more efficacious management could be passed on  to beneficiaries.""    It also proposed the elimination of a law regulating the  operators of cable television, saying, ""the CATV law that  regulates operators' facilities and the contents of their  businesses is unnecessary.""

The Commission's warning is contained in a paper published yesterday, which tries to reconcile the often contradictory requirements of efficient standardisation and intellectual property rights. The Commission believes the process of standardisation is essential to achievement of the single market. It has encouraged a small number of European standards institutes to develop common European standards, giving priority to high-technology areas such as telecommunications. The Brussels paper says 'all persons wishing to use European standards must be given access to these'.

The decision was announced in a joint  communique which was released on Friday.    The two countries' decision about the resumption of  political  ties, which came following talks between officials of the South  African Foreign Ministry and members of the office protecting  the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in that country,  brings to an end a 15-year-old complete rupture of Iran's ties  with South Africa.    Iran's ties with South Africa were severed following the  victory of the Islamic revolution and in protest against that  country's racist policies.    The Islamic Republic of Iran cut off all economic and  political ties with that country placing on top of its foreign  policy priorities its support for the struggle of the South  African nation for achieving independence.    The long and difficult struggle of the South African nation  has finally brought to an end the more than three-century-old  white domination over that country.    The Islamic Republic of Iran, while welcoming the trend of  return of peace, together with independence and restoration of  the rights of the black majority, considers the recent  developments in South Africa as being to the removal of  obstacles in the way of establishing political and economic ties  with that country and has announced its willingness for the  resumption of full diplomatic ties with South Africa. [passage  as received]    From a political point of view, the recent developments in  South Africa, which have provided the ground for all the races  to have direct and active participation in running the country's  affairs and making political and economic decisions, are  significant in that they can have positive impact and  consequences within the foreign policy and regional framework  for South Africa's future ties with other countries.    In this connection, the resumption of Islamic Republic of  Iran's economic and political ties with South Africa, the  groundwork of which was prepared during Mr. Mandela's visit to  Tehran last January, is an appropriate response to the victory  of the black majority in that country, and is a confirmation of  the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has always and will  continue to support the will of the nations in deciding about  the own fate.    As the rupturing of ties with the South African apartheid  regime 15 years ago and the resumption of ties with South Africa  now indicate, Iran does not have the slightest doubt in making  political decisions in this regard.

0,FT933-4497 ,"FT933-4497 _AN-DIHB8AGUFT 930908   FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (3): For once, Europe is ahead of the US game - Andrew Adonis looks at the likely impact of the new GSM networks      By ANDREW ADONIS   GSM stands for Groupe Speciale Mobile, a pan-European digital telecommunications standard for a new generation of cellular services across the continent compatible with each other. The first GSM networks were launched last July in Germany, France and Denmark. Vodafone launched its UK GSM service, called 'EuroDigital', on September 1. GSM services have recently - or will soon - come on stream in the other leading west European states, and eastern Europe is following behind. Dataquest, the consultancy company, is forecasting 1m GSM subscribers in western Europe by the end of this year, growing to 13m by the end of 1997. GSM networks are not going to replace existing analogue services overnight. GSM requires new infrastructure and different, digital handsets. That leaves analogue operators, including those constructing GSM networks, with investments to recoup and capacity to fill. It also leaves their subscribers with terminals useless for digital networks. With GSM handsets retailing for around Pounds 400 in the UK - after a subsidy of more than Pounds 100 from the operators - analogue handsets selling for a quarter of the price will retain a strong attraction. Dataquest projects that shipments of GSM telephones will overtake analogue shipments by next year; and that by the end of 1997 analogue will have barely half as many subscribers as GSM. 'The speed of the transition will be variable,' says Mr Dean Eyres, Dataquest's mobile analyst. 'It will be fastest in countries like Germany, where analogue penetration was lower and competition between GSM operators is already strong.' With digital barely off the ground in the UK, Germany already has nearly 500,000 GSM subscribers, and for most German users GSM is more accessible than analogue. The old and new are therefore set to co-exist until at least the turn of the century. Indeed, some operators are deliberately delaying their GSM offerings so as to maximise the potential of existing networks. In the UK, Cellnet is still looking to double its analogue subscriber base and will not be launching its GSM service until next year. Its strategy over the coming months is to combat Mercury One-2-One and Vodafone's two digital services with special analogue deals, playing hard on its lower all-in entry fee. It is not just a question of existing capacity. Mr Stafford Taylor, Cellnet's managing director, points to rapidly falling GSM handset and infrastructure prices, and more versatile base stations appearing by the month. Motorola, for instance, has just launched a base station ('ExCell') about twice the size of a street cabinet, requiring none of the separate buildings and protective fencing of its predecessors. Mr Taylor is gambling that delayed digital gratification will bring higher short and medium-term dividends. Nor will it be a straightforward one-way migration from analogue to GSM. Operators are piggy- backing 'local' digital services, with lower access and call charges, on their 900MHz GSM networks. In the UK Vodafone's is called 'MetroDigital' and will be launched on October 1. Digital networks operating to the higher 1800MHz frequency are also being built. The launch of UK Mercury One-2-One's PCN service is imminent, and Hutchison is constructing another. In Germany the E-Plus consortium - which includes Thyssen, Veba, BellSouth and Vodafone - is also building a DCS 1800 network. In some countries far cheaper telepoint services, offering one-way communication, are advancing too. Hutchison's 'Rabbit' service has so far had only limited success in the UK, but in Benelux and France similar services have fared better - though partly because of the inadequacy of the cellular network, particularly in Paris. GSM is thus only one of a number of new or revamped mobile services entering the market. It nonetheless has a critical role to play - not only because of its technological features, but because of the mode of its introduction, which is helping to reorganise not just the cellular market, but the configuration of the telecommunications services industry across Europe. Moreover, for once Europe is ahead of the American game in mobile. The US is still engaged in a dispute between operators over two rival digital standards - time division multiple access (TDMA) and code-division multiple access (CDMA) - which is threatening to delay the widespread introduction of digital systems. GSM's principal tech- nological assets are fourfold. Being digital, its capacity is far higher than that of analogue networks. It comes with a range of value-added features. Through 'roaming' agree- ments with other GSM oper- ators, it will in due course give mobility across much of Europe. And with more than 20 countries beyond Europe having now adopted the GSM standard, including Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, it offers the prospect of cellular mobil- ity well beyond Europe. Says Mr Robert Morris, telecommunications analyst at Goldman Sachs: 'It looks as if we are going to end up with one standard for the US, and GSM for the rest of the world' - a fortuitous development for Europe's GSM users, who can expect to benefit from cheaper infrastructure and devel- opment costs in consequence. Most GSM operators now have roaming agreements with counterparts across Europe, allowing GSM subscribers to make calls in any country with a GSM network simply by inserting their personal smartcard into a digital handset. Of the wide range of value-added services available with GSM, probably the most widely appreciated will be the short message facility, allowing handsets fitted with liquid crystal screens to receive messages, like alphanumeric radiopagers. In the longer term the mobile data facility incorporated within the GSM standard will permit mobile terminals, such as portable computers and fax machines, to communicate through handsets at speeds comparable to today's fixed data lines. However, arguably the most novel and far-reaching feature of GSM is that for the first time it is providing most of Europe's cellular phone users with a choice - choice of network and choice of operator. In the UK and US, analogue networks were provided by rival operators. In most of Europe, however, the state-owned PTO provides the service, with no rival licensed and few immediate incentives for the PTO to maximise its subscriber base. By contrast, GSM licences are generally being offered to two competing operators (see table). Typically one of them is the PTO, but the cellular activities of the PTO are increasingly being moved into separate divisions and encouraged to compete aggressively. Belgacom, Belgium's state operator, has gone the farthest of all the monopolies, hiving off its GSM operation and inviting Pacific Telesis, one of the top five US cellular companies, to join it as a minority partner in the project. The reasons for this change of policy are not hard to find, although rarely stated explicitly. Most of Europe's PTOs are anxious for privatisation and greater operational flexibility. Separating out their mobile divisions, and allowing them to bid for overseas licences and to work with private sector partners, is good preparation. As for governments, which award the GSM licences, licensing rival GSM operators is a measured first step towards wider telecommunications liberalisation. Under a recent European Community agreement, full competition must be permitted in most of the fixed-wire voice market by 1998. It is also turning into a useful, and increasingly lucrative, source of government revenue. The policy of giving licences away to companies in return for commitments to build within a pre-determined timescale, and in some cases also to keep tariffs within set bounds, is giving way in poorer countries to a straight auction. Poland led the way two years ago, extracting about Dollars 100m from France Telecom and Ameritech of the US for their cellular licence. Greece turned the auction into an art form last year, when it got Dollars 164m each from two consortia for their GSM licences. Following the Greek model, the Hungarian government last month succeeded in pocketing nearly Dollars 100m in return for its licences. According to the FT's Mobile Communications newsletter, the Greek auction netted Dollars 16 per head of population; Poland Dollars 2-Dollars 3; the Hungarians nearer Dollars 5. That may be good news for southern and eastern Europe's hard-pressed taxpayers. But if it becomes the norm, then those heralding cellular as the means to meet the telecommunications needs of impoverished communities will have to find a new tune.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    GSM operators in western Europe  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Number of Country      licences*    Operator(s)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria          1        PTO Belgium          1        PTO (with Pacific Telesis) Denmark          2        (1) PTO (2) Dansk                           Mobiltelefon (GN Great Nordic??)

0,FT942-13454 ,"FT942-13454 _AN-EDYDRADNFT 940425   FT  25 APR 94 / Final march of the old guard : As more EU leaders step down or are cast aside, the European ideal is under challenge      By DAVID MARSH   Following the revolutions in the east, Europe is now coping with upheavals in the west. Five years after the surge of central and eastern European discontent that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the ground is shifting under western Europe's political leadership. Four weeks after Italy's general election, and with the countdown under way to polls in the Netherlands on May 3 and for the European parliament on June 9 and 12, the continent is in the the midst of a period of intense electioneering. Coming political contests also include Germany's general election in October and the presidential tussle in France in May 1995. By summer next year, most of the leaders who launched a dynamic phase of European integration leading to agreement on the Maastricht treaty are likely to have left office. The Maastricht summit in December 1991 represented a high point both in enthusiasm for European union and for the careers of a remarkably long-lived set of European leaders. Of the 13 main participants at Maastricht, 11 had been in office (some for more than one spell) for six years or more. Since then, their political fortunes, like the European economy, have turned down. Five of the 13 have left office. At least three more will go over the next year. Of the 24 European Union finance and foreign ministers who signed the treaty in February 1992, only seven remain. The new generation must manage a difficult transition. Europe's challenges include: Handling the slow recovery from recession, in one of the most difficult periods for the European economy since the 1930s depression; Finding a common foreign and security policy to counter instability in former Yugoslavia, the ex-Soviet Union and northern Africa; Holding the 1996 conference to renew the EU's structure and preparing for enlargement to eastern Europe after the planned 1995 accession of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden; Rediscovering currency stability following the exchange rate mechanism's collapse in 1993 and doubts over the Maastricht goal of economic and monetary union (Emu) by 1997-99; And re-establishing fiscal control after a rise in government borrowing to well above Maastricht Emu targets. The Maastricht treaty has become law, but it looks out of kilter with public opinion. The latest opinion surveys in Brussels show only 39 per cent of EU voters support the treaty, with 22 per cent against it and 39 per cent undecided. Most governments expect a large protest vote in the European elections. The treaty gives the parliament greater powers. Yet an increased number of anti-Maastricht MEPs is likely to enter the Strasbourg chamber. 'The elections are taking place at the worst possible juncture  - a time of malaise and disdain,' says Mr Michael Sturmer, director of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, a German government policy think-tank. 'All governments have failed to explain to their populations why Europe is good for them.' Political and economic strains have undermined earlier assumptions about European integration. No government at present wants to press for initiatives ahead of the 1996 Maastricht review conference. This includes reconstructing the ERM. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the Danish national bank, and Europe's longest-serving central bank chief, says last summer's break-up of the narrow-margin ERM has led to a 'vacuum' in Emu planning. 'This setback has paralysed the political process.' The changes in Italy, a traditional supporter of European union, are particularly striking. The new government to be formed soon, probably under Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is likely to be more inward-looking than administrations run by the now-eclipsed Christian Democrats over the last 40 years. Most EU members' policies are increasingly focused on national interests. This is underlined by France's support for its farmers during Gatt negotiations, the row between Greece and the EU over Macedonia, and Britain's attempt to maintain its EU voting power after next year's enlargement. Priorities seem to be switching in Germany and France, the main partners behind European co-operation. Pointing to unrest in the former Soviet Union and the Maghreb, Mr Richard Portes, director of the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research, says: 'Germany will be looking more to its interests in the east, France to its interests in the south. These are diverging perspectives.' A crucial factor behind the Maastricht treaty was the French and German governments' desire to reinforce the framework of integration to tie reunited Germany to western Europe. Leading figures in France and Germany admit that the plan to subsume the D-Mark into a single European currency was based partly on the perceived need to restrain German power. As ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing recently put it, 'We need an organised Europe to escape German domination.' However, the German electorate's hostility to abandoning the D-Mark has added to the difficulties of realising Emu. Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he no longer wants 'the United States of Europe'  - a goal he formerly specifically endorsed. According to Prof Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, head of Germany's Allensbach opinion research institute, whose polls are influential with Mr Kohl, 'There is a great determination in Germany not to go towards a federal European state. People want to keep national variations unchanged. Before Maastricht, this was not an issue.' Ms Noelle-Neumann's surveys show German opposition to Emu has softened recently because many Germans believe its prospects have receded. On the balance between deepening western European integration and extending the EU eastwards, Ms Noelle-Neumann says Germans have 'an unswerving wish' to open Europe to the east. 'This could create difficulties with France, Italy and Spain.' In France, business leaders recall Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, a possible successor to President Francois Mitterrand, previously voiced strong doubts about Emu. 'Union or not, we have to solve our own problems,' says Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of France's Suez financial conglomerate. 'What will happen in 1997 or 1999 is not the most important question.' One top French official says wistfully, 'If the Soviet Union had not fallen, we could have had a triangular relationship between West Germany, Britain and France.' All hope for the Maastricht blueprint has not been lost. Economic recovery will rekindle enthusiasm for western European integration, just as it revived after the 1981-82 recession. The Union is likely to find a more coherent policy to deal with turbulence on its borders. Whatever the German population's scepticism, the German government will not want to escape its treaty commitment to Emu. None the less, as Europe's political landscape changes, none of these three forecasts can be assured. As the 1980s leaders disappear from the stage, the objectives they espoused, too, may start to fade from view.  ---------------------------------------------------------- Total years in office as of Dec 1991  ---------------------------------------------------------- Wilfred Martens**                        Belgium       12 Francois Mitterrand*                     France        10 Poul Schluter**                          Denmark        9 Ruud Lubbers*                            Netherlands    9 Felipe Gonzalez                          Spain          9 Helmut Kohl*                             Germany        9 Giulio Andreotti**                       Italy          8 Jacques Santer*                          Luxembourg     7 Charles Haughey**                        Ireland        7 Jacques Delors*                          EC president   6 Anibal Cavaco Silva*                     Portugal       6 Constantine Mitsotakis**                 Greece         1 John Major                               UK             1  ---------------------------------------------------------- *Facing election or end of office by 1995 **Have left office  ----------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------                      EU ELECTIONS 1994-96  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Italy                Parliament                27-28 March 1994 Netherlands          Parliament                          May 94 EC states            European Parliament                June 94 Luxembourg           Lower Chamber                      June 94 Germany              Parliament                          Oct 94 Denmark              Parliament                          Dec 94 France               President                           May 95 Belgium              Parliament                       Autumn 95 Portugal             Parliament                          Oct 95 Spain*, UK*          Parliament                Possibly in 1996  ------------------------------------------------------------------ The Spanish and UK elections will probably be held before their June and April 1997 deadlines respectively  ------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Instead, the European Environment  Agency, based in Green-conscious Denmark, has materialised as a  toothless watchdog.    Copenhagen has finally been designated the Agency's  permanent  home after three years of bickering. But it faces an uphill  struggle, thanks to widespread disillusionment over its role.    Its lack of real bite is becoming increasingly embarrassing  as some individual states seek to reclaim responsibility for  Green issues from Brussels. That is a dramatic change from the  idealistic days of 1989, when the idea of the Agency was first  put forward. Then, environmentalists saw it as a tough  enforcement agency, knocking into line any state dragging its  feet on Brussels's environmental rules.    At the very least, it was hoped, it would pull together the  disparate strands of EU environmental legislation and  co-ordinate policy.    Today, with those hopes shattered, it is clear that for the  first couple of years at least, the Agency will be little more  than a monitoring centre. It will have virtually no powers to  police Green laws, and it will play no part in framing European  environmental policies.    According to Phillip Bourdeau, director of the task force  which has set up the Agency, its main task will be to provide a  continuous assessment of Europe's environment -- gathering  statistics on issues like air pollution and the quality of river  water -- and report to the Brussels environment division and  European Parliament.    Bourdeau says it will be useful in monitoring how effective  the directives are -- although it will rely on member states to  provide the necessary statistics.    Environmental groups claim that the toothless agency  reflects  a growing trend in the European Commission to allow member  states more flexibility in meeting environmental standards.  They accuse Brussels of ""going soft"" on the environment. Many  in the governments of Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands  agree. A recent accord on the Commission's packaging directive  -- which considerably reduces targets on the recycling of  household waste from those in the original proposal -- was  strongly opposed by these countries. Hans Alders, the Dutch  environment minister, claimed the directive had been so weakened  it had ""nothing to do with the environment.""    Alders had already complained that there was a ""malaise in  environmental policy-making"" in the European Union [EU]. He  said: ""Within the last year the Council of Ministers has made  virtually no important environmental decisions.""    Ironically, the Maastricht Treaty gave the Union  considerable  new powers over the environment, leading many to believe that  the environment would become one of the Union's most important  areas for action.    Indeed, two weeks after the Maastricht Treaty came into  force, Yiannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner, said:  ""An enormous amount still remains to be done if we are not to be  accused by our children and grandchildren of handing down a more  polluted environment than the one we inherited."" Two months  later, it is clear that the Commission is prepared to sacrifice  environment for subsidiarity. In the face of considerable  pressure fron Britain and France, Brussels officials have  already announced that drinking and bathing water directives are  to be replaced by framework directives.    Both London and Paris have complained that the Commission's  tough environmental stance was proving politically disastrous  for governments at home. France's water companies predicted  that prices would have to double in ten years to meet EU  standards.    The environment is fast becoming Europe's newest political  battleground. The Dutch government is insisting that the wider  use of subsidiarity must be accompanied by increased monitoring  of how member states use their new-found freedom.    Giving the European Environment Agency more power would help  to redress the balance. Victoria Gonzalez of the World Wide  Fund for Nature in Brussels, said: ""We think the Commission is  unlikely to grant it much power at all. But the agency would  still make some sort of impact if all it did was provide good,  detailed information on the environment.""     "

But in an interview in Die Welt am Sonntag Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister, continued to defend the aircraft, which is already behind schedule by two years. Ms Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy parliamentary leader of the SPD, said the taxpayer would have to provide an extra billion D-Marks if the project goes ahead. The federal audit office last month calculated that the price of each aircraft has already increased to DM150m (Pounds 62m) instead of earlier estimates by the Defence Ministry of DM90m. The SPD has consistently argued against the project following the end of the cold war and the demise of the Warsaw Pact. But supporters of the aircraft say it will meet western Europe's air defence needs well into the next century.

Does this indicate a change in the  attitude toward our state on the part of the world's ""mighty""?    [Horyn] It must be admitted that quite a number of Ukrainian  politicians have been counting upon comprehensive support for  Ukraine on the part of Western democratic states that will be  happy to help us. We needed time for our society to become  convinced that a Ukrainian state, about which dozens of  generations dreamed and for which millions of patriots died, can  only be built by our own efforts. It is only possible to create  a favorable political climate in Ukraine when it stands on its  own two feet concerning the economy and defense, and when it  manages to convince its neighbors and the entire democratic  world that it will ensure stability inside the state and will  thereby promote stability in the region and in the world. In  that case, it would be political short-sighted to ignore us and  not to establish mutually advantageous relations with us.    As regards the policy of the United States and some European  states, it has undergone a certain evolution in a direction  favorable for us. Earlier, there were calls for us to return to  the ""bosom"" of the empire, and the new leader Bill Clinton tried  to talk to us through ultimata. Their policy with regard to the  states of the former USSR, with the exception of the Baltic  countries, was pro-Russian. This, in turn, stimulated leading  Russian state figures to pursue a tough policy with regard to  Ukraine. There even were territorial claims. It must be  pointed out that this was always encouraged by the unprincipled  policy pursued by our government and president.    [Pasichnyy] After all, we remember quite well George Bush's  visit and his speech at the Ukrainian Parliament in which he  openly called upon us to return to the empire. Or the present  position of President Clinton, a position that is openly  coercive....    [Horyn] They expected that the young state would yield to  such powerful pressure.... However, our parliament had enough  common sense to state: We will not fully disarm ourselves,  because we do not possess guarantees for Ukraine's security as  an independent state in what concerns its borders and  territorial integrity.    The refusal immediately to give up nuclear weapons was an  extremely clever step on the part of the Ukrainian external  policy, as it drew the attention of the entire civilized world  to Ukraine. The world started thinking: What sort of state is  Ukraine, why does it refuse to give up its nuclear weapons, how  does it motivate its position, and to what logic do its  politicians adhere. There arose a problem of imperial threat on  the part of Russia, and our northeastern neighbor acquired the  image of an aggressor. The Western mass media steadily spread  this idea and, as a result, in recent months, there appeared a  change for the better in the attitude toward Ukraine. We became  an object of a thoughtful U.S. policy, and, finally, Washington  realized that the giant state in the center of Europe required a  proper attitude toward itself. This does not mean that today's  U.S. policy has become pro-Ukrainian. However, we have not freed  ourselves from pressure on the part of the United States.  Clinton's planned trip to Moscow is quite telling. However,  now Clinton demands that we dismantle our nuclear weapons in  exchange for compensation. It will depend upon our president  whether he will manage to convince Clinton that the best  security guarantee for Ukraine would be to retain those 46  strategic missiles until all nuclear states disarm. However, it  must be admitted that we are no longer being totally ignored.    [Pasichnyy] I agree with you, but I want to remark that  Clinton arrived in Kiev in order to offer us assistance in  dollars. However, he does not want to guarantee our security.  We cannot count upon assistance from the United States or NATO  in the case of Russian encroachments....    [Horyn] Recently, I had a conversation with a German deputy  defense minister, who stated that they are not interested in the  existence of a strong Ukraine. Such frankness was nothing new  for me. Back in Soviet [prison] camps, Levko Lukyanenko  [Ukraine's Republican Party leader] and I foresaw such a turn of  events.    Well, this high-ranking German official explained his idea  in  approximately this way. Ukraine is presently in a state of  crisis. We do not have enough food. However, some 10 years will  pass, and our state will finally be standing on its own two  feet. It will be a competitor on European agricultural markets.  At the same time, traditional exporters, such as Germany and  France, will find themselves in a difficult situation....    I replied to those arguments by saying that had Ukraine  remained within the empire, the entire Europe would have been  compelled to spend huge amounts of money on armaments in order  to insure themselves against the imperial threat. Europe would  have trembled before the Moscow empire as it did after World War  II.    Ukraine is not only a dream of the people and the form of  their survival. Ukraine is a factor of stability, peace, and  de- imperialization in Europe. Ukraine must become a therapist  of the imperial moods that prevail among the Russian people.  The recent elections in Russia are disturbing.    [Pasichnyy] After all, the consequences of the recent  elections in Russia have again placed before the world a threat  of direct invasion from Moscow. Chauvinism is still alive, and  it has now acquired features of communo-fascism....    [Horyn] Yes, they showed that it is not only the ruling  circles in the Kremlin that are infected with the virus of  imperialism. Many Russians display deep nostalgia for the  empire, because its very existence raised our neighbors in their  own eyes.    The results of the elections in Russia have also contributed  to a change in orientations in the West's attitude toward  Ukraine. Instead of diktat, we see a striving for a dialogue.    [Pasichnyy] Pan Mykhaylo, you, as chairman of Ukraine's  Republican Party, are a candidate for deputy of the Supreme  Council at the coming elections. What is the attitude of the  Republicans toward Ukraine's nuclear status?    [Horyn] We believe that the very fact of nuclear missiles in  Ukraine is a guarantee for us and a warning for all of our  neighbors that they should refrain from playing with fire. We  are not opponents of disarmament and we are not against  dismantling those missiles whose service life has expired.  However, in our opinion, 46 missiles must be left and  dismantled only after all nuclear powers make identical steps.    One more thing. Russia, after it received from us a large  number of medium-range missiles, has not to this day paid us for  the nuclear fuel -- this sum constitutes several billions of  U.S. dollars.    I, for example, do not agree that, while dismantling the  nuclear warheads, we should also be compelled to dismantle the  missiles themselves. They are our separate property -- they  were built at our factories. We will be able to use them to  protect ourselves from territorial encroachments by aggressors.    I hope that the president will not hasten to sign the  necessary documents that would fully disarm Ukraine. It would  be an irreparable blunder.     "

Now once more under the banner of his own Tara Arts company, he has returned to the same fertile source. Verma's adaptation of The Bourgeois Gentilhomme is set in the French colony of Pondicherry in the southern India of the late 17th century. The merchant Monsieur Jourdain, ludicrously eager to elevate himself socially, here becomes successful fisherman Thirru Kaka Deen, hopelessly trying to buy in bulk the frills and furbelows, airs and graces which will unlock to him the world of the Annians, or French colonisers. In order to win his daughter's hand after Kaka's first snobbish rebuff, her suitor impersonates not the Great Turk but the Sun King himself. Much play is made of Kaka Deen's desire to transform himself from a crow (the literal meaning of his name) into a peacock, and Vincent Ebrahim makes a fine strutting idiot, attempting to buy knowledge by the yard and discovering, in the original play's most famous aphorism, that he has been speaking prose all his life and never realised it. Yet Verma's version is more than mere prose. He uses the term 'Binglish' (by analogy with 'Bollywood', the common coinage for the Bombay movie industry) to describe the fizzing East-West linguistic cocktail which his characters speak. The likes of Salman Rushdie and Vikram Seth have conveyed the energy of this modern vernacular on the page, but hearing a classic French comedy rendered thus is another experience entirely. The unaccustomed ear is never allowed to attune fully; Verma is alert to the possibilities of 'Binglish' for ridicule, as Kaka Deen fails time and again to master the formal 'received' speech of the nobles whose favour he craves, and lapses back into his altogether livelier 'natural' lexicon. This cheery verbal syllabub re-enacts the central message which Tara's production elicits from the narrative: that energy, happiness and truth are found in hybridity rather than in trying to attain a phoney alien propriety. Kaka Deen is spoken of as would-be social 'coconut' - brown on the outside, white on the inside - yet when the play reverts in the final moments to the modern frame in which Verma has mounted it, the question, 'Are you a coconut?' is met with a joyous affirmative 'Aren't we all?' The change and interaction of words and cultures is to be embraced: at one point a character quotes the central teaching of 20th-century guru, Meher Baba; pauses; repeats it, and begins singing it . . . because that is what we now associate with the phrase 'Don't worry, be happy,' that is what it now means to us. None of which is to damn the production as 'worthy'. The performance I saw managed (eventually) to seduce even a resolutely Surrey-commuter-belt audience at the Maltings, Farnham into going along with the larks. Moliere's 'comedie-ballet' is rendered with song (accompanied with an arsenal of percussion by Joji Hirota), dance (choreographic consultant, Shobana Jeyasingh) and a kind of semi-improvised puppetry, which sees Kaka Deen exchanging flatteries with an aristocratic mango wearing a tricorn. Verma's primary aim is celebration rather than profundity, and on that score The Bourgeois Gentilhomme succeeds comfortably, thank you.

We won't need them if we are going to utilise Europe as one market.' Percy Barnevik, head of ABB, talks to Guy de Jonquieres      By GUY DE JONQUIERES   FOR Mr Percy Barnevik, president of ABB, the world's largest power engineering group, the advent of the single market marks the fulfilment of a long-cherished dream. Yet as he examines Europe's prospects, the picture he sees is tinged with the shades of an incipient nightmare. Since 1987, when Mr Barnevik master-minded the merger of Sweden's Asea with Switzerland's Brown Boveri, he has acquired a reputation as a far-sighted and decisive manager. The merger - the first in a wave of big cross-border deals - has been followed by about 70 further acquisitions on both sides of the Atlantic. Driven by a vision of Europe without frontiers, ABB has been reshaped into a decentralised transnational enterprise, equipped to operate freely across borders. Mr Barnevik, a 51-year-old Swede, says it is at home in all the 140 countries in which it operates, yet owes fealty to none. But while he remains convinced that the strategy is right, he is increasingly worried that the leap forward represented by EC integration will be jeopardised by long-term economic problems and by growing instability on Europe's eastern borders. At worst, he fears, the fabric of European cohesion will start to unravel. His prime concern is not that the single market programme will prove still-born. Indeed, he is confident that, despite some rearguard protectionism, EC public procurement markets will steadily open up to competition as purchasers seek better value for money. ABB's pursuit of increased efficiency and faster decision-making has earned it a reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter. In four years it has shed 50,000 jobs, while increasing turnover 60 per cent to Dollars 28.8bn in 1991. 'We grow all the time, but we also shrink all the time,' says Mr Barnevik. But the company still has more plants making more products than its main competitors in the US and Japan. 'We have six production centres for bogies and five design centres for traction motors, where only one or two of each are needed. All that has to be standardised, Europeanised,' he says. It is at this point that the doubts start to creep in. If economies are to benefit fully from integration, he says, industry must continue to slim down. Yet by doing so, it risks creating a backlash which will thwart further restructuring: 'All hell breaks loose when we want to close a plant because half the workers walk into unemployment.' He believes the problem is not rooted in recession, but in inexorable advances in productivity. He forecasts that the proportion of Europe's labour force employed in manufacturing and business services will fall from about 35 per cent today to 25 per cent in 10 years' time - and to 15 per cent a decade later. 'Where will all these people go? Out they will go, because we won't need them if we really are going to utilise Europe as one market.' In addition, public sector payrolls will fall sharply as governments are compelled to curb spending and become more efficient. Mr Barnevik reckons the result will be a shake-out comparable to that in agricultural employment earlier this century. But this time, surplus labour will be much harder to absorb because service industries are too sluggish to create enough well paid jobs. 'If anybody tells me, wait two or three years and there will be a hell of a demand for labour, I say, tell me where. What jobs? In what cities? Which companies? When I add it all together, I find a clear risk that the 10 per cent unemployed or underemployed today could easily become 20 to 25 per cent.' 'If you look at service industries, there are highly paid people, like lawyers and investment bankers, and then there are the cleaners and guest workers who earn a third or half as much as skilled factory workers. So we end up either with permanent unemployment or under-employment, or with two classes of differently paid people. Both are social dynamite. That is exactly what will create Fortress Europe. That is what will hamper restructuring.' The blame cannot, he says, be laid on government policies, nor does he see any clear solution: 'If I knew the answer, I should probably win Nobel prizes in several subjects.' Yet, he insists, the problem pales into insignificance compared with the threat to western Europe's future posed by economic disintegration in eastern and central Europe. 'It is tragic to see what is happening. The desperation, the disappointment, people feeling cheated. What is so terrible is to see these lost opportunities, the political destabilisation and the threat to economic development in all of Europe happening before our eyes.' Yet the west's response so far has been supine and impassive, he says. Without much more decisive action, it will pay a heavy price in the form of a massive influx of refugees, which will strain social cohesion to breaking point. Here, he does have a solution to propose. Western governments should sharply increase financial aid over three to five years and back it with generous long-term soft loans, freer market access for exports from eastern Europe and political insurance for western companies investing there. 'Today, nine out of ten western executives say, let's wait, this is too unstable, I can't handle the inflation, I don't speak the language. So they stay out. We must get people in there to introduce the market economy, to organise, to bring computers in, to teach accounting and English, to tell them how to export, purchase and calculate product costs.' This may sound like special pleading by a company which has expanded rapidly in eastern Europe and is seeking to limit its risks. Yet Mr Barnevik insists ABB can look after itself. He cites its operations in Poland, where it has taken only 18 months for ABB's 10,000 workers in eight factories to achieve western quality and productivity levels. 'These people work like crazy. This isn't the third world. Take Russia. It has 12m engineers and 1m PhDs. Russia's strength is not its oil, it is its people. But you have to organise them, motivate them and get them into a normal model of a market economy,' Mr Barnevik says. 'The positive side is that if you do these things right, they can be a major force for stimulation because new markets open up with tremendous needs for telecommunications, energy, transport, health care, you name it.' The drawback is that few western politicians seem ready to contemplate a programme which, Mr Barnevik concedes, would entail short-term sacrifices by the west. 'They tell me it is politically impossible, not least in a time of recession, to advocate more public expenditure.' My conclusion is that we don't have a political system which rewards long-term thinking and looking beyond your own borders.' That will not prevent him from continuing to grab every opportunity to ram home the message that it is in the west's self-interest to act, and that there is not much time left. 'We have to tackle the problem immediately. We are too late already. If you sacrifice a little now, you will get the benefits. If you just sit there and sacrifice nothing, you will get the refugees and will have to maintain your military forces. Then you sacrifice your future and a hell of a lot more. We should not talk about sacrifice. We should talk about how to protect ourselves.'   Companies:-  Asea Brown Boveri.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

0,FT931-2344 ,"FT931-2344 _AN-DCUAGAB2FT 930320   FT  20 MAR 93 / The mouse that roared: Peter Bruce visits Andorra, Europe's newest sovereign state      By PETER BRUCE      ANDORRA   Come back in a few months,' says Mr Xavier Espot, Andorra's minister for tourism and sport, rubbing his hands. 'This is going to be very interesting.' Last Sunday, Andorrans, perched high up in their tiny Pyrenean principality between Spain and France, voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to grant themselves their first constitution and to end more than 700 years of feudal rule from 'down below' as they call their neighbours. As far as its people are concerned, Andorra has just become Europe's newest sovereign state. 'Now we'll get to see what its like being a real democracy,' says Mr Espot. There is excitement everywhere. In the next few weeks President Francois Mitterrand of France and the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Joan Marti Alanis, will sign the new constitution into law, transferring sovereignty to Andorrans. 'Things are going to begin to happen really quickly around here,' says Mr Candi Naudi i Mora, a former minister and the country's biggest property developer. Until recently, Andorrans have been slow to seek change. Since the 13th century the principality has been ruled jointly by the bishops of Urgell in Spain and the French counts of Foix. The Foix title passed to the crown of France in the 15th century and successive French heads of state. These 'co-princes' have enjoyed complete power in Andorra - over commerce, immigration and security. And for centuries Andorrans have wanted it that way. Even now, in voting sovereignty to themselves, Andorrans have made the co-princes a single constitutional monarch, obliged to sign laws and to be consulted only on foreign policy affairs that directly affect France and Spain. Slow political development has contrasted with an increased pace of economic change. In the past 30 years Andorra has been transformed from a subsistence economy into a modern tourist mecca. Its towns are lined with expensive duty free goods. Visitors shop and ski. And the 60,000 or so locals have one of Europe's highest standards of living. The country is pretty and clean. There is practically no crime and no prostitution. Andorrans pay no taxes, get free education in schools financed by France and Spain and get cheap health care. The local government has until now raised more than 95 per cent of its revenue by charging a small import duty. No one knows what inflation might be. 'We don't have a consumer price index,' says Mr Naudi. And per capita income? 'Enormous,' says the minister for tourism. Economic development has prompted increasing demands for self-determination which has brought the people of Andorra into a series of disputes with the co-princes. In 1982 an Andorran assembly, was established with the agreement of the princes. The most serious dispute has occurred over an expropriation law passed unanimously by the assembly in 1985 but which has never been approved by the co-princes. The law would probably cut the price that the government has to pay to buy land from property-owners - many of whom have benefited from the old system. Under the new constitution, the co-princes will have to sign the law. The See of Urgell is the big loser from Andorra's new independence. The Bishop, once so influential that he could determine the credit policies of Andorran banks, failed to make catholicism a state religion in the new constitution and had to fight hard to prevent abortion being legalised. But, under pressure from the Spanish government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the See has been forced to accept a reduction of its power. Andorran officials say there is no resentment behind their move to independence. 'We just want to be able to do things,' says Mr Espot. 'The institutions of the old system were incapable of dealing with modern problems.' For a start, the Andorrans want to establish themselves as an offshore financial centre. 'We pay no tax but we can't even be a tax haven because we don't have the appropriate laws,' says a local lawyer. More importantly, the government wants to scrap legislation banning foreign companies from Andorra. Officials say they must change such laws to find new sources of income. Freedom from feudal rule is going to be expensive. Between 1989 and last year public spending rose nearly 50 per cent to Pta20.4bn (Pounds 118m), mainly to fund new schools. To finance a growing budget deficit the Andorrans need to create more economic activity - by changing company law and opening up to foreign investors - and then find ways to tax the new sources of wealth. 'We will never have a direct tax here,' says Mr Naudi, but there is broad agreement that indirect taxes will have to be introduced, perhaps even a value added tax. Andorrans fear new taxes just as they fear that continued economic growth will fuel immigration. Resident foreigners already outnumber locals by more than three to one - more than half the population is Spanish. The authorities, seeking to create a stronger sense of national identity, have decided to create more Andorrans. Anyone who has spent more than 30 years in the country or who was born there before 1975 is now eligible for citizenship. This may not seem very generous, but few foreigners are complaining. 'I have another 10 years to wait,' says a Basque, resident here for the past two decades.' He will happily give up his Spanish passport when the time comes. 'It's a strange, conservative, place. Everybody, especially the police, knows your business but it's a good price to pay for total security in a civilised country.'   Countries:-  ADZ  Andorra, West Europe.

The communique calls for turning the Baltic Sea area  into a region of special economic growth.    The ministers expressed support to the EU-Baltic free trade  negotiations and hoped that a friendship and cooperation  agreement between the EU and Russia could be concluded soon.    More attention was paid to improved cooperation in transport  and energetics, especially in the use of seaports. The need for  simplified border crossing procedures was also stressed.    The communique welcomed democratic reforms in the Baltic  states, Poland and Russia, stressed the importance of the troops  withdrawal from Lithuania and Latvia and reiterated the ""speedy,  complete and orderly withdrawal"" demand. The dismantling of the  Russian nuclear reactors in Paldiski and technical and legal aid  to the process was mentioned.    The statute of the Euro-faculties was approved and it was  decided to open another faculty in the Kaliningrad region.    The Baltic Sea Countries Council senior officials committee  is to consider the forming of a permanent secretariat. The  meeting will also consider Iceland's appeal to join the council.    Poland was elected next chairman country of the Council.  The foreign ministers' meeting established the post of another  human rights commissioner. Danish lawyer Ole Espersen was  appointed Special Commissioner for Democratic Institutions and  Human Rights.    Espersen commented that his tasks include the protection of  human rights and ethnic minorities and added that private  individual, groups of persons and organisations are free to  appeal to the commissioner. But he pointed out that he cannot  deal with all council member countries at once, due to the  limited resources and manpower. He met the representatives of  the Estonian Institute for Human Rights yesterday.    Representative of the EU sir Leon Brittan offered a  possibility to form a free trade area between the EU and the  Baltic Sea countries outside the union. Free trade has a  central position in the relations between these states and the  EU and it would not be too early to think of a common trade  region, he stressed.    The border issues between Russia and Estonia were not  mentioned at the meeting, contrary to the earlier promises of  the Russian foreign minister. Kozyrev unexpectedly announced at  the news conference that Russia has no border disputes with  neighbouring countries and that the issue will not be raised at  the Paris conference either. Estonian Foreign Minister Juri  Luik, however, stressed that Estonia will bring up the border  subject, as the Balladur Pact conference is the best opportunity  for discussing it.     "

The  European Monetary Institute [EMI] is being formally set up on  January 1 as part of the European Union's so-called second stage  of progress towards economic and monetary union. By  concentrating on a few necessary tasks, firmly defined by  governments and central banks, the EMI can improve the prospects  for successful monetary integration.    Conceived as an embryonic European central bank, the  institute will have to lower its sights from the ideas that  inspired its creation. An important priority will be to improve  co-ordination within the present European Monetary System [EMS],  which is a long way from carrying out its original and still  badly needed function of providing a stable exchange rate  environment for European business.    In view of the EMS disturbances since autumn 1992, along  with  other setbacks to the Maastricht timetable for a single  currency, the gestation period for the new monetary body has  been highly problematic. Because of delays in deciding to place  the institute in Germany, the EMI will not even be able to move  to a permanent home in Frankfurt before the summer.    In 1988-89, when plans for setting up the institute were  first laid, the European Commission, backed by the French and  Italian governments, wanted it to carry out some fully-fledged  central banking operations. This idea has been watered down,  above all because of opposition from the German Bundesbank.  Monetary decisionmaking will remain the preserve of the EMI's  12 member central banks. French-backed proposals for the EMI to  help manage currency reserves look unlikely to get off the  ground.    Harmonisation Drive    The task of Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the EMI's designated  president, will thus be to assemble a staff of statisticians and  economists, rather than to wield power.    This does not mean that the EMI will not have a job to do.  First, it will have to accomplish detailed technical work to  prepare for the harmonisation of monetary statistics and money  market instruments that forms an essential precondition for EMU  [Economic Monetary Union]. If the harmonisation drive leads to  an increase in efficiency of different countries' monetary  systems, then the benefits would extend beyond making EMU more  viable.    Second, the EMI can provide a forum for general debate on  European monetary matters. Mr Lamfalussy sees the need to  uphold the consensus on the desirability of EMU, but he also has  the experience and independence to speak plainly about the  hurdles that lie in its path. He will be helped in his task of  nurturing public understanding of Europe's unhealthily secretive  central banking system, if the EMI is required to publish  detailed minutes of its monthly meeting of central bank  governors.    Vital Arbiter    Third, in a less high-profile role, the EMI president can  function as an arbiter, providing advice and assistance to  member countries. The misunderstandings and mismanagement  evident during the monetary system flare-ups in September 1992  and July-August 1993 could have been lessened had an  intermediary been on hand to adjudicate between countries  pursuing different monetary priorities, or even to ensure that  rival positions were clearly communicated and understood.    After the upsets of the past 17 months, it seems still more  likely than before that EMU, if it takes place at all, will be  reached first by a relatively small group of countries willing  to combine a lasting political commitment to EMU with a  readiness to gear their monetary policies to Germany's. If  monetary convergence stops short of EMU, the task of managing  that process will require expertise and sensitivity of the  highest order.    Creating a new institute will not, by itself, solve Europe's  monetary problems. But if it can successfully combine the roles  of trouble-shooter and think-tank, the EMI will have a good  chance of bringing Europe closer to objectives that individual  central banks are incapable of fulfilling. It is a welcome  addition to the institutional landscape of the European Union.     "

This will exacerbate the overcapacity which already threatens the profitability of the petrochemicals industry. According to most estimates, about 7m tonnes of plastic are handled every year by Europe's municipal waste authorities. If 'long-term' wastes such as cars and televisions are included, the total amount of plastic discarded may be as much as 15m tonnes per year. Polyethylene forms the largest component of plastic waste. The proportion of Europe's plastic waste that is recycled is likely to increase from about 6 per cent today to 16 per cent in 1996, as governments promote recycling on environmental grounds through a mixture of compulsion and financial incentives. According to Chem Systems, the direct effect of recycling will be to reduce consumption of virgin polymer (freshly manufactured plastic) by more than 2m tonnes a year from the mid 1990s. Assuming an average price of Dollars 1,500/tonne, that would mean the loss of Dollars 3bn worth of sales, at a time when the industry will have increased its manufacturing capacity in anticipation of sustained growth in demand for new plastic. Eric Johnson, the consultant responsible for the study, says: 'The planners and business managers in the plastics and petrochemicals industry have not yet perceived the impact of recycling. They say they have but they really have not.' Since recycling is more suitable for some plastics and for some applications than for others, its impact will vary between companies. Producers of low-performance plastics are most vulnerable. Germany is taking the lead in promoting European plastics recycling. The German target is for 80 per cent of packaging to be recycled by 1995. This will require 40 recycling plants to be built, with an average capacity of 10,000 tonnes per year and a cost of DM1bn (Pounds 330m). Several other countries have ambitious recycling targets. Italy, for example, is aiming for 40 per cent recycling of plastic containers by December 1991. The UK is taking less action than most of its European partners and has no national recycling target. Although the plastics industry is adopting a co-operative attitude, its spokesmen maintain that the costs of collecting and sorting different types of plastic make recycling uneconomic. The industry is promoting instead the idea of using waste plastics as a fuel by controlled burning. For petrochemical manufacturers, incineration has the advantage that used plastics do not re-appear to compete with their new polymers. But according to the Chem Systems analysis, recycling may be a better economic proposition.  The Financial Times   London Page 12 Graph (Omitted).  "

Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said complaints had doubled since 1980, and the trend was likely to accelerate as companies insist on a level playing field in the single market. In particular, the commissioner took aim at restrictions in competition in Europe's energy market. Mr Van Miert promised to press ahead with efforts to create a single market in energy which was lagging behind telecoms liberalisation. Commission officials hope that private sector complaints could be a tool for attacking state monopolies, particularly powerful operators in the gas and electricity industry. In 1993, the Commission eliminated its backlog of old competition cases. Some 1,250 cases involving cartels or abuse of a dominant position were being examined on December 31, 1993, compared with a little under 1,700 a year earlier. Mr Van Miert signalled that the Commission is examining how to develop the idea of a common competition area extending to prospective EU members in eastern Europe.

Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, also said talks were taking place with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, on the surrender of the IRA's weapons. The move prompted immediate concern in London about the speed of events in Dublin and was greeted with dismay by rightwing Conservative MPs and Ulster unionists. Ms Geoghegan-Quinn said details of the numbers to be freed and the timetable of their release had yet to be fixed. 'But I can confirm that a number will be released between now and Christmas,' she said. The minister stressed that there was no question of trading prisoners for weapons. 'But the dismantling of IRA arsenals is being actively pursued,' she added. Last night the British government would say only that the release of terrorist prisoners was a matter for the Irish government. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'The prime minister has repeatedly made it clear in the past that IRA prisoners are serving sentences for criminal offences. They are not political prisoners and the question of an amnesty does not arise.' Privately, ministers are sanguine about Irish concessions to the IRA, which they hope will help to lock the terrorists into the peace process. There is concern in London, however, that Dublin is moving too quickly. Ministers are also keenly aware of the need to reassure unionists that their interests are not being ignored in the struggle to draw the republican movement into mainstream politics. Mr Henry Bellingham, Conservative MP for Norfolk North West, said he was 'deeply disturbed' about the announcement. 'I can understand why the Irish government want to keep the momentum behind the peace process going, but I think they are taking far too big a risk,' he said. Mr Bellingham, a member of both the British Irish Parliamentary Body and the Conservative Friends of the Union, said it was too early for such a release of terrorist prisoners, which would merely strengthen the IRA's active service units if the peace process broke down. Mr Bellingham said Conservative MPs would accept that it was not possible for Britain to prevent the release of terrorists convicted in Ireland. 'But I hope very much that Downing Street will make its grave displeasure very clear to the Irish government in private,' he said. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP, said he was becoming increasingly worried by what he described as the republic's piecemeal approach to the ceasefire which was in contrast to Mr Major's more considered and structured attitude.

0,FT931-16992 ,"FT931-16992 _AN-DADBPAALFT 930104   FT  04 JAN 93 / The Year Ahead: Taking sights at prosperity - and for some merely survival      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   After 12 months of setback and disappointment, most people in the industrialised world will be hoping that 1993 will be a year of economic recovery and prosperity after slowdown and recession in 1991 and 1992. Many millions more outside that relatively small group of most favoured nations will have their sights set lower - on mere survival and an end to conflict. The new year begins with some favourable aspects. With luck, the start of the European single market and the inauguration of president Bill Clinton later this month may boost business confidence in Europe and the US and so help restore growth. But the uncertainties are daunting and cover the globe. Many industrial countries are still shackled by high real interest rates. Further tensions are likely in the European exchange rate mechanism, threatening the EC's ambitious plans for economic and monetary union. Germany, supposedly Europe's economic powerhouse, has difficulty finding the right mix of budget and wages policy to tame inflation. Japan is held back by debt deflation. Constitutional problems beset Canada. Little wonder, therefore, that late in 1992 the International Monetary Fund revised down its forecast for industrial country growth this year to 2 per cent from the 3 per cent forecast less than three months before. Such growth will not stop further increases in unemployment. Problems abound elsewhere. 1993 will see a continued struggle to bring economic reform to Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union. But eastern Europe's experience since communism's collapse holds out little hope that victory for reform will swiftly bring prosperity. Large parts of Africa face further economic decline. It is unlikely that harrowing pictures of famine will be banished from the television screens of the developed world. Where prosperity beckons, as in China, political freedoms often remain chained. Yet there are glimmers of hope. A rush of upbeat statistics and confidence indicators at the end of last year could signal a clear recovery phase for the US economy after many false dawns. The UK, now freed of the need to hold its interest rates at German levels, stands a good chance of escaping from its longest recession since the second world war. But both countries will need strong political leadership if they are to reduce their swollen budget deficits and make recovery a prospect for the long term. The world will still face difficulties adjusting to the end of the cold war: both the industrialised democracies and the former communist powers have yet to convert their military-industrial complexes to peaceful uses. But local wars apart, the globe is becoming a safer place. Nuclear disarmament continues apace. Elections will be frequent in 1993, testifying to the strength of democracy and its growing importance in the third world. If the IMF is to be believed, developing countries as a whole will grow by a creditable 5.75 per cent, largely because some countries, notably in Latin America, have adopted the free market policies and principles that their industrialised competitors are spurning at their peril. But this year, like 1991 and 1992, will be one in which world leaders find they are at the mercy of unpredictable developments. In so far as foreseeable events affect their lives and ours, the important ones are listed below.   Countries:-  XAZ  World.   Industries:-  P96  Administration of Economic Programs.

0,FT921-13296 ,"FT921-13296 _AN-CAVBGADPFT 920122   FT  22 JAN 92 / Bonn is anxious to spread its burden      By QUENTIN PEEL      BONN   GERMANY, by far the largest donor and international lender to the former Soviet Union, is going to the Washington conference determined to spread the load. If all sources of aid and credit committed since September 1990 were put together, EC members would have provided about 75 per cent of the total, and Germany alone 57 per cent, according to figures from the European Commission. That includes food and medical assistance as well as export credits and credit guarantees, balance of payments support, specific payments to finance the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany, the dismantling of nuclear missiles and technical assistance. 'Given the importance of the reform process in the Commonwealth of Independent States for the future of the whole world, the burden must be fairly borne on all shoulders,' the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday. 'Failure of the reform process will not only have a negative effect on one country, or even one group of countries, but on the whole world.' At the same time, thanks to its aid efforts, Germany has the best experience of how carefully aid must be targeted within the CIS. The leading non-governmental aid agencies argue that blanket food aid, and private programmes of aid parcels, are not what is needed. 'We must have patience and not rush into sending assistance,' says Mr Peter von Oy, chief executive of the Care agency. 'The European Community kept saying aid must go at once, at once, at once. I kept saying it is far more important to ensure it is properly distributed. 'Food is not necessarily what is most needed: medical aid is even more urgent. But in the medical field we need measures which will last for a few years: which will mean progress and change. 'It is not just a question of sending medicines which will be accepted officially, but which are simply unheard of in Russia. They don't know how to use them.' Germany is proud of the DM400m (Pounds 140.8m) private aid effort launched last winter. Yet this showed that initiatives like food aid parcels sent through the post fail to reach the needy and could create resentment among recipients. As a result, groups like the Red Cross and Care have focused on specific aid programmes or targeted particular areas, like the Chernobyl radiation zone. The Foreign Ministry, which has co-ordinated the German aid programme, is also switching its focus from immediate short-term food aid, to medium- and long-term assistance.

Following the dissolution of the former Soviet Union,  Russia,  Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus became heirs to the bulk of  former Soviet nuclear arsenal.    Although Kazakhstan and Belarus had agreed much earlier to  transfer all the strategic weapons deployed on their territories  to Russia for destruction, Kiev had declined to do so due to  controversies.    With 176 strategic missiles and about 1,500 nuclear  warheads,  Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world after  Russia and the United States.    So Moscow and Washington became deeply concerned over Kiev's  unwillingness to give up its nuclear power status.    The concerns had increased after the Ukrainian parliament  decided on November 18 that the country would only destroy part  of its nuclear arms in the first stage and was prepared to  become a non-nuclear state only after being secured against  threats from other nuclear powers.    The parliament also urged the West to fund Ukraine in  dismantling its nuclear weapons.    Taking common interests into consideration, U.S. Vice  President Albert Gore visited Moscow in December to coordinate  the two countries' positions in pressing Ukraine to give up all  its nuclear weapons.    Meanwhile, Kiev was plagued by financial difficulties to  effectively maintain the bulk of strategic weapons, especially  after Moscow had refused to provide the spare parts needed by  such maintenance.    Under such situation, Ukraine agreed to negotiate with  Russia  and the United States. But the talks had deadlocked on  Ukraine's request for financial compensation for the destruction  of its nuclear arms and for sharing with Russia the income from  selling the uranium to be taken from the nuclear warheads.    The three sides had not made any major compromises on the  issue until U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to Prague for a  summit with leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and  Slovakia earlier this week.    Ukraine finally agreed to destroy all the nuclear weapons  deployed on its soil. In return, the United States will provide  Kiev 175 million U.S. dollars for nuclear arms destruction and  another 155 million in economic assistance, while Russia also  agreed to allow Kiev to share the income from uranium sales.    Because of this, Clinton changed his itinerary and stopped  briefly in Kiev on Wednesday to meet with Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk before flying to Moscow later the same day.    Kravchuk agreed to fly to Moscow on Friday for a summit with  Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin so that they could  sign an agreement on the issue, which has been jeopardizing  Kiev's relations with Moscow and Washington.

0,FT932-1980 ,"FT932-1980 _AN-DFUB2AE3FT 930621   FT  21 JUN 93 / France's four-letter word      By DAVID BUCHAN   Count on France to rail against Gatt at today's EC summit in Copenhagen. It will. Yet there is a case, which few in France dare make, for arguing that nothing could better serve the interests of France, the world's fourth largest exporter, as well as those of Europe, than a new international trade agreement. The French have never incorporated Gatt into their culture, even in a literal sense. They spit it out as a nasty four-letter word, forever a foreign acronym of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, itself rarely translated into French. Anti-Gatt feeling is at a record high in France. Gloom about rising unemployment has given way to a sudden panic about delocalisations, or the shift of production to lower-cost regions. But this has been happening for years; Thomson Consumer Electronics now employs more than three times as many people in Asia as it does in France. Why the panic now? One reason is an alarmist French Senate report on delocalisations. Another is that the new strength of the French franc and the continued weight of payroll taxes in France do not help the competitiveness of French goods. In services, the development of electronic teletravail, enabling French companies to get their accounting done in Bombay, also frightens people. Finally, there is the possibility that the Gatt Uruguay round might soon end in a further lowering of Europe's trade protection against the rest of the world. Many French fear Gatt is about to gobble them up. Mr Philippe Seguin, the Gaullist president of the National Assembly, last week put the fear graphically. 'Gatt is the picket tying down the European lamb and making it prey to the voracity of ever more ferocious world competition.' The fear he raises is that Europe's unemployment is not the result of a general, cyclical, world crisis, but of a more permanent crisis, confined to Europe, because of the way free trade operates against it. So, up has gone the old French battle cry of 'Community preference'. To some, including the Senate, this means raising EC tariffs all round; to the others it means graduated tariffs  - relatively low for the EC's immediate eastern European and north African neighbours, higher for the rest of the world, and punitive for countries with industries that employ children. 'Community preference' certainly exists in EC agriculture; its variable levies always bring the price of food imported into the Community up to that produced domestically. But the EC was lucky to get away with this in the early days of Gatt, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's government ac-knowledges that it is unrepeatable in the industrial field. It is largely, they concede, a warm-sounding phrase that sounds nice to French ears, but does not constitute a realistic battle plan for the Uruguay round. What, then, is their battle plan? One suggestion is to limit the benefits of Gatt trade liberalisation to countries subscribing to International Labour Organisation conventions on free trade unions and the like. The idea is presumably that unions would push up labour standards, and thus costs, in developing countries. But common social provisions are hard enough (as UK Prime Minister John Major has shown) to negotiate among the EC 12, let along among the Gatt 111. The Balladur government really believes its line that the EC has the world's most open trade system. To the fact that, at the start of the Uruguay round, the EC had an average trade-weighted tariff of 5.7 per cent, America 4.6 per cent and Japan 3.5 per cent, it retorts that America has far more high tariff peaks on textiles, shoes and glass, and that Japan's barriers are all non-tariff ones, but still prohibitive. True enough. In any case, Paris complains, any margin of average EC tariffs above others is negated by monetary swings in general, and the dollar's undervaluation in particular. True again. But part of the problem lies in Europe's own monetary system, and there is no hope of adding 'a monetary Gatt' to a trade one. Another idea circulating in Mr Balladur's office is for temporary EC 'tariff-quotas' (imposing high tariffs when import quotas are exceeded). Brussels has done this on steel from east European countries, which did not complain to the Gatt because they want to join the EC one day. There is no reason why other countries should be so forebearing. By contrast, the French call for Europe to have the same weapons of commercial defence as America strikes a sympathetic chord with many EC partners. Nothing annoys Washington's partners more than its tendency to play the Lone Ranger with the world trading system, using the 'silver bullet' of Section 301 of its successive Trade Acts. But the EC already has a 'European 301'  - in the form of its 1984 'new Community instrument', allowing the EC to take unilateral measures against what it sees as unfair trade practices  - but has hardly ever used it. Most of France's EC partners have generally only allowed it to be used against non-Gatt members, of which there are precious few left. Even its use would hardly rein in the US Congress, the real culprit and conceiver of Section 301. Only a Gatt deal, leading to a World Trade Organisation with some real clout, might give Capitol Hill pause. In contrast to arrangements in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank (reflecting America's dominance in 1944), the European Community's role in a WTO would reflect the fact it now accounts for the largest share (20 per cent) of world trade. Over time, too, a WTO might acquire a monetary and social dimension.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.

0,FT942-8713 ,"FT942-8713 _AN-EESCVADAFT 940519   FT  19 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): United in diversity  -Europe should exploit its variety, argues Hugh Aldersey-Williams      By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS   The European Commission will today make public plans to design a logo to attract Far East and American tourists and businesses. The idea will bring a shudder to many nationals of European countries. How can a region of such cultural diversity possibly be abbreviated into one symbol? The same dilemma confronts many European businesses. They are having to join forces with other European businesses in order to compete against companies from the more homogeneous trading blocs of Japan and North America. In doing so, they must surmount their own cultural differences to present a united front to the wider world. Fons Trompenaars, director of the Centre for International Business Studies in the Netherlands, points out in his recent book, Riding the Waves of Culture (Nicholas Brealey Publishing), that national culture is treated as a luxury or an inconvenience by many managers, especially perhaps by the insular British. 'The main dilemma which those who manage across cultures confront is the extent to which they should centralise, thereby imposing on foreign cultures rules and procedures that might affront them, or decentralise, thereby letting each culture go its own way . . . ' he says. Corporate identity consultant Wally Olins - in the first in a series of lectures on global companies to be published later this month by IMPR of Henley on Thames - says: 'There is no European corporate tradition comparable with the clear and comprehensible corporate traditions of the US and Japan.' Attempts to carry on regardless of that tradition founder. Alcazar and Volvo-Renault are recent reminders. Olins sets out five models for how European companies might proceed, based on what Europe does best and on how it is seen from the outside. Some models expect to bring about such a fusion of corporate cultures that national cultures become insignificant. Others will continue, like Airbus Industrie, to overcome them with governments' help. But many will choose to remain mono-cultural and will be so perceived within their own countries. Olins writes: 'That, I suspect, is where most big European companies will stay until the constraints become unbearable or their ambition grows irresistibly.' One difficulty is that people are at a loss to say what is the character of Europe as a whole. One of the reasons why people perceive a threat to national identity with each step towards closer European union is that no other identity appears to be on offer. However, could a Europe logo help us define ourselves? Olins believes this is too simplistic. To a large extent, Europe's identity lies in its diversity. With considerable effort, this attractive if hard-to-define quality could be exploited for competitive advantage. Many travellers no longer seek American-style homogeneity and European hotel groups could trade more effectively on the fact that the hotels they own - acquired over long periods and often with strong family or local histories - are highly varied. Likewise, Volkswagen - the maker of Seats in Spain, Skodas in the Czech Republic, and Audis and VWs in Germany - could, if it so chose, position itself as the maker of a mixed portfolio of European products rather than as the German controlling interest in a scattered collection of car factories. But 'Europeanness' will have to be authenticated by Europeans, and recognised and appreciated by people from outside Europe whose impressions of the place may have little to do with its realities. 'It's got to happen organically,' says Olins. 'Anything else will curdle.' If Europe's identity is to be its diversity, it will not be easily captured in any logo.

Despite recently being accused by one opposition leader of falling into the 'Gorbachev habit' of relying on foreign successes to boost his domestic popularity, President Yeltsin can still count on a measure of public support for signing a treaty which will abolish the world's most threatening class of nuclear weapons. Mr Andrei Kortunov, a defence analyst at the United States and Canada Institute, said however that Start 2 faced a difficult passage through the Russian parliament, whose powerful chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, had already voiced reservations about the treaty. Mr Kortunov also foresaw objections within Russia's still mighty defence industry circles, including highly-placed supporters such as Mr Yuri Skokov, who now heads a special presidential body on Russia's foreign relations. 'It will be a question of bargain-ing - what will they get in exchange (for endorsing the treaty),' he said. 'They will probably want major investment (by the Russian government) in the modernisation of the remaining strategic arsenal.' It was also no surprise that the schedule for implementing the Start 2 treaty is to be tied to the availability of foreign assistance for implementing it. The silos containing the land-based missiles with multiple warheads are concentrated mainly in Siberia and just west of the Ural mountains, as well as near Russia's border with Ukraine. A foreign ministry official said the main bottleneck in dismantling nuclear missiles under agreements reached so far was the storage of nuclear materials extracted from the warheads. He said US and Russian representatives negotiating the use of Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m) credit approved by the US Congress had agreed on the design of a special storage facility to be built in Russia, but now had to agree on the details, including the location. 'We will have to convince a local community to accept such a facility. The population is (environmentally) active nowadays - everybody says 'not in my backyard'.' He also said that talks would have to start with the Ukraine to iron out Ukrainian complaints in implementing its obligations under the Start 1 treaty. Only yesterday a senior Ukrainian official told reporters that his republic needed ten times the amount promised by the US to help it get rid of its long-range missiles - and said that Russia should pitch in too.

0,FT943-274 ,"FT943-274 _AN-EI3DUABHFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / Oxfam urges big change at World Bank      By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor   Big changes in the approach of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank towards Latin America were urged by the British-based aid organisation Oxfam in Madrid yesterday. After four successive years of economic growth, Latin America has come to be regarded as a success story for the market-oriented policies urged by Washington-based organisations. But, in yesterday's report, Oxfam said Latin America's free-market revolution has only widened already extreme income inequalities and worsened poverty. Oxfam welcomes the World Bank's recent commitment to poverty reduction 'but remains concerned that the strategy adopted is essentially a repackaging of the IMF and World Bank's policies, with social investment and safety nets added on'. According to the charity, the new policies' main flaws are that they fail to introduce policies for wealth distribution, and do nothing to protect what it calls basic rights, a lack of which has resulted in low-wage precarious jobs, unequal land distribution, restricted access to capital, and inadequate health and education. It says IMF stabilisation policies and World Bank insistence on market deregulation, import liberalisation and export growth have undermined any anti-poverty strategy. Growth was also based on the dismantling of workers' rights and the erosion of wages, which would further worsen economic insecurity. Its central recommendation is for the two institutions to replace their current single policy blueprint with a country-by-country reform strategy based on dialogue with local civil organisations, governments and relevant UN agencies. It favours selective trade protection and 'carefully targeted' subsidies for key industries, as well as low real interest rates. It also calls for social clauses in international trade and investment agreements 'to reverse the current trend towards low-wage export strategies'. Land reform should be a central element of the World Bank's poverty reduction strategy. Further, it says foreign debt is still draining many Latin American countries of resources. The Brady plan, though welcome, had been biased towards big debtors, and had failed to restore their long-term financial stability. Meanwhile debt to multilateral agencies such as the World Bank has become an increasing part of the problem, rising from 5 per cent of the regional debt stock in 1980 to 28 per cent in 1992. It urges quick implementation of the British government's proposal to use IMF gold stocks for debt relief for very poor countries, and says debt relief should be separated from IMF reform packages. The World Bank, it argues, should use its Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11.3bn) in reserves for selective debt relief; efforts to reduce countries' commercial debts should be renewed.

Israeli troops shot dead at least two Palestinians and wounded some 60 others in confrontations with stone-throwing youths. Palestinians said the violence in Hebron, where one Arab youth was killed, was more serious than the unrest that broke out after the massacre in the town. In Washington, President Clinton urged Palestinians not to abandon the peace talks, saying to reject negotiations would 'hand a victory to the extremists'. Diplomatic attempts to close the gap between the PLO and Israel intensified yesterday. Mr Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister who is leading an EU effort to revive the peace negotiations, held talks in Tunis with Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, before heading for Israel with what diplomats described only as 'some ideas'. Mr Igor Ivanov, deputy Russian foreign minister, also headed separately for talks in Israel after meeting the Palestinian leader. Despite Israeli and US opposition, international support appeared to be growing yesterday for the deployment of an international force in the territories to protect Palestinians. Mr Rabin stressed that the tragedy should not be used by the PLO as an excuse for trying to put the issue of settlements on the negotiating agenda. Instead, he said, the violence of the past six days should refocus both sides on the necessity for finalising an agreement on Palestinian self-rule. Mr Arafat yesterday restated PLO demands for returning to peace talks: the deployment of an international force in the territories to safeguard Palestinian lives, the dismantling of some extremist settlements and the disarming of the 120,000 Jewish settlers. Mr Rabin, however, said his government would not discuss settlements and settlers because the Declaration of Principles signed last September had specifically left these matters to later talks. On the issue of the deployment of an international force Mr Rabin said he had agreed to an 'international presence' but not an 'international force presence'. Officials said the prime minister had in mind a small group of observers for Gaza-Jericho only, and not for the rest of the West Bank. Talks meanwhile continued at the UN on the text of a proposed resolution which diplomats said had been sent to Tunis for consideration by Mr Arafat. Russian backing for an international force would present difficulties for Mr Rabin. Russia remains a co-sponsor with the US of the Middle East peace process. Mr Rabin said yesterday disagreement between the two co-sponsors could be exploited by the enemies of peace.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT921-293 ,"FT921-293 _AN-CC3A2ADPFT 920330   FT  30 MAR 92 / Volkswagen's new head to cut 12,500 jobs over five years      By ANDREW FISHER      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest car producer, is appointing a new chief executive and planning drastic action to cut costs, including the axing of 12,500 jobs over the next five years. Mr Ferdinand Piech, 54, an Austrian with a reputation for toughness who runs VW's successful Audi subsidiary, has been chosen to take over from Mr Carl Hahn next January. Mr Hahn, 65, had been given a two-year extension of his contract, but will step down a year earlier than planned. The company said the cuts of 2,500 a year in its 130,000-strong workforce would occur through natural wastage and would not involve redundancies. It denied a report that cuts of up to 25,000 were planned. The choice by an inner committee of the company's supervisory board of Mr Piech as group head underlines VW's determination to streamline its business. While an engineer at Audi, he was involved in several technological innovations and as its chief executive has presided over a period of rising profits and successful model launches. Until the last few weeks, Mr Daniel Goeudevert, a Frenchman who joined VW from Ford Motors' German subsidiary two years ago, had been regarded as the favoured candidate to succeed Mr Hahn. But with the backing of both trade union and corporate representatives on the supervisory board, it became clear recently that Mr Piech was in the lead. The appointment still requires the approval of the full non-executive supervisory board at its next meeting on April 10, but this is expected to be a formality. Mr Goeudevert, 50, who is responsible for the VW marque within the group, will be appointed deputy chief executive. VW also announced a 2.5 per cent rise in group net profits to DM1.1bn (Pounds 380m) for 1991, with turnover up by 12 per cent to DM76bn. The dividend will be unchanged at DM11 a share. However, it said that profits of the parent company, which reflect domestic performance, fell by a third to DM447m. Mr Stephen Reitman, motors analyst with UBS Phillips  Drew, the London stockbrokers, said the VW parent could be losing money on car sales before financial and other income was added in. VW has declined to comment on previous reports that this was the case and its figures, like those of other German companies, do not make this clear. 'They've got to get their break-even levels way down,' he added. It was against this background that Mr Piech's appointment should be judged. 'It's not time to be courting popularity,' he said. 'He will be the man who rattles cages. Similar cost problems are being experienced at other motor concerns in Germany, which has Europe's highest labour costs outside Sweden. German car companies have a productivity lead, but other European countries have been catching up. VW's main rival in Germany is Opel, part of General Motors of the US.

Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez said  Mexico does not need ""our experience"" of more than 30 years  fighting the Guatemalan guerrillas, and that the meetings held  have been the usual ones.    The dailies PRENSA LIBRE and SIGLO VEINTIUNO, who quote  sources close to the Army, said high-ranking Mexican military  officers had been to Guatemala in early January and they had  travelled to Ixcan, an area of conflict located in the northern  Quiche Department.    ""To provide military advice is a political decision. If the  Mexican authorities request it, I must ask the president for  authorization,"" the minister said, pointing out that the  meetings were not about the Chiapas situation.    Gen. Enriquez denied Guatemalan military officers had  travelled to Mexico to learn about the situation caused by the  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion, although he  said that way ""we would have more reliable information."" In  relation to the surveillance along the area bordering Mexico, he  reiterated the troops remain in a state of alert because the  Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) ""has concentrated  its forces in that area.""    The military command in Huehuetenango is coordinating  surveillance in the border area, which has been divided into  seven zones, and therefore, ""it has not been necessary to send  reinforcements,"" according to Army spokesperson Edith Vargas.    As of 5 January, the EZLN rebels have been in Guadalupe  Tepeyac, some 800 meters from the Guatemalan border, north of  Huehuetenango Department. In this area, Military Zone No. 19 is  in charge of security and defense but the border is also guarded  by troops and detachments which depend on the central military  zones located in the northern Quiche, Alta Verapaz, and Peten  Departments.    According to the Guatemalan defense minister, ""the entire  border is a shield for subversion. We fight them in Ixcan and  they show up in Mexico,"" where military intelligence has  detected hospitals for treating the guerrillas as well as arms  caches.    The daily SIGLO VEINTIUNO quotes a Guatemalan military  document which says the arrest of a ""terrorist criminal"" in  Cacahuatan, Chiapas in July 1984 led to the dismantling of a  ""clandestine surgical hospital.""    Enriquez ruled out the URNG as having the capacity for  organizing a rebellion like the EZLN rebellion in Chiapas State  on 1 January because ""it is militarily weak."" He also said  Guatemalan military attaches in Mexico have not reported on the  alleged Guatemalan guerrillas who were fighting with the  Zapatists, and he voiced concern about the arrest of Dr. Ruben  Alejandro Bailey. The medical doctor was arrested on 10 January  and accused of forming part of the Revolutionary Workers  Clandestine People's Union Party (PROCUP), which the Mexican  authorities have accused of terrorist actions.

0,FT943-808 ,"FT943-808 _AN-EI0DNAGMFT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (3): Later retirement with smaller pensions - Eva Kaluzynska examines the implications of an ageing population      By EVA KALUZYNSKA   Europe's workforce is ageing - 15 per cent of the population is already aged 65 or over, compared with an average of 6 per cent in the rest of the world. 'We're moving towards the low 20s (%) at the turn of the century,' said Dr David Coleman, a demographer at Oxford University, specialising in trends affecting Europe. There are relatively minor variations in birth and death rates among the 17 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), but the picture is very clear. Any company considering relocation will obviously factor in current levels of social costs, lowest in Portugal, Greece, Spain and the UK; highest in Germany, Denmark and Belgium. But employers must tune into demographic trends now if they want to get a sustainable, long-term personnel policy off the ground. 'Companies may be thinking of moving now to a country where costs are low, but they must plan now to keep them low,' said employee-benefits specialist David Formosa, of Sedgwick Noble Lowndes. The baby boom after the war was followed by what demographers at Eurostat, in Luxembourg, call a 'baby bust' in the 1970s. A marked decline in natural population growth throughout the EEA is continuing, while the death rate remains stable. In 1993, the birth rate was 11.2 per thousand, down from 11.5 per thousand in 1992; while the death rate stayed at 10.1 per thousand. Women, currently 51.2 per cent of the population in the European Union (EU), are having fewer children, and they are having them later if at all. Only in Ireland (and Poland, in central Europe) are women still having two or more children each. In 1993, there were 4.19m births in the 17 countries of the EEA - 110,000 fewer than the previous year. Demographers are ringing alarm bells about the need to adjust policies now, both at company and government level. 'Germany is the forerunner,' said Harri Cruijsen, team leader at Eurostat's project on demography. 'In the next five to 10 years it is going to have the most acute problems in adjusting to an ageing workforce.' Italy and Spain lag by about five to 10 years. The situation is less serious in France, which has had a policy of financial incentives for would-be mothers. The UK could also buck the trend up to a point, due to what Cruijsen calls an abnormally high rate of teenage pregnancies not seen elsewhere in Europe. The overall implications are stark. Employers who stay on the continent, rather than move nearer to markets in Asia, must make the most of the existing pool of potential labour, given the lack of youngsters. Experts agree on the need for two significant shifts in policy and attitude: postponing the age of retirement, and recruiting more women into the labour force. 'Seniors will stay on, females will come on,' as Cruijsen puts it. Many employees able to do so have retired early over the past decade, and many still expect to do so. 'This will stop,' said Cruijsen bluntly. Italy and Japan are already planning to raise the statutory age of retirement, and other countries will follow suit, experts say. 'The notion of early retirement has overshot its usefulness,' said Coleman. 'Active, employable life is getting longer. The notion that a person is old and past it at 65 is increasingly obsolete.' The idea of older people giving up their places in the workforce to youngsters gathered favour during the recession, though without any significant effect in reducing unemployment. Employers encouraged the trend, rejuvenating their workforces in the belief that younger people adapted better to new technologies. But Formosa urges managers to be innovative in adapting to new realities: 'Employers will have to start thinking differently.' Replacing key staff who have specialised knowledge and experience will become far more difficult, and flexible solutions, such as part-time schemes for key older employees could be part of the answer. He would recommend phased retirement: 'Maybe people will still be doing one or two days a week when they're aged 70.' Employers casting round for reserves in the labour force will have to make better use of women, experts say. Women currently make up about 40 per cent of the labour force in the EU. Denmark has the highest rate of female participation, at 46.6 per cent, followed by France (44.3), Portugal (43.2) and the UK(43.2). Ireland has the lowest rate, at 34.1 per cent. 'All projections for modest growth in the labour force at the turn of the century come from increased levels of female participation,' says Coleman. Formosa thinks employers will come round to offering women with caring responsibilities for children or older people more flexible working arrangements, as they realise the value of doing so. 'I believe employers will make more of an effort to keep women, as there is more difficulty in finding replacements.' Coleman estimates that, if all EU countries matched Denmark's rate of female participation in the labour force, the recruits would more than make up for any shortfall. 'There is a hidden labour force of at least 30m, which will be mobilised as married women increasingly take up work or return to work.' Europe's ageing workforce can expect lower statutory pensions, with higher retirement ages as the ratio of taxpayers to recipients descends from the current 2.4:1 to under two. Incentives to retire early will go, and the prospect of lower incomes will oblige seniors to work on. Employers are likely to become involved in improving pension provisions, partly through helping employees to set up appropriate schemes to which they are the main contributors, partly through incentives for later retirement. Formosa says there is still time to avoid scenarios in which pensions systems collapse under the burden of payments due. Later retirement will cut the cost of pensions by reducing the duration of payments. Some experts have suggested migration as a potential solution to the imbalance in western Europe's age structure. Coleman is adamant that this is no quick fix. The EEA countries cannot absorb significant numbers of legal migrants, other than those with specific skills for specific periods, he says: 'It seems eccentric to propose immigration for low-grade labour, especially since future demand emphasises high skills.' Importing cheap young labour would exacerbate one of Europe's biggest problems, its low productivity. Coleman argues that western Europe must deal with the impending crisis through making the best use of its own resources. It should, he says, retrain to reduce unemployment and invest in more capital-intensive processes to improve productivity. And it should mobilise more of its potential working population by making it easier for women to work, as well as by recruiting those beyond current retirement age. Canny employers can start planning now.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.   Industries:-  P9441 Administration of Social and Manpower Programs.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.

The expansion of business links in the wake of the  opening of the borders of the former socialist camp has led to  the emergence of a new sale market, where the relationship  between the sellers and buyers is determined by the offer.    Aside from big deals, such as the import of infested sugar  and corn and of other foodstuffs from the Middle East, a special  place among the various products currently on offer is taken by  the trade with arms and radioactive materials.    Armaments and Radioactive Materials Are Delivered From the  States of the Russian Federation    The dismemberment of the former Soviet Union in 1990 has led  not only to the appearance of new political forces and of new  concepts about whether to remake ""Great Russia"" or not, but also  to the redivision of the huge military arsenal of the former  USSR.    Part of this arsenal -- the nuclear part, which is deployed  in such areas of the former USSR that were suitable, from a  geographic viewpoint, for pointing missiles at capitalist  targets -- are under the control of the Western powers and will  be dismantled by 1996. The other part of this arsenal, which is  active, can jeopardize life in Central Europe and throughout the  world at any moment, not only because of the political  instability prevailing in the area of the former USSR, but also  because of the maintenance of various armed conflicts, which can  generate true nuclear holocausts at any time.    In keeping with existing treaties on nonproliferation and  nuclear disarmament, one portion of the nuclear charges  resulting from the dismantlement of the nuclear weapons of the  former USSR is earmarked for peaceful purposes, while the other  part is meant to be securely destroyed, so as not to endanger  human life and the environment.    Since the quantity of radioactive material resulting from  the  destruction of nuclear weapons is very large, a good part of it  was sold for further use either to countries in the Middle East  or to other countries currently interested in producing or  acquiring nuclear weapons. Equally true is the fact that the  former USSR countries possess mineral resources containing very  many radioactive elements, such as radium, scandium, osmium,  plutonium, and other strategic elements used in the manufacture  of nuclear weapons.    The new trade in radioactive materials has attracted people  from both the former USSR states and from the former Warsaw Pact  countries, since the profits inherent in this trade are large  and immediate.    Among the Russian companies involved in the sale of  radioactive substances, we would mention just two: LUCH-3,  whose owner is Sergey Alekseyevich Pushkin, and LEGION,  represented by Russian citizen Klynchagov [name as received].    Romanian Firms Are Involved in the Traffic of Radioactive  Materials    In a short period of time, several people from Romania --  including Niculae Costel, representative of several Romanian  companies such as ROMBEL and SIRCOM, and Elisabeta Ana  Stefanescu, owner and sole associate of TECHNOTOURS company --  have managed to establish contacts with Russian companies from  the Russian Federation and with various firms in Romania.    Under the cover of ROMBEL company, Niculae Costel managed to  contact several people and representatives of certain foreign  companies, such as EURONOR BUSINESS PARTNER Ltd., with  headquarters in Norway, DB FINANZ CONSULTING AG from Germany, or  DHS MERGER-Alois Geissler, offering to deliver red mercury,  osmium 192, radium, and scandium in quantities varying between  15 and 200 kilograms, at a cost price of $73,000 per gram, which  would be tantamount to a profit of $1 billion.    Throughout the 1992-93 period, Niculae Costel made several  visits to Russia to decide on the ways and means of delivering  the goods as well as on the amounts of hard currency to be paid  into various banks.    Codes Are Used for the Transactions of Radioactive Materials    The offers of the supplier of the respective commodity were  sent by fax, with the analysis certificate attached. The  analysis bulletins also specified the purity of the radioactive  material and the density of the other component substances.    In order to ensure the secrecy of the transaction, the two  sides used codes. The codes, containing various names such as  ""Sunshine,"" ""Apple,"" ""Stardust,"" or ""Nautilus,"" were used to  codify both the transaction and the product. For instance, the  code ""Nautilus"" was used to denote osmium 187, while the code  ""red oil"" was used for the red mercury-RM 20/20.    The letters of intent received from the party interested in  buying the product always mentioned that the transaction can  only take place after a sample of the respective material was  submitted to chemical analyses that would attest to the purity  and quality of the product. Only analysis certificates in  accordance with the ""Karpov"" and ""Frieberger"" methods are valid  for such radioactive substances.       The Transport of Red Mercury Samples Is Done With TAROM  Airplanes    Although red mercury is a nonactive substance, its  characteristics can turn it into a very strong explosive when it  merges with other chemical substances. As a matter of fact, red  mercury RM 20/20 is used in the manufacture of the neutron bomb.    Using not only her imagination, but also her relations, the  owner of TECNOTOURS company, Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu used the  Bucharest-Rome TAROM flight of 5 July 1992 -- which landed in  Rome at 1415 hours local time -- to transport a sample of red  mercury.    The red mercury sample was handed over to the airplane  captain by Rosca Stanescu, deputy commander of Otopeni Airport.  In Italy, the ""small package"" was handed over by the airplane  captain to Florin Groman, head of the TAROM office in Rome. The  package was then passed on to another man within the Rome  Airport by Florin Groman himself, who was ostentatiously  carrying a sign with the name of the individual supposed to take  over the package, namely the Italian citizen Egidio Musso.    Once the transaction was completed, Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu  told her Italian business partner, Egidio Musso, to open a  dollar account for her at the Italian bank Credito Italiano,  with herself as the only one entitled to withdraw money from  that account.    Using the ""Rosso"" code for the red mercury, Elisabeta  Stefanescu informed the Italian company OMNIA TECNO SRL, with  headquarters in the town of La Spezia, that the ""Rosso"" sample  was brought to Romania by an agent of an embassy empowered to  deal with this affair. In the same message, Elisabeta Stefanescu  -- who until 1989 had occupied various administrative posts at  several foreign diplomatic missions in Romania -- expressed the  fear that she had attracted ""too much attention"" at home.    For the same material, RM 20/20, Elisabeta Stefanescu used  the code ""992/LDEASGC/101-M"" in a transaction involving 138 kg  of red mercury for the MUELLER TREUHAND company of Zurich,  Switzerland, asking for $340,000 per kilogram. She also made  clear that the deal was concluded in Moscow with Russian  partners, with the red mercury procured from the Russian town of  Chelyabinsk.    In the July-December 1992 period, Elisabeta Stefanescu spent  a ""long vacation"" in Italy, more precisely in Lerici town,  staying at the most luxurious hotel in the region. On that  occasion, she got in touch with the business connections in  Italy and also established new contacts with people interested  in purchasing radioactive material.    At the end of a prosperous business trip abroad, she  returned  home with two boxes full of jewelry, two fur coats, two Mercedes  220D, a Nissan Patrol cross-country vehicle, and ""small gifts""  for her connections in Romania. In May 1992, Elisabeta  Stefanescu moved out of her parents' home in Londra Street No.  25 into a villa (number 45) in Snagov, which she is renting for  500,000 lei per month.    From the Trade in Red Mercury to the Trade in Military  Technology    TECNOTOURS' business turnover, which in 1992 stood at 2  billion lei, exceeded 23 billion lei in 1993, but registered  zero profits??! All this was achieved with only three employees  and a sole ""single associate,"" Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu. All  was made possible by expanding the company's sphere of activity  to include the trade in military technology.    By establishing several contacts with the Russian citizen  Anatoliy Ivanov, general director of the BIISIK [name as  received] Ltd. company, and with Eduard Hiznicenco, director of  the COMINET SRL company from Odorheiul Secuiesc, Elisabeta  Stefanescu began offering the Middle East ""market"" a whole range  of products from the Russian armaments industry: from AKM and  AK-47 machine guns -- each costing $170, with some 3 million  pieces on offer -- up to MI-26 and MI-35 helicopters, T-72 and  T-80 tanks, and MiG-29 planes, with the prices varying between  $19 million and $55 million.    The Use of Coded Messages and Other Codes in Arms  Transactions    Another private entrepreneur involved in the transactions  with radioactive materials and armaments, Niculae Costel,  representative of SIRCOM company, contacted the ROMTEHNICA  company.    In a letter marked ""confidential"" and ""ultra confidential,""  Niculae Costel informed Rear Admiral C. Raducanu, deputy chief  of the Army Supply and Equipment Service, of an impending  transaction, namely the confidential project ""Yacht,"" whose  destination was the Great Lakes region in Canada. The customer  was demanding that the name of the vessel should be kept secret  and that the Romanian crew should train the foreign crew during  the voyage. In exchange, the customer was offering, in codified  terms, ""stinger, hot, and patrol"" plus ""some money."" Meanwhile  we have managed to identify the meaning of ""stinger"" and ""hot,""  which stand for antitank missiles.     "
0,FT931-8640 ,"FT931-8640 _AN-DBRCKADRFT 930218   FT  18 FEB 93 / A battle on the Italian front: Haig Simonian on the wide-ranging problems facing the new Japanese boss of a European state steel group      By HAIG SIMONIAN   For Napoleon Bonaparte, the island of Elba represented a brief period of exile before he moved on to greater glories. For Mr Hayao Nakamura, the Japanese manager who today takes over as managing director of Italy's Ilva state steel group, the company could be the stepping stone to a bigger corporate crown, or the unenviable termination of an impressive career. Ilva - the Latin name for the iron ore-bearing Mediterranean island - was supposed to mark a fresh start for the state steel industry after the collapse of Finsider, the former public-sector steel giant, out of which Ilva was born in 1988. Instead of rising from Finsider's ashes, Ilva has staged a remarkable replay of its demise. It has been trapped in a downward spiral of rising losses and soaring borrowing, estimated to have reached L8,300bn (Pounds 3.78bn) last year. Many of the problems at Ilva, Europe's fourth-biggest steel maker after Usinor-Sacilor of France, British Steel and Thyssen of Germany, are common to the industry. Prices in Europe have dropped by about 30 per cent since 1989 as a result of recession and oversupply, notably because of cheap steel imports from eastern Europe. Last month, the outlook worsened with the threat of US duties on European steel. Yesterday, the European Commission proposed a restructuring plan for the EC's ailing steel makers in return for financial aid of at least Ecu480m (Pounds 394m) to help cover social costs. An Ilva spokesman welcomed the Commission's suggestions for action against what he called 'suspected dumping' of eastern European steel in the EC. However, he warned that 'capacity cuts by EC producers must be accompanied by measures to alleviate the social impact of the job losses involved'. Ilva is likely to remain one of Europe's weakest producers, however. 'It is in an appalling mess,' says Mr Jonathan Aylen, a lecturer in economics and steel industry specialist at Britain's Salford University. 'If you take indicators such as labour productivity, product quality or innovation, Ilva is very much in the second rank in Europe.' In 1991, Ilva lost L504bn after minority interests and setting aside L411bn in extraordinary gains in a special restructuring fund. Recently its financial decline has become alarming with losses of L1,750bn in the first 11 months of 1992. Last month, IRI, the Italian state holding company which controls Ilva, decided to draw the line. Shocked by the deterioration in Ilva's earnings - IRI had been forecasting a much lower Ilva loss of between L1,000bn and L1,300bn as recently as early January - it demanded the resignation of the steel maker's board of directors. The following day, it appointed Mr Nakamura, a former Nippon Steel executive, to the top job at Ilva. While the group's problems are symbolic of those facing most European steel makers, they are also a legacy of Italian state intervention in industry, where investments and strategic business decisions have been made as much on political as on commercial grounds. Under the government of Mr Guiliano Amato, which came to power last summer, the Italian authorities have demanded that public sector companies improve their financial performance. The government's sweeping privatisation plan is vital to lowering Italy's budget deficit, which at L163,150bn last year equals almost 11 per cent of gross domestic product. Where possible, profitable state enterprises such as the SME foods group have already been put up for sale. In the case of acute loss-makers such as Ilva, financial restructuring and management changes represent the first steps toward improving earnings and encouraging private investment. Last month's decision to seek the resignation of Ilva's former board of directors and choose a foreigner as managing director was an indication of Mr Amato's determination to minimise the influence of political considerations in industrial decision-making. Top management changes at Iritecna, the loss-making state-owned civil engineering and contracting group, suggests a similar strategy is under way there. The choice of a foreigner at Ilva was nevertheless unusual; the selection of a Japanese executive is unprecedented in one of Europe's most protected markets. But the appointment of Mr Nakamura indicates IRI, struggling to reduce group debts of nearly L70,000bn, is determined to sort out its wayward steel subsidiary. Mr Nakamura has impressive credentials. At 56, he has a solid background in the steel industry, most recently as Nippon Steel's Italian representative. Having lived in Italy for almost 30 years, he knows the country and language well. He is also one of a handful of Japanese businessmen who understand Italy's state sector. Mr Nakamura, who takes over today spent time in the 1960s as the Rome representative of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In the 1970s, he worked closely with Finsider on the expansion of its vast Taranto integrated steel works, still Italy's biggest but now a big drain on Ilva's resources. Later, he advised on the development of the Novi Ligure facility. In spite of his qualifications, observers are asking how Mr Nakamura will better the performance of his predecessor, Mr Giovanni Gambardella, in addressing Ilva's problems when most of Europe's steel makers are losing money. Mr Gambardella is blamed for many of Ilva's woes. He initiated its L1,500bn acquisition drive, which expanded its activities from basic steel making into more value-added and specialised products, such as coated steels for consumer durables. The strategy, however, drove up debts. Group borrowings surged from L3,500bn in 1989 to L6,300bn at the end of 1991. He is also accused of failing to control costs, although such attacks are harder to sustain in view of his success in closing 15 ex-Finsider plants, transferred to Ilva after 1988, and selling as many again. In the same period, the workforce was reduced by 30,000. The cut was 'quite an achievement', in view of Italy's tough labour laws, admits one IRI executive. But with earnings steadily deteriorating, the pace of cost-cutting was not quick enough, say Mr Gambardella's critics. Last November, IRI gave Ilva's former management a mid-1993 deadline to prepare a new restructuring plan. It is up to Mr Nakamura to finish the task. Speaking in Tokyo this month, Mr Nakamura indicated he would follow two paths to return Ilva to profit within three years. First, he hinted at further job cuts, notably at Taranto, and implied he would not seek consensus with the group's unionised workers at any price. Second, he hinted he wanted to change attitudes at the steel group. Ilva had some of the world's most modern plant - much of it built in collaboration with Nippon Steel - but suffered from weaknesses such as poor quality, bad marketing and unreliable delivery times. The three had fostered excessive wastage, inadequate attention to customers and lax financial controls. Improving such faults would require a greater sense of commitment from the workforce, he suggested. Joining the group as a rank outsider may help Mr Nakamura take painful decisions on further redundancies and closures. 'He has to do for Italian steel what Ian MacGregor (then chairman) did for British Steel about 10 years ago,' says Mr Aylen, of Salford University. But failing a surprise upturn in demand, it is hard to see how much extra room for cost-cutting Mr Nakamura will have. Mr Nakamura dismissed suggestions that his appointment marked a bridgehead for Nippon Steel to purchase a stake in Ilva or mount an outright takeover, although he left the door open for closer technological co-operation. Above all, he echoed Mr Gambardella in stressing Ilva's need for fresh capital to reduce borrowings. Last year, Ilva's former bosses openly discussed gaining a stock market quotation - and access to fresh money  - by buying out minority shareholders in its Dalmine tubes subsidiary and merging the two companies. That may still be on the cards, although the move will depend on first transferring the bulk of Ilva's debts to a separate company to make it more attractive to investors. A similar manoeuvre took place on Ilva's birth, when Finsider was retained as an empty shell containing about two-thirds of the group's L9,000bn debts. Just possibly, Mr Nakamura's arrival at Ilva could persuade outside investors that the company has the potential to be an interesting recovery stock. Contacts with foreign bankers had already taken place under the previous management. But before outsiders offer to help, the group will first have to show it is willing to tackle its problems fast and effectively.  ----------------------------------------- ILVA at a glance  ----------------------------------------- Group sales 1989   L10,556bn 1990   L10,611bn 1991   L10,608bn  ----------------------------------------- Group net profits and (loss)* 1989   L208bn 1990   L115bn 1991   (L504bn)**  ----------------------------------------- * After minority interests ** After setting aside L411bn in special restructuring fund  ----------------------------------------- Source: company reports  -----------------------------------------   Companies:-  Ilva.

The Labour government won a deal with the opposition to allow exploration in the Skagerrak strait, but agreed to make further environmental studies before starting drilling. The opposition Conservative party backed the plan in return for a government promise to review controversial rules allowing the state to raise its stake in profitable oil and gas fields. The new exploration areas will open up 16 per cent more of Norway's continental shelf for prospecting, making it possible to drill under 56 per cent of the waters off the coast. Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer, currently pumps some 2.5m barrels a day, mostly from the North Sea. Output, however, is expected to fall in few years unless new discoveries are made. Sweden, fearing pollution from oil prospecting in the waters between itself, Norway and Denmark, has requested inter-government talks before a decision is made. Norway's state pollution board has sharply criticised previous studies of the consequences of opening Skagerrak and areas off mid-Norway for exploration, calling them inadequate.

0,FT922-2388 ,"FT922-2388 _AN-CFQA6ADPFT 920617   FT  17 JUN 92 / Big cuts in nuclear arsenals agreed by Bush and Yeltsin      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   SWEEPING arms cuts to reduce the number of nuclear warheads in Russian and US possession by more than two-thirds were agreed in Washington yesterday. President George Bush and President Boris Yeltsin agreed to a two-phase plan to cut their arsenals of warheads for long-range nuclear weapons to between 3,000 and 3,500 each by the year 2003. They also agreed to eliminate the multiple warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), seen as the most menacing of all nuclear weapons. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, has been working for the past five months with his Russian counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, on a pact to take nuclear disarmament beyond the cuts agreed last year in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start.) This treaty would have reduced the US arsenal from about 10,000 warheads to some 8,500, including 1,400 loaded on ICBMs and 3,450 on submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The total Soviet force of about 10,200 warheads would have been cut to 6,450, including 3,150 loaded on ICBMs. Although the deadline for completing the new arms cuts is 2003, Mr Bush said they could be completed by the year 2000 if the US helped Russia to accelerate the destruction process. 'With this agreement, the nuclear night recedes,' Mr Bush said. Mr Yeltsin added that the agreement mirrored the fundamental change in relationship between Russia and the US. The Russian president said that, instead of laying down strict parity, each country could select its own force structure within the 3,000-3,500 target range. 'We know one thing: we shall not fight against each other,' Mr Yeltsin said. The agreement also provides for Russia and the US to work together on developing a 'concept' for a system of global defence against missiles, as well as opening the possibility of sharing early warning information. The disarmament pact will provide a capstone for the meeting, the first formal summit since the collapse of the Soviet Union. But the agreement seemed to be overshadowed yesterday, in terms of US public opinion, by Mr Yeltsin's revelation that some US prisoners of war might still be alive in Russia. The Russian leader raised this possibility on Monday, striking a chord with US citizens, most of whom believe that some US servicemen listed as missing in action during the Vietnam war are still held captive. Following the announcement of the arms reductions, Mr Yeltsin said he believed US POWs may still be alive in the former Soviet Union, saying he would join Mr Bush in pursuing a full-scale investigation. Mr Bush said a team of investigators would be sent to Moscow immediately to look into the fate of missing US servicemen. He said Mr Yeltsin told him that the prisoners taken by the Soviet Union included those from the Vietnam era and from earlier wars. While Mr Bush said there was no evidence that any of these Americans were still alive, he praised the Russian leader for agreeing to open the archives of the KGB and the Central Committee of the Communist party to help in the search. Downing Street said that the British government had been in close consultation with the US on the arms reduction discussions well before the summit. Last night, Mr John Major 'warmly welcomed' what he described as a far-reaching agreement.  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "

Cocaine is also a lower health risk than heroin, and I suspect he would find the medium-term effects of either fix unpalatable. The basic economic argument is clear, and cannot be repeated too often. It is that fixed exchange rates in an environment of less than free capital and labour markets, both in mobility and price, worsen regional recessions. Europe's labour markets are far from free, and we are facing a big employment challenge now and for the foreseeable future. The introduction of fixed rates can only make that challenge harder. As Germany will not accept a common currency, but would accept fixed rates, I expect we will get them, and the unemployed somewhere in Europe will be paying for Mr Jackson's 'relief from the cost and fuss of changing currencies'.

0,FT944-12025 ,"FT944-12025 _AN-EKCEGADSFT 941103   FT  03 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A bank for peace   The Casablanca conference on Middle East economic development has played a valuable role in dismantling psychological barriers. It also came up with a concrete proposal to that end, in agreeing to work towards the creation of a regional development bank. Pan-regional economic institutions - on trade, for example, and water - will be essential if peace is to be consolidated and trust built between ancient enemies. It is questionable, however, whether a bank is the best means to that end. Putting flesh on the bare bones of the proposed Middle East and North Africa Development Bank, and achieving a funding target of Dollars 10bn, will prove challenging. The yet to be selected 'group of experts' who will examine policy options for the bank should look closely at the chequered history of others in Asia, Africa and the Americas. One obvious lesson is that regional development banks have fared best when operating in relatively well-managed economies where project lending might have a better than average chance of proving profitable. The experience of the African Development Bank shows how difficult this can be. At the end of last year, over 39 per cent of its outstanding loans were to just four countries: Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria, the last two scarcely models of third world development. The percentage of loans going to the north of the continent is predicted to increase as investment opportunities decrease in sub-Saharan Africa. Significantly, those four countries would expect to be members of, and beneficiaries from, the new bank, an unnecessary duplication which cannot be left unresolved. Similar problems exist with the potentially overlapping activities of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Islamic Development Bank - not to mention the World Bank itself. The management of any new bank would need simultaneously to make Herculean efforts to loosen the link in the Middle East between politics and economic assistance. Arab countries bordering Israel have long been rewarded by one paymaster or another, according to political stance, not to economic performance. Israel still enjoys substantial and largely uncritical US assistance, while the Palestine Liberation Organisation is already showing all the symptoms of the aid addict in its demands for unfettered cash assistance. Regional governments will continue to emphasise the threat of Islamic extremism in an effort to ensure that political aid is not reduced. But it has been the very failure of those regimes to manage their economies efficiently which has created the conditions in which extremism flourishes. It is welcome that Middle Eastern governments are discussing ways in which they can work together. But a bank along the lines suggested is not the best form of co-operation - and certainly should not be the only one.   Countries:-  MZZ  Mozambique, Africa.     XNZ  Middle East.

Mr Yasutaka Moriguchi, the director of the nuclear fuel division of Japan's atomic energy bureau, says, however, that plans have been made to consume all this quantity, including shipments from Thorp, the UK reprocessing facility which has long-term contracts to handle Japan's waste nuclear fuel. In a letter to the FT Mr Moriguchi says today that 10-20 tonnes will be used for research and development of fast-breeder reactors, and about 10 tonnes for research and development for advanced thermal reactors. A further 50 tonnes will be used to make fuel for light-water reactors. Mr Moriguchi says Japan's plans for plutonium have slipped because of delays in the schedule to build its own reprocessing plant and develop fast-breeder reactors. This has also reduced both the demand and supply of plutonium. But, he says, 'the prospect that Japan will have no surplus of plutonium including that from Thorp is strictly maintained'. Japan has two options to deal with the plutonium that is produced as part of the spent fuel from its existing reactors, Mr Moriguchi says. It can either use it to make more fuel, or dispose of it. Japan believes that the environmental impact of reprocessing it will be smaller, which is why it has a policy of using plutonium as a fuel for nuclear reactors. Mr Moriguchi is one of a number of senior Japanese officials who have responded to a call by a group of Japanese MPs for a renegotiation of Japan's reprocessing contracts with British Nuclear Fuels, the owner of Thorp. Their interventions come as the UK government is conducting a consultation on whether to give the go-ahead for the start-up of Thorp, which cost Pounds 2.8bn to build and has a number of long-term contracts with foreign nuclear utilities. Japan would be the largest foreign customer of Thorp if it came into operation. The two biggest domestic customers of Thorp had serious doubts about the project in the 1980s and argued against reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel in favour of storage, according to a report by BBC Television's Panorama to be shown tonight. The programme also reveals that British Nuclear Fuels has been dismantling fuel since the late 1980s and suggests this might mean there is no alternative but to make Thorp operational. BNF so far has dismantled 90 per cent of the 1,800 tonnes of British spent fuel, removing its outer casing and storing it in water, Panorama adds. It claims that the Central Electricity Generating Board, Thorp's biggest customer, and Scottish Nuclear, its second-biggest, both believed that storage was a better solution than reprocessing spent fuel but could not withdraw support from Thorp for 'political reasons'.

The troop withdrawal from Germany - Russian soldiers are pictured (right) marching past the Soviet war memorial yesterday in Berlin - was the lead item on the evening news of the main television channel. Reporters stressed the army's role in crushing fascism, screening pictures of swarming Russian troops and exploding swastikas. The army newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, struck a note of caution saying the balance of power between Russia and Germany was vital for Europe's stability. The withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states merited just the briefest mention on television news.

0,FT941-9983 ,"FT941-9983 _AN-EBKCTAEFFT 940211   FT  11 FEB 94 / How GM steered clear of the abyss: The US group's success in limiting Europe's recessionary damage      By KEVIN DONE   General Motors' European operations suffered a 54.6 per cent decline in net profits last year, but the US group is expected to remain Europe's most profitable volume carmaker. Apart from GM, only Renault of France among the big six European volume carmakers is expected to report a profit for 1993. Volkswagen, of Germany, and Fiat, of Italy, have both plunged into loss, while Ford, GM's US rival, disclosed this week that its European automotive operations had suffered a third successive loss in 1993. New car sales in west Europe fell by an estimated 15.2 per cent to 11.45m last year, the steepest annual decline in the post-war period, which has left much of the European motor industry awash with red ink. GM, now firmly established in second place in the west European new car market, has remained in the black throughout the recession, however, and believes the worst is over. Mr Paul Schmidt, GM Europe finance director, said yesterday: 'We are counting on 1994 being more profitable than 1993.' GM's net profits from its European operations declined to Dollars 604.7m (Pounds 414m), from Dollars 1.3bn in 1992. Its results were burdened by one-off exchange rate losses of about Dollars 450m and by some Dollars 400m in restructuring charges. The net profit of the core Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations fell to about Dollars 600m from Dollars 1.4bn. Opel fell into loss in Germany, but GM made profits at Vauxhall in the UK and in Spain. In contrast to its fortunes in the US, where it is still a high-cost producer, GM's Opel/Vauxhall operations are among the most productive in Europe. It has gained a big advantage over Ford of Europe, for example, in the capital efficiency of its new model development programmes, and it was the first carmaker in Europe to discover the profits potential from driving down purchasing costs. The success of its model range has allowed it steadily to increase market share - to 13 per cent last year - while avoiding the worst excesses of heavy marketing costs. Its main marque - Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK (the cars are technically identical) - is the biggest selling make in the west European market, and GM has achieved a more even spread of market share than its rivals. While Fiat and Volkswagen are still heavily dependent on their home markets, GM has secured a share of at least 10 per cent in 12 countries in west Europe, and is among the top three in 12 out of 17 national markets. While it moved much earlier than Volkswagen and Fiat to increase productivity in Europe - unfortunately the lessons only penetrated belatedly into GM's North American bureaucracy - it was still forced to cut its European workforce last year, to keep pace with the steep decline in the overall market and to bring down stock levels. GM's overall European workforce declined to 131,000 at the end of 1993 from 141,000 a year earlier, but this includes all GM activities from EDS data processing to Hughes Electronics and vehicle components manufacture. The workforce of the Opel/Vauxhall operations fell by 8 per cent to 85,000 (including 16,000 salaried employees) at the end of 1993, from 92,000 (including 17,000 salaried employees) a year earlier. It also imposed widespread short-time working at its European assembly plants and was forced to cut a total of 450 shifts. GM car and light commercial vehicle production in Europe, including small volume assembly in Hungary and Turkey, fell last year by 16.9 per cent to 1,435,520. Having started later on painful slimming courses - and with less success in the marketplace to soften the blows - GM's rivals in Europe have been forced to make more swingeing cuts in their workforces, often at the cost of sinking morale.

But there is little to indicate that governments are preparing to tear down Europe's traditional welfare systems. In spite of British crowing that the debate is moving 'inexorably in the direction we have been advocating for some time,' as Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, concluded, Britain's partners are not about to rip up the EC's social charter. 'No monster or dragon has been slain by the British delegation,' insisted a senior European Commission official. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the social democrat prime minister of Denmark who chaired the summit, went out of his way to stress that the 12 had begun a debate on jobs and competitiveness 'without questioning the basic principles of our social welfare system.' But what has started is a radical rethink on labour costs and flexibility, and on ways the EC can regain competitive advantage and restore growth. This debate will certainly reshape thinking on EC social policy, a debate likely to be complicated by sharp differences over whether the EC should develop an industrial strategy. Behind the fuzzy outline of Mr Delors' presentation on jobs and competitiveness is the conviction that Europe cannot compete with Japan and the US, let alone, with eastern Europe and China, simply by driving down wage and non-wage costs. Part of Mr Delors' solution is that the EC must 'trade up' into ever higher added value activity. This means much more spending on infrastructure, research and development and training. Liberal member states, with the UK in the vanguard, see a disguised industrial policy behind such prescriptions, which Mr Delors failed to insert in the Maastricht treaty, and in the seven-year EC finance package agreed at the Edinburgh summit. The UK has already objected to Brussels plans to reform the Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.71bn) EC social fund, by siphoning off funds targeted on young and long-term unemployed to allow companies undergoing restructuring to retrain their workers. Other parts of the Delors prescription, like more spending on active labour market policies, more job-sharing, and switching taxes on labour to eco-taxes on energy and natural resources, reflect a shift in emphasis towards those without jobs and away from setting terms for those in work. A green paper on the future of social policy, due from the Commission in the autumn, will confirm the shift. But neither Brussels nor the UK's partners are likely to abandon outstanding draft laws derived from the Social Charter. Mr Major singled out the recently passed working time directive, and Brussels proposals to protect part-time and young workers and acquired employment rights, as particularly 'muddle-headed meddling', and argued that all proposals should be screened for their impact on costs and competitiveness. This is likely to happen more and more. Despite the opt-out, the UK has had to fight hard to dilute measures it abhors, like the working time directive. It is having to negotiate assiduously on measures its partners may introduce under the social chapter. Nevertheless the UK is right in believing costs have moved up the social agenda of all its partners. When the working time directive was finalised this month, a so-called no-regression clause - a pledge by the 11 not to use concessions designed for the British to backslide on their own working time conditions - was struck out without demur.

Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger writes  frequently for The Times.      NEW YORK      Whatever the evolution of Germany, existing security arrangements based on the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact are eroding. The  collapse of Soviet power in Central Europe coincides with a declining fear in  the Western democracies of military threat. Hence, President Bush's proposal to  reduce superpower troops on the Continent.    One political approach is to accelerate arms-control negotiations. But  upheavals in Europe have not only overthrown communist regimes but also some of  the premises of traditional arms-control theory. The attempt to negotiate a  balance on both sides of the existing military line in the center of Germany is  no longer realistic. When the current stage of conventional-arms negotiations  began, the military and political demarcation lines were identical. And because  the current stage of negotiation is confined to thinning out U.S. and Soviet  forces, it does not depend so critically on the location of dividing lines.  When that negotiation is completed, attention must turn to designing  comprehensive security systems. Then a fact must be faced: Military and  political dividing lines are no longer congruent. The military line runs  through Germany; the political one is located at the Soviet-Polish frontier.    A line through the center of Germany can no longer be appropriate after the two  German states have held elections later this year. Two democratic states  drawing ever closer together, governed by parties professing comparable  ideologies, cannot possibly belong to two opposing alliance systems for any  length of time. Such an incongruity would make the West -- in the name of arms  control -- a partner in the division of Germany and put at risk Germany's  pro-Western orientation.    The simplest approach would be to move the dividing line for European  arms-control arrangements from the frontier between the two German states to  the German-Polish frontier. The obstacle is that nations of Eastern Europe  would be extremely reluctant to be grouped with the Soviet Union. NATO and the  Warsaw Pact are simply not symmetrical institutions today -- if they ever were.  The Warsaw Pact has lost military rationale and will lose political purpose  with the advent of democratic governments.    How can symmetrical force levels be established along a dividing line that  includes Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, which have already demanded  withdrawal of Soviet forces? Must NATO be dismantled to keep pace with  disintegration of the Warsaw Pact? That would turn pact weakness into a  rationalization for dissolving NATO -- a goal the Warsaw Pact failed to achieve  when it was still relatively cohesive.    In future arms-control negotiations, the United States must not legitimize a  larger Soviet military presence in Central Europe than the Soviet Union could  maintain on its own. At the same time it must not encourage the impression that  a complete Soviet withdrawal will have to be matched by a complete American  withdrawal from Europe. Geographic proximity enables the Soviet Union to be a  major military factor in Central Europe, while an American withdrawal across  the Atlantic would destroy the possibility of a balance of power on the  Continent.    A new European security system should reassure the Soviet Union with respect to  its historic nightmare of invasion from the West; ease Western Europe's fear of  Soviet invasion; protect the countries of Eastern Europe against Soviet  aggression and German resurgence; reflect the reality -- demonstrated by two  world wars -- that a balance on the Continent requires U.S. participation, and  be compatible with some reasonable process of German unification.    Establishment of such a system is primarily a political issue, not one of arms  control. The key is the future evolution of Germany. There are in fact only  three possible political outcomes: that Germany remain divided along the  existing military demarcation lines; that Germany be unified as a neutral state  with a status similar to that of Austria or Finland; that Germany be unified  within NATO.    The permanent division of Germany would produce a chronic crisis by tempting  outside powers either to exploit or to stimulate intra-German conflict.    The concept of a unified and neutral Germany has a surface plausibility but  grave underlying problems, perhaps especially for the Soviet Union.  Neutralization is most easily verifiable in countries that do not yet possess  state-of-the-art technology. The larger the state and the more complex its  economy, the more difficult to determine its real military potential. Japan,  for example, could approach military superpower status soon after deciding to  do so.    A free-standing, unified Germany would be in much the same position. Indeed  after a few years it might repeat Germany's historic mistake of attempting to  achieve its own independent security, an enterprise that twice in this century  produced global catastrophe.    But Germany as part of NATO would be under the arms-control umbrella of allies  with a vested interest in observing agreed limitations.    An Austrian-type solution for Germany would create a single bloc from the  French-German frontier to the Polish-Soviet border, of states with similar  international status and therefore propelled toward joint diplomacy. Surely  there is no better formula for eventual German hegemony over Central Europe or  a long-term German-Russian conflict.    Ideally, a new security system for Europe should possess the following  elements:    * The countries of Eastern Europe -- with the exception of the German  Democratic Republic -- would be given a status similar to Austria or Finland.  They would be politically neutral and agree to a regime of limited armaments  specified by treaty and guaranteed internationally.    * Germany would begin the process of unification with a confederation; its  first task would be to negotiate a peace treaty acknowledging current external  frontiers.    * Germany would remain in NATO if it wished, but the territory of the current  German Democratic Republic would be demilitarized and all German military  forces limited by agreement.    * Foreign forces on German soil would be dramatically reduced.    * Nuclear weapons and foreign forces on West German soil would be pulled back  west from the East German border to an agreed line nearer the French-Benelux  borders.    Obviously such a scheme is illustrative, permitting numerous permutations. A  five-year transitional period during which some Soviet forces remain in Central  Europe seems entirely reasonable. But the basic objectives need to be  established soon, before the existing politically incongruous military  demarcation lines are again frozen in place.    In my view, the scheme outlined here would meet everyone's political and  security concerns to some extent. Such an outcome would bring about coincidence  between political and military demarcation lines. An agreed, managed process of  German unification would ease an otherwise festering crisis. The Soviets would  acquire a buffer glacis of about 800 miles; a zone of limited armaments between  the Rhine and the Elbe; a significant reduction of U.S. forces; a demilitarized  area on territory of the current German Democratic Republic, and a neutral belt  in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Western Europe would gain the same  glacis in reverse.    Many thoughtful policy-makers shrink from tackling the German issue because,  while recognizing its complexity, they fear that tackling it head-on might  overthrow Mikhail S. Gorbachev. I believe procrastination would produce the  most dangerous consequences. Gorbachev surely deserves great respect for his  willingness to confront the crisis of his society.    But the West does neither Gorbachev nor itself a favor by pretending that the  structural changes Gorbachev's policies have impelled can be calibrated by  arcane analysis of his domestic position. One way or another, the process now  under way will proceed on many fronts: In an election year for both Germanys,  the drive for unification will surely develop its own momentum; various  parliaments will be reducing NATO defense budgets, and different national  leaders will push individual arms-control proposals. Hence waiting on events is  an invitation to chaos and to the unilateral dismantling of institutions that  have brought us this far.    Another school of thought holds that even if Gorbachev's domestic position is  less precarious than feared, neither he nor any successor could ever agree to a  security system that retains U.S. forces in Europe and does not require the  dissolution of NATO. Yet so many recent events were regarded as inconceivable  until they actually occurred, one should be careful not to assume certainty  about Soviet conduct.    It may be that no security system will be able to contain the process now under  way. In time Germany may become neutral -- by its own choice or in response to  a Soviet offer. Improbable as it now seems, a German initiative cannot be ruled  out if German disillusionment with Western lack of support for its national  aspirations continues to grow. And sooner or later the Soviet Union may play  its ""German card"" -- exchanging unification for neutrality -- reckless as it  would be for Soviet security in the long run. Whether Germany would accept it  would depend not so much on exhortations as on the strength of its ties with  the West.    Painful as I would find such a development, the United States would have no  reason to panic. Instead it should offer to preserve NATO for whatever core  group of the Atlantic Alliance wishes it. In my view, that offer would be  accepted with alacrity by Western Europe as a hedge against German revanchism  or renewed Soviet aggressiveness.    In short, NATO is needed for the internal West European balance and as a  guarantee of European security. While U.S. deployments in Europe and the  overall strength of NATO should take account of the declining military threat,  abolishing NATO cannot be a quid pro quo for the ailments of the Warsaw Pact.  What NATO must do is redefine the threat it is supposed to deal with, the  strategy appropriate to it and the organization needed to reflect the changed  roles of Europe and the United States.    The security system outlined here implies an important change in NATO doctrine.  But the status quo is certain to be undermined by the random moves on arms  control, German unification and legislative defense budget-cutting throughout  the West that the absence of a coherent Western approach invites.    History does not produce automatic results. It requires conscious action -- a  recognition of the historic moment. Our arrival time can be flexible but  agreeing on the destination brooks no delay.      Opinion    "," LA020490-0196   171614    February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition      Opinion; Part M; Page 1; Column 2; Opinion Desk      1788 words      DRAWING FINE POLITICAL LINES FOR EUROPE'S FUTURE      By Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger writes  frequently for The Times.      NEW YORK      Whatever the evolution of Germany, existing security arrangements based on the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact are eroding. The  collapse of Soviet power in Central Europe coincides with a declining fear in  the Western democracies of military threat. Hence, President Bush's proposal to  reduce superpower troops on the Continent.    One political approach is to accelerate arms-control negotiations. But  upheavals in Europe have not only overthrown communist regimes but also some of  the premises of traditional arms-control theory. The attempt to negotiate a  balance on both sides of the existing military line in the center of Germany is  no longer realistic. When the current stage of conventional-arms negotiations  began, the military and political demarcation lines were identical. And because  the current stage of negotiation is confined to thinning out U.S. and Soviet  forces, it does not depend so critically on the location of dividing lines.  When that negotiation is completed, attention must turn to designing  comprehensive security systems. Then a fact must be faced: Military and  political dividing lines are no longer congruent. The military line runs  through Germany; the political one is located at the Soviet-Polish frontier.    A line through the center of Germany can no longer be appropriate after the two  German states have held elections later this year. Two democratic states  drawing ever closer together, governed by parties professing comparable  ideologies, cannot possibly belong to two opposing alliance systems for any  length of time. Such an incongruity would make the West -- in the name of arms  control -- a partner in the division of Germany and put at risk Germany's  pro-Western orientation.    The simplest approach would be to move the dividing line for European  arms-control arrangements from the frontier between the two German states to  the German-Polish frontier. The obstacle is that nations of Eastern Europe  would be extremely reluctant to be grouped with the Soviet Union. NATO and the  Warsaw Pact are simply not symmetrical institutions today -- if they ever were.  The Warsaw Pact has lost military rationale and will lose political purpose  with the advent of democratic governments.    How can symmetrical force levels be established along a dividing line that  includes Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, which have already demanded  withdrawal of Soviet forces? Must NATO be dismantled to keep pace with  disintegration of the Warsaw Pact? That would turn pact weakness into a  rationalization for dissolving NATO -- a goal the Warsaw Pact failed to achieve  when it was still relatively cohesive.    In future arms-control negotiations, the United States must not legitimize a  larger Soviet military presence in Central Europe than the Soviet Union could  maintain on its own. At the same time it must not encourage the impression that  a complete Soviet withdrawal will have to be matched by a complete American  withdrawal from Europe. Geographic proximity enables the Soviet Union to be a  major military factor in Central Europe, while an American withdrawal across  the Atlantic would destroy the possibility of a balance of power on the  Continent.    A new European security system should reassure the Soviet Union with respect to  its historic nightmare of invasion from the West; ease Western Europe's fear of  Soviet invasion; protect the countries of Eastern Europe against Soviet  aggression and German resurgence; reflect the reality -- demonstrated by two  world wars -- that a balance on the Continent requires U.S. participation, and  be compatible with some reasonable process of German unification.    Establishment of such a system is primarily a political issue, not one of arms  control. The key is the future evolution of Germany. There are in fact only  three possible political outcomes: that Germany remain divided along the  existing military demarcation lines; that Germany be unified as a neutral state  with a status similar to that of Austria or Finland; that Germany be unified  within NATO.    The permanent division of Germany would produce a chronic crisis by tempting  outside powers either to exploit or to stimulate intra-German conflict.    The concept of a unified and neutral Germany has a surface plausibility but  grave underlying problems, perhaps especially for the Soviet Union.  Neutralization is most easily verifiable in countries that do not yet possess  state-of-the-art technology. The larger the state and the more complex its  economy, the more difficult to determine its real military potential. Japan,  for example, could approach military superpower status soon after deciding to  do so.    A free-standing, unified Germany would be in much the same position. Indeed  after a few years it might repeat Germany's historic mistake of attempting to  achieve its own independent security, an enterprise that twice in this century  produced global catastrophe.    But Germany as part of NATO would be under the arms-control umbrella of allies  with a vested interest in observing agreed limitations.    An Austrian-type solution for Germany would create a single bloc from the  French-German frontier to the Polish-Soviet border, of states with similar  international status and therefore propelled toward joint diplomacy. Surely  there is no better formula for eventual German hegemony over Central Europe or  a long-term German-Russian conflict.    Ideally, a new security system for Europe should possess the following  elements:    * The countries of Eastern Europe -- with the exception of the German  Democratic Republic -- would be given a status similar to Austria or Finland.  They would be politically neutral and agree to a regime of limited armaments  specified by treaty and guaranteed internationally.    * Germany would begin the process of unification with a confederation; its  first task would be to negotiate a peace treaty acknowledging current external  frontiers.    * Germany would remain in NATO if it wished, but the territory of the current  German Democratic Republic would be demilitarized and all German military  forces limited by agreement.    * Foreign forces on German soil would be dramatically reduced.    * Nuclear weapons and foreign forces on West German soil would be pulled back  west from the East German border to an agreed line nearer the French-Benelux  borders.    Obviously such a scheme is illustrative, permitting numerous permutations. A  five-year transitional period during which some Soviet forces remain in Central  Europe seems entirely reasonable. But the basic objectives need to be  established soon, before the existing politically incongruous military  demarcation lines are again frozen in place.    In my view, the scheme outlined here would meet everyone's political and  security concerns to some extent. Such an outcome would bring about coincidence  between political and military demarcation lines. An agreed, managed process of  German unification would ease an otherwise festering crisis. The Soviets would  acquire a buffer glacis of about 800 miles; a zone of limited armaments between  the Rhine and the Elbe; a significant reduction of U.S. forces; a demilitarized  area on territory of the current German Democratic Republic, and a neutral belt  in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Western Europe would gain the same  glacis in reverse.    Many thoughtful policy-makers shrink from tackling the German issue because,  while recognizing its complexity, they fear that tackling it head-on might  overthrow Mikhail S. Gorbachev. I believe procrastination would produce the  most dangerous consequences. Gorbachev surely deserves great respect for his  willingness to confront the crisis of his society.    But the West does neither Gorbachev nor itself a favor by pretending that the  structural changes Gorbachev's policies have impelled can be calibrated by  arcane analysis of his domestic position. One way or another, the process now  under way will proceed on many fronts: In an election year for both Germanys,  the drive for unification will surely develop its own momentum; various  parliaments will be reducing NATO defense budgets, and different national  leaders will push individual arms-control proposals. Hence waiting on events is  an invitation to chaos and to the unilateral dismantling of institutions that  have brought us this far.    Another school of thought holds that even if Gorbachev's domestic position is  less precarious than feared, neither he nor any successor could ever agree to a  security system that retains U.S. forces in Europe and does not require the  dissolution of NATO.

The Federal Government also wants to support the  European Union [EU] efforts to help Ukraine. Kinkel spoke in  favor of an early partnership agreement between the European  Union and Ukraine.    Kinkel met in Bonn with members of a Ukrainian delegation,  including Foreign Minister Zlenko, Economics Minister Shpek,  Foreign Trade Minister Slyepichev, and Health Minister  Spizhenko. For Minister Slyepichev, Bonn is one of the most  important supporters of economic reforms in Ukraine.  ""Integration in the world market is decisive for our reforms,""  he stated in an interview with HANDELSBLATT. Since Chancellor  Kohl visited President Kravchuk in Kiev last year, the exchange  of views and information has become decisively faster and better.    For Kiev, it is important to intensify the dialogue with  institutions like GATT, the World Bank, the IMF, and the  European Union to ensure that ""we can participate in the  international division of labor without any restrictions."" He  sees a considerable market potential for Ukraine's independent  space industry (including missile technology, radar plants, and  satellites) and, above all, in the agricultural industry.    Slyepichev strongly rejected the often-voiced criticism by  Western observers that there is not sufficient readiness for  reform in Ukraine, that reforms are even being delayed. Ukraine  even adopted more far-reaching reform laws in some areas than  other reform states. No other country has so few restrictions  for foreign investors who want to buy land within the framework  of joint ventures or who want to establish enterprises.    A list of 30,000 state-owned enterprises which are to be  privatized in the course of this year will shortly be published.  In fact, large and commercial enterprises are involved, but  small and medium-sized enterprises represent the majority. A  modification of rules designed to promote joint ventures more  effectively is also expected for this year.    One of the reasons for Ukraine's poor image is probably  ""that  some media view Ukraine through special glasses."" When  assessing the country, one must not forget -- ""which usually  happens"" -- that it was not possible for Ukraine to develop  economic structures of its own in the past decades. ""We were  always part of the Soviet economic system.""    Slyepichev rules out Ukrainian membership in the ruble zone.  ""If we wanted to join the ruble zone, we would not negotiate  loans or a stabilization fund with the IMF."" Generally, it is  important to stabilize the currencies. He does not foresee any  negative consequences, such as losses in foreign exchange  holdings.    Slyepichev also sees positive aspects for his country  resulting the agreement on the ruble zone between Belarus and  the Russian Federation. Trade with the neighboring country  Belarus, for example, can be carried out and cleared much more  smoothly. Kiev is now negotiating a credit worth $700 million  -- an IMF delegation is currently visiting Kiev -- but,  according to Slyepichev, an additional fund should be discussed  to stabilize the Ukrainian currency. ""It takes much too long  until the IMF actually provides the money, but our currency must  be stabilized in the near future.""    Slyepichev sees a clear link between Western credits and  President Kravchuk's promise to disarm the nuclear weapons  inherited from the former USSR. Health Minister Yuriy Spizhenko  also believes that Ukraine's readiness to eliminate the nuclear  weapons arsenal has a certain ""market value."" ""In fact, we are  the only state in the world that wants to eliminate its nuclear  weapons completely. One reason is Chernobyl."" Thus, Ukraine  hopes for humanitarian aid so that the enormous problems  concerning medical care can be settled.    The consequences of the Chernobyl disaster are not even in  the foreground: ""We have much more severe problems in the  treatment of diabetes or in the sphere of anesthesia."" The  establishment of insulin factories is urgently required. The  plans exist, and thus Ukraine is waiting for foreign aid to  realize them according to the motto: We exchange weapons for  health.     "
0,FT922-9340 ,"FT922-9340 _AN-CEHA7AA7FT 920508   FT  08 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Ukraine's role   THE CURRENT visit to the US of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, is an attempt to gain international respect. Up to now, Ukrainians feel they have been treated like little brothers to the Russians, patronised and told off when they annoy the adults. There is some justice in the grievance. Ukraine is a state the size of France with a population close to that of Britain. It has considerable agricultural potential and its industrial base is huge. Most urgently, it has large nuclear and conventional forces. In the short term the international community will judge the Ukraine by the degree of responsibility it shows in dismantling this arsenal. In his talks in Washington Mr Kravchuk promised to remove most strategic weapons and to move tactical nuclear weapons to Russia for destruction. But his pledge to implement the Start agreement still leaves 46 strategic nuclear weapons in Ukraine and Mr Kravchuk wants to trade these for a US security guarantee. At a time when Russo-Ukrainian relations are worsening over a host of issues from the Black Sea fleet to Crimea, Russia would inevitably interpret this as a hostile act. Ukraine originally offered to give up all its strategic weapons. That is what it should still do. If it wishes its legitimate security concerns to be shared with the west, it must develop a serious dialogue, not proclaim its intention to be nuclear-free one day and appear to change its mind the next. But both Russia and the west should then make clear in tangible ways their recognition of Ukraine's good sense and maturity. More broadly, Russia and Ukraine - as closely tied as the US and Canada - need to cast away the idea that future relations should be shadowed by a nuclear threat. Ukraine is far too important, and the issues surrounding it too dangerous, to be any longer patronised and downgraded. It deserves the respect it wishes - so long as that respect is mutual.

KEY TARGETS ARE WITHIN ITS RANGE.      By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ABOARD THE USNS MERCY      Iraq launched a ballistic missile Friday for the second time in two days,  sending U.S. troops to their battle stations in preparation for war. The flight  path, however, did not threaten allied forces, and the alert was canceled 90  minutes later.    The Pentagon said the test-firing of a Soviet-made Scud-B missile was the third  such launching this month. The missile was aimed away from U.S. and allied  troops deployed in Saudi Arabia, officials said, and its flight path was  entirely within Iraq's borders.    Even so, American troops, who have been in a state of heightened alert since  before Christmas, have treated each missile launching as though it were the  first shot of an all-out war.    Here aboard the hospital ship Mercy, a 1,000-bed vessel anchored in the Persian  Gulf, word of the firing was flashed from U.S. communications personnel in  Bahrain to the bridge in a classified message.    The mate on watch passed it within seconds to the wardroom, where the master of  the civilian-crewed ship, Dan O'Brien of Reno, and the commanding officer of  the medical contingent, Navy Capt. Paul Barry of Buffalo, N.Y., were meeting.    Bells blasted through the corridors of the 900-foot-long vessel, and O'Brien  told the sailors and merchant marines over the public address system: ""A  missile has been launched. This is not a drill. All personnel take your  emergency stations. I say again, this is not a drill. Attention on board. A  Scud missile has been launched.""    Sailors in firefighting suits trotted to their positions in the unlikely event  that the Mercy -- a converted tanker that once carried oil from the Mideast to  the West under the name of the SS Worth -- was the target. A group of  journalists were issued gas masks. The flight deck was closed to non-emergency  personnel. O'Brien ordered the ship's engines warmed up in case it was  necessary to slip anchor.    The Scud-B, with a range of 220 miles, is one of four types of missiles in  Iraq's arsenal. The others are short-range, Soviet-made Frogs and the  Iraqi-produced Al Hussein and Al Abbas.    U.S. intelligence officers have reported that Iraq's fixed missile launchers  are stationed west of Baghdad, but the country also has a number of mobile  launchers dispersed throughout Iraq and Kuwait.    Saudi cities and allied troop concentrations are within range of the missiles.  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said that if the United States initiates  hostilities, his first target will be Tel Aviv, Israel's largest city.    Together with 2,700 artillery pieces -- traditionally the most effective  weapons against advancing troops -- and 4,000 tanks, the estimated 200 missiles  in Iraq's arsenal would represent a formidable challenge to allied forces in  the event of war.

KEY TARGETS ARE WITHIN ITS RANGE.      By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ABOARD THE USNS MERCY      Iraq launched a ballistic missile Friday for the second time in two days,  sending U.S. troops to their battle stations in preparation for war. The flight  path, however, did not threaten allied forces, and the alert was canceled 90  minutes later.    The Pentagon said the test-firing of a Soviet-made Scud-B missile was the third  such launching this month. The missile was aimed away from U.S. and allied  troops deployed in Saudi Arabia, officials said, and its flight path was  entirely within Iraq's borders.    Even so, American troops, who have been in a state of heightened alert since  before Christmas, have treated each missile launching as though it were the  first shot of an all-out war.    Here aboard the hospital ship Mercy, a 1,000-bed vessel anchored in the Persian  Gulf, word of the firing was flashed from U.S. communications personnel in  Bahrain to the bridge in a classified message.    The mate on watch passed it within seconds to the wardroom, where the master of  the civilian-crewed ship, Dan O'Brien of Reno, and the commanding officer of  the medical contingent, Navy Capt. Paul Barry of Buffalo, N.Y., were meeting.    Bells blasted through the corridors of the 900-foot-long vessel, and O'Brien  told the sailors and merchant marines over the public address system: ""A  missile has been launched. This is not a drill. All personnel take your  emergency stations. I say again, this is not a drill. Attention on board. A  Scud missile has been launched.""    Sailors in firefighting suits trotted to their positions in the unlikely event  that the Mercy -- a converted tanker that once carried oil from the Mideast to  the West under the name of the SS Worth -- was the target. A group of  journalists were issued gas masks. The flight deck was closed to non-emergency  personnel. O'Brien ordered the ship's engines warmed up in case it was  necessary to slip anchor.    The Scud-B, with a range of 220 miles, is one of four types of missiles in  Iraq's arsenal. The others are short-range, Soviet-made Frogs and the  Iraqi-produced Al Hussein and Al Abbas.    U.S. intelligence officers have reported that Iraq's fixed missile launchers  are stationed west of Baghdad, but the country also has a number of mobile  launchers dispersed throughout Iraq and Kuwait.    Saudi cities and allied troop concentrations are within range of the missiles.  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said that if the United States initiates  hostilities, his first target will be Tel Aviv, Israel's largest city.    Together with 2,700 artillery pieces -- traditionally the most effective  weapons against advancing troops -- and 4,000 tanks, the estimated 200 missiles  in Iraq's arsenal would represent a formidable challenge to allied forces in  the event of war. Iraq also has a network of heavily manned defensive  fortifications rimmed by mine fields and other obstacles.    If war breaks out, U.S. commanders believe Iraq is likely to rely on the same  tactics it used during its eight-year war with Iran: Attacking forces would be  allowed to punch their way through sections of the defensive lines, but then  would find themselves in ""killing zones"" where Iraq has massed artillery,  mortars, rocket launchers and tanks buried up to their turrets.

Unless revived at the two-day summit, the dropping of the US proposals represents a victory for the three Andean countries which produce the overwhelming majority of the world's coca, the leaf from which cocaine is derived. Peru, Bolivia and Colombia saw the proposals as potential US threats to their sovereignty. US-drafted 'talking points' used as the basis for pre-San Antonio negotiations earlier this month in Quito, had pressed for formation of a 'regional conference and action group' with wide powers of bilateral and multilateral sanction. Common jurisdiction over sea and airspace would, under the proposal, have allowed aircraft or warships of one member country to enter another's territory in pursuit of drugs traffickers. The Andean Commission of Jurists said that these rights 'would in fact be exercised by that member with the means and desire to execute them' - in other words, the US. All such controversial proposals have been eliminated from the joint statement, which merely calls for 'mutual co-operation .. with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our nations'. In addition to the US and the three Andean coca producers who met at the last drugs summit in Cartagena two years ago, the presidents of Mexico and Ecuador will attend. The Venezuelan president, Mr Carlos Andres Perez, was also due to attend, although is reported to have changed his plans after this month's coup attempt. The draft declaration 'vigorously' reaffirms the Cartagena declaration of two years ago. It claims advances - some of which are disputed elsewhere - in reducing production of and demand for coca and areas under cultivation, in creating alternative development programmes and in dismantling transnational drugs trafficking organisations and financial networks. The declaration, however, admits that the Cartagena objectives on coca crop substitution 'have not been altogether fulfilled'. It expresses hopes that an 'important new initiative' for training, technical assistance in marketing and animal and plant health will improve matters. The Andean countries call for, and the US takes note of, the need for an 'Alternative Development Facility' under the umbrella of an international financial institution. This would provide short-term financing until alternative development plans mature. The heads of state call upon the countries of Europe and Asia, expanding markets for cocaine, to co-operate in the fight against drugs. But success in the fight is principally depicted economically, as dependent upon 'strong economies and innovative economic initiatives'.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "
0,FT921-3048 ,"FT921-3048 _AN-CCQBDAALFT 920317   FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (11): Cries of desperation - Hardware makers have never had it so bad      By ALAN CANE   EUROPE'S top computer executives must be wondering if they made the right career choice these days. There are seemingly precious few rewards for staying in the hardware business. The European computer market has always been tough. Now a combination of the recession, increased competition from the US and Asia and a resistance to buying more computer equipment among their customers has stacked the deck resolutely against European-owned players. A note of desperation is creeping in. In a grim note to his staff, Mr Carlo de Benedetti, chairman and chief executive of the Italian Olivetti group, outlines a new management structure, adding: 'I am firmly convinced that this new organisation is the most appropriate for the difficult months ahead, during which the survival of the company will be at stake.' Some top computer executives have already decided to seek their rewards elsewhere. Mr Arno Bohn, former marketing director of Nixdorf, the ailing minicomputer manufacturer taken over by Siemens two years ago, left to become chief executive of Porsche, the luxury car manufacturer. Mr Vittorio Levi, a former Olivetti executive who became managing director of Nokia Data, the personal computer manufacturer, left to take up a senior post with the Italian fashion house Georgio Armani when the Finnish unit was acquired by ICL of the UK. The European landscape is considerably less populated than a few years ago. Fujitsu of Japan acquired ICL which in turn acquired Nokia Data. Keinzle, a minicomputer maker at one time owned by Mannesmann of Germany, was sold to Digital Equipment (DEC) of the US. Last year DEC also acquired the minicomputer interests of Philips of the Netherlands. Norsk Data remains independent but is still losing money despite a dramatic shift in product emphasis. The world IT market is dominated by US suppliers although Japanese mainframe suppliers are making an impressive showing. But of the top 10 manufacturers, only three are European, 1990 statistics demonstrate. Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany is in eighth place with a turnover of Dollars 7.7bn, Olivetti is ninth with Dollars 6.4bn and Groupe Bull of France 10th with Dollars 6.3bn. All three are currently losing money. Siemens' computer operations had been making a modest profit, but the merger with the hugely loss-making Nixdorf left it a legacy of unprofitability which it will take time to shake off. To put Europe's troubles in perspective, the computer industry is in trouble world wide. IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, lost money last year after taking substantial restructuring charges. Profitability has been much reduced at the leading Japanese suppliers, Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi. Nevertheless, Europe's makers are becoming 'marginalised' according to the French consultancy Idate which points out that in 1990 European-owned groups accounted for only 13.9 per cent of the Dollars 278.5bn world IT market, while consuming more than 35 per cent of the total. By comparison, in 1990 Japan accounted for almost a quarter of global production. There are a number of reasons for Europe's relative weakness in computing. Despite the advent of the single market, Europe remains a series of small markets each with its own computer champion. Insular attitudes have meant that although these companies collaborate in precompetitive research and in transnational programmes such as the EC's Esprit, it has proved impossible to persuade them to work together on a grand scale for the common good. These days, in any case, the wisdom of such an approach is open to question. Small, agile units able to respond quickly and flexibly to customer needs would seem to have the advantage over centralised and monolithic bureaucracies. IBM, for example, is trying to recreate itself in the form of a series of smaller, specialised units each with profit and loss responsibility. Merger has become, in any event, an academic question for Europe's surviving manufacturers. There is little talk any more of full blooded takeovers; the aim is rather to form alliances with stronger partners able to help defray research and development expenses and giving economies of scale in production. The European Commission, while anxious to help indigenous producers, has turned its face against subsidies or other means of providing aid which might be seen as anti-competitive. It is still considering whether French government plans to pump millions of francs into Groupe Bull are acceptable. It is, however, prepared to provide the impetus for what has become known as the European Nervous System, a transnational computer network designed to help to co-ordinate aspects of social policy throughout the community. The options open to Europe's manufacturers are narrow and getting still narrower. They are all heavily overstaffed and must lose people on a large scale. In the case of Olivetti, it required six weeks of negotiations to persuade the Italian government and trade unions to agree to a cut of 1,500, far short of the 2,200 the company was hoping for. They must also look for niche markets which play to their strengths. Now only IBM can hope to cover every area of the hardware business. Groupe Bull, after a protracted discussion period, has signed a broad ranging alliance with IBM giving it access to the US giant's expertise in reduced instruction set computing (risc) as well as a market for portable computers from its Zenith Data Systems subsidiary. IBM, in return, benefits from Bull's expertise in multiprocessing and networking. The deal gives Bull substantially more credibility in the marketplace. Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull chairman, is looking more relaxed than for many months. Siemens and Nixdorf have yet to settle into a comfortable working relationship. Broad cultural differences between the two companies are said to be causing difficulties and delaying the synergies expected of the merger. This is common in the computer business, where troubled mergers are more common than successful ones. It took ICL years to paper over the joins between English Electric, Ferranti Computers and other companies which went into the making of the former British computer champion. If there is a future for a European owned computer industry, it lies in services rather than hardware. Siemens Nixdorf already derives 37 per cent of its revenues from services, Olivetti 27 per cent and Bull 36 per cent.  The Financial Times   London Page VII  "

It will be the first time that Mercedes-Benz will have fitted another manufacturer's engines in one of its mainstream passenger vehicles. The deal marks the second significant collaboration this year between two of Europe's biggest vehicle makers. In April VW agreed to license technology from Mercedes-Benz for a new range of light commercial vehicles. Mercedes-Benz said yesterday that it is to purchase VW's VR6 engines and automatic gearboxes for use in its planned range of multi-purpose vehicles, which are expected to be launched in early 1996. The new vehicle, the Viano, will take Mercedes-Benz into one of the fastest growing segments of the European car market, where it will compete with established rivals such as the Renault Espace and new vehicles that are being launched by Peugeot, Fiat, Ford and VW itself. Mercedes-Benz said that engine and gearbox purchases from VW were expected to total around DM50m (Dollars 31.8m) a year. The Viano will be produced at the Mercedes-Benz plant at Vitoria, Spain.

It will attend the  inauguration ceremony of Nelson Mandela, the new president of  South Africa, which will take place on 10 May.    At Jan Smuts airport near Johannesburg, Shumeyko made the  following statement:    ""A solemn and joyful event in the life of South Africa --  the  inauguration of the first democratically elected president of  the country -- has brought this Russian delegation to South  Africa.    ""As is known, Russia has made a weighty contribution to the  cause of dismantling apartheid and ensuring a political  settlement in the RSA. In the fight against the system of  apartheid and in the process of establishing a negotiating  process, we developed close friendly relations with the  constructive forces in South Africa, which are now widely  represented in the leadership of South Africa. We intend to  maintain and strengthen these relations.    ""The RSA and Russia are experiencing a similar period of  renewal, a period of seeking the ways of future development  while overcoming the old mentality and difficulties of adapting  to the new realities. Who, therefore, is better qualified than  we are to better understand each other's problems and mutually  make use of the accumulated positive experience of social  reformation.""    The similarity of approach to many aspects of world politics  paves the way to partnership in international relations. Russia  maintains that the new South Africa must enter the world  community and its international bodies as an equal participant,  and that all remaining sanctions against it should be lifted  without delay. We are prepared to help South Africa in this  matter.    The delegation also brought a personal message from  President  Boris Yeltsin to President Nelson Mandela, congratulating him  and stating that the Russian leadership and all Russia's  citizens are ready to further promote bilateral cooperation with  the RSA in all areas, which would benefit both democratic Russia  and South Africa in the name of peace and prosperity.""    In an ITAR-TASS interview, Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that  the RSA used to be associated mainly with apartheid. Now when  the democratic processes have begun in that country, just as  they have been in Russia, the whole world wishes it success on  this path.    Speaking of bilateral relations, the head of the Russian  Federation delegation said they are not beginning from scratch.  Since the sanctions against the RSA were lifted, many  cooperation opportunities in various fields have opened up  between the two countries that are building democracy.  Interparliamentary relations are of considerable importance.  Our countries have similar legislature in the economic sphere,  and this makes our contacts much easier. We hope that from the  outset we will start moving toward legislation that will take  into account the interests of each partner.     "
0,FT921-16620 ,"FT921-16620 _AN-CABA3AA1FT 920102   FT  02 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Europe's role in the world   THE TIME of adolescent introspection is past. Free of the benevolent tutelage of the US, the EC must now make its own destiny as an adult. It must do so as mindful of the ruin that succeeded Europe's last period of autonomy, as of the opportunities and dangers that confront it today. Though Europe's child, the US has played a parental role towards it over the past 50 years. Success has crowned that effort, but the US is now weary and disillusioned. Europe must share the burden of leadership, but should beware substituting a destructive rivalry for the co-operation that is in its higher interest. Co-operation between Europe, the US, and Japan is the sine qua non of global stability and progress. Little of global significance can be done if they fail to co-operate; should they do so, little is beyond them. At the top of the agenda in the post-cold war era is economic co-operation, the first item of all being the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Nothing could justify the damage to international trade that would follow failure of these negotiations. Still less could the Gatt's collapse be justified by defence of a policy as wasteful and corrupting as the common agricultural policy. The EC will argue that it should not yield to US bullying. But it should remember what it owes the US, and repay a part of that debt. In the world, Europe must be an equal partner; vis-a-vis its neighbours it should be the leading one. The implosion of the old adversary has created a unique opportunity and a mortal danger. Stable market-oriented democracies need to be established in some 20 enfeebled and fractious states, polluted remnants of the last European empire. Russia's case The Russian colossus must be the starting point. Once again, there could be but a brief interlude of democracy between tyrannies. The Russian government, under Boris Yeltsin, is determined on economic reform in conditions that are nigh on hopeless. The west cannot afford to let him fail and, given the scale of the resources that had to be invested in defence against the Soviet Union, can afford what he needs to succeed. A huge effort of technical and financial assistance is needed, not next year, but now. Stability cannot be achieved in Eurasia if Russia remains in chaos. But other countries of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe should not be forgotten. Europe must try to do for them what the US once did for it. The first thing to give to all, to Europe's own great benefit, is free access to its markets. Also important, however, will be technical and financial support. Economically hopeful Inevitably the focus will be on the larger countries, such as Ukraine, and the more economically hopeful, such as the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, Hungary and Poland. The smaller countries can then be lifted by the buoyancy of their larger neighbours and those in the rear by the successes of those in the van. Finally, there is the challenge of enlargement. But this should come after the Gatt and after the problems of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. None of these countries will be ready for membership in the next few years, but their problems are far more urgent than those of such prosperous democracies as Austria or Sweden. However desirable early expansion of the EC may be, it must not divert attention from the threats and opportunities on the EC's eastern borders. Among those threats is that to security. The EC's failure to halt Yugoslavia's agonies offers a warning of what could follow in the erstwhile Soviet Union. The European Union has neither the military means, nor the will, to deal with such threats on its own. All the more important, therefore, that it develop the means and show the will to deal with the economic challenge before it boils over in civil war. Co-operation with its partners; generosity towards its erstwhile foes. These must be the guiding lights of a European Union, which was not born great, is yet to achieve greatness, but has had the opportunity for greatness thrust upon it.

0,FT921-12362 ,"FT921-12362 _AN-CA0BDADIFT 920127   FT  27 JAN 92 / An appetite for acquisitions: Europe's market in food is being transformed by predators and fiercer competition      By GUY DE JONQUIERES and WILLIAM DAWKINS   Just when the fashion for large cross-border takeovers seemed to be waning, the battle between Nestle of Switzerland and the Italian Agnelli family for the French Perrier group, the world's biggest mineral water company, has brought it bouncing back to life. The contest is striking evidence that recession has not dulled corporate appetites for expansion in western Europe's Dollars 700bn-a-year food market, nor diminished the intense rivalry to wrest control of producers with world-class brands. Since the mid-1980s, a wave of restructuring has swept through the industry, as manufacturers have scrambled to adapt to stiffer competition, changing tastes and products, faster innovation and the advance of European economic integration. The challenge facing many companies is to grow bigger quickly, or to shrink. None has responded more aggressively than trans-national heavyweights such as Nestle, the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group and Philip Morris, the US tobacco giant, which 18 months ago became Europe's third largest food group by buying Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss chocolate and coffee company, for Dollars 3.8bn. A tier below in size, France's BSN has been an exceptionally active cross-border shopper, followed more recently by manufacturers including Britain's United Biscuits and Cadbury Schweppes and scores of smaller companies. All are looking to expand further - and some of those hunting are also potential prey. The main limiting factor seems to be the number of prizes available. Many of the most desirable have already been snapped up or, in most countries except Britain, are defended against takeover. When a plum comes on the market, bidding can soar sky-high. 'I admit entirely that there is a lot of opportunism in it,' says Mr Floris Maljers, co-chairman of Unilever. 'Something is for sale and everybody begins to think feverishly, how does it fit into my strategy?' The pace of change seems unlikely to slow - though there have recently been signs of a shift in direction. The 20 largest food manufacturers in Europe still account for only about 12 per cent of a market peopled by an estimated 100,000 companies. By contrast, 40 of the world's top spirits brands are controlled by only four groups. However, the fragmentation of the food industry also reflects genuine diversity. It is really a cluster of many separate businesses, with widely varying competitive structures, growth rates, profitability and capital intensity. Adding to the complexity are Europe's differing national and local taste patterns, which make truly standardised products and brands a rarity. Even as well-established a Euro-brand as Nescafe comes in 50 combinations of strength, taste and flavour. Nonetheless, in some product categories supply is already quite concentrated. Unilever, for instance, accounts for an estimated 60 per cent of edible fats sales and a big slice of the ice cream business in Europe. Kellogg holds half the breakfast cereals market, while Mars, Nestle, Suchard and Cadbury dominate in chocolate. By contrast, there are no clear leaders in sectors such as cheese, fruit juice or meat-processing. However, even the biggest food companies do not attempt to compete across the entire spectrum, but have strengths in a limited number of areas. Indeed, some industry experts argue that, for all their financial clout, the majors operate industrially as federations of medium-sized companies. Of all the factors spurring the race to grow bigger, probably the most important is changes in food retailing, above all in northern Europe. Though the trade remains largely nationally-based, the power of large supermarkets has substantially increased in the past decade. In Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands, one or two chains now account for roughly a third of all food sales. Meanwhile, the spread of electronic point of sale systems and more sophisticated management techniques is providing supermarket groups with up-to-the-minute data about what products they sell, in what volumes, and how much profit they contribute. As a consequence, manufacturers, once used to lording it over the retailers, face fewer, bigger and more knowledgeable customers, who not only bargain harder on price but are increasingly choosy about what they stock. The trend seems certain to develop further, particularly as supermarkets in different European countries press ahead with efforts to purchase and develop new products jointly. The increasing competition for precious shelf-space is making life steadily harder for brands without strong consumer loyalty or powerful promotion. In the words of Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of BSN: 'In this business, the number one makes a lot of money, the number two can make a decent living, the number three just suffers.' The rapid growth of private-label products, sold under retailers' own names at prices which usually undercut top brands, has added to the pressure. More than a third of all packaged groceries sold in Britain - and roughly a fifth in France, Germany, the Benelux countries and Switzerland - are now private label. 'The low and high ends of the market are growing, but the middle ground is really being squeezed,' says Mr Peter Mensing, a food industry specialist with consultants Booz Allen. 'Manufacturers have either to trade up or down.' Most at risk are second- and third-rank manufacturers which compete mainly on price and in one national market. Many - particularly in the UK - have been driven to expand across European borders largely to offset dependence on a handful of powerful customers at home. The acquisition motives of the bigger companies are more complex. Broadly, they fall into three categories: Extending the power of established brands, the source of profits and market power. 'Everyone today is trying to get a bigger leverage to the consumer and a bigger leverage to the trade,' says Mr Camillo Pagano, vice-president of marketing at Nestle. Though large groups hold big shares of the overall European market in certain products, their strengths are often unevenly spread. BSN, though the world's biggest biscuit-maker, still does three quarters of its total sales in France and Italy, while two thirds of Suchard's Dollars 4.5bn turnover is in Germany and France. Often, the only way to achieve a better geographic balance is through small acquisitions. Unilever, for instance, made more than 100 at a cost of about Dollars 2.5bn in the second half of the 1980s. Filling up costly distribution and manufacturing capacity by adding new products. That is becoming increasingly important as large food companies increasingly centralise production in fewer plants designed to serve the entire European market. Diversifying into new businesses. Though overall European food consumption is increasing only slowly, businesses such as fresh, chilled and convenience foods are enjoying rapid growth and high margins. Innovations in these markets are often pioneered by smaller companies, which often sell out to bigger groups. The dilemma facing all would-be acquirers, however, is that keener rivalry has driven up the prices of quality targets, while extracting quick returns is increasingly difficult. Scope for boosting profits simply by cutting the costs of acquired companies has diminished, because many have already streamlined their operations and improved efficiency. 'Generally speaking, at today's high prices it may be difficult to consider an acquisition because you couldn't make it pay unless there were some unusual synergistic elements which would reduce this non-return calculation to a more favourable basis,' says Mr Hans Storr, executive vice-president and chief financial officer of Philip Morris. But achieving worthwhile 'synergies' can be a tricky proposition in a business as diverse and fast-changing as food, where scale economies often lie as much in marketing as in manufacturing. Some industry experts believe opportunistic acquirers have over-estimated the potential benefits. 'Cost savings from synergies often prove illusory or fail to cover acquisition premiums,' says Mr Ian Davis, director of the European consumer industries practice at consultants McKinsey. A growing awareness of the risks is prompting a search for other expansion routes, such as alliances. Nestle, once averse to joint ventures, has recently teamed up with General Mills of the US to exploit the international breakfast cereals market, with Coca-Cola in canned coffee and with BSN to buy Cokoladovny, a Czech biscuit and confectionery company. Nestle also says it is prepared to settle initially for a partial shareholding in Perrier, if necessary. Mr Jim Grover of OCC Strategy Consultants, which advises several leading European food companies, says they are increasingly interested in collaboration in preference to outright purchases. But he also admits that only about 10 per cent of joint venture proposals get beyond the ideas stage. A further element is the intrusion of anti-trust regulation, particularly from Brussels. If Nestle's bid for Perrier succeeds, it will probably be the first big food industry deal to be vetted under the EC merger control regulation since it took effect 16 months ago. None of these developments, however, is likely to slow the competition which is relentlessly bearing down on weaker players. Adding to the pressure are the ambitions of big US food groups such as Philip Morris, PepsiCo, Sara Lee and Campbells Soup, all of which see European expansion as a high priority. Says Mr Maljers of Unilever: 'I see a future for two kinds of food company: the well-managed specialist with perhaps one product in one country, and the multinational. Middle-sized companies present in only two or three countries are in trouble.' Some in the industry would consider that prognosis excessively stark. However, it is also a salutary reminder that building a broader international base is only one - and not necessarily a sufficient - condition for surviving in the European food markets of tomorrow. At least as important are the ability to carve out carefully-defined business segments and to exploit them with single-minded dedication. In a highly-fragmented industry where even the biggest players have prospered by focusing selectively on core products and skills, the company which spreads its resources across a wide range of activities and markets is more at risk than the small producer committed to doing one thing superlatively well.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------               TOP TEN CROSS-BORDER MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- BIDDER               TARGET                          YEAR    DOLLARS BN Nestle (Switz)       Rowntree (UK)                    1988      4.92 Phillip Morris (US)  Jacobs Suchard (Switz)           1990      3.80 BSN (France)         Smiths Crisps, Walkers           1989      2.50                      Crisps, Jacobs (all UK)                      Saiwa (Italy), Belin (France) Nestle (Switz)       Buitoni                          1988      1.40 Pepsico (US)         Smiths Crisps, Walkers Crisps    1989      1.35                      (UK) Sudzucker (Ger)      Raffinerie Tirlemont (Belgium)   1989      0.99 BSN (France)         HP Foods/Lea  Perrins (UK)      1988      0.34 Ferruzzi (Italy)     Lesieur (cooking oils division)  1988      0.26                      (France) Freia (Norway)       Marabou (Sweden)                 1990      0.23 Kuwait Investment    Ebro (Spain)                     1988      0.22 Office  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: KPMG  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 12 Chart (Omitted).

0,FT934-15083 ,"FT934-15083 _AN-DJMCRAF1FT 931013   FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Swedish gold miner aims to up the stakes - A small but profitable business that is coming to market      By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES   THE UNLIKELY site for Europe's largest gold mine is a place called Bjorkdal only 300km south of the Arctic circle in northern Sweden. Until now it has enjoyed an obscurity to match its remote location, but that will change next month when the mine's operator, Terra Mining, comes to the Swedish stock market, with a range of international institutions among its new owners. The company says it will be Europe's only listed mining group concerned purely with gold. Bjorkdal claims its status as Europe's leading gold mine with 1992 production of 2,310kg (74,250 troy ounces) and expected output of 2,475kg this year. Since it started production in 1988, total output has amounted to 9 tonnes. On the scale of the world's biggest gold mines, such as those in South Africa, this is insignificant, representing a mere one-tenth of 1 per cent of total annual gold output worldwide. But Terra Mining prides itself not on scale of production but on the efficiency and profitability of its operations. Its production costs are lower than 90 per cent of its western world rivals, with mine site cash costs dropping to Dollars 145 an ounce in 1993 from Dollars 209 last year. The improvement will help the company to achieve a pre-tax profit of SKr71m (Pounds 5.75m), a 35 per cent margin on sales of SKr202.3m and a level of profitability that will match the very best in the Swedish corporate sector. Part of the reason for the low cost base has been the dramatic strengthening of the US dollar against the Swedish krona from an average of SKr5.83 in 1992 to SKr7.75 this year - a significant boost for a company that has virtually all its expenses in krona and all its revenues in dollars. But it is also lean in terms of staff numbers - it employs just 45 people - and it has benefited from the efficiency of both its exploration and its mining techniques. The company prides itself on the effectiveness of its exploration technique, which uses modern data-processing methods and an understanding of the movement of glaciers during the last ice age to find commercial ore deposits. Analysis of the glacial till, the layer of terrain that collected small fragments of minerals as they were scraped off the underlying bedrock by glaciers, is at the heart of the process. Modern data processing allows huge numbers of deposits from many different areas to be analysed systematically. In this way Terra Mining has tested 150,000 samples for 30 different elements (a total of 4.5m analyses) from a grid covering nearly all of Sweden and parts of Finland, Norway and Ireland. The company has spent SKr100m on exploration since it was founded in 1980, and had spent only SKr30m by the time it identified the potential of Bjorkdal in 1983. It took just five years from the moment a claim was first lodged on the mine to the time production started - a short lead time by industry standards. The fact that the mine is open cast, rather than underground, helps to keep operating costs down. It has also modified its mining methods, changing bench height, blast size, and drilling patterns to enhance metallurgical recovery. The result has been a steady improvement in the ore grade from 2.56 grams of gold a tonne in 1990 to 3.31 grams this year, although this is still lower than a typical South African mine. Further efficiency has been achieved by tripling the amount of ore treated annually from 300,000 tonnes in 1988 to 900,000 tonnes today. The amount is not likely to rise any further, as the company is restricted under the terms of its concession to a maximum production of 1m tonnes of ore a year. Even when the gold price plunged to the equivalent of SKr56,000 a kilogram in July 1992 Bjorkdal remained profitable, with a break-even level of SKr51,000. When the gold price soars to SKr107,000 a kilogram - as it did this year, with a built-in benefit from the krona's devaluation - it is highly profitable, and remains so at the SKr92,000 level which prevailed at the end of September. Perhaps Terra Mining's biggest problem, from a potential investor's viewpoint, is that it has just one mine in operation at present, and one with only seven years of proven and probable reserves at that. The mine's president, Mr Torsten Borjemalm, is sensitive to this, but he brushes the criticism aside. 'How many other industries have an order stock of seven years? We know we have material to sell - it's only a question of price,' he says. Not only is the company confident that Bjorkdal's 'possible' reserves will extend its life further, it also has 60 other prospects on its books and expects to have at least one more mine, and possibly two, in operation by the year 2000. The most important exploration project is at Pahtavaara in Finland, which has proven reserves of 695,000 tonnes at a grade of 3.33 grams a tonne. A final decision on whether to develop this mine will be taken next year. Another interesting deposit is at Barsele in Sweden. It is partly because of the need to fund new mining developments that the company and its owners now want to broaden Terra's ownership base when it is listed. They will sell up to 1.3m shares at SKr140 a share. Norsk Hydro, the majority shareholder with 61 per cent, is to sell about 30 per cent of its stake as are the other two big shareholders, Euroventures Nordica and Mr Christer Lofgren, one of the company's founders. Presentations have been held in London, Paris, Stockholm and Edinburgh as part of the campaign to attract new owners from the Swedish and international investment community.

Germany is urging east European countries to take back nationals resident elsewhere without permission, and speed migrants' return to their country of origin. Also high on the agenda is a proposal to co-ordinate action on international 'human smuggling' groups. The Germans want 'non-front-line' western countries to share the burden of financial aid towards strengthening eastern Europe's immigration controls. The conference coincides with German efforts to tighten the country's liberal asylum rules. Germany's proposed constitutional amendment would allow authorities to turn back claimants for refugee status if they arrive from 'safe' neighbouring east European countries. Poland and the Czech Republic are determined not to become a cordon sanitaire for seekers of asylum in Germany. Bonn's efforts have an added urgency because of continuing racist attacks against foreigners. But EC countries less affected by immigration from eastern Europe are grudging in their solidarity. UK officials said yesterday that, while backing recommendations on exchange of information, they did not wish to see new measures, describing as unrealistic ideas about financial aid.

KOLKEY, Daniel M. Kolkey is a lawyer in Los Angeles.      The Warsaw Pact, it is commonly observed, is the only alliance in history whose  military forces have been used solely to invade its own members.    No doubt this is why Poland's new Solidarity-led government has taken pains to  reassure Moscow that it will not withdraw from the pact. It also explains why  Solidarity promptly yielded the defense and interior ministries to the  Communist Party: Reform in Eastern Europe cannot exceed the Soviet Union's  tolerance for change, a lesson imprinted on the memories of Hungarians and  Czechoslovakians whose hopes were dashed under the treads of Soviet tanks in  1956 and 1968.    However, the Warsaw Pact's past suppression of reform also reveals an  opportunity to be grasped in the ongoing conventional force reduction talks,  the third round of which commenced in Vienna earlier this month. Those  negotiations are designed to reduce the threat posed to the West by the Warsaw  Pact. However, the talks can also be utilized to reduce the threat that the  Warsaw Pact poses to its own members.    Specifically, the Vienna talks could be used to reduce and restrict Soviet  forces in Eastern Europe so as to limit Moscow's ability to pressure East Bloc  governments that experiment with democratic reform.    Admittedly, no conventional arms-control agreement can neutralize the Soviet  Union's inherent geographic advantage when it comes to moving forces across its  borders to Budapest, Prague or Warsaw. Still, in an era when Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev is attempting to persuade the West of his ""new thinking""  (not to mention his desire for Western credits and technology),  across-the-border invasion is no longer an attractive option for the Soviets.  Indeed, the unambiguous suppression of political dissent in, say, Warsaw would  undermine Gorbachev's policy of glasnost in Moscow. His credibility, his  program and thus his leadership would be a likely casualty of such an attack.    If Moscow wishes to place pressure on a neighbor, then indirect aggression --  e.g., ""military exercises"" by Warsaw Pact troops already stationed in Eastern  Europe -- is a more subtle and thus a more viable option. The more ambiguous  the aggression, the less liable it is to provoke a major Western response.  Contrast the worldwide condemnation of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in  December, 1979, (open aggression) with Europe's muted response to the more  ambiguous Soviet troop mobilization on the Polish border in 1981 to pressure  the Warsaw government to crack down on Solidarity.    Hence, the reduction and restriction of Soviet forces in Eastern Europe  eliminates Soviet options, leaving Moscow with the undesirable alternatives of  invasion or acquiescence. Advance notice of, and time limits on, military  exercises in Eastern Europe could further restrict Soviet options.    But how can the West encourage force reductions that limit Soviet options? By  placing the public relations spotlight on the conventional force reduction  talks, just as Gorbachev previously focused world attention on the  intermediate-range nuclear missile talks, which ultimately resulted in an  agreement during President Ronald Reagan's second term. The Soviet leader  maintained world attention on the negotiations until the political need to  reach an agreement was irresistible.    President Bush's conventional arms-control proposal to reduce U.S. armed forces  in Europe by 20% (if the Soviets do the same) was a step in the right  direction. The dramatic gesture, made last May in Brussels, focused attention  on the talks. Further, by offering to reduce U.S. forces, the President  symbolically demonstrated to Europeans his peaceful intentions and challenged  the Soviets to match them. By requiring that an agreement on conventional arms  reductions be implemented before talks on European-based, short-range nuclear  missiles were commenced, the President gave the Soviets an incentive to consent  to the West's conventional arms proposals. The Soviets have long placed greater  priority on reducing European-based nuclear weapons, the elimination of which  would make Europe more vulnerable to the Warsaw Pact's numerical superiority in  conventional forces.    Of course, the West German public is impatient with any delay in commencing  talks on battlefield nuclear weapons. President Bush temporarily smoothed over  the simmering dispute by proposing that the conventional arms reduction talks  be completed in a year, thus giving Bonn hope of early nuclear weapon-reduction  talks.    But this only emphasizes that Eastern Europe's future is just as dependent on  Western will as it is on Soviet tolerance. The path to Eastern Eurpean  self-determination may very well begin in Bonn and lead to Vienna so that it  can bypass Moscow.

0,FT944-18148 ,"FT944-18148 _AN-EJED5ACEFT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / IRA beatings may delay peace talks      By STEWART DALBY, DAVID GARDNER and GEORGE GRAHAM      BELFAST, BRUSSELS   The continuing use of punishment beatings in republican areas of Belfast - thought to be the work of the provisional IRA - could delay the start of talks between London and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. A British official yesterday warned: 'All military activity may have stopped, strictly speaking, but the violence in republican areas is continuing. We have to consider whether this is terrorism by another name.' London has promised to start a dialogue on how to admit Sinn Fein to political talks on Northern Ireland's future within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. The emergence of a possible new obstacle to the peace process coincided yesterday with mixed signals on the prospects for financial aid for the province to help smooth the path to a durable settlement. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said the European Union should decide by Christmas on whether to make new aid grants focusing on urban renewal and infrastructure. The 'peace grants' would be in addition to EU funds already committed to the province, he said after he and Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, briefed EU foreign ministers on recent developments. Specific sums were not mentioned yesterday but Mr Spring said he expected December's summit in Essen of EU leaders to agree a substantial package. Part of the new money could eventually go towards dismantling the 'peace walls' separating the two northern communities, senior officials said. But Mr Hurd made it clear that could only happen 'if people want it to happen'. The EU has allocated Ecu1.23bn (Pounds 960m) in aid to northern Ireland for 1994-99, and raised its annual contribution to the International Fund for Ireland from Ecu15m to Ecu20m. US officials have been trying to lower the level of expectations. A senior administration official said: 'I don't think any large assistance package of direct aid is on the cards. We just don't have that kind of budget flexibility.' Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, also drew this conclusion from his talks with US officials this week. The White House is examining less direct forms of aid, such as enhancing the role of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and accelerating spending from the International Fund for Ireland - to which the US contributes. The continuing violence will be another obstacle for Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, as he tries to increase pressure on London to start talks on his return from the US later this week. A further three beatings came to light this week, taking the total number of beatings in republican ares to 10 since the IRA ceasefire on August 31. In the same period last year there was only one punishment beating. The provisional IRA has not admitted it is responsible for the beatings but the Royal Ulster Constabulary is convinced that it is.

The Commission condemned fare increases introduced by British Airways, Alitalia, Luxair and Iberia on 22 routes - all but one involving British airports. The Commission decided the increases were not 'reasonably related' to the airlines' long-term costs. The Commission has not punished the airlines, which increased the fares during the Gulf crisis when the regulatory regime was temporarily relaxed. Instead, it has warned governments that they cannot use the prices as a reference for future increases.

'Never deny to others the justice and equality you fought so hard for and earned for yourselves. Freedom without tolerance is freedom unfulfilled,' Mr Clinton said in a speech to thousands of Latvians gathered in Riga's Freedom Square. Mr Clinton, who later flew to Poland, expressed confidence that Russia could resolve its disagreements with Estonia, the only country with which it has not agreed a troop withdrawal plan, if both sides showed flexibility. 'I think the differences are narrow,' he said. Russian troops have already pulled out of Lithuania and are due to quit Latvia by August 31. Negotiations with Estonia, however, are bedevilled by the status of ethnic Russians, including military pensioners. Although Mr Clinton insisted there was no link between the citizenship rights of Russians living in Estonia - an issue he discussed with President Boris Yeltsin by telephone before the Riga meeting - and the withdrawal of Russian troops, his strong call for tolerance was seen as a gesture to Mr Yeltsin's concerns. The status of the Russian minority is fiercely debated in all three Baltic countries, and is at the centre of heated discussion over a new citizenship law in Latvia. However, Estonia's President Lennart Meri recalled sharply that the Russian government itself had set the August 31 deadline. In an effort to smooth the way, Mr Clinton yesterday chipped in extra US money to resolve some of the outstanding issues. Besides promising Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.5m) for a three-nation Baltic peacekeeping battalion, he doubled the money available to help Latvia dismantle an unfinished early warning radar station at Skrunda. More than cash, however, Mr Clinton brought a symbolic promise of US support. 'The chain that binds our nations is unbreakable,' he told a cheering crowd. 'We will be partners so your nations will be forever free.' Lionel Barber adds from Brussels: The European Commission said yesterday it had completed negotiations for a free trade agreement with Estonia, paving the way for a free trade area for industrial goods with all three Baltic republics from next year. The deal, subject to council of ministers approval, involves the EU dismantling tariffs and quotas on goods by January 1. Estonia will remove its barriers by the same date, while Latvia and Lithuania will benefit from transition periods of four and six years respectively on sensitive products such as textiles. The other provisions of the agreements are modelled on pacts concluded with the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.   Countries:-  LVZ  Latvia, East Europe.

MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      VELEHRAD, Czechoslovakia      Sounding a call for continental unity, Pope John Paul II on Sunday summoned an  unprecedented all-European congress of Roman Catholic bishops to chart common  action made possible by the collapse of communism.    ""Never in the history of the church has there been such a continental meeting.  To my mind, the agenda will be huge,"" papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said.    The public papal summons for a synod of bishops from two dozen European  countries came after a Mass here before an onion-domed 17th-Century basilica  that is a Czechoslovakian national landmark.    For the second day Sunday, John Paul drew gigantic crowds for outdoor Masses in  a country where a peaceful revolution last winter ended four decades of  Communist rule -- and with it, the repression of religion. The Vatican says  that at least half of Czechoslovakia's 15 million people are Catholic.    Even after 40 muzzled years, everybody in the giant crowd here, old and young  alike, knew the words to ancient and bittersweet hymns that echoed through the  rain-soaked countryside Sunday in John Paul's wake.    Tens of thousands of worshipers, many in local dress harking back to the Middle  Ages and all waving yellow and white paper roses, defied glowering skies and  fresh mud for the Mass here, which also drew Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki  from neighboring Poland.

MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      VELEHRAD, Czechoslovakia      Sounding a call for continental unity, Pope John Paul II on Sunday summoned an  unprecedented all-European congress of Roman Catholic bishops to chart common  action made possible by the collapse of communism.    ""Never in the history of the church has there been such a continental meeting.  To my mind, the agenda will be huge,"" papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said.    The public papal summons for a synod of bishops from two dozen European  countries came after a Mass here before an onion-domed 17th-Century basilica  that is a Czechoslovakian national landmark.    For the second day Sunday, John Paul drew gigantic crowds for outdoor Masses in  a country where a peaceful revolution last winter ended four decades of  Communist rule -- and with it, the repression of religion. The Vatican says  that at least half of Czechoslovakia's 15 million people are Catholic.    Even after 40 muzzled years, everybody in the giant crowd here, old and young  alike, knew the words to ancient and bittersweet hymns that echoed through the  rain-soaked countryside Sunday in John Paul's wake.    Tens of thousands of worshipers, many in local dress harking back to the Middle  Ages and all waving yellow and white paper roses, defied glowering skies and  fresh mud for the Mass here, which also drew Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki  from neighboring Poland.

A  number of businessmen mingled with Arab and French diplomats and  political leaders, mostly of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] or  associated groups. In total, some 50 guests attended what  looked very much like a gathering of ""Gaullists,"" nostalgic for  ""France's Arab policy,"" including former representatives of  companies in Iraq who have been silent since the Gulf crisis.  Now ""attitudes are changing. This evening proves it,""  according to one of the organizers.    The visit to France by an Iraqi parliamentary delegation  provided the opportunity for a dinner-cum-debate. A deputy from  the Baghdad Parliament sat in the room, as did the  representative of the Iraqi interests section in Paris,  al-`Azzawi [name as transliterated]. The invitation was issued  by the Fifth Republic Christian Movement (MCVe), whose chairman  is Michel Grimard. The organization is closely associated with  Jacques Chirac's RPR.    When he invaded Kuwait in August 1990 Saddam Husayn fell  into  an American ""ambush,"" the assembled company was told by Roselyne  Bachelot, the RPR's deputy for Maine et Loire. ""It is certain  now that Baghdad received assurances from the highest diplomatic  level that the United States would not oppose their troops'  crossing the border."" The deputy, who is chairwoman of the  National Assembly's France-Iraq group, developed the conspiracy  theory at some length before demanding ""the opening as soon as  possible of an economic interests section in Baghdad, the  release of Iraq assets held in French banks for the purchase of  food and pharmaceuticals supplies, and a more flexible policy on  visas.""    In solemn tones, Paul Depis, a former ambassador to Baghdad,  recalled the golden years of Franco-Iraqi cooperation. French  enterprises ""invested 130-150 billion francs"" from 1973 through  1989. Above all, he said, by advancing beyond the Euphrates,  France succeeded in encroaching on ""a British reserve.""    Having long been in the minority, the advocates of a new  Paris-Baghdad axis -- if not political, then at least economic  -- can now count on the support of part of the Balladur  government. Thus Daniel Garrigue, another RPR deputy, expressed  satisfaction with France's action within the UN Security  Council. For the first time since the Gulf crisis, its  representative in New York on 17 March publicly opposed the  United States and Britain over the renewal of the international  sanctions against Iraq.    As it does every two months, the United Nations had to renew  the oil and military embargo and the measures to freeze Iraqi  assets abroad. This time Paris, backed by China and Russia,  urged that recognition be given for the ""progress made by  Baghdad."" The destruction of its chemical, nuclear, and  biological weapons is being completed. The long-term monitoring  of Iraq's arsenal of death is being established. According to  French diplomats, these ""efforts"" deserve to be encouraged.    The United Nations is giving itself six months in which to  establish an adequate surveillance system. France is pleading  for the lifting of the oil embargo as soon as this trial period  is over. It accuses its former allies of trying to impose on  Iraq conditions not envisaged by the UN documents. The English  [as published] and British consider this too short a time and  are refusing to grant Baghdad a blank check. They maintain that  Saddam Husayn is simply trying to allay suspicion. He has not  recognized the new line of the Iraqi-Kuwait border and is still  violating human rights. [passage omitted]    Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, welcomes  France's new stance. The Balladur government ""can persuade the  other sides, including the United States and Britain, to lift  the embargo,"" he told us Friday [25 March]. Western diplomats  do not fear a French defection, but do consider the policy a  dangerous one, ""because it threatens to mislead the Iraqis into  believing that the Western camp has weakened."" Already on the  eve of the UN vote, Saddam Husayn adopted a louder tone and  massed troops near Iraqi Kurdistan, in the belief that he could  thus bring pressure to bear on the Security Council.

But the conference on stability in Europe, brainchild of  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, left aside the wars in  Bosnia and the Caucasus, concentrating on preventing conflicts  that could regenerate from Europe's turbulent past.    And Europe's future relationship with Russia, which will not  be part of the pact, appeared ill-defined as the two-day  conference opened at UNESCO headquarters here.    In an opening speech, Balladur said ""we must begin by  liquidating the old quarrels, resolving the old conflicts,  dissipating the old fears, we must stabilise our continent as  far as borders and minority rights are concerned.""    The prime minister said the conference's objective should be  to sign the Stability Pact by early next year, perhaps in  February ""but perhaps it will take longer.""    A successful outcome would help Balladur in French  presidential elections due in May, 1995, analysts said, but the  Stability Pact project is less ambitious than when the prime  minister launched it a year ago.    It is now limited to preventing potential conflict. The war  in Bosnia, said Balladur, ""is a veritable lesson of what we must  no longer tolerate.""    The pact would incorporate existing good-neighbour  agreements, such as recognition of the Oder-Neisse frontier  between Germany and Poland, and new accords to be reached in the  interval, Balladur said.    The aim of the pact was to reconcile the desire of ""numerous  countries to join the European Union with the need to preserve  the unity of our continent and thus develop very close relations  with Russia,"" the prime minister said.    He added that the ""greater Europe of the future"" should  enjoy  ""privileged relations of partnership"" with Moscow.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev welcomed the  proposed  pact, but struck a note of caution, saying that Moscow preferred  that border disputes and minority issues be addressed by the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    He hailed the pact as ""yet another attempt to come to grips  seriously with the extremely dangerous signs of aggressive  nationalism, xenophobia and ethnic and religious intolerance"" in  Europe.    But he added, ""discussion of issues related to state borders  as well as to national minorities should take place exclusively  in the framework established by CSCE documents.""    Balladur also said Thursday the future pact would be closely  linked with the CSCE.    The United States is represented at the conference by  Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff.    The conference is chaired by Greece in its capacity as  current president of the EU after the union adopted Balladur's  initiative.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this week that the  summit aimed to settle border and minority problems between  ""countries with the vocation of entering the EU,"" following the  collapse of the Soviet bloc.    They are six central and eastern European countries --  Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and  Romania -- and the three Baltic countries - Latvia, Lithuania  and Estonia. Only one country that emerged from former  Yugoslavia - Slovenia - has been invited.    French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said the  EU, while prepared to accept new members, was unwilling to take  on board ""new sources of conflict."" The aim was to ""provide a  political impetus"" to handle good-neighbour problems ""better and  quicker,"" Juppe said.    On the agenda are the big Hungarian minorities in Romania  (1.6 million) and Slovakia (600,000).    Budapest is anxious to protect their rights to autonomy,  notably in the cultural field, while the Romanian and Slovakian  governments are seeking Hungarian acceptance of the  inviolability of existing frontiers.    The conference will also attempt to deal with the problem of  Russian minorities in the three Baltic countries and the  withdrawal of Russian troops.    The four candidate members of the EU -- Finland, Norway,  Sweden and Austria -- are attending the Paris conference, along  with the three neighbours of the central European Visegrad group  -- Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.    Apart from Russia and the United States, eight other states  with a direct interest in European stability are also taking  part -- Albania, Canada, Cyprus, Iceland, Malta, Switzerland,  Turkey and the Vatican.

Birth rates in the region are falling rapidly, and European fears of a flood of Arab immigrants are wildly exaggerated, Mr Courbage told a conference in Brussels yesterday. In fact, he added, the working-age population in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia will level off in about 2005, when the number of job applicants will begin to decrease. 'Just as Europe's bulging baby-boom generation leaves working life for retirement, and will need to rely on a sufficient labour force - foreign workers in particular - to finance it, the Maghreb labour markets, where labour will be in short supply, will be hard-pressed to meet export demands.' Mr Courbage, a senior researcher at the Institut National d'Etudes Demographiques in Paris, was speaking at a workshop on Europe and the Mediterranean at the Centre for European Policy Studies. The decrease in fertility in the Maghreb countries is acknowledged by the UN and the World Bank, he said, but those organisations had not yet taken the full measure of the decline.

The entire  huge network of influence, established when the USSR was one of  the world superpowers, continues to undoubtedly collapse, little  by little.    The 19 years of boycott harmed the postwar atmosphere and  only nourished the Cold War, contradicting the destiny of the  countries that, ultimately, live to coexist and not to nourish  the causes of misunderstandings. Almost two decades after the  day the United States withdrew from Vietnam, with the misfortune  of 58,000 deaths (compared to 1.3 million Vietnamese in the  north) and trauma that still prevails, the united Vietnam still  continues to be one of the poorest countries in the world, while  around it noncommunist countries in Southeastern Asia are  experiencing almost sustained development.    The commercial rapprochement between the United States and  Vietnam represents a major historic step toward their  reconciliation. Talks the past few years have always been  filled with passion. War veterans groups were the first to  repudiate Clinton's initiative due to doubts still surrounding  the fate of servicemen missing in action (the MIA's). According  to the war veterans, there are still 2,200 U.S. soldiers missing  in war whose fate, according to them, the Vietnamese Government  has done nothing to clarify. The discord will continue to exist  but efforts for an understanding have been strengthened.    Since late 1986, when the Vietnamese government renewed its  leadership, retiring old war heroes -- favorite disciples of  Uncle Ho, Secretary General Nguyen Van Linh has made  self-criticisms: ""The leadership's task today has changed. The  style is also changing,"" he said as he proposed changes that  entailed dismantling the centralized bureaucracy, ""based on  state subsidies that only brought suffering to the people."" It  was quite common to find youths in Vietnam, thousands of them --  mathematicians, computer experts, engineers or specialized  workers -- in other brother socialist countries who, having  returned, could not find a job or were being employed to do  simple jobs. Moreover, the economic crisis, also aggravated by  the war against the Khmer Rouge, forced thousands of Vietnamese  to seek work abroad. The rice planted in the Mekong River is  not enough to supply the entire south. Vietnam survived thanks  to the constant aid granted by communist countries, until the  Soviet empire collapsed.    Early last year the government launched a campaign against  corruption, excessive red tape, the theft of government assets,  ineptitude, and the lack of democracy. Since then the  Vietnamese leadership has been seeking to adopt market economy  principles without giving up its single party system. The U.S.  embargo gradually was being lifted as envoys have held talks  with Vietnamese leaders since the Bush administration. It is a  good thing that President Clinton, who during his youth  protested against the Vietnamese war and did not enlist to  participate in it, has taken the decisive step to lift the  resentment that has existed since 1975.

0,FT934-12786 ,"FT934-12786 _AN-DJYCQADVFT 931025   FT  25 OCT 93 / Economics Notebook: Emu still firmly on central bank agendas      By PETER NORMAN   Mr John Major thinks that calls for full economic and monetary union in Europe 'have all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency'. Tell a continental government official about the prime- ministerial jibe in a recent issue of the Economist and the reaction is one of pained surprise. Britain's European partners are again working towards Emu, even if the ambitious timetable of the Maastricht Treaty that envisages union by 1999 may slip. Germany's ratification of Maastricht after its Constitutional Court found in favour of the treaty on October 12 has brought Emu back up the European agenda. The special EC summit in Brussels on Friday this week will decide the location of the European Monetary Institute, which, as forerunner of the planned European central bank, will prepare for the third and final stage of Emu with its single European currency and monetary policy. Although August's changes to the European Monetary System mean that the European exchange rate mechanism no longer exercises its former tight discipline over EC currencies, Europe's central bankers are not ignoring Emu. Indeed, at a seminar on monetary policy, organised in Amsterdam last week by the Dutch central bank and the Centre for Economic Research at Tilburg University, both the Bundesbank and the Bank of England were making their cases for how monetary policy should operate once European economic monetary union is under way. Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist and a member of the Bundesbank board, put forward an uncompromising vision of Emu's operating according to German rules and urged that a decision on such a programme should be made now. The planned European central bank should have a money supply target to steer its policy, just as the Bundesbank steers German policy by reference to M3, the broad measure of German money supply. In that way, the new institution would inherit the counter inflationary credibility of the Bundesbank. Worries that financial innovation might undermine such targetry on a European level, as it has in the US or Britain, were probably overdone, Mr Issing suggested. Innovations tended to multiply in periods of high inflation and after regulation and deregulation in the financial sector. If stage three of Emu were to begin with prices stable, the chances of minimising the dangers of innovation would be good. By advocating a European monetary policy 'made in Germany' in this way, Mr Issing put the Bundesbank on collision course with the Bank of England. It is not so long since Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, threw his weight behind UK government efforts to scale down the EC's monetary ambitions by suggesting that other European member states should emulate the British practice of having an inflation target and use these to aim for economic convergence. In Amsterdam last week, Mr Andrew Crockett, the Bank's executive director for international monetary affairs, argued in favour of mixing rules in monetary policy with discretion. It is fine, Mr Crockett argued, to have rules for the final objective of policy such as price stability. But monetary authorities must use judgment rather than intermediate targets such as money supply in pursuit of such objectives. The pursuit of a broad money target to control inflation was too vulnerable to economic and financial change. If nothing else, the Amsterdam symposium highlighted the gulf between Anglo-Saxon and central European thinking about how monetary policy should be managed to achieve price stability. Canada and New Zealand also target inflation rates rather than intermediate goals (and introduced inflation targets before the UK) while the Bank of England's more judgmental approach has support in US academic circles. Germany's near neighbours in what is left of the ERM are keeping faith with the Bundesbank's counter inflation record by not moving aggressively to cut their short-term interest rates. Such a debate might appear abstruse. But the Bundesbank's credibility in continental Europe gives it the confidence to set the monetary policy agenda for Emu in other ways. Mr Issing made clear that a decision to use money stock as an intermediate target in monetary policy in Emu 'would only be a first step'. He spoke warmly of the German experience of controlling money market liquidity through minimum reserves - the non interest-bearing deposits that commercial banks have to place with the Bundesbank. The adoption of such a policy on a European scale could reduce the competitiveness of international banks in the City, which at present face no such rule. As Mr Issing does not look like a rain dancer, Mr Major should perhaps take note of what he says. There is another point about the debate on future monetary policy in Emu that should weigh with all 12 EC leaders when they meet in Brussels at the end of the week. Such issues as the ideal EC monetary aggregate, the merits and demerits of inflation targeting and the best way of implementing a Europe-wide monetary policy threaten to tie up some of Europe's brightest economic policy makers at a time when more urgent questions, such as how best to tackle Europe's high and rising unemployment, are crying out for an answer. This risk became clear when Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, head of economics at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, noted that 20 of the OECD's 24 member states are projected to have inflation rates below 3 per cent and asked whether the industrialised countries should not now err on the side of economic expansion rather than combating inflation. The absence of growth, Mr Shigehara warned, was fostering trade tensions and protectionism that threatened global prosperity. Sadly, and perhaps significantly, his intervention was not followed up by the 70 or so central bankers and academics at the Amsterdam meeting.

0,FT934-6700 ,"FT934-6700 _AN-DKXCSAAPFT 931124   FT  24 NOV 93 / Brussels seeks jobs blueprint      By LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS   Over the next fortnight, Europe's political leaders will be hit with a blizzard of paper recommending ways to combat unemployment and spur an economic recovery. The European Commission is preparing no fewer than four separate studies on these topics, an exercise which has strained the bureaucracy's powers of co-ordination to its limits. Even supporters admit there is duplication and overlap. The Brussels paper trail includes a Green paper on the future of European social policy drawn up by Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish commissioner; a Commission document setting out 'broad economic policy guidelines' to be adopted at next month's EU summit; a paper on the state of 'convergence' among the 12 member states' economies; and Mr Jacques Delors' own White Paper on employment, competitiveness and growth which will borrow liberally from all the above. Mr Delors, approaching his 10th and final year as Commission president, is keen to go out on a high note. The White Paper has become something of a last will and testament which he hopes will lift EU leaders sights above their short-term difficulties to the long-term future of the European economy. Mr Delors' dilemma is how to influence the debate at a time when member states are increasingly looking for national - rather than pan-European - solutions to their economic problems. The Bank of England's half percentage point reduction in its base lending rate yesterday underlined the trend. At a meeting of EU finance ministers last Monday, Mr Delors pleaded for an open-minded debate; but his prescriptions for job creation, such as a shorter-working week, lower retirement age, compulsory cuts in overtime, and more 'solidarity' between those in and out of work appeared to be given short shrift. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, dismissed the ideas as 'folly' and claimed they would actually create more unemployment. Mr Johann Eekhoff, Germany's state secretary for the economy, said such measures could only be 'a short-term emergency instrument'. Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's finance minister, said shorter working hours would send a 'negative, defeatist signal' to Europe's workers. Similarly, finance ministers expressed concern about the difficulty in cutting employment taxes. Though there is general recognition that it is necessary to encourage businesses to hire labour, ministers are worried that the loss in state revenue will have to be made up with higher taxes, such as valued added tax or new environmental levies. There is also a widespread reluctance to commit to specific targets either on interest rate cuts, or the ambitious target of creating 15m new jobs by the year 2000. Mr Delors' aides insist that the tone inside Monday's meeting was friendly, with ministers welcoming the Commission's analysis of the structural economic problems facing the Union. Yet the question of the prescription persists and will form the core debate at the European summit in Brussels on December 10 to 11. So far, there is a curiously tentative tone to the latest drafts of the White Paper. The opening section disavows any intention to legislate, and it explicitly recognises that solutions must be tailored to member states' needs. About the only strong statement the Commission makes is a rejection of the US 'trickle-down' model of reducing income disparities and improving job creation through more wealth creation. Commission officials also predict there will have to be substantial revisions of the White Book's chapter on employment. There is widespread scepticism about claims that up to 1m new jobs could be created through tighter environmental standards and more 'green' public and private sector inspectors by the end of the century. Similar assertions about the potential for employment in the arts and leisure industry are also viewed with suspicion inside the Commission. 'They seem to want to turn Europe into a giant Disney park,' said one official. Mr Delors faces a delicate balancing act, uniting his fellow Commissioners behind his own White Paper and then winning the support of the member states for a general plan of action. He must also square the circle between his support for the European social welfare state and the need for more labour market flexibility. Much work still needs to be done.

From Associated Press      LISBON, Portugal      Vasco da Gama and Ferdinand Magellan may seem unlikely rivals for Donald Duck  and Mickey Mouse. But under an ambitious plan by a group of U.S. businessmen,  the 15th-Century Portuguese explorers could vie with Walt Disney stars as major  European theme park attractions.    A U.S.-owned company, backed by the Portuguese government, is planning an  $80-million to $100-million theme park near Lisbon, based on the pioneering  Portuguese sea voyages to Africa, Asia and the New World some 500 years ago.    The Lusolandia park is set for a 1993 opening, one year after the scheduled  launch of a Euro Disneyland park in France.    Lusolandia Holdings chairman Edward Kane, a Boston native, said the project  sprang from Disney's rejection five years ago of an idea from then-Portuguese  Prime Minister Mario Soares to locate a European Disneyland in Portugal.    As Lisbon representative of the Washington-based International Trade and  Guarantee Corp., a company advising U.S. businesses abroad, Kane had been asked  by Soares -- currently Portuguese president -- to approach Disney.    ""Walt Disney Enterprises basically said no way, Portugal is too small potatoes  for them,"" Kane said.    Disney decided to locate closer to Europe's more affluent and densely populated  ""golden triangle"" formed by London, Paris and Brussels. Their French amusement  park program foresees costs of up to $2.8 billion to 1997.    After Disney's refusal, Kane turned to Management Resources, an Anaheim company  specializing in creating and running theme parks and formed by ex-Disney  employees.    ""I had the idea of . . . instead of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck . . . let's  make it a Portuguese historical theme park, let's replace Donald Duck with  Bartolomeu Dias and Mickey Mouse with Vasco da Gama,"" said Kane, a retired U.S.  foreign service officer.    Portuguese authorities backed the plan, and Mangagement Resources  enthusiastically joined the project. Feasibility studies predicted 2.15 million  first-year customers from Portugal's 10 million inhabitants and foreign  visitors to Portugal who last year topped 16 million.    The park is to be built near the town of Azambuja, 28 miles northeast of Lisbon  along the main north-south freeway to Oporto, Portugal's second largest city.    Kane said the park will also have good road links to Portugal's main tourist  destination -- the southern Algarve region -- and to neighboring Spain. The  site proposed for a new Lisbon international airport is seven miles to the east  of the park location.    Visitors will enter the 247-acre park into a mock-up of Renaissance Lisbon,  complete with castle and 15th-Century main street.    From a reconstructed quay, replicas of the explorers' caravels will carry  would-be Magellans on a voyage of discovery across an artificial lake to ""theme  areas"" representing Brazilian jungles, mysterious African kingdoms and the  glittering civilizations of India, China and Japan.    Kane said the latest technology will be used to create a have-fun-as-you-learn  environment for adults and children. The park publicity brochure promises ocean  storms and Amazonian canoe trips as well as cultural exhibits highlighting  lands along the Portuguese sea routes.

0,FT924-12844 ,"FT924-12844 _AN-CJSB0AB4FT 921019   FT  19 OCT 92 / Manifesto of despair      By IAN DAVIDSON   To judge by the coverage of the British newspapers over the weekend, Friday's European summit in Birmingham has already been consigned to the category of a non-event. Conceived last month as an international public-relations exercise, to save Mr Major's face from the domestic consequences of Black Wednesday, it was engulfed before it began by the new domestic crisis caused by the British government's decision to close 31 coal mines. Europe's leaders had answered the call to Birmingham, in the hope that they could help Mr Major and save the Maastricht treaty. By the time they arrived, the British government's self-inflicted coal crisis seemed to be rendering their efforts inadequate, irrelevant and derisory. Unfortunately, the summit was much worse than a non-event; it looked and sounded as if the Community was intent on committing collective suicide. The communique was doubtless intended to inspire confidence in the common leadership of Europe's governments, but it sounded like a manifesto of monetarist despair. The accompanying 'Birmingham declaration' had been long touted in advance by the Mr Major's government as the reassuring answer to the complaints of the Euro-sceptics that Maastricht would subject us to a centralised Euro-state. But the declaration released on Friday evening is about as reassuring as a leaky balloon. The Community's dilemma can be simply stated: Europe's governments are failing to persuade their electorates that the European Community, as it now functions, is providing answers to their real problems; and nothing that occurred last Friday will change that situation. In their communique on the economic situation, the heads of government said they were 'concerned' at lower growth and increasing unemployment. Mr Major adopted an equally lofty tone at his concluding press conference, when he said that he 'regretted' the plight of the miners his government had just decided to put out of work. But the millions of unemployed, in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, are unlikely to be impressed by the 12 governments' statement of 'concern', nor appeased by Mr Major's vacuous expression of 'regret'. On the contrary, they are only likely to be interested in Euro-babble if they get the impression that their governments, acting collectively, can do something to halt and then reverse the apparently ineluctable rise in unemployment. Is this the impression that they would get from Friday's summit? In a word, no. On the contrary, all the 12 are able to offer is the same mixture as before. 'Strong co-ordination at the Community level,' they say, 'will help to ensure that the economy of each member state is strengthened by the success of other member states.' The problem is that there has been no effective co-ordination at the Community level (for example, over the fiscal imbalance in Germany which is helping to drive the rest of Europe to perdition); and it is not at all clear what particular 'success' they have in mind. The British and other European governments have tried to cover their policy nakedness, by laying the blame for Europe's troubles on over-centralism in Brussels. They would have us believe that we would all be better off if the Commission stopped interfering in every 'nook and cranny'. Hence last week's declaration on 'subsidiarity'. There are just two problems with this subsidiarity issue: it is an off-shore principle which the UK government does not wish to apply in Britain; and in any case it is entirely irrelevant to the central concerns of the people of Europe. 'We reaffirm that decisions must be taken as closely as possible to the citizen,' says the declaration. But it goes on: 'It is for each member state to decide how its powers should be exercised domestically.' In other words, Britain will continue to be governed by an elective dictatorship, as exemplified by the secretive cabinet decision on the pit closures. Mr Major is not really interested in subsidiarity; he is merely lancing at the windmill of a non-existent European state, in the hope that this will make him look like the champion of the national interest. In any case the subsidiarity issue is just a distraction. Does anybody seriously imagine that 49 per cent of the French voted No mainly because they were worried by 'nooks and crannies'? Of course, the hunting-and-shooting extremists object to Community protection of migrant birds. But the main factor behind the No vote was obviously general economic fear. Here is the nub. The problem is not really future fear of the Maastricht treaty, but present fear of the effects of the single European market, which is relentlessly compressing prices, costs, incomes and growth. The corollary of the new world of cost deflation is that it is putting in jeopardy the European model of society. In Britain this is called the welfare state; on the Continent it is called Christian or social democracy; all these variants are threatened by European and worldwide hyper-competition, because Europe is under increasing pressure to cut out all forms of economic activity which are not immediately profitable. There is of course no magic solution; there are no national solutions, certainly not for Britain. But unless the 12 come up with some policies which seem likely to salvage both the prospects for economic growth and their traditional national models of society, the single market, the Maastricht treaty and even the Community itself could founder with all hands. And that would be a paradoxical and posthumous victory for Thatcherism.  The Financial Times   London Page 40  "

The Commonwealth Games Council for England will choose between the three on February 2. The winner will have until November next year to persuade the federation of similar councils throughout the Commonwealth to award the games to England. New Delhi, Nairobi, Cape Town and a Caribbean city are all likely contenders for 2002, but the 50th anniversary of the Queen's accession is seen as a powerful selling point by all three English hopefuls. The London bid is led by the private sector but stems from London First, part of the government's experimental city pride partnership scheme to stimulate regeneration. The Wembley stadium and arena complex are expected to figure. Sheffield's bid relies on the stadium, swimming pool and arena built for the World Student Games of 1991.

According to the writ issued on 13 June by the lower court  of  controlled substances in La Paz, 15 of the 23 individuals  arrested have been taken to the maximum security prison in  Chonchocoro. During the operation 84,500 grams of cocaine were  seized.    Judges Victor Lopez Alcala and Renan Moreno Aviles filed  against Luis Alberto Arteaga Seleme and Iver Daza Suarez, for  manufacturing, trafficking, and transporting cocaine. They are  also accused of illegal association to commit crime and are  being held at the Chonchocoro prison.    The judges also filed against Emilio Arce Vidal, Robin  Rosales Agreda, Horario Arroyo Bonilla, and Ruddy Yassir  Pedrazas Suarez. They are accused of manufacturing and  trafficking cocaine, and of illegal association to commit crime.    The following, who are at large, are also accused of the  same  crime: Juan Carlos Araoz Antelo, Johnny Lara, Clider Matienzo  Rodriguez, Victor Rosales Agreda, Johnny Rosales Agreda,  Fernando Cadario Garrido, Carlos Alfonso Gutierrrez, and Freddy  Eguez.    The antidrug judges also began criminal proceedings against  Juan Rosales Agreda who is accused of murder, cocaine  trafficking, and association to commit crime, while Luis  Fernando Bascope Rivera is accused of cocaine trafficking and  association to commit crime.    The following are accused of the same crime: Alcides Bascope  Chavez, Wilfredo Rosales Agreda, Pedro Fernandez Barrientos,  Elvio Cespedes Anez, Mario Antonio Artega Seleme, and Medardo  Vargas Callau.    William Rosales Suarez is accused of participating in  trafficking and manufacturing of cocaine, and association to  commit crime.    The judges issued an arrest warrant against the eight people  who are still at large. The Ministry of Government, through its  specialized organizations, is ordered to catch them.    The writ of indictment was forwarded to the La Paz Superior  Court for approval, according to current legal dispositions.    Antidrug judge Justino Ugarte expressed satisfaction over  the  2d. Court decision and said the Superior Court must ratify the  measures.    ""The Superior Criminal Court must approve the indictment  issued by the antidrug judges who filed the accusation based on  evidence of involvement,"" the criminal prosecutor said.    Beside dismantling three trafficking organizations,  ""Operation Trebol"" allowed the seizure of assets estimated at  several hundred thousand of dollars.    The following properties were seized in Santa Cruz:  properties on Mutualista Avenue and Paragua Street, at 605  Cotoca Canal, at Km 12 of the old highway to Cochabamba, on the  corner of the third beltway and Pedro Rivera Mendez Street, at  the ""Suto"" condominium, on San Aurelio Avenue, and on Virgen de  Cotoca Avenue.

Workers' representatives and management will start talks soon to discuss short-time working at the group's German factories for the first quarter of 1994, a spokesman said yesterday. The agenda would include a possible extension of the Christmas and New Year holiday shut-down, he added. He dismissed as speculation reports in a Wolfsburg newspaper that the local factory, the biggest in the group, with some 53,000 employees, would shut down for 47 days next year and that other plants could close for up to 60 days. The only concrete decision taken so far was to stop production for six days at VW's smallest works, a half-finished assembly plant in Mosel, eastern Germany. The VW group, which includes the Volkswagen and Audi marques, Seat in Spain and Skoda in the Czech Republic, cut output 19 per cent in the first six months this year.

Political solutions are insufficient. Grandiose development plans will take too long. In a just and perpetual peace, the powers have to ensure there is individual economic opportunities at the grassroots level of society. This need is most acute in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians need capital to develop their own small businesses and create jobs.

0,FT921-3058 ,"FT921-3058 _AN-CCQBDAABFT 920317   FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (2): 'We can still catch them' - A fervent believer in Europe's potential      By ALAN CANE   JACQUES STERN, former chairman of Groupe Bull and doyen of French computer industry executives, embodies the hopes, ambitions and contradictions of the European information technology industry. He believes passionately that Europe can, despite its current weakness in data processing markets, catch up with the US and Japan if it puts the right technology policies in place. He remains steadfastly optimistic about Europe's potential despite years of failing to cajole its major firms to work together. And he is sharply critical of initiatives that spend public money on programmes that he believes are destined to fail. He is concerned, for example, about Esprit, the European Commission driven programme in precompetitive research designed to give European companies experience in working together. He explains that when Viscount Etienne Davignon, EC vice president from 1977 to 1984, initiated the community's RD framework for IT, he saw Esprit as the first step towards a European industrial policy for IT. Davignon had failed to persuade the leading electronics companies to work together on product planning, production or marketing. Still fiercely independent, they were afraid of letting rivals in on their commercial secrets. So Esprit was launched as a pre-competitive vehicle in the hope that working together in research might inspire collaboration closer to the market. That hope was never fully realised and, with time, the gulf between research and the market has widened. At that time Davignon was Commissioner for both research and industry. Today, research and industry report to two different Commissioners. 'Esprit is not at fault, neither are the people managing the programme, who are doing a good job in Brussels. But governments can question spending large amounts of money from one precompetitive program to another if there is no industrial application. The final goal of Esprit must be to bring in cooperation innovative and competitive products to the markets that serve real needs.' The second phase of the Esprit programme, finishing this year, represents a Community investment of more than Ecu3.2bn. Mr Stern now heads the Advanced Computer Research Institute, a small research organisation based in Paris. He is unwilling to talk about his research, fearing the moment is not right to reveal progress, but he is known to have an abiding fascination with the development of supercomputers, which he likens to the creation of a Formula One racing car. The emphasis, he points out, is on doing everything faster. Just as competition improves the breed, so techniques developed for supercomputing eventually filter down to more mundane levels of computing: 'If you are not active in this market, you lose these skills.' Supercomputing is also a market controlled by US and Japanese companies. By the turn of the century, Mr Stern worries, there will be more supercomputers in Japan than in the US, with Europe trailing hopelessly if nothing is done. Supercomputers will soon be used for many commercial tasks including the design of automobiles and aeroplanes and buildings where their ability to 'visualise' structures and forces in three dimensions can improve quality and shorten design cycles. Much of what Mr Stern advocates these days turns around the idea of conserving Europe's information technology skills for the future - a holding operation while the community thrashes out an effective industrial policy for electronics. He sees a powerful opportunity with the advent of open systems, the emergence of hardware and software from different manufacturers that works easily together. He believes that all new computer products will soon be based on standard microprocessors of the risc variety. Risc, or reduced instruction set computing, is a technology which trades off simple microprocessor chips against complicated operating software. The result can be very fast chips which, linked together in networks, generate enormous processing power. The advent of risc and open systems is proving one of the few major disjunctions in a business which, despite the rate of change, is often predictable. Mr Stern says: 'It is easy to forecast what is going to happen; the difficulty is to say when.' There are only a handful of risc chip designers - International Business Machines, Sun Microsystems, Mips, Hewlett Packard as well as Intel, Motorola and Disitel Equipment. Groupe Bull has recently signed an agreement with IBM which gives it access to the computer giant's risc technology, a deal which Mr Stern believes was both fortunate - IBM was seeking new markets for its risc technology - and essential. Without a source of risc technology, Bull would have been cut off from the leading edge of open systems developments. There are a number of prerequisities for success in risc. First, considerable expertise in the design and fabrication of microprocessors. Second, experience in the kind of complex software - optimising compilers - which makes the best use of the advantages of the risc chip. Third, volume sales to give economies of scale. Mr Stern suggests that short term alliances with the US manufacturers of risc technology could give European suppliers a breathing space to devise ways to collaborate on the development of indigenous risc processors. But with Europe's semiconductor manufacturers in disarray and trailing behind the US and Japanese producers, has not Europe missed the bus on chip manufacturer? Mr Stern is unambiguous: 'You cannot drive innovation if you do not control the hardware.' European electronics may be sickly, but it has hidden strengths, he argues. There is, for example, software engineering, an area where European companies are equal to any in the world. Software engineering involves the development of methodologies, technologies and software which make it simpler to write computer programs. Software productivity has become a key issue in business with projects notoriously overunning on time and budget. Software engineering, which essentially aims to turn program production from art to engineering discipline, has a key role to play in improving matters. Mr Stern's prescription to return Europe to health involves a strong lead from Brussels with the full support of the national governments of the community. It would strengthen Europe's indigenous players through alliances with companies overseas, while seeking ways to help small, innovative companies. It is some years since Mr Stern has publicly set out his ideas on the rejuvenation of the European industry, but time has dulled neither the urgency nor the content of the message.

They said raising more money from vehicle owners presented the only realistic prospect of funding the increases in road capacity needed to cope with the forecast growth in European traffic. Opening a Financial Times transport conference in London yesterday, Mr John MacGregor, UK transport minister, said the challenge to governments throughout Europe was how to finance the new roads their economies needed. He said the UK government would this spring be proposing the introduction of direct charges for the use of inter-urban roads to attract private sector finance into roadbuilding. Mr Gunther Krause, German transport minister, told the conference that Europe faced a looming 'mobility crisis' because of rapidly rising traffic flows - with Germany, the 'number one transit country', at the centre of it. The German government, he said, was planning to introduce motorway charges to fund new roadbuilding, so creating the conditions for a privatisation of the motorway network. The budget funds released by the new source of income would be spent on improving the railways.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

It  also noted with satisfaction that the European Commission has  carried out preliminary action along these lines which will  allow dialogue with the other Community institutions. The EP,  that is particularly concerned about the ""immense"" risks  entailed by the collapse of the Soviet system for the control of  nuclear exports and the possibility that some of the 2000 to  3000 USSR specialists in the nuclear weapons field will turn  into ""nuclear mercenaries,"" calls on the Union to insist upon  the establishment of a universal control regime of the complete  uranium and plutonium cycle for civilian use (also possibly of  thorium), including material from the military cycle further to  the partial dismantling of military arsenals. The EP notes that  between 27,000 and 30,000 nuclear tactical and strategic weapons  are stockpiled in the former Soviet Union alone. It also  stresses the importance that the European Energy Charter  attaches to nuclear energy and its safety, and the strategic  role that this form of energy plays in energy supply and in the  CIS' export potential.    In its resolution, the EP calls on the European Union, on  the  basis of Article VII of the NPT, to carry out political action  aimed at encouraging the creation of denuclearised zones: The  Parliament notes that, further to South Africa's accession to  NPT, the African continent may be considered as a denuclearised  zone, and calls on the Union for vigorous diplomatic action so  that Brazil may follow the example of Cuba which joined the  Tlatelolco Treaty. This would also make Latin America a nuclear  weapon-free region. The EP states that the EU should include  conditionality clauses on nuclear non-proliferation in  cooperation agreements with third countries and that the  cooperation actions eventually established by these agreements  in nuclear energy matters should be strictly limited to the use  of this type of energy for peaceful purposes. Such clauses  should particularly be included in agreements with the CIS and  Eastern European countries and the International Centre for  Science and Technology in Moscow should make it possible for  nuclear experts to specialize in energy applications. In  addition, Parliament notes that:    - in the context of the Middle East peace talks, a  denuclearized zone should be created in the region;    - the Commission departments responsible for security checks  in the framework of the Euratom Treaty should apply the  provisions on controls of exports of nuclear material to North  Korea as stringently as possible.    Lastly, the EP calls for useless duplication between the  IAEA  (International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna) and the security  control mechanisms established under Article 77 of the Euratom  Treaty to be avoided.

0,FT934-2620 ,"FT934-2620 _AN-DLMDEACVFT 931213   FT  13 DEC 93 / Leading Article: How to build Euro-networks   Jacques Delors' plan for big investments in trans-European networks provoked controversy at the weekend summit. Britain and Germany, in particular, do not like the idea of so-called Union bonds to finance infrastructure when member states are trying to curb budget deficits. It is certainly possible to pick holes in Mr Delors' suggestions. The section of the Commission's white paper on this subject is poorly argued, repetitive and full of jargon. The bonds plan also suggests an effort by the Commission to outflank the European Investment Bank, which was asked by European leaders only a year ago to back infrastructure investment through increased lending. But it would be wrong to dismiss ideas to develop trans-European networks, which are vital to the success of the union. European businesses and individuals pay a large price for the fragmentation of transport, telecommunications and energy systems. No European can feel pleased at the delays in air travel caused by incompatible and inadequate air traffic control systems. Nor is it acceptable that it costs three times more to make a phone call across national boundaries than it does inside them. Equally, British ministers should be ashamed that trains will creep to London when the Channel tunnel opens next year because a high-speed link on the British side has not been built. Sharp perception Mr Delors' sharp perception of sickness in the European body is not, however, matched by his remedies. The white paper rightly states that the bulk of funding for information networks will come from private sources. It points out, too, that in the transport and energy field - where public sector involvement will necessarily be greater - private investor interest needs to be encouraged. Yet it fails to resist the temptation to place exaggerated emphasis on a central role for the Commission and Council of Ministers in channelling Euro-cash to worthy projects. Mr Delors also seems, at times, to think trans-European networks are inherently desirable, rather than proceeding from an analysis of identified needs. Too much faith in vague concepts such as 'mulimodal strategy' could, combined with centralised planning, land Europe with a herd of white elephants. The main reason for the fragmentation of Europe's networks is that the telecommunications, transport and energy industries are still mostly national public sector monopolies. Because they are national, they rarely look beyond their frontiers. Because they are public sector, they are strapped for cash when state bud gets are tight. Because they are monopolies, more efficient private enterprises are discouraged from providing the missing links. The priority is to open up the provision of infrastructure to competition. This would provide extra sources of finance, while ensuring that investment responds to commercial needs rather than political fancies. The Commission acknowledges this, but its plans are too timid. Cost-benefit analysis It would, however, be naive to think that liberalisation can solve all the problems, especially in transport. Many rail and road projects, which are justified on a wider cost-benefit basis, are insufficiently profitable to attract private sector support. Since national budgets are under strain, innovative ways of marrying public and private finance are needed. Possible methods include franchising services, electronic road tolls and earmarked taxes (or even bond issues) for specific projects. Trans-national coordination is sensible where the benefits of investment spill over from one country to another. It is, for example, hard to see how a single private enterprise could address Europe's air traffic problem. Modernisation of transport links between the European Union and the countries of central and eastern Europe will also require co-ordination. The white paper pays lip-service to the need to combat monopolisation and harness private finance, but it fails to state clearly that liberalisation and privatisation are being held up by powerful vested interests. Unless these can be overcome, with the aid of a vigorous campaign from the top, the plan for improved networks is unlikely to travel far from the drawing board.

The proposals are contained in a document from Padraig  Flynn,  Commissioner for Social Policy and Immigration. They are the  first indication of how far the Maastricht treaty may allow the  European Union [EU] to spread its influence into areas  previously the preserve of national governments. Mr Flynn, a  former Irish Justice Minister, risks controversy by tackling  these issues, particularly as some member states such as Britain  dispute the Commission's right to take the lead.    The document aims to accentuate the positive features of  immigration, officials say. The message behind the essentially  liberal plan is that ""immigration to Europe has been a positive  development with substantial economic and social benefits,"" an  official said yesterday. ""It has been an enriching process.""    Cash is available to assist in integrating immigrants, say  officials. Their rights need strengthening, including measures  to underpin equality, employment, housing, education and  training, particularly those aged between 20 and 30. Employers  and unions would be encouraged to adopt a new code of conduct on  non- discrimination. These programmes would involve ""education,  information and new legislation,"" officials say.    The rights flowing from legal residence vary across the EU  and are often not recognised in other states. A Turkish worker  legally resident in Germany, for instance, would have problems  finding work in Britain. The ways to achieve nationality also  vary throughout the EU, and the Flynn proposals would focus on  using dual nationality. Speeding up the process of gaining  nationality would greatly help to integrate immigrants,  officials say.    Mr Flynn and his officials emphasise this aspect of his  package, even though it also confronts the other side of the  issue -- restricting the flow of immigrants into Europe and  removing those who are already here illegally. The document  recommends tougher measures against illegal immigrants, with a  U.S.-style focus on punishing those who employ them.    The second aspect of the voluminous package is on  immigration  flows, movement of asylum-seekers and immigrants across borders.  The paper focuses on admission procedures, illegal immigration  and refugees, all areas already being tackled. EU ministers  have been working to restrict asylum-seekers by tightening  definitions, accelerating procedures and weeding out ""manifestly  unfounded claims.""    The Flynn proposals, however, deal with temporary protection  for people who, like some of those fleeing the war in former  Yugoslavia, need shelter, protection and assistance for only a  limited time. The document spells out ways of sharing the burden  among EU states when one or more faces a sudden flood of those  seeking asylum or temporary protection. This controversial idea  was advocated by Germany -- faced with massive migrant flows --  but is resisted by its partners.    The third area examined by the paper deals with the pressure  that causes immigration and the flow of asylum-seekers. It  recommends using trade and aid agreements to improve conditions  in the countries that are a source of migration, and toughening  the stance on human rights with countries where government  oppression creates refugees.    The paper is still being discussed between the different  services of the Commission and may be put before all  Commissioners next week. It would then be sent to the Council of  Ministers, which groups representatives of member states,  including on this issue the Home Secretary, and the European  Parliament. The aim is to create a detailed action programme  for legislation and decisions.    The subject matter will be controversial enough. But some  member states will be deeply opposed to the Commission taking  the lead. The Maastricht treaty created a common policy on  Justice and Home Affairs, but measures are largely left to  member states.    Many proposals will be welcomed by those working on behalf  of  immigrants and asylum-seekers. But they will horrify right-wing  opponents of the EU, since they combine the incendiary elements  of immigration and the Maastricht treaty.    They put more emphasis on the rights of immigrants and  asylum  seekers than previous decisions by EU governments that  concentrated on creating a ""Fortress Europe.""    The Commission may be taking a generous view of its  abilities  under Maastricht. But Mr Flynn's officials point to existing  powers in the area of social policy which enable him to take  initiatives. And they point out that many of the issues raised  relate to the completion of the single market.     "
0,FT943-6482 ,"FT943-6482 _AN-EH2B3AC8FT 940829   FT  29 AUG 94 / VW's big hopes for small car: Kevin Done reports on the German carmaker's efforts to catch up      By KEVIN DONE   Several thousand Volkswagen dealers from across Europe are converging on a Paris race course in the Bois de Boulogne this week. It is not for a flutter on the horses, however, but for the high pressure launch of the new VW Polo, which the German carmaker hopes its dealers will soon be selling in sufficient numbers to transform VW from an also-ran in west Europe's fiercely competitive small car market into a front-runner. The VW group, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, may be Europe's biggest carmaker, but as an individual brand VW is ranked only third behind the Opel make (Vauxhall in the UK) of General Motors and Ford. In the small car segment of the market, VW languished in sixth place with the old Polo last year. As the car bumped along to the end of its life-cycle, its sales dropped by 39.8 per cent to only 186,000, according to Automotive Industry Data, the UK-based analysts. Sales of the market-leading Ford Fiesta were more than double Polo sales at 452,000. VW has a lot of ground to make up. Even though it will have the newest car in the market, it is up against tough opposition with both GM and Fiat having made launches in the past 18 months in the shape of the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa and the Fiat Punto. It is vital for VW to achieve a breakthrough in this segment, where superminis (Fiesta, Corsa, Punto etc) and minis (Fiat Cinquecento, Fiat Panda, Renault Twingo etc) account for 31 per cent of all the new cars sold in Europe. With the new Polo, VW dealers will be able to meet the competition on a more level playing field. Its predecessor was long overdue for replacement having been launched 13 years ago, and VW had never properly met the demands of the market-place. VW's UK import subsidiary maintains that with the old model Polo, it could only cover 29 per cent of the market-place. With the new car it will be able to cover virtually the entire market and offer for the first time a host of features common among rival models, such as five doors, automatic transmission, anti-lock braking, power-assisted steering, driver and passenger airbags, air conditioning, central locking and electric windows. Mr Dieter Dahlhoff, director of marketing for the VW brand, says: 'We want to make the new Polo into a real high volume model and to use it to open doors to new customers.' The group is aiming to increase sales of the Polo to at least 350,000 in 1995. Most of the output will come from VW's Spanish plant at Pamplona with output next year targeted to reach at least 1,040 a day on two shifts with the ability to rise to 1,200 a day. The car will be built at VW's main plant at Wolfsburg at the rate of 530 a day. While ambitious for Volkswagen, these targets appear modest against the aims of its bitter rival General Motors, with which it is still locked in controversy over GM allegations of industrial espionage. Opel is raising Corsa production at its Eisenach plant in eastern Germany to 640 a day on a three-shift operation. Combined with its main Corsa plant at Zaragoza, Spain, this will raise total production for the range to 2,400 a day. The Polo must also help to bring VW down to a lower cost base, so that the heavily loss-making German group can start to rid itself of its unenviable position as Europe's high-cost carmaker. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW management board, claims the hours taken to build the new Polo have been cut by about 15 per cent (on a comparable basis to the old Polo) to 16 hours per car. The new car is also an important element in the group's platform strategy aimed at cutting costs and simplifying its global manufacturing activities. It is planning to reduce the number of basic chassis platforms from 16 earlier this year to four by early next decade. The Polo platform will spawn all other small car models in the VW group for the next decade, including Seat and Skoda. According to Mr Ulrich Seiffert, VW group research and development director, the new Polo shares about 40 per cent of its components, by value, with its half-sister, the Seat Ibiza, launched early last year. The Ibiza and the Polo share dashboards, as well as rear axle and suspension, and some engines and gearboxes. VW is developing its first mini car, smaller than the Polo, code-named the EA420 and due for launch in Europe by late 1996. Based on a shortened Polo platform and to be produced at Wolfsburg, it is supposed to be the car that proves VW can assemble cars in Germany as cost effectively as any carmaker in Europe.

Disclosure of the report is certain to increase pressure on Shamir when he  meets President Bush today to talk about a U.S. plan to revive the stalled  Middle East peace process.    The Pentagon document lists ""nuclear, chemical or HE (high explosive)"" as the  warheads for the tactical ballistic missile, which has been in the Israeli  arsenal for more than 20 years. The Jericho I reportedly has a range of about  400 miles. A newer version has a range of about 900 miles.    Although there has been speculation for years that Israel has both nuclear and  chemical armaments, the Israeli government has steadfastly refused to discuss  the matter. The U.S. government, Israel's closest ally, also had declined to  confirm the reports.

In return for participating in the talks, Israel wants an understanding that it  will not be expected to discuss anything but its plan for West Bank and Gaza  Strip elections and will not be asked to negotiate with Palestinians who do not  live in Israeli-occupied territory.    Israel's policy-making inner cabinet accepted ""in principle"" Baker's five-point  plan for Israeli-Palestinian dialogue earlier this month, but it conditioned  its endorsement on U.S. acceptance of Israeli conditions expected to make the  plan unacceptable to the Arab world. Baker said last week he had told Israel  the conditions were unacceptable before the Cabinet voted, but he has refrained  from rejecting the proposals out of hand.

The fall of the Nicolae Ceausescu regime in nearby Romania, coupled with severe  economic problems in Albania itself, last month triggered the first serious  anti-government demonstration since the Communist revolution in 1944, U.S.  analysts say.    The student-led protest in the northern city of Shkoder, Albania's  second-largest city and a major industrial and transportation center, appears  to have been put down ""immediately and violently,"" according to a State  Department official, though the event passed almost unnoticed in the West.    But the growing undercurrents of resistance to Europe's most backward, isolated  and totalitarian regime led a senior U.S. analyst to predict that ""Albania will  fall as a Communist, Stalinist state -- if not from an uprising, then from  economic necessity.""    A State Department specialist agreed. ""Now that Romania is over, all eyes are  moving to Albania. . . . It's only a question of timing and how it plays out.""    Upheaval in Albania would complete a clean sweep of the Continent's Communist  regimes.    A land of rugged mountains along the Adriatic Sea, Albania has been ruled sinc  1944 by a Communist government so uncompromising that its leaders broke with  Moscow in the 1960s, criticizing Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev as too  soft. They still count Soviet dictator Josef Stalin as their model.    Now, however, President Ramiz Alia appears to be on the defensive. Alia, a  relative centrist in a fragmented Politburo, is thought to be uncertain whether  to crack down or ease up.    The senior analyst said: ""We're seeing a pattern of economic concessions and  warnings to people that what happened elsewhere is not going to happen in  Albania. The regime is obviously nervous.""    For example, Alia, in his New Year's address to the nation, alluded to the  pressures engendered by the dramatic pace of change elsewhere in Eastern  Europe: ""The events that have occurred recently in East Europe have inspired  certain known anti-Albanian forces to resume the campaign of slanders against  our country. But, as our people say, they cannot succeed in doing us harm.""    Since last summer, there have been unconfirmed reports of demonstrations in  other Albanian towns and villages, including the oil center at Fier and the  southern city of Korca.    Albania's economy has suffered throughout much of the 1980s, bringing  increasing deprivation to what was already Europe's poorest state. After three  years of drought, the country, once self-sufficient, had to import food in  1988.    Albanian officials have reported publicly that 1989 brought a marked recovery,  but a U.S. official warned, ""None of their figures have ever been reliable.""    ""Economic difficulties and necessity are driving Albania into the 20th Century  and forcing it to deal with the outside world,"" another U.S. official said.    As with most of the new opposition movements in Eastern Europe, anti-government  activity appears to be centered among students. They are a particularly  important segment of the population of Albania because, with one of the highest  birthrates in Europe, an estimated two-thirds of its 3.2 million people are  under 30 years old.    Ironically, the Communist regime may have helped spawn its own opposition.  Albanian government statistics show that only 15% of the population was  literate in 1944. In one of its few positive accomplishments, the regime has  raised that figure to 75%, according to U.S. analysts.    ""This generation of Albanian youth is pretty well educated. It's surprising how  many speak foreign languages, especially German and English,"" the State  Department specialist said.    ""They're also not as isolated as we once thought,"" he added.    Another U.S. expert agreed: ""Albania is an island politically from the rest of  Eastern Europe. But geographically it is still there -- and the impact has to  be felt.    ""Albanians are not isolated from news. They get Yugoslav, Greek and Italian TV,  plus the Voice of America. They even get 'Dallas' in Italian. The Albanian  press has also given pretty accurate coverage of events in Romania. They know  what's going on,"" he said.    ""They want to read, to travel, to eat well and to be fashionable,"" he said.    In an officially sanctioned poll last fall, students showed unprecedented  interest in Western rock music.    The Albanian press has recently reported on extensive ""hooliganism,"" widely  interpreted by Western specialists as a denunciation of new student activism.    ""This is going to be a young people's revolution,"" one such analyst predicted.    Another potential source of opposition comes from within the peasant community,  which accounts for 70% of the population and is divided among Albania's  legendary clans.    ""(The late President Enver) Hoxha never controlled the peasants. And among the  peasants today, the Communists have no credibility. They are known only for the  negative, not the positive,"" a U.S. analyst said. ""The peasants don't think in  terms of liberation. They only know that the government has taken away their  land and their animals.""    Hoxha, who died in 1985, was the guerrilla leader who led the resistance  against the Italians and Germans in World War II and who ruled the state for  four decades in a staunchly Stalinist fashion.    The tightly knit clans have also proven largely impenetrable by the state's  Draconian secret police, the Sigurimi, U.S. officials say.    Ironically, the first visible signs of opposition have emerged at a time when  Alia appears to be moving cautiously toward reform. In a series of steps, he  has encouraged Albania's government-run media to report objectively about some  issues and has publicly criticized the government bureaucracy.    He has also allowed a handful of American tourists to visit and has established  links with American-Albanian organizations.    Alia has even eased the country's official atheism, allowing religious  ceremonies in private homes.    There have also been tantalizing hints of a desire on Alia's part for official  contacts with the United States -- the first from an Albanian leader since the  1950s.    An official of the Albanian Orthodox Church in the United States, the Very Rev.  Arthur Liolin, was granted a brief meeting with Alia in November, the first  time an Albanian Communist leader has met with such a prominent religious  figure.    Liolin met last week with Asst. Secretary of State Raymond Seitz and said  Albania has loosened its prohibition on religious practices and is seeking  business contacts with U.S. firms. ""They are very interested in the United  States,"" he said in a telephone interview.    The United States has no diplomatic relations with Albania at any level, a  State Department official said.    Alia also allowed the publication of a book that denounced the brutality,  absolute power and human rights abuses of the Sigurimi.    ""Alia is trying to save the (Communist) Party by finding scapegoats, either in  the bureaucracy or the secret police,"" said Elez Biberaj, the director of the  VOA's Albanian service and the author of several works on Albania.    He and several U.S. officials pointed out that Alia is trapped in a political  Catch-22.    ""The party must reform itself for the sake of the economy, and there are some  indications that Alia is trying to do it. But if he should carry out radical  reforms, it would almost surely lead to the decline of the party and the  system. It's a no-win position,"" Biberaj said.    U.S. officials predict that Albania's looming upheaval is likely to be violent.    ""When Albania goes, it will probably go along the lines of the Romanian model.  In other words, it will start with an incident, a protest over something like a  missed food shipment. That will lead to massive repression and deaths. Then it  snowballs into an uprising,"" a U.S. analyst said.

On 20 December  Valeriy Shmarov, Ukrainian vice premier in charge of the  military industrial complex, announced that 17 nuclear SS-24  missiles (in all there are 46 SS-24's in Ukraine) have been  taken off alert. Combat nuclear units (more than 100) have been  taken down from missiles, yet they still remain in silos.  Before the end of the year Ukraine has promised to dismantle  warheads from yet another three SS-24 missiles. And in 1994,  according to Valeriy Shmarov, the remaining SS-24 missiles  located on Ukraine's territory are to be taken off alert status.  This, in spite of the fact that back on 11 August Grishchenko,  head of the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry's Arms Control  and Disarmament Department, announced that, in Kiev's opinion,  the Ukrainian SS-24's do not come under the START I Treaty and  therefore may legally be kept.    The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that 17 warheads have  indeed been taken down from SS-24 missiles. In addition,  according to the Russian Defense Ministry, nuclear units have  been dismantled from 41 Ukrainian SS-19 missiles (more than 200  units) while part of the SS-19 missiles have already been taken  out of their silos for subsequent destruction. Therefore  approximately one-third of the Ukrainian nuclear missile  capability has been taken off alert. Clearly the joint  Russian-U.S. diplomatic and economic pressure has finally  resulted in appreciable shifts in Kiev's position. A U.S. State  Department spokesman in Washington welcomed Ukraine's latest  moves as ``a step in the right direction.''    True, full elimination of all nuclear missile disagreements  between Moscow and Kiev is still a long way off. Valeriy  Shmarov said that Russian specialists continue to service the  nuclear charges located on Ukraine's territory, and described  the Russian Government statement that such servicing has been  stopped as ``populist and uncalled for.'' Nonetheless, Colonel  General Yevgeniy Maslin, chief of the 12th Main Directorate of  the Russian Defense Ministry (earlier a highly classified branch  of the Soviet Army whose specialists deal with all matters of  storage, use, and transportation of nuclear units and are  generally responsible for all nuclear charges adopted for  service), assured SEGODNYA's correspondent that ``there are no  Russian military servicemen from the 12th Directorate in  Ukraine.'' However, the 43rd Missile Army deployed in Ukraine  includes former specialists of the 12th Main Directorate who  have ``stayed'' in Ukraine together with the army and sworn the  Ukrainian military oath, and can not now be considered Russian  servicemen.    Furthermore, only three defective SS-24 missile warheads  have  been delivered to Russian territory and transferred to  specialists of the Atomic Energy Ministry (former Sredmash).  The other decomissioned missile nuclear units are so far in  Ukraine. As before, the 43rd Army's combat unit storage  facilities remain overloaded in excess of all norms (six to  eight times, according to the 12th Main Directorate).    The question about the form and size of compensation to  Ukraine for nuclear disarmament also remains open.     "

Three of the four heirs of Mr Serafino Ferruzzi, the group's founder, have launched one of Italy's biggest claims for damages. The legal action is against Mrs Idina Gardini (nee Ferruzzi), the wife of the entrepreneur Mr Raul Gardini, who guided Ferruzzi for much of the time after Mr Ferruzzi's death in 1979. Mr Gardini, who shot himself earlier this year after becoming embroiled in Italy's political corruption scandal, gave up control of Ferruzzi in July 1991 following a family rift. Mrs Gardini received L505bn (Pounds 206m) from her relatives for her 23 per cent stake in the family holding company, which controls the quoted Ferruzzi group, and the two families parted company. In the suit, launched in the Ferruzzi's home town of Ravenna, Mrs Gardini's relatives are reclaiming the L505bn, plus interest, along with a further L1,600bn in damages to cover the alleged 'nullification' of their stake in Ferruzzi caused by Mr Gardini's alleged mismanage-ment. The group, which has borrowings of more than L28,000bn, has been effect-ively controlled by a pool of creditor banks since reporting financial difficulties in May.

On 20 December  Valeriy Shmarov, Ukrainian vice premier in charge of the  military industrial complex, announced that 17 nuclear SS-24  missiles (in all there are 46 SS-24's in Ukraine) have been  taken off alert. Combat nuclear units (more than 100) have been  taken down from missiles, yet they still remain in silos.  Before the end of the year Ukraine has promised to dismantle  warheads from yet another three SS-24 missiles. And in 1994,  according to Valeriy Shmarov, the remaining SS-24 missiles  located on Ukraine's territory are to be taken off alert status.

According to the writ issued on 13 June by the lower court  of  controlled substances in La Paz, 15 of the 23 individuals  arrested have been taken to the maximum security prison in  Chonchocoro. During the operation 84,500 grams of cocaine were  seized.    Judges Victor Lopez Alcala and Renan Moreno Aviles filed  against Luis Alberto Arteaga Seleme and Iver Daza Suarez, for  manufacturing, trafficking, and transporting cocaine. They are  also accused of illegal association to commit crime and are  being held at the Chonchocoro prison.    The judges also filed against Emilio Arce Vidal, Robin  Rosales Agreda, Horario Arroyo Bonilla, and Ruddy Yassir  Pedrazas Suarez. They are accused of manufacturing and  trafficking cocaine, and of illegal association to commit crime.    The following, who are at large, are also accused of the  same  crime: Juan Carlos Araoz Antelo, Johnny Lara, Clider Matienzo  Rodriguez, Victor Rosales Agreda, Johnny Rosales Agreda,  Fernando Cadario Garrido, Carlos Alfonso Gutierrrez, and Freddy  Eguez.    The antidrug judges also began criminal proceedings against  Juan Rosales Agreda who is accused of murder, cocaine  trafficking, and association to commit crime, while Luis  Fernando Bascope Rivera is accused of cocaine trafficking and  association to commit crime.    The following are accused of the same crime: Alcides Bascope  Chavez, Wilfredo Rosales Agreda, Pedro Fernandez Barrientos,  Elvio Cespedes Anez, Mario Antonio Artega Seleme, and Medardo  Vargas Callau.    William Rosales Suarez is accused of participating in  trafficking and manufacturing of cocaine, and association to  commit crime.    The judges issued an arrest warrant against the eight people  who are still at large. The Ministry of Government, through its  specialized organizations, is ordered to catch them.    The writ of indictment was forwarded to the La Paz Superior  Court for approval, according to current legal dispositions.    Antidrug judge Justino Ugarte expressed satisfaction over  the  second Court decision and said the Superior Court must ratify  the measures.    ""The Superior Criminal Court must approve the indictment  issued by the antidrug judges who filed the accusation based on  evidence of involvement,"" the criminal prosecutor said.    Beside dismantling three trafficking organizations,  ""Operation Trebol"" allowed the seizure of assets estimated at  several hundred thousand of dollars.    The following properties were seized in Santa Cruz:  properties on Mutualista Avenue and Paragua Street, at 605  Cotoca Canal, at Km 12 of the old highway to Cochabamba, on the  corner of the third beltway and Pedro Rivera Mendez Street, at  the ""Suto"" condominium, on San Aurelio Avenue, and on Virgen de  Cotoca Avenue.

Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said Europe needed an internal energy market which gave businesses the freedom to shop around. Some of the largest users were in industries such as chemicals and steel which compete in tough international markets where energy costs have a strong bearing on commercial success, he said. Mr Davies was speaking as the CBI launched a paper intended to influence the green paper on energy being prepared by the European Commission. It comes amid growing calls for an 'energy chapter' in the 1996 revision of the Maastricht treaty. The CBI said it viewed such calls as premature. The commission has for several years been trying to force European power and gas companies to open their largely monopolistic businesses to competition, but with only limited success. Although there are signs of change in thinking in states such as Germany which were previously suspicious of liberalisation, even the most enthusiastic supporters of change believe it will be some years before there is a deregulated market in energy.

Mr Bush's announcement came at the opening of an international conference in Washington called by the US in December to co-ordinate aid to the republics. It appeared to be aimed at defusing tensions with European allies which have criticised the US for dragging its feet over Soviet aid. In a further conciliatory gesture, the US agreed to a follow-up aid conference sponsored by the European Community in Lisbon before June. Unlike the Washington meeting, the former Soviet republics will be invited to attend. In his speech, Mr Bush urged foreign ministers and senior officials from 47 countries and five international financial institutions to 'pull together' to meet the historic challenge of winning the post-Cold War peace. He paid tribute to the 'courageous' economic reforms carried out by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, but he acknowledged that the challenge of dismantling communism and centrally planned economies was enormous. Ultimate success or failure rested squarely with the people of Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central Asia, he said. Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, who is hosting the conference, praised the European Community, especially Germany, for shouldering much of the burden of providing food, medicine and other humanitarian aid to the former Soviet Union and the republics. However, both of them avoided responding to Russia's request for a Dollars 7bn fund to stabilise the rouble and further money for a 'safety net' against the shock of radical economic reform - both of which are regarded as being vital to the transition to a free market. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said that the main industrialised countries would soon have to confront Russia's request. It was 'not far over the horizon,' he said. The US and Britain want the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to take the lead on macroeconomic reform. Although the IMF and the bank are offering technical advice, direct financial aid will be delayed until Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic states and other reformist republics take up full membership of these institutions - some time before the end of this year. The Washington conference aims to map out 'action plans' on pooling and distributing aid to the republics. Total pledges from the leading industrialised nations and the EC amount to Dollars 20bn, though the latest US pledge is dependent on Congressional approval.

He was commenting on the outcome of the three-nation summit  ending in Moscow on Friday [14 January].    ""After all, all those missiles are part of the former Soviet  Union's property and each republic, including Ukraine, can claim  for part of it. We will handle it in a way wanted by the  Ukrainians,"" the minister said. ""As far as I know, they prefer  to obtain fuel grade uranium reprocessed from the nuclear  warheads, he said adding ""we respect their right"".    On the other hand, said the minister, ""the Belarussians want  to receive their share of the weapons in money, and why not?""    The minister ruled out any extra payment to Kiev, saying it  would be humiliating to Ukraine itself and a very strange thing  for Russia to do.    Kozyrev said the United States had agreed to allocate some  $60-70 Mn to pay for the cost of transporting the weapons from  Ukraine to Russia. He described the spending involved as high  but inevitable, given that the operation must be carried out in  a way that would preclude any new Chernobyl-style accidents.    Incidentally, said the minister, the operation was caused by  a technological necessity rather than by a desire to snub  Ukraine. The missiles must be dismantled where they were  assembled and Russia alone had such facilities, Kozyrev said.    More importantly, he went on to say, the leaders of the  three  countries meeting in Moscow on Friday reaffirmed their political  will to get the problem resolved. The minister believes  technical problems to be secondary.    The assurances of security guarantees given to Ukraine by  Russia and the United States were similar to those which the co-  founders of the non-proliferation treaty - the U.S., Britain and  Russia - offered to all signatories under a Security Council  resolution, Kozyrev said. These automatically covered any  country, including Ukraine, if it gives up its nuclear status,  he said. However, the minister said that security guarantees  would be effective only after Kiev joined the non-proliferation  treaty as a denuclearized nation. But he does not rule out the  possibility of some sort of ""Ukrainian specifics.""    On the Russian-American summit itself, Kozyrev said human  rights had also been high on the agenda. The two sides were  somewhat at odds on the issue of Russian pullout from the Baltic  states and the plight of ethnic Russians there, he said.    Unlike the Americans and other western countries which start  with troop withdrawals, said the minister, we think it more  correct to begin in reverse order. ""We are ready to pull out  troops,"" he said, ""but will the Balts be prepared to observe  human rights in full measure?"" While sharing President  Yeltsin's position on the issue, I think Mr. Clinton's statement  of commitment to the human rights situation in the Baltic states  is one of the achievements of the Moscow summit, the Russian  minister said.

Mr Hurd, who was in Kiev, the capital, between trips to Kazakhstan and Russia, arrived at a tense time: Ukraine's relations with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States have been strained nearly to breaking point by a dispute over the division of the Soviet military. Although Mr Hurd said the issue was not raised in his discussions with the leadership, he said 'it would be a pity' if Ukraine left the Commonwealth and urged it to follow the example of the European Community in resolving conflicts between member states through negotiation. Over the weekend, in the Kazakh capital of Alma Ata, Mr Hurd received assurances from the republic's president that Kazakhstan would join the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and intended to become a nuclear-free state. He received similar reassurances from Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and Mr Konstantin Morozov, minister of defence. Ukraine has been steadfast in its plans to dismantle nuclear weapons. Mr Hurd praised it for setting dates for the removal and destruction of nuclear weapons on its soil and said Nato countries 'will be willing to make what contributions will be necessary to the progress of dismantling nuclear weapons'. Mr Hurd also said he was 'encouraged' by the manner in which Ukraine and other republics were negotiating the reduction of conventional forces and believed it would be possible for them to abide by the Vienna Agreement on Conventional Forces in Europe. On the economic front, Mr Hurd said Ukraine's application for full membership in the IMF was a priority and should serve as a cornerstone in the republic's efforts to move to a market economy. In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said republics of the former Soviet Union would continue to receive western economic aid only if they convinced the west they were honouring international arms control agreements, Reuter reports. In an interview published yesterday, Mr Kohl spelled out a link between aid for the CIS and assurances that agreements signed by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev would be honoured. 'In our talks on western aid, we must make clear to those responsible in the former Soviet republics that trust is a precondition for help,' he said.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

According to Leonid Kravchuk, this brief visit is as  valuable  as a long one. Bill Clinton said that the three countries'  presidents are ready to sign an agreement on Friday that will  commit Ukraine to eliminate the 176 ICBM's and around 1,500  nuclear warheads targeted against the United States and open up  new forms of cooperation in the economy, politics, and security.  ""Let me give credit to President Kravchuk for his statesmanlike  way of thinking and his guidance in reaching this accord,"" he  said.    However, the credit still has to be given: The U.S.  President promised that he would take care to ensure that  Ukraine receives most speedily the proper compensation for the  tactical nuclear weapons that have already been taken to Russia  and, in addition, that Ukraine gets a considerable amount of  money for dismantling the weapons -- money that can be used for  defense and conversion. The United States pledged to help  Ukraine during the difficult period of its transition to a  market economy. In Kiev Clinton announced the creation of an  enterprise support fund for Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus.    Ukraine's participation in the ""Partnership for Peace"" will  provide additional guarantees that it can cooperate with the  U.S. Armed Forces and with NATO countries, and Ukraine's  decision to become a nuclear-free state will make it possible  for it to obtain economic aid from the World Bank, the IMF, the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the G-7  countries.    ""I believe that Ukraine cannot be confident of its security  in the 21st century unless it is strong economically,"" Bill  Clinton said.    The Ukrainian president decided to act without recourse to  the parliament, which not so long ago even had a fair number of  complaints to make about the START-I Treaty. ""Philosophers say  that everything in the world is changing and that you cannot  step into the same river twice,"" Leonid Kravchuk said. ""It is  the same with the parliament: I hope that it will understand  the crux of this global problem facing the world, the crux of  our relations, and given the three states' mutual desire we will  fulfill our commitments with its support.""    The last session of the current Supreme Council next week  could upset this: The accusation of ""disarming"" Ukraine is one  that many people respond to, particularly during an election  campaign. During Clinton's visit the youth faction of the  People's Rukh demonstrated at the airport with the Ukrainian  Students' Union. Boys stood under banners proclaiming ""Careful,  Clinton: First Crimea, then Alaska""; ""Bill, would you disarm if  you were in the same cage as a Russian bear?""; and ""All Missiles  to Zhirinovskiy?""    The last question is of interest to many Ukrainian  inhabitants -- it may be cleared up by the three president's  meeting in Moscow.     "

The leading European rocket engine manufacturers--German  Aerospace (DASA), Fiat Avio, SEP (European Propellant Company),  Techspace Aero, and Volvo Aircraft Engines, Inc.--have signed an  agreement that is expected to ensure the development of  high-performance engine systems beyond the year 2015. The  regular workforce of experienced workers is expected to continue  to be motivated and their valuable know-how to be safeguarded.    Before the German-French Society for Science and Technology  in Bonn, Roger Vignelles, the chief executive officer of SEP,  and Werner Inden, a member of the board of DASA/Erno Space  Technology, Ltd., in Bremen, seemed to be optimistic that  Europe's space industry could hold its own against the  competition from the United States, Russia, China, and Japan in  future as well.    Rocket engines are a specific branch of the high-tech  industry. This is why the experiences amassed and top  performance obtained in this field over the past 20 years could  not have been preserved and developed with activities in other  fields. Moreover, while it takes a very long time to develop  rockets and their core, the propulsion system, they also have a  very long operational life. This is why we had to set our course  for need-oriented developments early on.    In the opinion of the five rocket engine manufacturers, we  can count on the following developments in the  economic-technical domain over the next 10 years: an increase in  rocket payloads for the purpose of transporting heavy  geostationary telecommunications satellites, intensification of  earth observation, more science satellites, the development of  satellites weighing from 0.5 to 1 ton for low orbits, a demand  for military reconnaissance satellites in Europe too, and a  European contribution to the development of a manned space  station. In the additional 10 years until 2015 we may count on  Europe's participation in the operation of a space station and,  furthermore, on manned space transportation as well as round  trips to the moon.    In the field of telecommunications the number of satellite  positionings will, to be sure, stagnate, but the payload of a  carrier will increase every seven years by from 800 to 1,000 kg  and this will happen despite the huge increase in carrier  capacities as a result of further miniaturization.    After 2015 we can count on drastic cost reductions in space  transport with completely new fields of application to solve  mankind's global problems. The catchphrases with regard to this  are, among others: solar energy from space and (wireless)  transmission of same to the earth, the alleviation or solution  of the ozone problem, and the transporting of the rare gas,  helium, from the moon to the earth. A solar station in outer  space with an output of 10 gigawatts (as muchas eight  Biblis-type nuclear power plants produce) will also presuppose  an entirely new infrastructure on the earth. Furthermore,  reusable rocket engines will have to be developed. But first the  development of large (lightweight) structures will also still  have to be mastered. The development of closed life (survival)  systems for longer space missions will be an enormous task.    In the opinion of the rocket engine makers, the Ariane 5,  the  basic development program for which will be completed in 1995,  still absolutely has the potential for improvement as concerns  cost reduction, only, however, to a maximum of about 10 percent.  Greater savings beyond this can only be achieved through new,  reusable equipment. Moreover, the U.S. shuttle is not de facto a  really reusable piece of equipment.    At the present time the engine manufacturers are thinking of  developing a small engine for a reusable ""demonstrator"" weighing  from 10 to 15 tons in order to ""familiarize themselves with the  technological requirements."" In connection with this, the  Europeans are said to have negotiated with the Russians to let  them have the appropriate (very advanced) know-how for the  attractive price of 40 million German marks.    In the industry's opinion, the competition in the commercial  space industry--especially for the positioning of  telecommunications satellites--will be tougher in the near  future than up to now between the European Ariane, the American  Atlas 2AS, possibly a new U.S. development, and, furthermore,  the Chinese ""Long March,"" the Japanese H2, and the Russian  Proton. However, the experts acknowledge that the design for the  Ariane 5 presented in 1984 represents the best combination of  performance, cost, and reliability.     "

The proposed Pounds 80m windfarm would comprise more than 250 wind turbines, each 170ft high, with the capacity to feed up to 80 megawatts into the national grid. Power stations of 50MW or above are the planning responsibility of the DTI, rather than local authorities. The three square mile site, believed by TriGen to be the windiest in England, is 1,500ft above sea level, and is owned by Forest Enterprise, the Forestry Commission's estate management arm. TriGen expects average output to be between 20MW and 30MW. The electricity would go on power lines to a substation at the Royal Air Force's Spadeadam base in Cumbria. The project needs planning permission as well as a subsidy under the UK government's non-fossil fuel obligation scheme, which requires electricity companies to buy some energy generated from renewable sources. TriGen Windpower intends to bid for subsidy in the next tranche of schemes, expected later this year. It hopes to have the windfarm operational by the end of 1995.   Companies:-  TriGen Windpower.

The 'recapitalisation' and provision of additional RD funding of Europe's only remaining independent chip-maker was agreed at the Franco-Italian government summit yesterday. The additional French funds for SGS-Thomson will be channelled through the three state shareholders - Thomson CSF, CEA-Industrie and France Telecom. IRI, the Italian state holding company, holds a 45 per cent share in the company, with the remaining 5 per cent held by the latter's high technology subsidiary, Finmeccanica. However, it is more likely that the bulk of the Italian funds will be funneled through ENEA, the state nuclear and alternative energy research institute. This would make ENEA a shareholder in the venture and mean that Italy is emulating an ownership similar to that of France. France has been pressing Italy, which is trying to restrain its ballooning public deficit, to find more money for SGS-Thomson since September when the French government brought in CEA-Industrie, the industrial arm of its Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, and France Telecom to help Thomson-CSF out.

""If the Slovak Government still agreed with dissemination of  RFE broadcasts, it would actually agree with the correctness of  the discriminatory decision,"" Hrnko says.

Hrnko notes that in the past the RFE was dividing the Slovak  political scene into the democratic part, whereby the  pro-Czechoslovak forces were meant, and the undemocratic part,  whereby the advocates of Slovak sovereignty were meant. ""This  division complicates the real crystallization of the political  forces.

0,FT941-8592 ,"FT941-8592 _AN-EBRCXAGLFT 940218   FT  18 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Sharp reversal in long-dated US Treasury prices      By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN      NEW YORK, LONDON   Longer-dated US Treasury prices went into free-fall yesterday afternoon in a sharp reversal from the morning's activity, when a tame reading on consumer prices sparked a short-lived rally. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond plunged by 1 5/32 to 96 1/16 , after climbing as high as 97 7/8 early in the session. Significantly, yields breached the psychological 6.5 per cent barrier, jumping almost 9 basis points to 6.546 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 3/32 , to yield 4.472 per cent. Analysts said the turnround reflected the market's extreme sensitivity since the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy two weeks ago. At first, prices at the long end surged after the Labor Department revealed that its consumer price index was unchanged last month, while prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors were up a mere 0.1 per cent. The results were a pleasant surprise for the market, which had expected a 0.3 per cent rise in both statistics. The data were a powerful indication that inflation, which undermines the value of fixed-rate securities, remained well under control in January. The jubilant mood, however, was short-lived, as contradictory evidence surfaced during the morning. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve said the prices paid by manufacturers in the region had increased sharply, with the so-called prices-paid index in its February business outlook survey climbing to 30.4 in February, from 25.7 the previous month. The news caused the long bond to turn in its tracks and retreat to near its opening level by midday. Later the decline accelerated as speculative accounts and dealers scrambled to unload positions. With the Fed leaning toward a second strike on rates, traders saw danger signals in the Philadelphia report, which contained the kind of long-term price data which may trigger further action. Europe's government bond markets had a volatile day, rallying smartly on the Deutsche Bundesbank's discount-rate cut and lower-than-expected US inflation numbers, and then sliding back on a late bout of profit-taking. Despite Wednesday's upbeat monthly report from the German central bank, most bond dealers were not expecting a rate cut and were taken by surprise when the bank announced it was lowering its discount rate by 1/2 point to 5.25 per cent while leaving its repo rate unchanged at a fixed 6 per cent. The German rate cut was followed by similar moves in Austria, Belgium and The Netherlands, fuelling hopes that Italy and France would follow suit soon. 'The easing process is back on track,' said Mr Klaus Baader, senior international economist at Lehman Brothers in London. He expects only one week of fixed-rate repos in Germany, before a return to variable-rate repos paves the way for lower money market rates. While he said bond markets could weaken in the near term following yesterday's sharp gains, he said that prospects for continued easing would keep prices underpinned in coming weeks. Others were less sanguine. 'I'm bearish for bonds, and feel the next move will be down,' said Mr Steve Major, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. 'The repo rate is still 6 per cent and it still costs us the same to carry bond positions.' He felt that the main boost for Europe's markets came from US January CPI numbers which prompted a sharp rally in US Treasuries. When that succumbed to profit-taking, European bonds fell with it. German bund futures soared on the rate cut news and the Liffe bund futures contract, which had opened at 98.62, rallied to a high of 99.30. However, the market fell back later and the contract touched a low of 98.38 before ending the day at 98.50. Traders said the bulk of trading took place in the futures pits, with cash activity very limited. 'In these fast markets, most investors are afraid of getting their fingers burnt,' said one trader. UK gilts had a similarly volatile day, with cash bond prices ending steady to slightly higher. Trading was largely futures-driven. The March long gilt futures contract, which opened at 116.08, rose to a high of 117.01 and ended the day at around 116.03. The Italian bond market, which suffered the worst losses in recent days, posted substantial gains on hopes for a near-term cut in interest rates.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT933-2484 ,"FT933-2484 _AN-DISAKABUFT 930918   FT  18 SEP 93 / Lights, camera - reaction]: France's film industry fears a loss of identity if culture is included in Gatt      By DAVID BUCHAN   We cannot allow the Americans to treat us as they did the Redskins,' Mr Bertrand Tavernier told the European parliament this week. He and other French film directors fear that, if the cinema is included in the Gatt trade negotiations, Hollywood will either kill off their livelihood or force them on to some ever-shrinking cultural reservation. So, a kind of Stars War has broken out between the US and France, already at Gatt loggerheads over agriculture. Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture minister, said this week that his government 'will not sign' a Gatt deal that covers, however marginally, the audiovisual industry. The threat of a French veto is nothing like as real over the cinema as over farm trade. But the Gatt negotiations enter the home straight just as France is bracing itself for what its culturally prickly establishment sees as another wave of American celluloid imperialism. Yesterday Ted Turner's new TNT/cartoon satellite channel started beaming across Europe, and Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park is about to hit French cinemas next month. Gerard Depardieu, the thinking woman's truck-driver, and star of the French cinema, joined Mr Tavernier and many other actors, producers and directors in Strasbourg this week to lobby MEPs. He stoutly denies that, by taking up cudgels against the US in Gatt, suspect he is being 'anti-American'. He himself has appeared in US films, and has indeed helped distribute some in Europe. But he also recognises that Hollywood is 'a war machine, a state within a state', which has captured nearly 60 per cent of the French market, holds an average share of 80 per cent in Europe, and is voracious for more. Depardieu says France's cinema constitutes 'our identity', which others claim he incarnates personally. 'Gerard Depardieu is as much a symbol for the French as John Wayne was for Americans,' says Mr Rene Cleitman, head of Hachette Premiere, which produced the highly successfully Cyrano de Bergerac with Depardieu in the star role. Films have a wider role in conveying a whole lifestyle, says Mr Nicolas Seydoux, head of the Gaumont cinema chain, pointing out that, 'without Westerns, blue jeans would not have invaded the whole world'. Just as in France's other international dramas over currencies and farming, the 'Anglo-Saxons' - a term more widely used in France than anywhere else - are cast as the villains, with the British always wearing some of the 'black hats'. Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK commissioner who is chief Gatt negotiator in Brussels, is seen as the man who, wittingly or not, is about to sell the French cinema down the river. In fact, the quarrel arises out of a difference over tactics, not aims. Sir Leon stresses that Hollywood should not, and will not, be allowed to steamroller Europe's cultural identity. But his US opposite number, Mr Mickey Kantor, who happens to hail from the tinsel town of Los Angeles, has insisted that the audiovisual sector counts as a service for inclusion in the Gatt. Since Brussels is keen that no services should be allowed to escape the Gatt  -precisely because Washington has tried to keep some financial, transport and telecommunications services out of the Gatt - Sir Leon is suggesting including the audiovisual dossier in the Gatt, but safeguarding it with a clause declaring its 'specificity'. He believes that this would give Europe's audiovisual industry protection against any unilateral US action. France's government and film industry believe this to be a fundamental miscalculation, and urge that Europe should make the audiovisual industry a formal 'exception' to the Gatt (as Canada did with its film industry in its free trade deal with the US). The threat of American bullying, outside Gatt, is phoney, says Mr Dominique Wallon, head of France's powerful Centre National de la Cinematographie. 'What could the Americans retaliate against, when we have only 1 per cent of their market?' he queries. Worse, 'putting the very complex French system of film support under the Gatt would at best freeze it, preventing its further development, and at worst lead over time to its dismantling, piece by piece', Mr Wallon fears. 'Very complex' is indeed an understatement about a system which helps French film-makers at every step: Some FFr1.6bn (Pounds 182m) a year is raised, from levies of 5.5 per cent on TV stations' turnover, 11 per cent on cinema tickets and 2 per cent on video distributors' turnover, to back new films. FFr600m a year in public money goes to help script-writers, to copy films, renovate cinemas and even promote cinema studies in the classroom. French programmes must fill no less than 40 per cent of TV stations' prime airtime, and EC-made programmes at least 60 per cent. They also have to 'pre-buy' a certain number of French films a year. For their part, radio stations have a French content requirement of 15-65 per cent. Hardest to meet, says Mr Andrew Manderstam, head of the RFM radio rock station, is a requirement to play records by relatively unknown 'nouveaux talents' twice an hour. So, in a sense, France has already put its film industry on an Indian reservation against further encroachment from Hollywood's cavalry. Yet this self-protectionism does not appear to have dulled the creativity of French cinema, which - with the decline of its Italian and UK counterparts - is Europe's largest and most successful. The evidence is that French filmgoers want to go on having the best of both worlds (their own and America's), rather than end up with the worst as well as the best of one Americanised world.

Supervisors voted 4 to 0 to spend $200,000 for equipment and technicians and  construction of the facilities in the county morgue building in Santa Ana.    The laboratory will make possible DNA -- or deoxyribonucleic acid -- profiles  of unique genetic codes in everything from hair and skin samples to blood and  other body fluids, helping prosecutors tie evidence to a crime suspect.    The lab will be in operation by late December and two chemists should be ready  to take their first case by January, 1990, coroner's office spokesman Larry  Ragle said. The lab will include $80,000 in special equipment, the most  expensive being a video-imaging system, an environmental incubator, a genetic  evaluation system, scales and a chromatography refrigerator.    ""I believe that this DNA lab will make a wonderful present for the people of  Orange County to have under their Christmas trees for 1989,"" Supervisor Don R.  Roth said. ""And let the word go out into the criminal world that Orange County  will have the most modern crime-fighting tools in our arsenal -- a DNA lab,"" he  added.    The county also will include a genetic testing laboratory as part of the  county's planned new forensics building that will be built in two years.  Because the Sheriff's Department has been training the two employees in genetic  research, Orange County is perhaps more than a year ahead of Los Angeles or the  state in operating a genetic testing laboratory, Ragle said. The state plans to  build its main DNA lab at Berkeley.    Some staff members said they could not remember when an issue was dealt with so  quickly by Orange County supervisors. Questions on financing the lab surfaced a  little more than two weeks ago, and since then, county administrators prepared  a lengthy report on the feasibility of such a laboratory. That report was  approved Tuesday by the supervisors.    The latest push for the DNA lab followed the recent rape of a 12-year-old girl  in a gated community in Huntington Beach. It was learned that the suspect  arrested in that case earlier had been acquitted of a rape charge after  prosecutors were late in receiving DNA evidence from an outside lab.    Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who stirred some hard feelings when she said at  the earlier board meeting that she identified more with rape victims than the  four male supervisors, was absent for the vote Tuesday because she was in  Washington on county business. But in a prepared statement, Wieder said the lab  approval ""will go a long way toward ensuring that residents of Orange County  receive the best law enforcement services available.""    Roth, who called for the study on how to fund the DNA lab without using general  fund money, praised the district attorney's office, the county counsel's office  and the Sheriff's Department for completing the report in ""record time."" The  report said the lab could be self-sufficient in the future, especially if it is  designated a regional facility by the state.    None of the start-up funds will come from the county's general fund. About  $120,000 of the needed amount will come from Neighborhood Development and  Preservation funds, raised from county property taxes and designated for  redevelopment projects, along with $80,000 raised by the Sheriff's Advisory  Council from private sources in the county. The county counsel has determined  that use of redevelopment funds for the lab is legal.    There remains some uncertainty, however, about the admissibility of such  evidence.    According to Orange County's lawyers, the highest appeals court in Virginia has  ruled that DNA evidence is admissible, and DNA evidence has been admitted in  trial courts in 32 states, including a case in Ventura County.    Earlier this year, Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp approved use of so-called  ""genetic fingerprinting"" evidence in criminal cases. But there have not yet  been any California appellate cases or any California statute on the  admissibility of DNA testing evidence in California Courts, said Barbara L.

Honda said that Peugeot was among a number of candidates to supply diesel engines for its Civic model, which is to replace the Concerto. The Japanese car maker is already selling Concertos in Europe with Peugeot diesel engines. The Concertos are manufactured for Honda by Rover. Honda does not make diesel engines of its own and trying to develop one would be extremely costly. Honda denied that it was in detailed negotiations with specific companies but confirmed that Peugeot was among a number of possible candidates. Nissan is also considering using European diesel engines in its Primera cars. These are exported from Japan and currently have Japanese engines. Because of the rise of the yen, it is expensive to export diesel engines from Japan to Europe, Nissan said. 'Diesel engines will become more widespread in Europe and if we decide that buying from another manufacturer on an original equipment manufacturing basis is the best way to go, we will consider it,' the company added. The interest both companies have shown in buying diesel engines in Europe represents a marked step away from past practice among Japanese car makers, which have considered it crucial to use their own engines.

0,FT911-4372 ,"FT911-4372 _AN-BDSBDAEFFT 910419   FT  19 APR 91 / BSkyB acts to resolve row over high quality television pictures      By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and RAYMOND SNODDY   BRITISH SKY Broadcasting could be transmitting higher quality pictures for reception on wide screen television sets by the end of the year under a proposal before the European Commission. The move could end a potentially serious row over European television standards and represent a big step towards eventual adoption of a system under which high definition television would be provided throughout Europe. This would help free movement of production equipment, television sets and programmes. A current European Community directive requires all satellite broadcasters to use the Mac system which provides better pictures than those from other television transmission systems. BSkyB - formed last year from the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Sky Television - avoids the Mac requirement by transmitting from Astra, which is a telecommunications rather than a television satellite. The proposal being discussed with the Commission envisages BSkyB broadcasting simultaneously in its existing Pal system and in a Mac system called D2-Mac, but only if the Commission pays the additional cost - of more than Pounds 5m a channel a year. The D2-Mac system was created as a half-way house to European high definition television, which is expected to be introduced in the mid-1990s. A directive is under discussion which could impose D2-Mac on all satellite broadcasters, a move favoured by some EC governments. If D2-Mac became the satellite standard, Pal could be phased out for satellite use over three-seven years, rendering much European satellite reception equipment obsolete. BSkyB says it is prepared to broadcast first one and then the second of its movie channels in the new wider screen format using D2-Mac. If there was enough demand the sports channel could also be broadcast in the format. Agreement by BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, to broadcast in D2-Mac would provide a big boost to Europe's efforts to create its own advanced television system. The enhanced standard suffered a serious blow when BSB merged with Sky. BSB had used D-Mac, a British variation of D2-Mac, but the merged organisation made clear it would broadcast in Pal. Its decision had represented a setback to the prospects for the Mac system. EC telecommunications ministers meet on June 3 to decide on the new satellite broadcasting directive to succeed the one expiring at the end of the year. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the technology commissioner, has said new legislation should be combined with a consensus approach to resolving the standards issue. Simultaneous D2-Mac and Pal transmission by BSkyB, one of Europe's largest satellite broadcasters, would mean that confrontation with the Commission could be avoided. British-based television makers threw their weight behind the drive to create a single European satellite standard. Lord Chapple, president of the British Radio and Electronic Equipment Manufacturers' Association, expressed support for D2-Mac, in effect withdrawing the manufacturers' backing for D-Mac, which has been used only in the UK.

0,FT941-7558 ,"FT941-7558 _AN-EBXC7ADLFT 940224   FT  24 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Why a buoyant US and Asia pity poor old listless Europe - The view from outside      By WILLIAM DAWKINS, MARTIN DICKSON and JOHN BURTON   Europe's flagging prowess prompts surprise, criticism and - worst of all - pity from business leaders in the US and Asia. Many American executives, basking in their country's economic revival, are scathing about the Old World's inability to find the path back to growth. Although corporate Japan is preoccupied by the country's own recession, its representatives wonder aloud about Europe's capacity to solve its problems. Elsewhere, in east Asia's booming 'tiger' economies, industrialists say bluntly that Europe will slip further in the competitiveness league unless it adopts more free market medicine. Many US executives attribute their country's economic recovery to the creative energy of American capitalism. They view Europe, by contrast, as a soft, sclerotic society, addicted to subsidies, welfare handouts and long holidays. 'Painful as it must be, Europe needs to celebrate change,' says Mr Tom Theobald, chairman of Continental Bank. 'Some wonderful cultural and societal values are bottled up in European tradition, but the communication and transportation revolution no longers allows the continent to be walled off from world competititors. Change is frightening, even in America, but Europe must master the art.' Americans acknowledge that, in sectors such as power generation equipment, chemicals and retailing, Europe remains competitive. However, Europe is regarded as lagging badly in many important high technology industries, including computer hardware and software, data networking, and multi-media telephony and entertainment. One top executive at a leading US electronics group says most American companies know relatively little about European companies because so few of them are good enough to set standards in their individual sectors. European volume motor manufacturers, for years protected from Japanese competition, are regarded as well behind the European operations of Ford and General Motors in productivity and cost-cutting. Americans point to recent decisions by Germany's BMW and Mercedes-Benz to locate new factories in the southern US. This shows, they say, how European industry is trying to escape high domestic costs by moving abroad. Japanese executives these days pay less attention to Europe, reflecting a shift in Japan's investment priorities to China and other parts of Asia. Additionally, BMW's surprise move to buy 80 per cent of Rover, the UK motor company in which Honda holds a 20 per cent stake, has reminded Japanese businessmen of the differences in corporate culture between Europe and Asia. Mr Toyoo Gyoten, chairman of the Bank of Tokyo, says Europe faces 'multiple challenges' as a result of 'dangerously high' unemployment and post-cold war uncertainties. Mr Gyoten says an important priority is 'to complete the reunification of Germany as soon as possible'. 'United Germany is bound to play the role of an anchor in the economic and political stability of Europe. However, it didn't take much time for our German friends to discover that the task of unification was indeed a daunting one.' Mr Gyoten adds that the collapse of the European Monetary System has 'maimed' momentum towards economic integration. Europe will remain a federation of nation states, he says. 'Convergence of economic fundamentals must come first before artificial institutionalisation (of European union.)' The most outspoken advocacy of free market solutions comes from South Korea. Mr Bae Soonhoon, president of Daewoo Electronics, says: 'The solution to the European malaise is simple: give Adam Smith as much chance to work as possible. Remove the paternalistic protection given to industry and workers, which in many cases is neither wanted or needed. 'Europeans must recognise that today's comforts have been made possible by the industriousness of their forefathers, and the value of hard work must be relearned from them.' Mr SaKong Il, a former South Korean finance minister and president of the Institute for Global Economics in Seoul, says Europe has lost its sense of priorities. 'It has been devoting too much time and energy to political integration. It has not paid enough attention to unemployment and other social problems.

It condemns  manifestations of terrorism in all their forms and is prepared  to take part in the investigation of this tragic incident in  order to punish the guilty,"" ITAR-TASS was told today by Libyan  Ambassador to Russia Muhammad 'Husni Sha'ban.    The ambassador dwelt on the charges advanced against Libya  the United States and Great Britain. Two Libyan citizens are  known to be suspected of organising an explosion on board a  Pan-American liner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988.  France accuses Libyan agents of blowing up a French liner,  belonging to the UTA air company, in Niger in 1989. These  incident claimed the lives of 449 people.    The ambassador noted that Libya had insisted on a ""fair and  just"" investigation of the charges brought against its citizens,  who should be first tried by a Libyan court. Later it had  softened its stand and agreed that the investigation should be  conducted by The Hague International Court. The United Nations  and the Arab League could find an appropriate legal basis for  this. It had also offered to conduct a joint investigation by  representatives from the United States, Great Britain, Libya and  several other states. According to Sha'ban, all these proposals  were rejected by Washington and London. They continue to insist  on the unconditional extradition of the suspects, to which Libya  cannot agree, of course. The Arab League even offered to try  the two Libyans by a court of Scottish judges and according to  Scottish laws at The Hague International Court, but this  compromise was turned down by the British side. On the whole,  the Libyan leadership holds that the two Libyan citizens, whose  crime has not been proved, are merely suspects, not even  defendants. Hence, the demand for their extradition is legally  ungrounded. ""We decided to put off the case indefinitely,  because we have exhausted all our arsenal of reasonable  proposals and are now looking forward to constructive steps from  the other side,"" Sha'ban said. The Arab League, the African  Unity Organisation, and the Islamic Conference Organisation,  accounting for the majority of the U.N. membership, have  condemned the U.N. sanctions against Libya, imposed on Western  insistence.""    Asked by ITAR-TASS to describe the current state of  Libyan-Russian relations, the ambassador noted that, in his  opinion, the U.N. Security Council Resolution 748 of May 31,  1989, imposing international economic sanctions on Libya, was  primarily intended to cause material and moral damage to  Tripoli. Moreover, it was a deliberate blow, inflicted by the  masterminds of the resolution on Libyan-Soviet relations, and on  relations between Libya and the USSR's successor -- Russia.    ""The carefully worded boycott resolution,"" he said, ""is  spearheaded against the delivery to my country of armaments and  other military hardware, which mostly came from Moscow. The  embargo on air traffic was also mainly directed against Russia,  with which we were then conducting talks on the improvement of  air carriages. At the same time, the oil, which is being used by  the West, remained outside the embargo. As a result, the damage  caused to Libya and Russia amounted to several billion U.S.  dollars. The treaties, agreements and contracts are to expire  in all the spheres they cover only in 1997, but they have  already been suspended, just as payments for Russian services in  the sphere of economic deliveries, personnel training,  maintenance of technical facilities, including military  installations. In other words, the process of cooperation  between the two countries was suspended.    The ambassador refused to give the exact figures of this  cooperation, but, according to information received by ITAR-TASS  from other sources, Tripoli's debt to Moscow totalled 21 billion  U.S. dollars in the period from 1970 until today. Approximately  18 billions have already been paid.    In conclusion, Sha'ban expressed regret that Russia was  voting in the U.N. Security Council for further sanctions  against Libya. At the same time, he expressed satisfaction with  the fact that Moscow was lately trying to mediate between  Tripoli and the other parties to the conflict, but so far its  initiatives have not evoked any response from the West.

[Soares] We must do both at the same time.    [LE FIGARO] Would not such change be too much of a shock for  newcomers?    [Soares] Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland want to join  the Union. Their motives are mostly economic. But we need to  explain to them that enlargement without a renewed political  structure is not a viable proposition. One of these days,  Europe will fall apart unless it has a political structure and a  real European constitution. We need European parties, European  trade unions, etc.    [LE FIGARO] After taking in such countries, will it be  necessary to rebalance the Union to the south, for instance by  having Malta or Cyprus join in?    [Soares] Yes, I believe it is necessary. We shall also need  to readjust eastward.    [LE FIGARO] Do you believe that Europe is taking too long in  opening its doors to new Eastern democracies?    [Soares] Yes, without any doubt. I believe Europe has not  proved bold enough, that its response to the perspectives that  have opened has been completely inadequate. The Europe we built  was one based on the divide between two blocs. Now that blocs  have vanished, we cannot keep looking at Europe in the same  light as before.    [LE FIGARO] How do you view Europe's attitude with respect  to the Bosnian conflict?    [Soares] Europe has not progressed as far as external policy  and defense are concerned. Institutionally, Europe has made no  headway either. Bosnia is a good reason for us to speed up the  construction of a real European political structure.    [LE FIGARO] Is not the Maastricht crisis behind us, now?    [Soares] Things have improved, no doubt about it. But  everything remains to be done. One major problem is the fact  that since Europe's inception, the driving force has been the  Franco-German axis. What will become of this axis in the  future? That is the question. There is no certainty that all  difficulties have been overcome.    [LE FIGARO] What are you worried about?    [Soares] What will come out of the election in Germany?  Chancellor Kohl has taken a major part in the European  construction; he has always been strongly pro-European. He is a  German of the West. We do not know whether his successors will  share his European ideal.    [LE FIGARO] Doesn't Europe need a charismatic figure?    [Soares] Yes, I think so. You know, for years, all  Europeans have tended to look at Mitterrand as the man who  embodied this determination to build Europe. But Mitterrand is  now reaching the end of his term....    [LE FIGARO] Among Europe's other potentially troublesome  neighbors are also North African countries, and especially  Algeria. What turn do you expect things will take in Algeria?    [Soares] I do not see any short-term solution.    [LE FIGARO] Do you believe a military dictatorship can work  toward the reestablishment of a civilian government in a few  years' time?    [Soares] This can only be a temporary solution.    [LE FIGARO] There is the example of Turkey....    [Soares] Turkey remains a problematic country, but true,  things have not gone too awry there.    [LE FIGARO] Is Islam the West's new enemy, now that  communism is dead?    [Soares] There are exponents of Islam with whom it is  possible to talk. One cannot be satisfied with a simplistic  vision of the problem; no attitude could be worse. There are  positive forces within Islam. We must encourage and help them.  One must never lose sight of the economic and social context in  which Islam thrives. This is what fuels religious fundamentalism.    [LE FIGARO] Even in Saudi Arabia?    [Soares] We should not let Saudi Arabia remain the way it  is, we should not let the people of Islam revert to archaic  models.    [LE FIGARO] And still we do nothing about it....    [Soares] The West does nothing about it; that is the West's  mistake. If one wants to foster democracy, one cannot tolerate  dictators. This is the contradiction at the core of the United  States' policies, as well as Europe's, to a lesser extent. Take  East Timor, which was annexed illegally by Indonesia after the  1975 military invasion. We have been exerting pressure on the  United Nations so that this island's right to self-determination  may be recognized. This is a just cause. And yet, when we ask  France or other European countries for help, we are faced with a  wall of silence. Of course, Indonesia is a powerful country  that purchases European goods. So we conveniently forget that  it is a dictatorship.    [LE FIGARO] Is not your position somewhat inconsistent?  On the one hand you advocate dialogue with Algeria's  fundamentalists, and on the other you believe that we should  interfere with Indonesia or Saudi Arabia's affairs -- hard-line  regimes, to be sure, but without a civil war.    [Soares] No, they do not have a civil war, they are  dictatorships. One must call a spade a spade -- and  dictatorships are dictatorships. And one must not respect those  as though they actually represent a people. I am quite  sensitive to these things because I fought dictatorship in  Portugal. And the Western world -- including England, the  United States, and France -- used to consider that the  Portuguese and Spanish dictators were acceptable because they  were anticommunist. I believe there is no excuse for such an  attitude if one wants to have a global human rights policy.    [LE FIGARO] After the Gulf war, there were aspirations to a  new world order. Today, the dream has collapsed, has it not?    [Soares] It will re-emerge, it is inevitable. Because  humankind's major problems know no border. Only a global policy  will solve problems such as environment degradation or  starvation. This is why we are necessarily headed for a global  legal order, headed by a reformed United Nations organization.  Living in a world where two-thirds of the population are  starving is an untenable proposition.    [LE FIGARO] You know Africa well. Is it a lost continent?    [Soares] No. Africa is a continent that has gone adrift,  but it is not lost. We have no overall policy with respect to  this continent.    [LE FIGARO] Which is Africa's key country?    [Soares] As far as Sub-Saharan Africa is concerned, this is  undoubtedly South Africa. If peaceful elections can be held  there, then I think settlements can be found for peripheral  conflicts -- in Angola, Mozambique, Zaire, etc.    [LE FIGARO] Do you think Mandela is the right man for the  job?    [Soares] He has learned a great deal. He is a really wise  man.    [LE FIGARO] Your trust in him is total?    [Soares] Yes I trust him. He is a moderate. He knows what  the issues are, and he wants a peaceful way out for his country.  He is prepared to make a number of vital concessions to avoid  causing a panic among the population.    [LE FIGARO] All told, you are much more optimistic than most  Western leaders....    [Soares] I am optimistic inasmuch as I think we are going to  rediscover a number of essential values. We shall finally  realize that humankind's evolution does not solely hinge on  interest rates and growth rates, but also on political and  social values. That humankind must mobilize for ideas, not only  for interests. And that notions of equality, fraternity,  democracy, and human rights are the only ones likely to free  humankind. We are still in a transitional phase. The end of  totalitarian regimes constitutes a considerable improvement.  This is important. If we feel the world has been going all  wrong lately, it is also because of the hopes for an everlasting  peace created by the collapse of communism.     "

This month's issue of Windpower Monthly, the industry journal, has on the cover a grisly picture showing a man holding a dead bird by its battered feathers. In the background are several wind turbines. The scene is Tarifa in southern Spain, where Europe's largest wind farm with 269 turbines has been accused of slicing up migratory birds. A long article inside contains the disturbing admission by Francisco Serrano, director of Spain's renewables energy agency IDAE, that there was 'a very unfortunate lapse of memory' at the planning stage. 'Nobody thought about migratory birds. Only the resident fauna was taken into consideration,' he says. The article also describes how the European Commission has warned Spain to review its wind-farm policy until a long-term bird study is completed. The edition has led to howls in some corners of the wind-power industry because it may only stoke further hostility towards wind farms. But Lyn Harrison, who edits it from Denmark, tells readers: 'There is method in our madness.' Better to air the problem in a wind energy magazine where it is more likely to get balanced treatment than in other media.

To suggest that Bitterfeld is a kind of nether world is not far from the truth.  Bitterfeld is described as the most polluted city in East Germany, which is  sometimes called the ""cesspool of Europe,"" among the most polluted of all  countries.    ""They should change the name of Bitterfeld to Agent Orange,"" a West German  journalist who was born in nearby Leipzig and once reported from Vietnam  remarked to a recent visitor.    Indeed, the name of the grim, sullen city means bitter field, though it was  christened long before the development of the coal mines and the chemical and  power plants that have given the city its reputation as the dirtiest town in  Europe.    Bitterfeld, population 20,000, is afflicted with a variety of forms of  pollution. The skies are almost always hazy from dust and coal particles rising  from enormous open-pit mines, and gases pouring out of the tall stacks that  surround the town. The water is soured with nitrates from fertilizers.    The fallout in Bitterfeld's streets runs to more than a pound of particles per  square yard per month.    ""We have serious lung disease problems,"" said City Councilman Rainer Fromman,  who is in charge of environmental matters. ""We get the coal particles from the  mines and now that the topsoil is gone, we get silicon dust as well. Sometimes  the visibility is so bad it's hard to drive.    ""We believe the life expectancy here is five years lower than in other parts of  the country. But it's difficult to tell because all the figures on disease in  this area were considered top secret until recently.""    Under the Communists, local officials were forbidden to take pollution samples  or to make public any information on the subject.    To give Bitterfeld schoolchildren a taste of fresh air, classes are moved to an  island in the Baltic Sea for a month each year.    Bitterfeld's neighbors fare little better. Just up the road is Wolfen, where  the nation's largest photochemical plant is situated. Its dozen stacks produce  stinging emissions.    Indeed, the pollution problem is nationwide. In Leipzig, authorities report  that a smog alarm should be sounded every day -- if there were such an alarm.    A recent poll in the West German magazine Spiegel indicated that East Germans'  desire for a better environment ranks second only to their desire for  democracy.    During the 40 years of Communist rule, much of the country's industrial plant  became outdated and inefficient, emitting pollutants of every kind. West German  experts say that if their standards were applied to East Germany, half the  industrial plant would have to be shut down.    Kurt Lietzman, the Environment Ministry official from Bonn who liaisons with  East Germany, put it this way: ""The whole economy has to be reconstructed. East  Germany is decades behind Western standards.""    In part, East Germany's pollution woes can be traced to the main source of  energy: brown coal, which when burned produces noxious sulfur dioxide. East  Germany has Europe's highest level of sulfur dioxide emissions, which are  widely blamed for acid rain, which in turn is killing forests.    Chemical plants discharge untreated effluents directly into rivers. One plant,  near Halle, pumps 50 pounds of mercury into the Saale River every day, 10 times  as much as the West German chemical giant BASF in Ludwigshaven puts into the  Rhine in a year.    An estimated 20% of the country's water is so polluted that it cannot be used,  according to Peter Diederich, minister of the environment. The Elbe has  acquired the dubious distinction of being Europe's most polluted river.    The two-stroke motor vehicles on East German roads burn the cheapest form of  gasoline and diesel oil, further contaminating the atmosphere.

""I think help is coming,"" he said. ""People live in Bitterfeld because of the  higher wages and available housing. But 40,000 have left in 10 years, so there  is a high turnover.

But then both parties must be prepared to  compromise.    Unfortunately, I must say that in these confusing times we  cannot count on much understanding and support from our friends  and allies in the West.    Even at this critical moment, now that the democrats need  full support, we are hearing Western threats that economic  cooperation with Russia will be limited.    Some comments show an almost manic desire for a world with  just one great power: the United States. This is not very  realistic. The United States cannot deal with all the world's  problems on its own; if it were to try, it would just weaken  itself.    Moreover, even in this difficult transitional period, Russia  remains a superpower. Not just because of its arsenal of  nuclear weapons and missiles, but also because of its natural  resources, technological skills, and strategic location.    There are reactionary forces in both the United States and  Russia, the military-industrial and bureaucratic complexes that  are afraid of losing influence, that are striving for an end to  the present cooperation. They are spreading myths: ""Since  Russia is simply condemned to eternal totalitarian governments,  always in confrontation with the outside world, it can never,  from a historical point of view, travel the same path as the  West.""    It appears that some Western politicians, in Washington and  elsewhere, see Russia as a younger rather than an equal partner.  In this view of things a ""good Russian"" is always a follower  and never a leader.    Right from the start, politicians in both Russia and the  West  who thought pragmatically based their policy on two assumptions.  First, Russia is predestined to be a great power, not a  second-rank power. Under a communist or nationalist regime it is  aggressive and a threat, while under a democratic government it  would be peaceful and prosperous.    Second, cooperative links, like those between the United  States and Russia, do not prevent forceful and even aggressive  policies to defend self-interests.    This can sometimes lead to disagreement. That is not  serious, as long as the situation remains one of compromise  rather than confrontation. It is naive to expect that great  powers like Russia and the United States must and can always  live together in harmony.    A particularly promising example of cooperation was the U.S.  readiness to involve Russian experts in determining the  principles for the export of militarily useful technology from  the West to the former Communist countries and countries which  are accused of supporting terrorism.    How should the Russian democrats answer the new chauvinistic  wind blowing in Washington? Russia cannot agree to playing a  subordinate role in the world. That would be unjust and  politically dangerous. Extreme nationalists and other  reactionaries would quickly reap a profit.    While the idea that the Americans are in charge of the world  is dangerous, there remains an urgent need for U.S. leadership  because of the special position of the United States in the G-7  and NATO.    NATO was set up to resist communism and defend the Western  democracies from the threat emanating from it. But nowadays  NATO is no longer sufficient for two reasons: It no longer has  communism as its greatest enemy and Russia is not a member.    What role could NATO play in solving the big international  conflicts? The organizational problems could be solved in part  by the Partnership for Peace proposed by the United States,  which various countries in Eastern and Central Europe have in  the meantime joined and which is also acceptable to Russia.    But even this should not be seen as true cooperation, as has  been painfully demonstrated in the Bosnian crisis. The NATO  ultimatum on Sarajevo was made while Russia was not involved in  any way. It is unacceptable to exclude Russia from attempts to  solve the situation in Bosnia, where Russia has present and  future interests.    We must urgently make a start on a strategy for achieving a  mature and realistic relationship -- dare we call it realpolitik?     "
0,FT944-16746 ,"FT944-16746 _AN-EJLD6AC1FT 941012   FT  12 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Recyclable film with a lens      By EMIKO TERAZONO   Akira Fukano, a researcher at Fuji Photo Film, is displeased when people talk of the company's 'disposable' cameras. This is a misnomer, he says, since almost all of the camera is reused or recycled. The company insists the device be called a 'film with a lens', although when it was first marketed in 1986 the idea was to throw away the lens and shutter apparatus once the film was used. But in 1990, Fuji launched its recycling centre and today more than 70 per cent of the parts, including the lens, flash and shutter are tested and reused. Other components, such as the outer cardboard box and batteries, are sent to outside recycling companies. Fuji, which has been followed down the recycling path by other photo film companies, including Konica, Kodak, and Agfa, has about 80 per cent of the domestic disposable camera market. It invested Y1bn (Pounds 6.27m) in its first automated line in 1992 and another Y1bn in its fully automated system the following year. Earlier this year, it won an award from the ministry of international trade and industry for its environment-friendly system. Mr Fukano says the key to the high reusage ratio is product development. 'Recycling parts is fine, but it's better for the environment to reuse the component as it is,' he says. This has meant using quality parts, which can be used over and over again, and meticulous quality testing systems which pick out used components that are damaged. To enable easy dismantling by machines, the components, screwed together in the original version, are shaped to allow them to be simply fitted together. To limit the amounts of materials used in a product, miniaturisation has also been important. The company has reduced the camera weight by 20 per cent to 40g. But there are costs for recycling. Fukano admits that a recycled product is more expensive than a completely new one because of the initial development costs and the running costs for collection and storage of used cameras. Fuji, and the other photo film companies, are also facing competition from the large supermarkets selling their own-brand disposable cameras. A further problem is that the recycling process relies on the film processing labs to return used parts to the manufacturers. While this helps to create a link between consumer and processing lab, some labs, including those belonging to the large supermarkets, have used the parts from Fuji cameras, as well as their own, to produce new branded disposable cameras. After Fuji protests the retailers have agreed to stop, but some independent labs are still using used parts. For example, Nihon Jumbo, a fast growing film processing chain, reuses parts from leading manufacturers' products. The company says it has a right to recycle parts from used cameras and is not obliged to return them to the maker since the consumer has 'thrown them away'. Fuji says, however, that sales of recycled products by processing laboratories pose little threat to its market position.   Companies:-  Fuji Photo Film.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

In January this year, the FDA said Glaxo 'frequently suggests unapproved uses for Zantac and consistently makes comparative efficacy and safety claims that are not supported by adequate data'. Glaxo stopped publishing the contested claims in advertising and promotional literature earlier this month, but objected to the FDA's claims and said it was unlikely to write to US doctors as the FDA had demanded. The company said it has agreed with the FDA on a letter to be sent to US doctors, correcting its standard literature. Discussions continue on how Glaxo's retractions should be published. Zantac is the world's best-selling medicine with annual sales of about Pounds 2bn, representing 45 per cent of Glaxo's turnover. Annual US sales are estimated by analysts at Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 980m). The company stressed yesterday its right to distribute the drug in the US had never been questioned. An analyst said: 'This makes it harder for Glaxo to differentiate Zantac from Tagamet. When there is a cheaper generic version of Tagamet on the market in the US next year it may be harder for Zantac to maintain market share.'   Companies:-  Glaxo Holdings.

Minister of the Presidency Oscar Santamaria told the press  that ""this government is committed to concluding all agreements  by the end of its term."" He added that ""naturally, some of these  agreements will continue to be implemented beyond that time  because these are scheduled for beyond the period of  transition."" He noted that there is not an impasse, but a  dynamic that is appropriate to the peace process, in which there  are some time difficulties, but which are normal within the  complexity of the process.""    The government and the former Salvadoran guerrillas signed  more than 100 peace agreements on 16 January 1992 in Mexico,  ending a civil war which had lasted more than 12 years and in  which over 75,000 persons were killed, according to humanitarian  organizations. Santamaria added that ""we have not reached any  crisis because we are heading in the right direction  fortunately,"" although he admitted that ""sometimes we are not on  schedule, but despite problems, we are advancing.""    Last week before UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali,  the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], the former  guerrilla organization now turned political party, claimed there  were several delays in implementing some peace agreements, which  are the responsibility of the government, such as rejoining  civilian life and transfer of land to the former fighters. In  addition, the FMLN thinks the complete development of the new  National Civilian Police (PNC) and the definite dismantling of  the current National Police (PN), which has a military  structure, is another delay in the peace agreements.    For his part, Ghali told the FMLN in New York that he sent  President Alfredo Cristiani a letter asking him to accelerate  the implementation of the issues pending from the peace  agreement. Santamaria insisted that ""we are doing this with our  best political will, and we are not going to back out in any way  from our commitment."" He also accused the FMLN of not  surrendering all of its weapons yet. Santamaria said the Ghali's  letter is ""welcome,"" and he affirmed that ""the government does  not see anything negative in it. On the contrary, it reminds us  that we have agreements pending so that we will not lose the  impetus we are giving the entire implementation.""    Santamaria said FMLN representatives went to the United  Nations not because of an alleged crisis in the agreements, but  because they wanted to talk with Ghali about the future of the  peace process following the change of government after the 20  March general elections. The official added that the government  has met with the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal) to  coordinate the implementation of the peace agreements, mainly  those related to the former guerrillas rejoining civilian life  and the deployment of the PNC.    Santamaria made these statements after presiding at the  graduation ceremony of a new group of PNC officers who will be  sent to enforce security in various parts of the country where  there are delegations of the new police corps created by the  peace agreements.

They announced yesterday that Ameritech would invest Dollars 472m in the newly formed company, while GE would contribute the assets of its General Electric Information Services division, which specialises in electronic data exchange and electronic commerce. The move came just 24 hours after Ameritech, in conjunction with its German partner Deutsche Telekom, was selected to take a stake in Matav, the Hungarian state telecoms concern, as part of eastern Europe's largest single privatisation deal. Ameritech's stake will cost it Dollars 437.5m. GE's information services division, which has revenues of Dollars 600m and is based in Rockville, Maryland, was founded in the 1960s as a computer time-sharing business and evolved into an electric commerce company in the 1980s when the personal computer revolution reduced demand for time-sharing. The business helps companies exchange documents electronically with suppliers and customers, increasing efficiency and eliminating paperwork. It advises on internal company communications. The new company initially will be wholly owned and operated by GE. Ameritech's investment will be a four-year convertible note which will convert into a 30 per cent equity stake when certain legal restrictions are removed.   Companies:-  Ameritech Corp.

The most distinguished proof  is Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to the Saudi  capital and the reception accorded to him at the highest level.  But it seems that Kuwait -- through its officials -- continues  to insist on swimming against the tide and working to obstruct  any Arab rapprochement directly or indirectly in order to  perpetuate the disputes and splits if possible.    Two days ago the Interior Ministry revealed that it had  found  weapons and skulls inside the Palestinian embassy in Kuwait  after fabricating illogical reasons for storming it, violating  all known diplomatic conventions.    We do not know how the Palestinian embassy has turned into  an  arsenal of weapons and a warehouse of skulls. Even if these  skulls do really exist, what is strange about it, given that  almost every house in Kuwait is armed to the teeth with machine  guns, rockets, and heavy artillery, as announced by the Interior  Ministry itself during its combing campaigns designed to seize  arms after its continued appeal to urge citizens to hand them  over failed.    The presence of a firearm in an Arab embassy is not a  strange  or odd thing. It is a rule pursued in most countries, and no  diplomatic bag lacks arms. The Kuwaiti Government knows there  is a personal weapon with the ambassador of the state of  Palestine in Kuwait and elsewhere. It also knows that other  embassies have weapons, whether before or after the invasion.    The question is about the use and purpose of these weapons,  not about their presence. If these weapons had really been used  against Kuwait's security and stability, thousands of  Palestinians would not have been expelled in a humiliating way  from Kuwait. Nor would Palestinian women have been raped by  Kuwaitis in broad daylight and in front of their families.    One of the main criticisms aimed against the PLO and its  leaders in a recent Palestine National Council session was its  failure to distribute arms to the Palestinians living in Kuwait  to enable them to defend themselves against the storming  operations conducted by government militias. Its reply was that  if it had done so, Kuwait would have turned into a blood bath --  which it does not want to happen to anyone, neither to Kuwait  nor to the Palestinians.    It is regrettable for Kuwaiti Government officials to speak  about the existence of skulls in Palestine's embassy and  announce this serious discovery on the day the Palestinian  president's visit to Riyadh was due to take place. We do not  know how these skulls reached the embassy building. If these  skulls really exist, they are definitely the skulls of innocent  Palestinians who sought refuge in their country's embassy but  were later killed by the bullets of the Kuwaitis who had pursued  them at the height of their spite against anything Palestinian  -- the spite which dominated Kuwait after the Iraqi forces were  moved out of it.    What is clear is that the Palestinians did not kill a single  Kuwaiti. Actually they were often the victims. Amnesty  International reports and television pictures taken by Western  reporters are full of images of mass graves for the victims  killed by Kuwaiti government militias.    Some Kuwaiti officials are mistaken if they think that by  these lies they can obstruct Arab reconciliation. They know  that this reconciliation is not in their interests. They cannot  obstruct history's movement, nor can they freeze it at a certain  point. Second, such an approach -- if it continues -- will lead  to further isolation for Kuwait at the Arab level, and perhaps  at the Gulf level as well. Proof of this is that some Kuwaiti  writers have urged that reconciliation should be achieved with  some of the states which supported Iraq, naming Yemen and  Tunisia, for example.    Kuwait needs a voice of reason to ease the tension with the  brothers and lead to new pages, which do not all have to be  positive; it is sufficient for them not to be negative. This is  because the continuation of hostility is not in the interests of  Kuwait or its people, whether this hostility is toward the  Palestinians or anyone else.     "
0,FT931-13284 ,"FT931-13284 _AN-DAYB1AASFT 930125   FT  25 JAN 93 / Single Market Watch: Brussels battle over telecoms at crucial phase      By DANIEL GREEN and ANDREW HILL      LONDON, BRUSSELS   THE advent of the single market on January 1 marked a small step in the liberalisation of Europe's telecommunications industry. Some of the business of carrying computer data was opened to competition. The industry and its customers barely gave the change a second thought. Their executives were busy lobbying Brussels over plans for far more dramatic deregulation: the opening up of the business of carrying ordinary telephone calls, a market worth Ecu90bn (Pounds 73bn) in 1990 and valued now at an annual Ecu110bn. At stake is control of a fast growing industry. Turnover in European telephone calls is rising by more than 8 per cent a year, according to Daiwa Institute of Research in London. This industry is dominated by a handful of state-owned monopolies. They earn almost 90 per cent of telephone revenues in the EC. The European Commission wants this to change. It has called for representations from suppliers, customers and governments on how far liberalisation should go. These submissions should be filed by the end of this month. The Commission has asked for views on four alternative proposals. One would be to freeze the process of liberalisation, reversing present policy. The second approach would call for Brussels to bring in centralised rules to cut the cost of calls - a policy which would contradict the EC's new emphasis on subsidiarity, or making decisions at the lowest level of government. The other alternatives - which seem in practice more likely - would be to decide on either a partial deregulation or sweeping changes of the kind introduced in the UK. The Commission has said it wants to see at least some further deregulation. But many member states are opposed to this. Views spread from the strongly free-market British Telecom and Mercury Communications, the UK post and telecommunications organisations (PTOs), to the pro-state monopoly governments in southern Europe. Executives in London and officials in Brussels now suggest that the anti-liberalisation governments are bending to the will of the free-marketeers. This would be no mean victory. Voice telecommunications represent the core of an industry still seen in many countries as an arm of government. The debate is heavily influenced by ideology and emotion. Publication of the Commission's plans was twice delayed last summer, partly because of concern about its impact on France's Maastricht referendum in September. The conservatives have already lost ground. The Commission has pushed through reforms in the non-core activities of the PTOs. Legislation opening up the equipment market, for example, was approved in 1988. Countries that a decade ago were once staunch opponents of liberalisation have allowed a measure of competition since the late 1980s. The UK remains the only EC country with two PTOs, but Germany and France have introduced competition into mobile telephony and in satellite links. Last week, a subsidiary of the US company MCI Communications received French government approval to run an independent satellite telecommunications network in France. 'In a matter of a very few years, attitudes have changed,' says Mr Jonathan Rickford, BT's director of government relations. The UK, which deregulated in the early 1980s, 'used to be regarded as a piece of Anglo-Saxon eccentricity. Now it is seen that that is the way the world is going.' None the less, recent political moves suggest that obstacles to deregulation may increase. In the EC commission, responsibility for telecommunications has passed to Mr Martin Bangemann, who adds it to his industry portfolio. Mr Karel van Miert, a Belgian socialist, has taken over competition policy from the free-marketeer Sir Leon Brittan. Both Mr Bangemann and Mr Van Miert believe competition should not be the overriding factor in policy decisions - a sentiment in line with the attitude of some state telephone monopolies. EC commissioners intend to approve a draft proposal on deregulation by early March. This would be presented to telecommunications ministers on May 10. Commission officials concede it will take a year or more of detailed negotiations before legislation is approved. But, depending on the outcome of negotiations during the next few weeks, Europe's will to make real progress in deregulation will be tested very soon.

I am going to speak sincerely  and directly, face to face with you, about the changes I will  make if you elect me as your president on 29 May. I am going to  tell you about my plans to make Colombia a nation of  opportunities where we can be sure of getting a good education,  being able to walk the streets safely, and finding a decent job.  [passage omitted]    Previous governments have believed mistakenly that  guerrillas  and narcotraffickers are the only ones who deserve attention  from the state, thus neglecting daily security. That is why I  have proposed the creation of a specialized group, so that just  as groups that counter guerrillas, kidnappings, and  narcotrafficking, it can dedicate itself to dismantling and  breaking up, once and for all, the mafia of common criminals who  disrupt in the country's main cities and the tranquillity of  citizens.    It is critical that we support the prosecutor general's work  to definitively eliminate impunity. Nothing is more infuriating  or frustrating than to see crimes go unpunished and criminals  mocking their victims because they know they will not be  punished. Even worse is the scenario where a victim, the  citizen, is mistreated by a bureaucratized, inoperative, and  inefficient justice system. For example, a citizen files  charges and fails to recover stolen goods but must fear  retribution from the thief he identified. We must guarantee  citizens that they will receive prompt and full justice through  fair punishment of the criminal.    Our personal safety is now jeopardized by the Constitutional  Court's ruling on the legality of specific drug quantities for  personal use. This is unacceptable and inconceivable. We  cannot allow them to bury our dream of a better Colombia. As a  parent, I cannot accept this and you can't either, because we  want healthy children and young people. I do not want those who  represent our future to fall under the effects of narcotics. I  will not allow them to murder our future. I do not want to see  the criminal selling drugs or killing our efforts to restore  values, family, education, and everyday safety. No to drugs! I  have always said this and will always say it: I will not budge!    I am not one of those who today says no to the court's  decision but who yesterday was one of the ones who proposed  legalization. Or maybe they believe that the marijuana of 15  years ago was less harmful than the kind consumed in the streets  today? What nonsense! No to drugs! Following the legalization  of the personal dosage comes the legalization of drug  trafficking. Make no mistake about that. In this struggle  against the killers of our future, we have paid a high price in  lives, kidnappings, and grief. That cost will not be fruitless.  No parent who really loves his children, no teacher who values  his students, no Colombian who thinks about Colombia can agree  with those who favor legalization. I will not permit it.

Arms conversion means the conversion of  military facilities for civilian purposes -- a multifaceted  issue: It includes the scrapping of weapons, the ""retraining""  of professional soldiers, the new orientation of the armament  industry, as well as the use of the money saved from the defense  budget.    The BICC, which was founded on the initiative of the North  Rhine- Westphalian Land Government, wants to draw up concepts on  these issues: ""The work is practically waiting to be tackled,""  said Mr. Wulf, the designated head of the center, when he  presented his future work in Duesseldorf. ""We understand  ourselves as a service station for practical peace work.""    Arms expert Wulf, who has until now headed the Development  and Peace Institute at Duisburg University and is an adviser to  the UN Disarmament Department, begins his work with 10  employees. Later on, the staff is to be increased to 30. North  Rhine-Westphalia takes over the start-up financing -- 11.7  million German marks [DM] over the next five years. Day-to-day  operations are to be financed by the World Bank, the EU, or  foundations.    The costs of disarmament are becoming a problem for many  countries, Wulf warns. His example is Russia: There 4.5  million people are employed in the arms industry. If these  people cannot find any new work, this could lead to a ""social  disaster."" In Germany about 280,000 jobs are dependent on arms  production; in addition, there are soldiers and civilian  employees in barracks.    ""Of course, we can make only a moderate contribution to  solving the problems,"" Wulf knows. For this purpose, the BICC  wants, among other things, to advise arms companies and  establish a database, where experiences and concepts are stored  and passed on. So far, there are many individual projects all  over the world, but they are not linked with one another.  Specifically: One country is looking for solutions that may  already have been found elsewhere.    While the new orientation of the employees in the arms  industry and the military gives rise to many problems in view of  the worldwide job crisis, arms conversion meanwhile is making  the most progress in using outdated military facilities and in  scrapping weapons. In the FRG, for instance, universities are  taking over vacant barracks and using them as lecture halls or  want to establish students' hostels there. And the dismantling  of a tank, for instance, costs only DM3,000 now, Wulf says.  Three years ago it cost DM30,000.     "

HELTON, Arthur C. Helton, a lawyer, is director of the political  asylum project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, based in New York  City.      Asylum is being abused. So say U.S. immigration officials commenting on a  recent upsurge of Central Americans crossing the South Texas border.    Yes, asylum is being abused -- not by the individual applicants, but by the  federal immigration authorities who have neglected and misapplied the asylum  provisions of the Refugee Act of 1980.    The whole process of asylum, from defining its purpose to administering its  paperwork, has become so twisted and defective that basic reforms are needed.  Chief among them is removing the administration of asylum from the Immigration  and Naturalization Service.    By law, political asylum is granted to people who face threats to life or  freedom in their home countries. These days, the INS presumes most asylum  applicants to be economic migrants who are trying to gain a foothold in the  United States. The INS says that a sharp rise in filings -- more than 86,000  cases were pending as of last December -- is attributable to aliens using  asylum to avoid deportation and to obtain permission to work under new  immigration controls. The largest groups represented in the filings are  Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, Cubans, Guatemalans and Poles.    To counter the increase in asylum filings, the INS is adding new deterrent  measures to an existing arsenal of policies, including detention and stepped-up  interceptions at sea. The agency has restricted the travel of asylum applicants  in South Texas and assigned temporary staff to accelerate decisions in Los  Angeles and Miami, and itis planning to require that refugees show at the  outset that they will be granted asylum in order to be permitted to work.    Additionally, the INS now opposes the issuance of rules that would establish a  corps of specially trained asylum officers to decide cases. It also proposes to  abolish a unit in the Justice Department that was created to monitor asylum  policy and procedures after an incident in 1985 in which a Soviet seaman was  forcibly returned to his ship by the Border Patrol.    The INS misconstrues the problem, and the solutions that it proposes are  retrogressive and inhumane.    Central Americans flee to the United States for a mix of reasons, including  political persecution or economic devastation (which itself can be a  consequence of political repression). Certainly, those who have a ""well-founded  fear of persecution"" in their homeland deserve refugee protection.    As Justice Harry A. Blackmun explained in a 1987 Supreme Court decision, the  implementation of the Refugee Act requires the INS to end its ""years of  seemingly purposeful blindness"" to appropriate legal standards.    Only about 30 INS examiners are currently involved in deciding asylum cases  around the country. These are low-level functionaries who receive little or no  instruction on asylum; training materials have not been updated since 1983.  Many worthy refugees are denied protection because of agency ineptitude.    Rather than deprive refugees of the opportunity to subsist, rather than seek to  deter them by imposing restrictive or punitive measures, our government should  invest sufficient resources in the asylum procedure to ensure that claims are  fairly and expeditiously determined. The proposed asylum officer corps should  be established immediately. Asylum adjudicators should be qualified  professionals who are capable of evaluating the merits of cases on humanitarian  grounds, without regard to the foreign-policy preferences of the State  Department, which frequently dictate the outcome of cases under current  procedure. These adjudicators should be trained in refugee law and  international relations, and they should be deployed in sufficient numbers to  decide cases within a reasonable period of time. Also, the standards that they  follow should be published to promote consistent decision-making.    Even more fundamentally, asylum adjudication should be handled by an agency  other than INS, perhaps a separate office in the Justice Department. The  law-enforcement mentality of the INS is simply incompatible with the  humanitarian act of providing asylum.    The current asylum ""crisis"" is not caused by an increase in the numbers of  Central Americans coming to the United States. Rather, it results from the  continuing failure of INS to achieve the humanitarian standards necessary to  deciding asylum cases. To protect the people who have fled to this country  seeking a haven from injustice, a new asylum system is crucial.

There are the sloping terra-cotta roofs, the palm trees, the well-used park  benches and ugly modern monuments. Shoeshine men work on the black-and-white  tiled sidewalks and pedestrians dart through honking, fume-spewing traffic. The  people look sturdy, and not particularly fashion-minded.    This scene underscores how far Portugal, perched on the southwestern fringe of  Europe, has to go to achieve its goal of catching up with its neighbors. Now an  overheating economy is further imperiling that ambition.    A surging inflation rate and trade deficit could hamper the small country's  ability to expand and modernize in readiness for 1992. That's when the  12-nation European Community, which Portugal joined in 1986, becomes one  barrier-free marketplace of 320 million consumers.    In the late 1980s, Portugal is belatedly turning its attention eastward to the  rest of Europe after hundreds of years of looking across the Atlantic and into  Africa and India.    The 10.3 million Portuguese, descended of Celtic, Roman and Moorish conquerors,  perhaps have come to terms with the loss of the globe-circling empire that  their famous explorers discovered five centuries ago.    Portugal's colonial legacy is still evident in the relaxed mingling of black,  brown and white faces in Lisbon's cafes, in the curry in Portuguese food, in  the easy command of English in this Portuguese-speaking country.    After painful recession, austerity and more than 25% inflation in 1983 and  1984, Portugal is one of Europe's most dynamic economies. Gross domestic  product has grown 4.5% a year on average for three years, and is projected to  continue at 3.5%. Unemployment has been halved to nearly 6%.    A conscientious debt-repayer, Portugal has cut its foreign debt to $16 billion,  down from 80.4% of GDP in 1985 to 40.7%.    But signs of economic overheating appeared last year, forcing unpopular  measures. Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's center-right Social Democrats,  who won an unprecedented majority in Parliament in the June, 1987, general  election, have lost support in recent months.    A poll recently published in O Jornal showed the Social Democrats down to 41%  nearly halfway through their four-year term from just under 50% in the  election. The clean-cut, 49-year-old prime minister has developed a reputation  for being abrasive and overly self-confident.    The opposition Socialists, meanwhile, have gained to 36% from 22.3%, and  Socialist President Mario Soares, a legendary, consummate politician, has  become increasingly popular.    Nonetheless, Cavaco Silva is still expected to be the first Portuguese leader  to survive a full four-year term since the 1974 Revolution of the Carnations,  which ended 48 years of authoritarian rule, mostly under rightist dictator  Antonio Salazar.    ""We are making our way firmly forward toward a more efficient and competitive  economy, a more creative and enterprising society, a freer, more modern  country, without being perturbed by those who would like Portugal to turn back  to the past,"" the prime minister said in a recent speech.    The most prominent opponents of modernization are farm workers, who are  resisting the planting of eucalyptus trees for paper pulp processing, fearing  these will replace traditional olive trees and threaten farm jobs.    The eucalyptus war reached a climax in late March, when local people trying to  dig up newly planted trees in Valpacos clashed with national guardsmen.    In Lisbon, there are plenty of complaints, too.    Jaime de Lacerda, director of the Confederation of Portuguese Industry, said,  ""Now people tend to criticize the government a lot and the mood is a very  critical one.""    Said economist Jose Cavalheira Antunes of Banco Espirito Santo, ""I think we  have a certain situation of crisis.""    You hear it on the streets.    Isaac da Silva, a 52-year-old taxi driver, said, ""Many people are unhappy  because life isn't easy. We have to work very hard. The cost of living is very  hard.""    But not everybody is negative.    Licelia Godinho, a 35-year-old car rental worker, said, ""There are more jobs.  There is less poverty in particular than in the other days.""    Inflation has jumped to an annual rate of 12.3%, more than twice the  government's 6% target for this year, while the trade balance went into the red  last year, giving it a $5.9-billion gap.    Strong consumption and investment are to blame. Recent political stability has  unleashed long pent-up demand.    To cool the economy, the government in April instituted 11 financial measures  that raised interest rates -- now at nearly 15% -- reduced banks' liquidity and  restricted the availability of credit, particularly in the booming car-sales  market.    Although some measures were widely regarded as necessary, they were attacked as  late and misdirected. They have underscored the government's tendency to  intervene while simultaneously championing free-market policies.    ""Again, it is the private sector that is suffering,"" said Luis Campos e Cunha,  an economics professor at Lisbon's New University. ""They should be thinking of  squeezing public expenditure.""    Foreign investors complain of having to cope with the frequent policy changes  and voluminous red tape. Taxes are complex and labor laws restrictive. There  are periodic public sector strikes.      Foreign Investors    Nonetheless, foreign investors, seeking a foothold in the Common Market ahead  of 1992 and attracted by Portugal's low wages, invested $496 million in the  year ended October, up significantly from $166 million in 1986.    Said Nicholas Racich, administrator of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.'s  Portuguese operations, ""You have to keep plugging away.""    But the millions of dollars of EC financial aid that have flowed into Portugal  have proved a mixed blessing. Although it has enabled much-needed improvements  to transport and communications to begin, EC demands for Portuguese matching  funds have worsened the budget deficit.    The government is implementing far-reaching economic reforms, including  restructuring the capital markets.    The third-tier Lisbon and Oporto stock exchanges, not yet fully recovered from  the stock market crash, are being modernized and combined into a national  bourse. In late April, the government launched an ambitious privatization  program with the sale of a 49% stake in Unicer, the state-owned brewer.    ""We want to create the confidence, confidence on various levels, not just in  the market but also in the financial institutions,"" said Rui Ambrosio Tribolet,  the Lisbon Stock Exchange's general secretary.    But another problem is that Portugal's progress is expected to widen social  divisions.      'Everyone for Himself'    Said Cavalheira Antunes: ""The idea of social solidarity is regressing and the  idea of everyone for himself is coming out on top.""    Portugal lags behind its neighbors on many counts.    At about $3,700, its per capita GDP is Europe's lowest. It has the worst  literacy rate and one of the highest infant mortality rates.    Portugal imports 80% of its energy and, surprisingly, half its food, even  though one-fifth of the population works in agriculture.    The country is extremely dependent on tourism. Each year, Portugal's population  more than doubles as tourists flock in, mostly to the southern Algarve coast.    Other big industries tend to be traditional: textiles, footwear, cork, forestry  products, fishing, wine and ceramics. Shipbuilding and repair, and construction  also are important.    The experts say 1992 poses two possible scenarios.    If it's lucky and smart, Portugal could become Europe's California by  concentrating on exotic produce, high technology, light manufacturing and  tourism.    If it is not, foreigners might buy up Portugal's choice assets, leaving it  flooded with imports and producing the low-tech, low-profit goods.    The Portuguese, who are mostly Catholic, conservative and family minded, have a  reputation for being resilient in adversity and flexible in the face of change.    In particular, Portugal prides itself on successfully absorbing about 700,000  Portuguese retornados and African immigrants who fled to the country in the  mid-1970s after Portugal gave up its African colonies of Angola, Mozambique and  Guinea-Bissau.    Optimistic about the outlook is the industry confederation's Lacerda, who said:  ""I think we are not going to miss the opportunity of 1992.""

Only 18 percent of Europe's 255 million citizens would vote  in a referendum to quit the Union, the poll shows. Yet 49  percent of voters oppose ""a United States of Europe with a  federal government."" Just 32 percent are in favour, and there  are substantial majorities against federalism in eight of the 12  EU member countries.    The result of the far-reaching poll, conducted by MORI  [Market and Opinion Research International], will come as a  significant boost to the clutch of parties fighting next month's  European Parliament elections on an anti-Maastricht ticket.    Until recently, the vision of a federal Europe has been an  article of faith among main-stream politicians across much of  the continent. Now, eight months after ratification of the  Maastricht Treaty, the findings suggest that the public is in a  more questioning frame of mind.    According to the poll, across the 12 EU states 70 percent of  people would vote to maintain membership of the Union. Even in  Britain, the home of Euro-scepticism, only just over one-third  of voters would back withdrawal.    But, according to MORI, the appeal of full-blooded  federalism  is now confined to Greece, Italy and Belgium -- the latter  itself a federal country, where backing is highest at 58 percent.    In Spain, traditionally viewed as one of the most ardently  European nations, opinion is almost evenly split.    In France and Germany, in spite of their leaders' unswerving  commitment to the Maastricht blueprint for EU integration, the  electorates are also firmly resistant.    In Germany, supporters of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's avowd aim  to build a United States of Europe are outnumbered almost three  to one.    Predictably, some of the most ferocious opposition comes  from  sovereignty-conscious Denmark and Britain. In both countries  around 70 percent of voters are hostile to federalism. But more  significant as a trend may be the high level of opposition in  the Netherlands, one of the founder-members of the then EEC,  which has traditionally looked to Brussels to fight the corner  of small countries. According to the survey, only 21 percent of  the Dutch support a United States of Europe, compared with 73  percent against.    With the Germans about to begin a bold new federal  initiative  when they assume the EU presidency at the beginning of July, the  findings are bound to be used as ammunition in the increasingly  bitter battle over Europe's institutional future. Rows are  already erupting over the agenda for the Inter-governmental  Conference (IGC) in 1996, which is expected to quicken the pace  of federalism.    Although anti-federalist politicians are still in a  minority,  the poll shows that their views have the support of a  surprisingly large proportion of the population. It will be a  further warning to political elites of the dangers of a  high-handed approach to European issues.    Federalists will already be uneasily aware that the  political  landscape of Europe is changing. Antonio Martino, the new  Italian foreign minister in the Berlusconi government, and a  founder-member of the anti-federalist Bruges Group, is expected  to take a cooler approach to European integration than his  predecessors did. In a crucial policy shift, he is set to  assert Italian national interests at the expense of ceding  further powers to Brussels.    The political partnership between Chancellor Kohl and  Spain's  prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, could be abruptly terminated.  Gonzalez is under increasing pressure to resign as a result of  growing corruption scandals in Spain. The right-wing opposition  leader, Jose Maria Aznar, who may well succeed him, is less  fervent and idealistic about Europe.    For this ambitious Europe-wide survey, MORI and associate  pollsters in the 12 EU nations interviewed 7,300 adults over 18  years old, undertaking the fieldwork between 10 and 30 April.    In terms of the future political make-up of the European  Parliament, the poll puts the Socialists and the Centre-Right  European People's Party level-pegging on 34 percent. The  European People's Party is an umbrella grouping of Christian  Democrats, the British Conservatives, the French UDF and  Gauliists, and possibly the new right-wing Italian groupings.    This neck-and-neck voting result would make the Socialists  the biggest single party, owing to the character of European  electoral systems. The Left would emerge with roughly 40 seats  more than the European People's Party, yet would lack an overall  majority. The final political line-up will ultimately hinge on  how right-wing parties align themselves after the June election.     "

That appears the conclusion to draw from the latest survey* of European consumer lifestyles by Euromonitor, the London-based market analyst. In its survey of 23 countries on a range of factors from employment patterns to birth rates since its last poll in 1989, Euromonitor reported increasing homeownership - now accounting for 55 per cent of households in Europe - and particularly strong growth in single-person households. In western Germany and Scandinavia, for example, single people occupy a third of all homes. Birth rate trends mean the youth market in western Europe will fade during the 1990s and the early years of the next century, while the population aged between 30 and 45 will represent the largest sector of consumers. An increasingly health-conscious population, says the report, has resulted in an overall rise of two years in European life expectancy since the mid-1980s, and of 10 years since 1970. The community, social and personal services sector represents by far the largest employment of Europe's citizens. On average, 26 per cent of the workforce in western Europe is employed in social and personal services. This figure represents a move from the traditional large employers in the manufacturing sector, which now employs about 21 per cent of the workforce. However, 23.5 per cent of employees in Greece still work in agriculture, while in the UK 57.5 per cent are employed by wholesalers, retailers, restaurants or hotels. While European unemployment rates have been rising by a rate of at least 2 to 3 per cent since 1988, jobless levels have been rising at much higher rates in some countries. In Sweden, unemployment rose from 1.4 per cent to 5.3 per cent between 1989 and 1992, and jumped in Switzerland from 0.6 per cent in 1990 to 3 per cent in 1992. In Finland, joblessness rose from 3.5 per cent to 13.1 per cent from 1988 to 1992. However, some consumer goods appear to be essential, job or no job. In every country surveyed, televisions are owned by 95 per cent of households. Consumption trends have been affected by stagnancy in west European spending power, while levels in eastern Europe have plummeted as state subsidies have been withdrawn. Although real incomes are beginning to rise, the survey gave a 'poor prognosis' for large spending on consumer items. The survey noted, however, that general wealth was increasing in western Europe, where average per capita production in 1992 was Dollars 21,000, (Pounds 13,550) with two-thirds of that figure devoted to personal disposable income. In southern Europe, per capita gross domestic product ranges from Dollars 7,800 in Greece to Dollars 21,500 in Italy. In eastern Europe it dropped as low as Dollars 600 in Russia and Dollars 3,400 in Hungary, the highest in the region. Spending habits in certain sectors varied widely between markets. Food, for example, accounts for twice as much of the household budget in Greece or Portugal - 27 to 32 per cent - as in Germany or the UK. In eastern Europe, consumers spend 30 to 40 per cent of their budgets on food, although in Hungary the proportion is 17 per cent. As a proportion of total consumption, spending on housing is rising - at the time of the previous survey the rate was falling. The report warns that the current mood in Europe is towards national perspectives in consumption as much as anything else. *European Consumer Lifestyles, available from Euromonitor, 87-88 Turnmill Street, London EC1M 5QU, 071 251 8024.

The new company, ABB Flexible Automation, will account for about 10 per cent of ABB's industrial systems and products segment. It represents another step by Zurich-based ABB to simplify its structure, save on administrative costs and boost its market presence. The former ABB Robotics claimed to be the world's largest supplier of robots and the paint finishing business was a leading supplier in the automotive paint systems market, worth about Dollars 2.5bn a year. Both have been expanding through organic growth and acquisitions of companies such as Trallfa and Ransburg. Mr Stelio Demark, president of the new company, said yesterday that, by merging the two businesses and exploiting their synergies, 'we are in a good position to improve the overall profitability of our businesses'. The merger will not lead to any job cuts, said Mr Roland Nordstrom, chief executive of the UK arm of ABB Flexible Automation. But savings could be made by merging administrative and other functions, and co-operating in research and development, he said.

But Navy officials predicted that the problem will be fixed in time for the  $35-billion program to meet its scheduled initial deployment next March.    A Trident 2 test missile self-destructed Tuesday after its underwater launch  from the submarine Tennessee. It was the second failure in three tests of the  rocket, which is intended to be the mainstay of the sea-based portion of  America's nuclear arsenal for the next 40 years.    Lt. Greg Smith, a Navy spokesman, said the missile apparently cannot withstand  the intense water pressure of the launch. Both failures occurred as the  missile's engines ignited just after it broke the surface of the ocean, he  said.      Missile to Be Redesigned    Smith said that the weapon will be redesigned to overcome the flaw and that the  Navy fully expects the missile to meet its original performance specifications.    ""We still believe in the program,"" Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said.  ""There's no reason to change our view of its importance, or that it ultimately  will be successful, and hopefully on schedule.""    However, retired Rear Adm. Eugene J. Carroll Jr., deputy director of the  private Center for Defense Information, said the Navy ""may have to make changes  that might be a compromise in terms of performance, (but) given enough money  and enough time, this missile will be made to work.""    Nevertheless, Carroll, a frequent critic of the Pentagon, said the Trident 2 is  the sixth submarine-launched missile to be developed over the last 30 years and  that it is shocking that problems remain in the underwater phase.    ""The problem seems to reflect some failure to consider the information that  they must have compiled in the launching of the earlier systems,"" Carroll said.  ""What we are seeing is a slippage in a system and increased cost for something  that is already a $35-billion program.""      Some Problems Corrected    Smith said design problems are not unusual in new weapons systems. The purpose  of testing is to identify the flaws so they can be corrected.    He said some problems detected in the first undersea firing in March already  have been corrected. The missile was launched successfully Aug. 2 but failed in  its third test Tuesday.    Like all submarine missiles, the Trident 2 is propelled to the surface through  30 to 40 feet of water by compressed gas. Shortly after it pops out of the  water, its engines ignite to propel it to its target.    When any submarine missile breaks the surface, it creates a plume of water that  follows it into the air. Smith said the Trident 2, almost twice as heavy as  previous submarine-launched rockets, produced more water pressure and a larger  plume than had been anticipated.    ""There were no surprises about what happened in terms of the water plume and  water pressure,"" Smith said. ""These were just underestimated somewhat. The  missile could not withstand the pressure.""    The Navy said the Trident 2, in its initial test in March, cartwheeled in the  air and blew up because launch pressure had jammed a steering nozzle in the  wrong position.      Electrical Cables Snapped    It said a nozzle also appeared to be in the wrong position in the failure  Tuesday. Beyond that, it said, electrical cables snapped and triggered the  self-destruct procedure.    Earlier tests of the missile, conducted on land under controlled conditions,  had been successful nearly every time.    The Trident 2 will carry eight nuclear warheads. Its specifications call for  sufficient power and accuracy to destroy a Soviet missile in a hardened  underground silo 80% of the time.

Brussels officials yesterday said they were very close to announcing a decision. Some 30 companies are thought to be involved in the inquiry which, under Commission rules, could result in fines of up to 10 per cent of the European turnover of the worst offenders. The investigation originally involved more than 70 companies. The shortened list is thought to include all the main suppliers including British, French, German and Italian companies. It would be the fourth time this year that fines have been imposed by the Commission for alleged market-sharing or price-fixing by European companies. In July, Brussels imposed record fines totalling Ecu132.15m (Pounds 104m) on 19 carton-board producers accused of operating Europe's 'most pernicious' price-fixing cartel. In February, Brussels fined 14 steel producers more than Ecu100m for price-fixing and market-sharing. The cement investigations began in 1989 when officials staged a dawn raid on the offices of 10 leading cement producers in France, Belgium and Germany. The raids were ordered after customers complained of a low level of cement imports in spite of large price variations between neighbouring European countries. Imports have risen since the late 1980s but still provide a very low proportion of total sales in most EU countries.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-14643 ,"FT942-14643 _AN-EDSDVAGUFT 940419   FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (5): Key role for Treuhand's man in Tallinn - Dr Herbert Schmidt advocates a 'third way' to privatisation      By BRUCE CLARK   As a nation that spent many centuries under the tutelage of Teutonic land owners, the Estonians tend to be admirers of most things German. And the government, faced with the task of parcelling out Estonia's state industries efficiently but fairly, has looked for advice to Berlin - in the shape of Treuhandanstalt, the German privatisation agency. This makes Dr Herbert Schmidt, Treuhand's man in Tallinn, one of the most influential figures in Estonian public life. Since taking up his job in autumn 1992, his experience and above all his contacts in the banking and corporate worlds have been of invaluable help in enabling Estonia to sell itself to the world - even at a time of instability in neighbouring Russia. 'We have kept investor confidence, despite Zhirinovksy' is Dr Schmidt's  - so far - justifiable claim. He has brought from Treuhand a 'philosophy' of privatisation - 'in some countries,' he says, 'the main purpose is the political one of dismantling the state as rapidly as possible; in others, the exercise is mainly fiscal, aimed at boosting state revenues without looking too closely at the buyers.' Dr Schmidt advocates a 'third way' to privatisation: seeing the process not as a sale of assets but a purchase of management skills, technology and capital. For 'political' privatisation, a Czech or Russian-style voucher system is appropriate; for fiscally-minded privatisers the obvious road is straight auctions. But the 'purchase' of external help can only be done by using an elaborate range of criteria to evaluate each potential buyer. Dr Schmidt has encouraged his Estonian colleagues to look not simply at the direct fiscal benefits from each bid, but at the more broadly defined 'transaction value,' which takes into account promises of long-term investment and employment. He is frank about Estonia's possible drawbacks, which makes him more plausible than when he talks about the country's undoubted assets. While Estonians are by instinct a law-abiding, even legalistic nation, the Soviet takeover of 1940 interrupted the parliament's adoption of a fully-fledged civil war code. So the only legal tradition on which Estonia can draw is the fragile one that was instituted by Russia's Tsar Alexander II in the 1860s. That makes it harder, though certainly not impossible, to draw up contracts. He likes to compare Estonia with 'Hong Kong of twenty years ago' - a strategically located 'entrepot' and outpost of capitalism, with a deep, efficiently-managed port. These assets, he reckons, should make up for the tiny size of the local market. On the future of Estonian industry, he is sure that those businesses which 'grew up naturally' in the pre-war period out of the region's own resources can restructure and flourish. But some of the manufacturing that was artificially planted in the republic by the Soviet occupiers, particularly in the defence sector, may now wither away.

Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel  docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5. Twenty minutes later, families  started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning  sailors.    The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which  extends six decks down into the ship. There were 11 survivors inside the  turret, all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ship's  magazines, the Navy said.      Crewmen Stand on Turret    Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened  turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two  other turrets.    When the vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers among those on the  dock, but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier.    Adm. Powell F. Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, was there to  greet the vessel. As the ship docked, three Marines raised a flag to half-staff  at the stern.    The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters  were not allowed to talk with the families or crewmen.    The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur  videotape released by the Navy on Sunday. The tape was made by an officer on  the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns.      Jet of Intense Fire    The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber ""bloomers""  that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and  thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse.    The videotape cut immediately to damage-control firefighters spraying heavy  streams of water onto the turret.    Churches throughout the area dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families  of Iowa crewmen.    ""We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way,"" said Cmdr. John L. Fitzgerald,  a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk Naval Air Station. ""Our faith helps us  to handle what science cannot answer, the mystery of death.""    A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book containing the  names of the dead were taken to the altar.    This morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that  can accommodate 3,000 people. The families of the victims were invited, but  Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend.    The explosion occurred during exercises off Puerto Rico. The Pentagon said it  happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the three-gun turret had been fired.  The guns, the largest on any ship at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black  powder to fire a 2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles.

Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein rattles his enormous stockpile of mustard and  nerve gases and promises to obliterate half of Israel if that country makes any  military move against his own. Saddam Hussein is much given to bravado. This  time, though, his words are more than an empty threat.    Iraq is known to have missiles able to carry chemical warheads to Israel's  population centers or, for that matter, to cities in Iran and Syria, its other  regional enemies. Would it try to do so? In the case of Israel, only if Iraq's  leader took full leave of his senses. For the nation Saddam Hussein so  murderously threatens has its own long-range missiles, and almost certainly  nuclear warheads with which to arm them. Whatever damage Iraq might be able to  inflict on Israel, Israel is capable of doing many times over to Iraq.    Welcome to the latest of the world's escalating arms races. This time the  competitors aren't rushing to amass still more tanks, planes or artillery  pieces. This time, they are hell-bent on acquiring chemical weapons, maybe  biological ones, and in at least a number of cases, nuclear bombs. Ominously,  the main players already have the means to deliver these weapons of mass  slaughter over much of the Middle East.    Israel, in the near-unanimous view of international experts on proliferation,  has a significant if unacknowledged nuclear capability. The common estimate is  that it has produced the components for at least 100 nuclear weapons. Israel  regards this arsenal as its equalizer and the ultimate deterrent against the  combined and vastly larger ground and air forces -- and now the chemical  weapons -- of its hostile neighbors. Iraq, in the view of these same experts,  is pursuing a crash program to develop nuclear weapons. Last week's foiled  attempt to smuggle in U.S.-made triggering mechanisms for nuclear warheads was  only the latest bit of evidence as to its intentions.    A nuclear weapons program, though, is costly and demands an advanced  technological base. It's far easier and cheaper to get hold of chemical and/or  nerve agents, sometimes called the poor country's atomic bombs. Though long  outlawed, chemical weapons were used with devastating results in the latter  stages of the Persian Gulf war, particularly by Iraq. Their deadly and  demoralizing effects are credited with finally persuading Iran's fanatical  leaders, who had sworn never to compromise, to accept an armistice.    The most significant international consequence of Iraq's use of dreaded and  outlawed chemical and nerve gases was that it got away with it. The world  community tut-tutted, but that concern didn't carry over into sanctions, even  after Iraq used these horrible weapons to kill hundreds of its own Kurdish  citizens. Iraq continues to get help from many nations, including economic  credits from the United States. The implicit message was that chemical weapons  no longer bear the taboo they carried since World War I. That conclusion hasn't  been lost on Libya, Syria, Iran or other nations believed to be working  feverishly to develop the means to wage chemical warfare.    U.S. officials confirm that Libya, pursuing chemical weapons development, now  has a system to refuel its Soviet-supplied Su-24 fighter bombers that will  bring Israel within their range. Egypt is thought to be working on chemical  weapons; it's known to be cooperating with Iraq on a missile, the Badr 2000,  which has a range of up to 700 miles. Syria is trying to make chemical weapons;  it already has Soviet-supplied missiles, including the SS-21, which can reach  Israel only two minutes after launching.

Zinzun said police and city officials covered up an investigation of the  February incident, which ended with Police Chief Daryl F. Gates verbally  reprimanding Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon.    The claim alleges that Zinzun's privacy, his civil rights and the terms of a  previous court ruling barring police from spying on lawful citizens were  violated.      Prelude to Filing Suit    The claim, which also names Gates and Vernon, is a prelude to filing a lawsuit.  The city has 45 days to act after which a lawsuit can be filed under state law.    Asked about the claim, Gates insisted that Vernon did not take any sensitive  information about Zinzun from police intelligence files. Rather, he said, the  data came from a non-classified computer data base that consists mainly of  electronic versions of newspaper and magazine articles.    ""I don't blame Zinzun for not believing me because I would never believe  anything Zinzun ever had to say,"" Gates said.    He acknowledged, however, that the computer terminal through which Vernon  received the information has been moved from the anti-terrorist division and  will be relocated in the office of Cmdr. William Booth, Gates' spokesman.    In February, Vernon was rebuked by Gates after his use of the computer to  gather data on Zinzun, a former Black Panther who in March waged his third  unsuccessful campaign for Pasadena's Board of Directors. Zinzun blamed his  defeat partially on the incident.      Data for Rivals    Gates has said Vernon, a Pasadena resident, had printed out from the computer  156 pages of data for Zinzun's political rivals. Gates said he intervened  before Vernon could deliver the information. Department regulations prohibit  personnel from using police resources for anything but official business.    Zinzun, a member of the Coalition Against Police Abuse, was a key figure in the  1983 dismantling of the department's Public Disorder Intelligence Division,  which had illegally spied and kept intelligence files on hundreds of citizens.    Some of those files had been removed by a PDID detective who channeled the data  to an ultra-right-wing group. In 1983, the city settled the suit for $1.8  million, and the PDID was replaced by the Anti-Terrorist Division.    Zinzun and his attorney, Dan Stormer, said they believe the data Vernon  requested included police intelligence not in the public domain.    The City Council called for an investigation by the Police Commission, the  department's civilian review board.      Handled in Executive Session    Booth said the issue was handled by the commission in executive session ""to the  satisfaction of everyone involved,"" including the interested council members.    A spokesman for Councilman Robert Farrell, who originally called for the  investigation, said the council had asked for a report but had not set a  deadline.    Zinzun a year ago agreed to a $1.2-million settlement with the Pasadena police  over a 1986 incident at a housing complex in northwest Pasadena, which left him  permanently blind in one eye.

Faced with future security challenges, it will be in  Germany's interest in the 21st century to continue its policy of  Western ties and international integration, the chancellor said  today while accepting this year's Konrad Adenauer Prize from the  Germany Foundation in Munich. This also means that Germany  should not stand aside when tasks and operations aimed at  preserving and reestablishing peace in Europe and the world are  at issue.    Hence, the issue of the Bundeswehr's deployment is at the  heart of united Germany's future alliance and partnership  capability, Kohl added. Anyone opposing bloodshed should also  help prevent or end it. If Germany fails in this, then it is  ""justifiably"" losing international respect and its own dignity,  but also the confidence that it needs and on which it depends to  a greater extent than do other countries. ""A people no longer  willing to work with its partners for peace and freedom has also  morally given up,"" the head of government said.    Kohl once again emphasized the significance of Europe's  political union for safeguarding peace. Nobody should believe  that the specter of nationalism in Europe is endemic only to the  Balkans. On the other hand, Germans should also resist the  temptation to despise patriotism just because that notion was  abused during the Nazi period. [passage omitted]     "

AS A  BONUS, PROGRESS IS MADE ON SLASHING LONG-RANGE NUCLEAR ARMS.      By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      UNITED NATIONS      Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze announced an ""agreement in principle"" Wednesday on a treaty  slashing the numbers of tanks, artillery and other conventional weapons in  Europe.    The agreement still needs the approval of Washington's 15 North Atlantic Treaty  Organization allies and Moscow's five remaining Warsaw Pact allies, but Baker  said he hopes the treaty will be ready for signature next month at a European  summit meeting in Paris.    Baker and Shevardnadze refused to divulge details of the agreement in advance  of presentation to allied nations. But Baker said the pact will result in the  destruction of ""a significant amount of armaments.""    U.S. officials have said that the emerging treaty will reduce Warsaw Pact  weaponry by about 60%, eliminating more than 100,000 weapons, including more  than 40,000 tanks. It will reduce NATO's substantially smaller arsenal by about  10%, or 15,000 weapons.    The Conventional Forces in Europe talks, which began in Vienna on March 8,  1989, are technically between the member nations of the rival military  alliances. However, it is inconceivable that either NATO or the Warsaw Pact  would reject an agreement that was acceptable to both Moscow and Washington.    When the negotiations began last year, the Warsaw Pact consisted of the Soviet  Union and six Communist-governed nations that followed Moscow's lead in foreign  policy and military planning. Now, the size of the pact has shrunk with the  disappearance of East Germany. Of the remaining nations, three -- Hungary,  Czechoslovakia and Poland -- have jettisoned communism completely and two --  Bulgaria and Romania -- have ousted old-line Communist dictators.    ""So far as U.S.-Soviet discussions are concerned, we have been able to reach  mutual understanding on all major issues,"" Shevardnadze said. ""I am sure our  allies will be able to agree with us.""    Baker and Shevardnadze spent most of their six-hour meeting at the headquarters  of the Soviet U.N. Mission on completing the conventional weapons talks.  However, Shevardnadze said they also made ""substantial progress"" toward a new  agreement slashing the superpower arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons.    Baker flew back to Washington late Wednesday but he said he might return to New  York on Friday to continue talks on a strategic arms reduction treaty before  Shevardnadze returns to Moscow this weekend. President Bush and Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have set a goal of completing the nuclear  weapons treaty before the end of this year.    But Baker said the two sides are on a ""very short time leash"" concerning the  conventional weapons talks. The United States has said that it will not attend  the Conference on Security and Cooperation summit meeting, scheduled for Paris  on Nov. 19-21, unless a conventional arms pact is ready to be signed there.    Most of the most significant issues in the conventional arms talks were settled  earlier. For instance, the two sides agreed to limit the army of reunified  Germany to 370,000 men, down from 600,000 just a year ago.    The pact will not impose manpower limits on any other armies, because the  United States and the Soviet Union were unable to agree on ceilings for U.S.  troops after the Soviets agreed, in talks with their allies, to withdraw all  Soviet soldiers from Eastern Europe within four years.    Baker said it is still possible that glitches in the formal drafting process  could upset the agreement, but he said that was unlikely.

He predicted that lower-level negotiators would straighten out  that problem without requiring additional action by the foreign ministers.    ""We agreed that the question of (Soviet) land-based naval aircraft, which was  one of the real sticking points, would be handled by a politically binding  declaration"" outside of the formal language of the treaty, Baker said.

AS A  BONUS, PROGRESS IS MADE ON SLASHING LONG-RANGE NUCLEAR ARMS.      By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      UNITED NATIONS      Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze announced an ""agreement in principle"" Wednesday on a treaty  slashing the numbers of tanks, artillery and other conventional weapons in  Europe.    The agreement still needs the approval of Washington's 15 North Atlantic Treaty  Organization allies and Moscow's five remaining Warsaw Pact allies, but Baker  said he hopes the treaty will be ready for signature next month at a European  summit meeting in Paris.    Baker and Shevardnadze refused to divulge details of the agreement in advance  of presentation to allied nations. But Baker said the pact will result in the  destruction of ""a significant amount of armaments.""    U.S. officials have said that the emerging treaty will reduce Warsaw Pact  weaponry by about 60%, eliminating more than 100,000 weapons, including more  than 40,000 tanks. It will reduce NATO's substantially smaller arsenal by about  10%, or 15,000 weapons.    The Conventional Forces in Europe talks, which began in Vienna on March 8,  1989, are technically between the member nations of the rival military  alliances. However, it is inconceivable that either NATO or the Warsaw Pact  would reject an agreement that was acceptable to both Moscow and Washington.    When the negotiations began last year, the Warsaw Pact consisted of the Soviet  Union and six Communist-governed nations that followed Moscow's lead in foreign  policy and military planning. Now, the size of the pact has shrunk with the  disappearance of East Germany. Of the remaining nations, three -- Hungary,  Czechoslovakia and Poland -- have jettisoned communism completely and two --  Bulgaria and Romania -- have ousted old-line Communist dictators.    ""So far as U.S.-Soviet discussions are concerned, we have been able to reach  mutual understanding on all major issues,"" Shevardnadze said. ""I am sure our  allies will be able to agree with us.""    Baker and Shevardnadze spent most of their six-hour meeting at the headquarters  of the Soviet U.N. Mission on completing the conventional weapons talks.  However, Shevardnadze said they also made ""substantial progress"" toward a new  agreement slashing the superpower arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons.    Baker flew back to Washington late Wednesday but he said he might return to New  York on Friday to continue talks on a strategic arms reduction treaty before  Shevardnadze returns to Moscow this weekend. President Bush and Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have set a goal of completing the nuclear  weapons treaty before the end of this year.    But Baker said the two sides are on a ""very short time leash"" concerning the  conventional weapons talks. The United States has said that it will not attend  the Conference on Security and Cooperation summit meeting, scheduled for Paris  on Nov. 19-21, unless a conventional arms pact is ready to be signed there.    Most of the most significant issues in the conventional arms talks were settled  earlier. For instance, the two sides agreed to limit the army of reunified  Germany to 370,000 men, down from 600,000 just a year ago.

Philip Mok in  The Hague; date not given: ""A Pointer From the North -- Finnish  Premier Pleads for Realism on Russia""; first two paragraphs are  ELSEVIER introduction]    [Excerpts] Finland is well on the way to acquiring European  Union membership, with negotiations to be completed by 1 March.  Last week, Esko Tapani Aho, the very young premier of Suomi, the  ""land of a thousand lakes,"" made a trip to The Hague in order to  present and secure Finnish interests. [passage omitted]    Politically, as a representative of the agrarian Finnish  Center Party, he is a moderate man. But he looked sharply  across the low table and quietly gesticulated in reaction to the  comment that Europe had reacted with euphoria to the  revolutionary developments in the former Soviet Union and East  bloc, whereas Finland had suffered a severe setback. ""I do not  deny that this was the direct result of the upheavals,"" he  says. ""It was indeed dramatic, we lost our markets in the East.  As a result we had to look elsewhere, and increasingly to the  European market.""    [Mok] Therefore you have everything to gain in The Hague,  where your colleague Lubbers has been tipped repeatedly as a  possible future Commission president?    [Aho] Yes. But things are now going much better in Finland.  And do not forget that other factors than developments on the  other side of the eastern border also affected our economy: the  general, international recession, the lack of investments,  inflation. We have applied successfully certain measures to  fight inflation and reduce unemployment.    Our aim now is to attract industrial investments. We will  succeed in this, and our competitive position has improved  already. And now we are recovering gradually from the blow we  received following the events in Russia. In 1990, 13 percent of  our exports were destined stil lfor the Soviet Union; in 1991  the percentage had fallen to nearly 3 percent (a fall of 10  percent in just one year), and in 1992 they fell even further.  But in 1993 our exports to Russia doubled, so we have reason to  be optimistic.    [Mok] Perhaps. But we hear of long queues at the Finnish  soup kitchens, and a lot of people have fallen by the wayside.    [Aho] I am not saying that everything in our welfare state  is  perfect; just that we are on the right road. But you must not  overestimate the speed with which you can succeed in situations  like this.    [Mok] You have adopted a positive position on the  Partnership  for Peace initiative, which President Clinton presented so  forcefully in Europe. But, apart from EU membership, you are  not, like some East European countries, seeking NATO membership.  Is Finland, with the vast arsenal of Russian weapons and  nuclear power stations like Chernobyl just outside St.  Petersburg and practically in Finland's own backyard, to remain  politically aligned with Finland and Finland alone?    [Aho] We are not so keen on new measures for our security.  The East European countries which, as members of the Warsaw  pact, have been deprived of their security guarantees, are  naturally in a different position than neutral, nonaligned  Finland. Our interest in the Partnership for Peace is in that  part of the program which deals with peacekeeping activities, a  field in which we have experience.    [Aho] How do you view the phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy, who  with his buffoonery as war-horse of the right won the votes of  nearly a quarter of the Russian voters? The Finnish defense  budget is to be increased for 1995, is it not?    [Mok] The one has nothing to do with the other. We are faced  simply with the need to spend money in order to modernize our  military equipment. Buying new aircraft, for example, costs  money. But as far as the success of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is  concerned, all I can say is that I find it easy to understand  the growth of nationalism in Russia. People, also outside the  former Soviet Union, have overestimated the rapid changes. Many  observers thought Russia would be totally transformed in two  years. But it does not work like that: politically,  economically, and in the field of civil and human rights,  expectations were too high. Realism is the best guide, also in  order to view developments in Russia in a long-term perspective.     "
0,FT934-1219 ,"FT934-1219 _AN-DLUC5AATFT 931221   FT  21 DEC 93 / Antall successor brings firm hand to Hungary      By NICHOLAS DENTON      BUDAPEST   Mr Peter Boross, Hungary's acting premier since the illness and death of Mr Jozsef Antall, goes before parliament in Budapest today to be confirmed as the country's new prime minister. The smoothness of the succession has defied the doom-mongering speculation typical of Hungary. Commentators pondered every potential catastrophe from wrenching leadership struggle to constitutional crisis, from swing to the right to state of emergency, early elections to delayed elections. Instead, the governing conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum took just a day after Mr Antall's death to designate Mr Boross, the interior minister, as successor. Although the conservative coalition's majority is formally just in single figures, parliamentary approval for Mr Boross today appears assured. Eastern Europe's longest-serving government is still well placed to complete a full term in office. Hungary has passed the initial test. But Mr Antall personified Hungary's political stability and so the question arises of how much will survive him. Mr Boross, aged 65 and a former catering company executive, has never been elected and only joined the Forum in 1991. He may therefore feel the need to secure his political base by appealing to the Forum's right-wing activists. He is an altogether rawer politician than his predecessor and his confrontational rhetoric has made him a bogeyman for opposition liberals and socialists. Even one of his former colleagues admits: 'Boross scares people.' Critics point to Mr Boross's call for a strong centralised state to ensure governability and strong armed forces to maintain the security of Hungary and the 3.5m ethnic Hungarians across the borders. The conservatism of Mr Boross is of the uncompromising variety. When Amnesty International issued a critical report on human rights in Hungary, the then interior minister labelled the authors 'over-sensitive liberal philanthropists that you find in every country'. So much for words. As for actions, opposition politicians note a coincidence, although they cannot prove it was any more than that. While Mr Boross was acting prime minister when Mr Antall was in Germany receiving treatment in October and November, the Evening Balance TV news, a sharp cabaret radio show and other allegedly 'disloyal' programmes were suspended. Mr Boross is no extremist, however. He rose in politics through Mr Antall's sponsorship and so is unlikely to diverge too far from his predecessor's path. The Forum chose him precisely because he offered competent leadership and continuity. The bigger question is whether Mr Boross will be able to revive the Forum's electoral chances in the run-up to elections expected next May. The party is running fourth in the opinion polls with around 10 per cent support while the Smallholders party, a key partner in the conservative coalition, has self-destructed. Mr Boross's owlish face brings little to the Forum's televisual, and electoral, appeal. But he, unlike his predecessor, has at least the physical robustness to conduct a campaign, and his forceful and plain speaking could prove an asset. Personality, however, will prove less decisive than the economy, which has contracted by 20 per cent since 1990 and brought approval for the government down with it. The problem is that Mr Boross has little room to stimulate the economy and so raise voters' sense of well-being. At the central bank council meeting last week the National Bank of Hungary, the newly independent central bank, held to the monetary tightening which has seen money-market interest rates rise 5 per cent since July, compounding government fears that tight monetary policy will snuff out economic recovery next year. Politically, prolonged economic stagnation plays into the hands of the Hungarian Socialist party, the former communists. After the recent shock over the Russian election results the Forum may be able to win back moderate voters with a red scare and the party's record of steady government. But even if the conservatives and the Forum fail, Mr Antall will at least have the posthumous honour of being not only post-communist Europe's longest serving head of government, but also one of the few to have departed undefeated.

The above is stressed by the International Association for  Protection of Human Rights in Cyprus. The association adds:  The report ignores the decisions of the United Nations and  other international organizations regarding the Turkish invasion  and the illegal pseudostate. It also ignores the decisions of  the Council of Europe's Committee on Human Rights, which in 1976  and 1983 decided that Turkey was guilty of mass and continuous  violations of the Greek Cypriots' human rights in the occupied  part of Cyprus.    In substance, the association notes, the State Department's  report recognizes the division of Cyprus as permanent, gives  legal status to the Turkish Cypriot ""administration"" and  indulgence to the Turkish troops, deceives on basic issues and  distorts the facts against the Cypriot people. Especially on  the pseudostate, there is reference to ""free elections"" and  respect of ""human rights.""    The association also stresses that the report becomes even  more scandalous if one bears in mind that it follows similar  reports in past years, and the fact that the real events were  always very well known. The inaccuracies and distortions of  previous reports have been pointed out by a delegation of the  association to the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus in order to avoid a  repetition in future reports.     "

That should help to overcome the  bureaucratic obstacles within the Union. Rexrodt wants to use a  team of independent experts, composed of scientists,  businessmen, and lawyers, to examine these issues. They should  check EU provisions to establish whether companies and consumers  are being burdened with unnecessary costs. The minister did,  however, say that the subject was ""dynamite in Europe"" and would  be rejected by Jacques Delors, the EU president.    Rexrodt talked about the main tasks that he envisaged when  Germany takes over the EU presidency on 1 July. Those tasks  included overcoming unemployment and strengthening competition.  An unemployment figure of over 17 million in Europe sounds an  alarm bell in Europe, said Rexrodt in Bonn. Fortunately,  economic recovery had started in many EU member states. This  positive development has to be secured and developed. The  European Council action program for growth, competitiveness, and  employment can provide a basis for this. It seemed to be  particularly important to Rexrodt to oversee the implementation  of this plan. It would be sensible for the European states to  report to the Council of Minister on successes and failures.    In individual laender -- while considering the specific  situation in each of them -- the issue is one of consolidating  public budgets, developing labor market policy instruments, and  reducing bureaucracy. Next year, the European Commission is to  expand the number of its members from the current 17 to 21.    Rexrodt also said it is important to liberalize the European  electricity and gas markets: When that happens, competitive  distortions between member states will have to be eliminated.  In the case of energy production, companies should experience a  healthy degree of competition. In this respect, an EU guideline  is necessary, one that would increase the possibilities for  transferring gas and electricity through foreign networks and  would result in the disappearance of the current demarcation  agreements. There are substantial differences on this issue  within Germany. Thus, municipal authorities want to retain their  rights to issue exclusive permits for the supply of energy. The  Environment Ministry feels that it has been disregarded by the  Economics Ministry, because Rexrodt's ministry has not accorded  sufficient attention to environmental considerations and because  coordination between the ministries does not function.    Further, Rexrodt thinks it is necessary to create clear-cut  prospects for Central and East European states. In this  respect, Germany has a particular duty. Thus, the negotiations  on the free trade agreements with the Baltic states should be  concluded during the German presidency. The Commission could  then shortly present the draft of a mandate for the conclusion  of an agreement with those states. As far as the applications  for membership submitted by Poland and Hungary are concerned,  membership negotiations are conceivable only when the situation  in those countries would permit that. In the meantime, the  European Union will have to develop its policy of opening up  markets by dismantling tariffs and other restrictions. Rexrodt  does not consider the ideas that he has outlined to be ""a list  of wishes,"" but sees there being good prospects of real progress  in the areas in question.     "

We may even sympathize with this  young couple who rule the White House and wield the helm of  world events, or so we think. We understand the nervous  pressure and frayed confidence of the strongest man in the world  when his job is placed on the line and his position is  jeopardized by a scandal that threatens to drown him in  Whitewater, a scandal reminiscent of President Nixon's Watergate.    We may also sense the influence and see the fingerprints of  some U.S. officials who are concerned with the Middle East  crisis on Washington's tendencies, policies, statements, and, of  course, decisions. Among these officials are Dennis Ross, the  chief coordinator; Daniel Kurtzer, deputy assistant secretary of  state; Martin Indyk, National Security Council and White House  official; and Aaron Miller, Ross's assistant.    But there are things that we fail to understand, comprehend,  or even imagine and, therefore, find unacceptable and  objectionable.    For example:    -- We fail to understand why President Clinton should try to  emerge from his dilemma at the expense of the truth, why he  should make an offer for which someone else would foot the bill,  and why he should present Jerusalem as a sacrifice at the alter  to please certain people, hoping that they may then back him and  make the Whitewater affair disappear before it ends his career  as Watergate ended Nixon's.    -- We find it unacceptable and objectionable that the judge,  partner, and mediator should hand down his final verdict in the  case before the defense has ended its presentation, before the  case is summed up, before the contestants are brought into  court, and before the rivals face each other at the negotiating  table.    -- We object to Clinton's issuing a unilateral decision that  undermines the international order, violates the legitimacy of  its resolution, and slaps the members of the international  community in the face.    -- We find it incomprehensible and bewildering that  President  Clinton should break with his country's tradition and turn his  back on its known positions for the past 27 years. That is,  from June 1967 until Clinton declared unified Jerusalem as  Israel's capital.    For 27 years, for more than a quarter of a century --  President Johnson, who instigated, planned, funded, armed, and  orchestrated the 1967 aggression, could not declare or state  that Jerusalem was Israel's capital; and Presidents Nixon, Ford,  Carter, Reagan, and Bush stopped short of what Clinton, all of a  sudden and with bizarre timing, did.    On the contrary, for a quarter century resolutions were  issued, statements were declared, and positions were stated by  successive U.S. Administrations, the UN General Assembly, and  the UN Security Council, all of which emphasized that East  Jerusalem is part of the Arab territories occupied in 1967.    An element of flexibility had been advocated by James Baker,  the former U.S. secretary of state, who maintained that the  peace process should begin by addressing the easy issues. This,  he reasoned, should lead to progress and generate momentum that  could be useful in addressing the difficult and intricate issues  at a later stage. The idea, then, was not to make concessions  and compromises for their own sake, but to expand the areas of  agreement through discussion of less thorny matters. That is,  once a climate of understanding and a spirit of mutual  confidence had been created, difficult matters would be brought  to the table.    President Clinton's declaration, although made during a  private meeting with U.S. Jewish leaders, does not show the  astuteness of a ""professional"" statesman as much as it betrays  the opinion of an ""amateur politician"". There's a big  difference between amateurism and professionalism.    Amateurism is a whim, a personal inclination motivated by  bias and fed by emotions. Professionalism is a job, work, and  responsibility.    Professionalism means calculations, assessments, and rules.  It has principles and codes of conduct. Anyone who disregards  them breaks the rules. If he circumvents them, he violates the  law. If he breaks the rules and transgresses, he is taken to  account.    Governing -- particularly on a very high level, on a state  level, indeed on a universal level, as the case is with the U.S.  President -- must signify justice and responsibility. It must  never be an attention grabbing ""arbitrary move"" that shifts the  focus from Whitewater to Jerusalem, or from the Hebron massacre  to an assault on a Lebanese church or a monastery in al-Qusiyah,  Egypt.    Governing should signify decisions and statements that have  been thoroughly thought out, sober conduct, and a word of reason  at this difficult, embarrassing time.    During a recent meeting with Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] --  at  a time when his chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th had just returned  from Washington following lengthy meetings with Christopher and  his aides -- Abu-'Ammar disclosed part of the news Sha'th had  brought to him from the U.S. capital. Among the things he  revealed were some of the reasons for the obstruction of a UN  Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre. The most  important of these reasons was a ""firm, stern, and emphatic U.S.  refusal to allow any direct or indirect reference to Jerusalem.""  There was a U.S. commitment to ""banning the word Jerusalem from  the draft of the resolution and subsequently from the resolution  itself.""    Everyone was perplexed by this strange attitude and this  intransigence and insistence because the draft resolution  included nothing new about Jerusalem. It added nothing new,  made no new request, and did not emphasize a principle that some  people were trying to obliterate.    All that the Palestinians asked for was that the draft and  the final wording of the resolution should include a passing  reference to Security Council Resolution 799 of 1992. It was  meant to be a reference to that resolution in the wake of the  Hebron massacre. Resolution 799 speaks of implementing the  fourth Geneva Convention pertaining to territories and residents  living under occupation, including occupied Palestinian  territories in the West Bank and Gaza, including Jerusalem.    This reference to a binding UN resolution and a firm  international principle -- a resolution and principle accepted  by the United States when the vote on Resolution 799 was taken  in 1992 -- was now unacceptable, prohibited, and a taboo.    No one knew at that point the reason for the prohibition of  something which had, in fact, been accepted and agreed upon as a  matter of course.    It was to be a Palestinian reference, a necessary one after  the Hebron massacre proved that Palestinians under occupation  enjoy no form of protection whatsoever.    People became apprehensive at this point and the  Palestinians  realized something ""was being cooked up"" in the dark. The  perplexity and fear persisted until President Clinton revealed  his intentions and ""detonated his bombshell"" in the dark.  Israel Radio then lifted the veil and ""laid it bare"".    This attitude to the resolution and its draft form, to which  the U.S. negotiators adhered throughout the Security Council's  deliberations, was based on frank, definite, and clear  instructions from the White House. It does not reflect the U.S.  Administration's calculations. It rather shows ""a deception.""  It reflects a circumvention and contradiction of former  positions and commitments. It shows an abandonment of the  responsibility the United States bears as a full partner in the  peace process.    This position reflects a bias, indeed a U.S.-Israeli  alliance, against the Arabs.    Perhaps this maneuver or change in the U.S. position would  have been acceptable before Oslo and before the signing ceremony  at the White House. Perhaps this position could have been the  subject of discussion, argument, and negotiations before the  Hebron massacre. But after the signing ceremony at the White  House and the festival of martyrdom in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque,  it is impermissible for the United States -- irrespective of the  personal reasons of President Clinton and his wife Hillary -- to  adopt such a stand, unless the game is much bigger than this,  the deception hides behind it a greater tragedy, and the peace  process for which we are sincerely working is a big lie.    I am afraid that President Clinton's calculations and  assessment of the overall situation were the result of political  amateurism and not responsible professionalism, which is  necessary for one who occupies this high position at the center  of the empire that runs the affairs of the entire world.    This political amateurism may have been nurtured or  attracted  by an easy or naive calculation based on the facts and  developments at that moment. This naive and tempting  calculation may have been based on dealing with the situation in  light of the material relations between the forces. These  material relations say that Israel is now the strongest country  as a result of its alliance with the United States, its military  arsenal, nuclear bombs, and internal cohesion, despite the  internal struggle for leadership and power.    The material relations also say that the Arabs are now at  the  peak of their division and weakness. They also say that this  weakness and disintegration have led many Arab states to run  after Israel, seeking science, knowledge, experience, money,  gain, and good administration. Many of the Arabs have rushed to  compete for the Israeli treasures.    This is the general picture of the relations and balance  between the forces in the area. There are those who seek  progress, wealth, and knowledge from Israel and those who have  placed security in the back or front of their minds as their  main concern and have imagined that a military alliance with  Israel in the near or distant future will spare them from the  evil of troublemakers among their Arab brothers who covet their  territory and wealth. They also imagined that this will spare  them from the evil of the troublemakers among the Muslim  brothers in the neighboring countries who are seeking to restore  past glories by establishing a Muslim empire that transcends  borders. This, as we said, is the material calculation, the  calculation based on the relations and balance between the  forces. This is a misleading calculation as much as it is  tempting. Furthermore, there is a difference between weakness  resulting from a defect in relations between the forces and  capitulation, which is out of the question.    Therefore, the reality is very different and the reasons  for that are many. For the foreseeable future at least,  military superiority has become ineffective. Nuclear and  military potentials have, to a large extent, become inoperative  and useless. We have the example of the second superpower, which  broke down and collapsed on itself while possessing the largest  weapons arsenal of all kinds. It also had the largest supply of  resources, expertise, and scientists on the face of the earth.    We have the second example in South Africa, which was  founded  as a racial state in the same year as racial Israel was founded,  1948. Both of them came to be part of the post-World War II  arrangements.    The whites established their racial state there and deprived  around 30 million people, that is the black Africans and sons of  the area, of their land. The whites armed themselves with  everything and deprived the others of everything. They armed  themselves with education, monopolized work including  agriculture, built an atomic bomb, set up a military arsenal,  and at the end of the road, discovered that the world had  changed.    They found out that arrangements made after World War II had  collapsed and were being replaced by post-Cold War arrangements.    They discovered that they were up against the wall and had  no  other option but coexistence, dismantling the racial state, and  building a democratic state. They discovered that bullets were  blank and grenades had no triggers.    They changed and decided to bravely join the rest of the  world, led wisely, expertly, and with good intentions by de  Klerk. They made way for free elections for all -- for the  blacks, the whites, and the coloreds -- elections that will take  place on 27 April.    They decided to go ahead despite the fact that they know the  results beforehand -- the black majority will win. However,  they did not withdraw, as Rabin is doing today.    The noticeable fact is that the two racial states, Israel  and  South Africa, were founded in 1948.    Also, in both cases peace negotiations based on change  started in 1992.    The difference is the regression, through massacres, in  Palestine and the progress, despite problems, in South Africa.    The second fact in the unseen, intangible, and invisible  formula is that when Israel accepts or shows readiness to accept  a part of the land under a just peace, it should do so on the  condition that the Palestinians regain their rights and land,  topped by Jerusalem.    This condition is binding, not only to Israel, but even to  those who have competed to sign secret agreements with Israel,  be they security or cooperation agreements.    The region and its people have accepted peace as a condition  for cooperation -- a just, fair, and equitable peace.    Anything less than this is rejected and unimplementable; no  one can impose it on them.    Therefore, the real calculations of the superpowers do not  rely on material and military relations. In actual fact, they  rely on general popular acceptance by all the countries and  peoples in the region. This is the effective and decisive  factor. Anything less than this, is a fancy flitting through  the minds of amateurs.     "

The northern  border, where a de facto economic and commercial integration is  supposed to exist, constitutes the practical scenario to show  the advantages of the commercial agreement in a natural and  everyday manner.    In Chihuahua, however, the situation appears to be the same,  at least in regard to regional exports from the state to U.S.  markets. Despite everything, as far as imports are concerned, it  is possible to find in the supermarkets a variety of U.S.  products that are being sold without Spanish labels and even  foods with expired dates on them. Is the Mexican Customs  opening in keeping with the ""free flow of foods"" that is being  promoted by NAFTA or is it simple premodernistic [premoderno]  smuggling.    As for Chihuahua's exports, there is discouragement and  disappointment. Apple producers who process the fruit and sell  it as concentrate or syrup must, before every shipment, wait for  lab tests in order to introduce their product. The product is  kept by Customs for days, which entails additional expense since  apples are a perishable product. Apparently, the elimination of  nontariff barriers has not reached the U.S. Customs officials  yet.    Another case in point is that of a renowned producer of  Mexican bread and tortillas, which are exported to the United  States. To preclude surprises in each shipment, he asked that a  customs office be set up at his plant where compliance with the  rigorous U.S. health requirements is documented, verified, and  certified. Despite this, tortilla shipments and exports are  stopped and sent for lab tests, thus delaying and raising the  Mexican exporter's operating costs.    In addition to these protectionist examples, typical of U.S.  praxis and insensitive to NAFTA, there is a very significant and  well documented ""free trade"" experience. An executive of a  business association or chamber accompanied by Mexican and U.S.  notaries tried to determine levels of bias and ambiguity among  U.S. Customs officials. For this purpose, he bought several  gallons of U.S. milk (the milk sector of the state refuses to  let go, despite efforts by the sector's industrialists via  subsidized imports and official policy). He shipped it and  imported it into Mexican territory. Subsequently, he switched  the packaging (not the containers) and replaced them with others  that had Mexican labels. When the same milk was exported to the  United States, Customs officials stopped the shipment and  conducted the lab tests that have become customary for Mexican  perishables. The milk was rejected because it yielded negative  results (unhealthy bacteria and foreign objects). How can one  interpret this Customs behavior that milk producers have  documented with Mexican and U.S. notaries?    In sum, the cases described have nothing to do with promises  of ""clear and objective regulations for permanent access to the  national exports"" that were used to justify this national  decision to sign and approve NAFTA.    Therefore, before further lowering tariffs and beginning the  new opening for the announced banking services, the government  should demand the effective dismantling of nontariff  restrictions because thus far, neither commercial reciprocity  nor NAFTA have reached Chihuahua's border.

More than half of the people in  those countries (57 percent) fear an ""increase in crime in their  country."" Netherlanders and inhabitants of the former East  Germany are most fearful, registering 66 and 67 percent,  respectively.    This is the conclusion of an international survey whose  results were presented Tuesday [24 May] in the German city of  Gronau. The survey was commissioned by the Netherlands Police  Academy (NPA) and the German Police Academy (PFA).    The same survey also showed that there is widespread support  in the four countries for international police cooperation in  the European Union. One striking fact is that Netherlanders in  particular are fervent supporters of more in-depth cooperation.    In addition, no less than 97 percent of Netherlanders want  information on criminals to be exchanged between international  police bodies. The average in the four countries is 2 percent  lower.    The Netherlands also favors a joint police structure, such  as  Europol: With 96 percent in favor, compared to an average of 92  percent in the four countries involved in the survey.    A total of 80 percent of the respondents felt the police  should be able to chase and arrest suspects across internal  borders. That percentage puts the Netherlands squarely in the  middle.     "

""The recovery of the automobile market in Italy is  nonexistent."" ""The improvement of the economy in Europe is not  itself capable of resolving the problems of unemployment and  public finance, which is causing an extremely critical situation  in Italy."" Fiat Chairman Gianni Agnelli came to Lake Como to  take part in the seminar organized by the Council for  Italian-U.S. Relations, and took the opportunity, both in his  speech and when talking with journalists, to express his opinion  about the political and economic issues of the moment. From the  Berlusconi government's first moves to the failure of the Corfu  summit, and from the recovery to the restlessness of the  financial markets.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Mr. Agnelli, how do you judge Mr.  Berlusconi's first moves?    [Agnelli] He certainly has not done much yet, but the first  measures are in the right direction...    [LA REPUBBLICA] Including in the direction of a reform of  public finance? Is there not a danger that the necessary  corrective moves will be postponed too long?    [Agnelli] The sooner they implement the reform, the better  for everyone. Of course, it must be said that this government  has only existed for 45 days; it has been distracted by the  European elections and has not been able to do much.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So would you still express a vote of  confidence in it?    [Agnelli] Definitely, yes, just as I would grant it to other  governments, from an institutional viewpoint.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is Fiat experiencing a recovery?    [Agnelli] A distinction must be drawn: The recovery of the  automobile market is weak in Europe, but it is nonexistent in  Italy, on which, as is well known, Fiat depends to a large  extent.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So should there be incentives to facilitate  sales?    [Agnelli] It is not up to me to discuss such matters.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think that the recovery that is  emerging in Europe could spread and grow stronger?    [Agnelli] The overall climate seems calmer, but we must  consider how to strengthen the recovery, how to set in motion a  strong and lasting recovery. The spontaneous improvement  envisaged for the second half of 1994 and for 1995 does not  itself seem capable of resolving the two structural problems  assailing Europe -- the worrying level of unemployment and the  public finance situation.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Are there any solutions in the short term?    [Agnelli] There are no miracle solutions to unemployment,  and  there is now widespread agreement that Europe's inability to  curb the loss of jobs stems from structural factors such as the  great rigidity of the labor market and the excessive extent of  the welfare state. If Europe wants to create new job  opportunities it must have the courage and the determination to  tackle these problems, to impart flexibility to the economic  system and to carry out a proper and incisive reform of the  welfare state.    [LA REPUBBLICA] From an industrial viewpoint, what is the  way  to support the recovery?    [Agnelli] Europe must continue along the path of pay  restraint; it must support investments, especially in the major  infrastructure networks; it must take action against rigidities  and bottlenecks that present sufficient mobility of production  factors and especially of labor, so as not to create obstacles  to the prompt adaptation of production to the variability of  demand.    [LA REPUBBLICA] The sudden declines in the international  markets indicate great alarm about economic prospects, about  trends in inflation and interest rates.    [Agnelli] It is essential to issue strong and clear signals  to the markets. Negative expectations threaten to influence  Europe's recovery, precisely through an increase in the cost of  money. Although it can be said that the worst period of the  crisis is now behind us, the recovery is not only modest, but  still seems very unsteady and based on policies that enjoy  little confidence on the part of the markets.    [LA REPUBBLICA] The Corfu summit ended without an agreement  on the next president of the Commission. Is that a worrying  sign?    [Agnelli] They will meet and discuss it again. For us  Italians, it does not seem to me to be a major problem whether  the candidate is Dutch or Belgian. Personally, I would choose  GATT Secretary General Peter Sutherland for his professional  qualities.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So is there not another split within the  European Union?    [Agnelli] British Prime Minister Major has suffered so many  blows at home that he wanted to gain some satisfaction abroad by  blocking the choice of the new president.     "

Volkswagen Financial Services, as the company is to be known, will bring together the number of individual financial services companies that Volkswagen operates and will have direct access to international capital markets. 'The new company will make it much easier to access the most favourable financing rates available on world markets,' Volkswagen said yesterday. 'The result will be a significant reduction of refinancing costs and an improvement in the return on the capital committed to the financial services business.' The group said yesterday the new company would be used to finance the high liquidity requirements of the group's financial services activities. Since the group established a separate financial services division in 1989, the balance sheet size of these activities has grown from DM14bn (Dollars 8.6bn) to DM22bn. Unlike VW's mainstream automobile manufacturing activities, the division is profitable, making DM270m pre-tax profits last year, up from DM120m in 1989. Volkswagen said yesterday profits are set to increase again this year. The new company is to be formed from the merger of financing companies in France, the UK, Italy, Spain and the former Czechoslovakia as well as Germany.

Market conditions were 'changing all the time' and not all workers were likely to be affected in the same way. British Steel said last week it would cut production of liquid steel by as much as 20 per cent in the present quarter because of a decline in the demand for steel products in the UK and in export markets.

The Italian state-controlled airline claimed yesterday that it had strengthened its position in the market place. The board, however, warned that 1993 promised to be a difficult year which 'might see a slowdown in the process of renewal and relaunching so positively under way'. During the period 1993-96, Alitalia plans to invest L4,270bn (Dollars 2.76bn). Last year, the airline carried out fleet investment worth L363bn. To cover financial needs of L134bn, assets were sold, including unwanted aircraft worth L101bn. Provision for potential foreign exchange losses as a result of the lira's float since September amounted to L60.3bn. Group revenues rose by 17 per cent to L5,428bn, and if domestic and international traffic carried is measured against 1990 to exclude the anomalous effects of the 1991 Gulf war, the rise was 26 per cent. The load factor edged up to 66.3 per cent compared with 61.3 per cent during the Gulf war year. The airline continued to prune its workforce during the year, with job losses totalling 67.

0,FT932-5326 ,"FT932-5326 _AN-DFDB5ACDFT 930604   FT  04 JUN 93 / Storing up long-term doubts: Why it is so hard to put a price on decommissioning      By BRONWEN MADDOX   THE estimate that it will cost Pounds 18bn to dismantle Britain's civil nuclear facilities begs one main question: the ultimate destination of the radioactive waste. Environmentalists are criticising the NAO report on decommissioning, which is published today, for the 'absurdity' of projecting the costs of decommissioning when the method and timing are still unclear. Mr Simon Roberts of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, said: 'With no nuclear waste disposal facility in place and no detailed case for safe decommissioning presented to regulators, Pounds 18bn is definitely an opening bid for the cost of the nuclear legacy.' The NAO said yesterday: 'We took the industry's figures for decommissioning costs - we did not recalculate them - but we have pointed out all the uncertainties.' Nuclear facilities generally have a life of several decades, and the process of dismantling them begins immediately they are closed. The cost of decommissioning is high because of the need to shield workers from radioactivity, which requires remote-control machinery, and the need to store the radioactive waste safely, sometimes for centuries, until radioactivity levels have fallen. However, the timescale makes the costs difficult to project. On present plans, decommissioning would carry on for at least 100 years after a plant was closed. As the NAO points out: 'No large-scale reactor has yet been fully decommissioned, either in this country or elsewhere.' The office argued yesterday that the uncertainty of the final destination of the waste did not undermine the industry figures because the cost of storage makes up a third or less of the total figure. However the nuclear companies have made two controversial assumptions about future storage: that an underground repository will be built below Sellafield in Cumbria for medium-level waste, and that British Nuclear Fuels' Thorp reprocessing plant for high-level waste at Sellafield will get the go-ahead. Low-level waste, such as staff's contaminated overshoes and clothing, will continue to go to British Nuclear Fuels' present storage at Sellafield, they assume. The assumptions are controversial because plans for the proposed Nirex store below the ground at Sellafield have stalled and its costs are unknown. The government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee warned in its annual report last month that the timetable for opening this store was 'unrealistic' and that it might be difficult to get 'unequivocal evidence' that the geological conditions were suitable. The report also leaves open the thorny question of the timing of decommissioning. The NAO has assumed that reactors would be razed to greenfield sites within 100 years and fuel treatment plants within 50 years. But the industry wants to spread the costs over at least 135 years. That would need an extra step - building a concrete shell around a decommissioned plant while waiting for radioactivity levels to fall. The total costs would be higher, but when discounted to allow for the fact that the money would not be spent for years, the sum in today's money would be lower. On industry estimates, the delay could reduce the cost of decommissioning a Magnox reactor from Pounds 500m to Pounds 300m in today's money values.

Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, said after a meeting in Geneva that they would take their draft of the treaty known as Start 2 to presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin for final approval. The cuts that should follow would leave the world with its smallest nuclear arsenal since the early 1960s. Mr Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, last night said Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin would issue a joint statement today and were likely to sign the treaty on January 2 or 3. Earlier, he said the summit was likely to be held in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Mr Bush is already due to travel to Somalia to spend New Year's Eve with US troops. He will then fly on to Saudi Arabia and is expected to meet King Fahd on Friday. Mr Eagleburger, however, left open the possibility of further negotiations to fine-tune the agreement. 'It's up to the presidents to look at the documents and see if we've made sufficient progress to sign an agreement,' he said. 'If there are changes they would want to suggest, obviously, we'd have to come back together again.' The negotiations over the wording of Start 2 were completed in record time, just six months after presidents Bush and Yeltsin agreed a draft at their summit in Washington. Nevertheless, the final agreement was held up by disagreements on the size of Russian missile silos, the convertibility of multiple-warhead missiles to single-warhead use and the flexibility of US bombers to carry nuclear or conventional payloads. The details of how these differences were resolved were not revealed yesterday. In Washington, congressional leaders welcomed the news of Start 2's apparent completion. 'This is a great gift to the nation and to the world,' said Mr Lee Hamilton, who is about to take over as chairman of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee. An announcement from US officials on when and where a summit meeting between Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin might take place was expected after Mr Eagleburger returned to Washington late yesterday. In the meantime, White House planning for a trip to Sochi was going ahead. In Russia, Mr Yeltsin may yet face domestic opposition from politicians and the military over the nuclear weapons accord. Other countries which were once part of the Soviet Union that also have nuclear weapons may also delay the implementation of Start 2. Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus should disarm under the Start 1 treaty signed last year between Washington and Moscow, but only Kazakhstan has ratified Start 1. Alison Smith writes: In London, the Foreign Office welcomed the prospect of defining in treaty form the agreement on further reductions in strategic arsenals. The progress in the Start talks, however, brought renewed opposition pressure on the government not to increase the number of nuclear warheads when the Trident submarine is deployed in the mid-1990s. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the Conservative chairman of the cross-party defence committee of MPs, welcomed the progress made but sounded a note of caution as he pointed out that Ukraine had neither taken part in the talks nor agreed to surrender its nuclear armaments to Russia.

The shooting, the first since the IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries declared ceasefires, cast a shadow over the Northern Ireland peace process. It will almost certainly increase pressure on London and Dublin to step up their efforts to secure a dismantling of paramilitary arsenals. Dublin's decision to cancel the early release orders for the IRA prisoners was announced by Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, after a meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'deeply angered' by the 'callous and wicked' murder. There would be 'very natural suspicions' as to the motive for the crime. The attack took place in Newry. Three armed men, dressed as postmen and using a post office van, entered a fenced sorting centre. An employee was shot dead. Two of the men were arrested after a chase involving helicopters near the Irish border. The third escaped and was last night being sought by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The RUC said the two men arrested were reported to be known republicans. But Sinn Fein indicated last night that the raid was not the work of the IRA and did not represent a breach of the two-month-old ceasefire. Republican sources in South Armagh, a strongly nationalist area, said the raid was the work of renegade, freelance republicans commiting a straightforward criminal act. Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, was reported to be 'visibly shaken' when told the news by a reporter. He said: 'The RUC is engaged in a transparent attempt to damage the peace process.' A statement from the IRA said: 'On August 31 the IRA announced a complete cessation of military operations . . . This position has not changed.' Yesterday's killing came on the eve of a meeting between British and Irish officials to discuss the framework document which the two governments hope will form the basis of a durable political settlement in the province. Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are to discuss the document in the Republic of Ireland on Monday. There have been signs in recent days that the two governments have made progress - particularly in the area of north-south relations - after a period of little progress. British and Irish politicians said the shooting showed the need for a rapid surrender of weapons. Mr Seamus Mallon, MP for Newry for the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'All we do know for certain is that these people had a certain close relationship with the IRA, that they had weapons, and they had very clearly planned this operation . . . the same kind of operation they have used before.' His view was echoed by Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist party spokesman on legal affairs. He said: 'Freelance operations don't take place in that area unless they're licensed by the IRA.'

The new subsidiary, Digital Sales  Services South Africa, will begin operations on July 1. Digital estimates South Africa's annual investment in information technology is Dollars 1.7bn, making it the largest market in the world without a Digital presence. 'Many of our major international customers operate here and they have asked Digital to come and support them as we do elsewhere,' said Mr Alberto Fresco, Digital Europe's vice-president. Digital, the world's third-largest computer company, said it had been monitoring the economic, political and social climate in South Africa for two years and decided it was time to participate. The new subsidiary would offer Digital's full range of open, networked computer systems, services and systems integration for personal computers to mainframes. Mr Alan Peters of Digital Europe has been made general manager of the subsidiary. The majority of employees would be South African. Ms Sallie Crenshaw, Digital's international trade director, said the company would begin with 50 employees, including four senior US-based Digital managers who would help set up the local operation and develop their local management replacements before returning to the US. The company hoped to have 200 local employees by 1996. 'We hope this will send a signal of commitment and confidence to other foreign investors considering the South African market,' she added.

Japan agreed to consider the Russian request for the  emergency storage facility at a bilateral experts' meeting held  at the Foreign Ministry, the officials said.    The two sides reconfirmed that it is essential to prevent  further dumping of low-level liquid radioactive waste into the  ocean by Russia, they said.    Russia told Japan it is storing about 1,900 tons of liquid  radioactive waste in four vessels and other facilities around  Vladivostok but that the storage capacity is nearly full.    The environment in the Russian Far East is in ""critical""  danger because, for example, one of the old vessels storing the  liquid radioactive waste has a hole in it that might pose a  threat in bad weather, the Russian delegation was quoted as  saying.    Russia explained that emergency measures are necessary to  cope with the situation and asked for Japanese cooperation in  finding a chemical tanker with a storage capacity of between  5,000 tons and 25,000 tons, the officials said.    An estimated 5,000 tons of liquid radioactive waste are  generated annually in Russia as a result of the dismantling of  nuclear-powered submarines.    A 100 million dollar fund pledged by Japan to Moscow to help  Russia scrap its obsolete nuclear weapons will be utilized to  purchase the tanker or some other facility for emergency  storage, they said. The tanker would be a used one, since it  would take more than a year to build a new one.    The two sides agreed to hold another experts' meeting in  Moscow in early January to further discuss the matter, they said.    Russia dumped 900 tons of liquid nuclear waste into the Sea  of Japan on October 17. It suspended a planned second dumping  following international protests, particularly from Japan and  South Korea.    Tuesday's meeting was attended by Russian First Deputy  Foreign Minister Michail Kokeev and five other officials from  the Atomic Energy Ministry, the Navy and the Pacific Fleet.    The Japanese group was headed by Yukiya Amano, director of  the Foreign Ministry's Science and Nuclear Energy Division.  Officials from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  and Science and Technology Agency also attended.    At the meeting, Japan and Russia also reconfirmed plans to  conduct joint research on the Sea of Japan in mid-January, the  officials said.    South Korea will also take part in the joint research, which  will sample both water and sediment around the point where  Russia dumped the waste in October. Officials from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) may also be aboard the  research ship, they said.    The Japanese and Russian delegations also basically agreed  to  conduct a second joint research expedition next summer if  possible, they said.    The two sides will hold a joint working group meeting in  Tokyo in March to discuss the results of January's joint survey,  details of the proposed second investigation and other problems  involving the storage of radioactive waste, they said.    On Wednesday, the Russian delegation will visit radioactive  waste storage and processing facilities in the village of Tokai  in Ibaraki Prefecture, the officials said.     "

The ruling follows a European Commission decision two months ago that Langnese-Iglo, a Unilever subsidiary, and Scholler Lebensmittel, another German ice-cream maker, were acting illegally by maintaining exclusive ties with German retailers which kept Mars products out of their stores. The Commission also reached an interim decision that exclusive freezer agreements operated by Unilever - Europe's biggest ice-cream maker - infringed EC competition law. Mars yesterday sought to overturn a two-year-old Irish court injunction preventing it from putting its ice cream into freezers owned by HB Ice Cream, an Irish Unilever subsidiary. However, the High Court said the injunction did not violate EC or Irish law. Mars said it would appeal against the ruling before the Irish Supreme Court and possibly in the European Court of Justice.

However, the Panamanian head of state denied Italian reports  that arrests were made in his country in connection with  ""Unigold"" operation, which on Wednesday destroyed a network that  laundered $100 million monthly from the sale of Colombian  cocaine in the United States through large amounts of gold sent  to Panama.    In statements to EFE, Endara said that according to the  security reports he has received, an international operation was  conducted with the participation of Italian police, and although  Panama ""was not directly involved, it was kept informed of the  situation by other agencies.""    The cooperation, Endara added, was ""at the level of  information,"" which the Italians did not request directly but  received through unidentified organizations.    Endara said he does not believe that these kinds of  drug-related activities affect the international image of  Panama, whose international banking system and Free Trade Zone  have been considered by U.S. counternarcotics experts as ""very  vulnerable"" to money laundering.    ""This happens in all countries, and we always cooperate when  asked,"" the president stressed.    According to reports by authorities, the network dismantled  in Italy was led by Colombian citizen Gustavo Jesus Upegui  Delgado, former accountant of late Medellin Cartel chief Pablo  Escobar and currently one of the main financial leaders of the  ""Cali Cartel."" Upegui has been arrested in Vicenza (northeast  part of the country). Seven Italian businessmen were arrested in  Vicenza and Arezzo on charges of participating in the money  ""laundering"" network.    Reports from Italy said that four other unidentified people  were arrested in Panama, but Endara asserted that no arrests had  been made in his country in connection with ""Unigold"" operation.    Italian authorities began the investigation last June after  receiving a lead from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA).    According to reports from Italy, the dismantled gang used  ""narcodollars"" to buy some 1,000 kg of gold bars per month,  which were sent to Panama, where they were resold and the  ""laundered"" money wired to the Cali Cartel in Colombia.    Alessandro Pansa, director of the operation and one of the  individuals responsible for the Central Operation Center of  Italy's Criminal Police, said in his country that the  trafficking operations were so large that they threatened to  alter the gold market.    Endara said that unlike other countries, Panama does not  control the sale of gold, which ""comes and goes without a  problem.""    Italian investigators identified three corporations, all  based in Arezzo, as the owners of bank accounts where the  ""narcodollars"" were sent. The corporations are Simar Joyeros  Mayoristas, which has an outlet in Panama, Aurea Trading  International, and Eurocatene.    Panamanian sources at Simar Joyeros Mayoristas told EFE that  their corporation had not participated in any drug money  laundering operation, that no employee had been arrested, and  that last year an investigation conducted by the Panamanian  Customs Directorate cast no doubts on the corporation's  activities.    According to government sources, the jewelry corporation in  Panama is owned by Saul Schwartz, a Jewish businessman who on 1  June was kidnapped under strange circumstances by unidentified  individuals who released him uninjured after an unspecified  ransom was paid through a rabbi.

0,FT942-9232 ,"FT942-9232 _AN-EEQDYADYFT 940517   FT  17 MAY 94 / The best lines of defence: The political and commercial challenges facing Europe's arms industry      By BERNARD GRAY and BRUCE CLARK   If the cold logic of commerce were the only factor, then the French foreign legion would be using bullets from Lancashire, and French shells would be whizzing across the British army's training ground on Salisbury plain. Such a pooling of resources between munitions makers makes business sense. As tensions have eased after the cold war, almost every western country has been quick to claim the peace dividend, and governments have trimmed defence budgets as a proportion of gross national product. At least on paper, European countries are committed to the principle of pooling arms procurement efforts as companies grapple with declines in both domestic and foreign sales. Mr John Weston, chairman of British Aerospace defence, is confident that talks on collaboration between Royal Ordnance, the BAe subsidiary which makes bullets, and Giat of France will bear fruit. But before this happens, both companies will have to satisfy a small caveat from the UK Ministry of Defence. If the UK has to use French bullets, then France has to use British ones. As a ministry official put it: 'Any dependence must be mutual.' This lingering wariness between Europe's ancient nations means the continent's defence industry is not streamlining as fast as its counterpart in the US. As American groups rationalise and regroup, Europe's politicians and industrialists are still searching for ways to follow suit without sacrificing all their secrets and sovereignty. The commercial rationale for consolidation is equally powerful on both sides of the Atlantic. Throughout the western world export sales are in decline. At constant 1991 prices, Britain, France and the US saw total arms exports fall from Dollars 25.7bn in 1987 to Dollars 14.4bn in 1991. In the US, the response to this challenge has been rapid. The plunge in government arms purchases - to about Dollars 40bn next year from Dollars 120bn a decade earlier at constant 1993 prices - has already prompted an extensive restructuring in the industry. General Dynamics has sold its tactical aircraft business to Lockheed, its missiles operations to Hughes and its electronic systems to Carlyle. Most recently, Grumman was the target of a Dollars 2.2bn tug-of-love bid between Northrop and Martin Marietta, which Northrop won. Compared with this hectic activity, rationalisation in Europe has been sluggish. Europe still produces three types of main battle tank, against one in the US. It is also designing three advanced fighters - the Eurofighter, the French Rafale and the Swedish Grippen, while the US is concentrating on one - the Lockheed/Boeing F-22. The contrast has not gone unnoticed in Europe. Mr Louis Gallois, chairman of Aerospatiale, the state-owned French group, said in London recently: 'Not without government intention and support, the American aerospace industry is completely restructuring. Ignoring merger control and anti-trust legislation, very profitable mammoth companies are being formed in almost all product categories.' Behind these comments lies a gnawing fear that economies of scale will enable US companies to launch a price war long before Europe has had time to get its own corporate act together. There are a few signs that Europe is starting to react. Dasa, the German aerospace company, announced a plan to cut 16,000 jobs last year; British Aerospace has been in negotiations for the past 18 months to merge its missile business with Matra of France; Aerospatiale is in similar talks with Dasa; the UK defence and automotive group GKN has bought the helicopter-maker, Westland. Yet progress has been painfully slow, and there is little consensus on how European industry should rationalise. Some, including Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, believe defence is essentially the business of individual countries, and that larger groupings will be formed within states rather than between them. For instance, Lord Weinstock says that GEC and BAe may eventually work together as joint prime contractors on projects or conceivably pool some defence interests. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of the UK tank maker, Vickers, takes a different view. He sees cross-border co-operation in weapons production as the most likely way forward: keeping separate the companies making particular products, but allowing for joint ventures and joint weapons development. The vision of cross-border collaboration is shared by Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, who says: 'There is no other way forward. The pressures on stretched budgets are driving towards more collaborative programmes.' The most spectacular multinational project to date is Eurofighter. This Pounds 32bn bid by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain to be in the vanguard of military aircraft technology has divided German opinion. Also in the pipeline are a Dollars 7bn project to build a new military transporter, the Future Large Aircraft (see chart); a Franco-German armoured car; and a frigate involving Britain, France and Italy. As technology becomes more expensive, it may no longer be feasible for any European country to build a cutting-edge weapons platform alone. Co-operation therefore sounds appealing and politically prestigious. But grandiose plans for the future will not remove the need for painful decisions about current production. Building weapons in more than one country may make it easier to raise development capital, but it does not necessarily save money. Overheads and production facilities may be duplicated unless some countries are prepared to relinquish manufacturing. Matra, for instance, has decided that collaboration on specific projects is not a sufficiently radical solution to Europe's cost-cutting problem. It argues that it needs to pool equity as well as expertise with its European counterparts to compete with rivals in the US. But does Europe have to choose between national giants, cross-border project collaboration, or multinational mergers? Mr Weston of BAe thinks not. He foresees 'a mixture of national and international mergers to rationalise the industry'. Nor is he persuaded that Europe is falling behind the US. 'Europe does have some barriers to overcome which the Americans do not. But then the European industry probably started to sort itself out long before the US.' However, as Lord Weinstock points out, European companies cannot be expected to make strategic decisions until governments have defined their foreign policy priorities more clearly. 'The defence industry needs direction from governments, but the situation is far more complex now that the cold war is over,' he says. European governments are drawing up a defence shopping list in the light of a partial, and possibly total, US withdrawal from the continent. This should be concentrating minds in foreign ministries and boardrooms, but so far there has been only a stumbling convergence between leading members of the Western European Union, the embryonic security organisation. Britain, the standard-bearer of links with the US, now accepts that the WEU's importance will increase and that in certain conflicts, Europe may act alone. France, long suspicious of Washington's intentions toward Europe, now worries about too little US presence in Europe rather than too much. But key questions about the size and function of Nato remain wide open, and all discussion of Germany's role will be hypothetical until this summer's verdict by the constitutional court on whether the Bundeswehr can serve overseas. European governments broadly agree on what they need for home defence or to fight a small version of the Gulf war without US help: mobile armour, a strategic airlift capacity, satellite intelligence, and early warning systems to detect and intercept long-range missiles. Where they do not agree is on what all this implies for the arms industry. For France, it is axiomatic that European self-sufficiency in arms can only be attained through self-sufficiency in arms production. With its own budget under strain, it feels more strongly than ever the need for cross-border collaboration. Next week, France and Germany will reaffirm their commitment to establish a joint arms agency, initially to manage existing projects but with the possibility of becoming a powerful procurement executive. There is some scope for mutual advantage between France and Germany in export markets. France needs German capital and engineering skills, while Germany sometimes benefits from France's global connections, and its relative freedom from export restrictions. German companies are barred by law from exporting arms to areas of actual or potential tension. Last year's Dollars 3.5bn sale of French tanks with German engines to the United Arab Emirates looked like a neat way round that problem - although even that deal required a special permit by the Bonn government. The UK, for its part, does not accept that defending Europe necessarily implies buying European. For its forthcoming purchase of helicopters, the British army is thought to favour the US-designed Apache rather than the Franco-German Tiger. To meet its strategic airlift requirement, it is keeping open the options of buying more US Hercules aircraft or coming back to the European Future Large Aircraft, from which it withdrew in 1989. Even France is conscious of the high price of investing in European capabilities. Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, has acknowledged that in pure budgetary terms, it might be better for France to buy Hercules aircraft. He has even suggested that both FLA and the four-nation NH-90 helicopter may have to be axed unless production costs can be trimmed by 20 per cent. However, he remains committed to both projects because of their importance for European industry. Other items on the European wish-list will be even more expensive. France has virtually completed one military satellite programme, the Helios, with help from Spain and Italy, but it cannot drum up much enthusiasm for further space extravaganzas. While seeking financial help from its European partners, France is traditionally reluctant to share sensitive technology. Recent defence ministry documents state clearly that the country no longer has the money to be self-sufficient in defence electronics or weapon-building material. But its insistence on independence in nuclear matters is undiminished. Nuclear technology is proving increasingly costly, but among European states which do not trust each other enough to make bullets, such strategic collaboration is even harder. Besides, while France is protective of its own nuclear secrets, Britain's relationship with the US prevents it from passing on American technology to other countries. The most ambitious European dream of all would be the construction of a strategic anti-missile defence system to rival America's now-defunct Star Wars plan. The military case may be growing, as rocket technology becomes available to increasing numbers of uncomfortably close and potentially unstable countries in the Middle East and North Africa. However, even the US has been forced to curtail its aspirations in the field of anti-missile defences. So it seems unlikely that Europe will be able to raise the enormous sums necessary to implement such flights of fancy. At a more practical level, even a streamlined European defence industry may not be able to afford to design a shield against low-technology Scud missiles of the kind used in Yemen over the past few days. Such large-scale projects would require clarity of military purpose, political will and industrial cohesion - all of which are lacking at the moment. Ironically, the end of the cold war, which has brought such savings for the US, may increase the burden on the European taxpayer. Politicians may be called upon to explain to voters that they face a peace levy and not a peace dividend, if the continent is to defend itself without US help. To make matters worse, the political challenge coincides with intensifying competition from American defence contractors which can merge and co-operate without hand-wringing over technology transfers and issues of sovereignty. As one European expert put it: 'The US is rationalising over three to five years. Europe is moving over 10 to 15 years. That is the kind of gap you just don't close.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Europe's defence under attack  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Leading cross border projects  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Eurofighter: fighter aircraft Participants: Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain.

0,FT941-15898 ,"FT941-15898 _AN-EAMCUAAOFT 940113   FT  13 JAN 94 / Stockholm tries to bridge gap over Danish link: Environmental wrangles in cabinet are delaying one of Europe's biggest infrastructure projects      By HUGH CARNEGY   Sweden's centre-right government will today make a renewed attempt to break a deadlock that is holding up the start of work on building a bridge and tunnel link across the Oresund to Denmark - one of Europe's biggest infrastructure projects. A wrangle over environmental objections to the link has caused some embarrassment to Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, destabilising his minority coalition and undercutting his enthusiastic commitment to tying Sweden closer to the European mainstream. It has also aroused irritation in Denmark which is keen to get on with the project. Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party, the Liberal and Christian Democrat coalition partners and the opposition Social Democrats are all backing the link, which was first agreed in a treaty signed by Stockholm and Copenhagen in 1991. It is seen as a vital parallel project to Sweden's application to join the European Union, which is also due to be decided this year. But the Centre party, the fourth member of the governing coalition, has dug its heels in against the project on environmental grounds, and claims to have the support of almost half the population. Their concerns are that the main bridge section will impede salt water flows into the Baltic which are vital to the health of the already heavily polluted sea. They also argue that exhaust emissions on the bridge will break Danish and Swedish commitments made at the Rio environmental summit not to increase levels of such pollutants. The 17km combined road and rail connection between Copenhagen and the southern Swedish city of Malmo has the strong support of Swedish industry and unions. Like the political parties, they see the bridge/tunnel - the first fixed link between Sweden and the European mainland - as a valuable boost to the economy. The Swedish side particularly has already gone to painstaking lengths, including expensive redesigns of the bridge, to minimise the environmental impact. But Mr Bildt has so far failed to overcome the objections of the Centre party, whose leader, Mr Olof Johansson, is environment minister. What Mr Bildt is struggling to achieve is a political compromise that allows the government to give the final green light to the Oresund link, without prompting the Centre party to quit the coalition. In his favour is the undisguised unwillingness of Mr Johansson and his colleagues to be forced into such a position. Some formulation allowing the Centre party to dissent from customary unanimous cabinet decisions may provide a way out. But there was little sign yesterday that such a compromise was in sight, and Mr Johansson indicated that another postponement of a final decision was likely. The joint Swedish-Danish consortium set up to build the link is due to invite construction tenders early this year. On the Danish side, work on some of the approach roads and site clearances has already begun. The total cost, including associated construction on the Danish and Swedish sides, is around Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.68bn) to be paid back in rail fees and vehicle tolls. Supporters say the link will transform the Copenhagen and Malmo areas and will have beneficial effects for both nation's economies. The combined Copenhagen-Malmo region has a population of 2.3m, making it the 20th largest urban concentration in Europe and the eighth largest in terms of purchasing power - giving much greater critical economic mass than the two can muster separately. The Oresund link will cut travel times between the two city centres from a minimum 90 minutes at present to around 30 minutes. For Swedish industry particularly, the rail link will offer much faster transit times for freight that otherwise goes by ferry - halving the time it takes to move freight by rail from Malmo to Hamburg, for example.

A local leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam  (LTTE)  had asked the Colombo government last week to ""create conditions  to establishing peace"" in the embattled northeast where the  rebels are fighting for a separate state.    In the first reaction to the offer made by an LTTE  functionary known as Karikalan, the prime minister said that  rebel supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran, 39, must be directly  involved in any new peace effort.    ""Any response from the LTTE must come from Prabhakaran. We  have not closed the door for peace. But Prabhakaran is silent,""  Wickremasinghe told a public rally in central Kotmale region  Sunday.    He said 14 months of talks with the LTTE ended in failure in  June 1990, leading to more bloodshed, and he added that after  that debacle all political parties agreed that Prabhakaran must  be directly involved with any talks.    ""No political party has changed that position. We do not  want  to discourage anyone from talking. But any serious move must  come from Prabhakaran himself and no one else in the LTTE,""  Wickremasinghe told AFP Monday.    The latest LTTE peace bid was conveyed to the government by  A.T. Ariyaratna, a leader of a non-governmental organisation,  who visited LTTE-held Jaffna Peninsula.    ""I met the (LTTE's Jaffna political leader) Karikalan who  expressed their desire to bring about peace. I have conveyed  their message to the president,"" said Ariyaratna who heads the  voluntary organisation called Sarvodaya.    He said Karikalan's message in Tamil was tape recorded and a  transcript was given to President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga who  has often repeated that there was no ethnic conflict but a  problem of terrorism in the island's north.    ""I only conveyed to the president (this message) and he said  he will give very serious thought to all that and for me to  continue what ever confidence building measures,"" Ariyaratna  said.    The Tigers had asked the government to create conditions  conducive to peace by dismantling a limited economic blockade on  the peninsula. There have been no concrete proposals from the  Tigers themselves.    Ariyaratna, a member of the majority Sinhalese community,  said he was planning several more visits to the Jaffna peninsula  to ""build confidence"" between Sinhalese and the minority Tamils  concentrated in the northeast.    The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Colombo Nicholas Marcus  Fernando and the Anglican Bishop of Colombo Kenneth Fernando  made separate visits to Jaffna recently and reiterated the need  for ending the 22-year-old war.    The two clergymen also met with several LTTE leaders,  although the Tiger supremo Velupillai Prabakaran did not make an  appearance.    Wickremasinghe also said the government hoped that the  LTTE's  political wing, known as the People's Front of Liberation Tigers  (PFLT), would contest local council elections in parts of the  embattled northeast.    ""We wanted to give them a chance to test their popularity  and  then come for talks. But they have not responded,""  Wickremasinghe said. The elections are scheduled for March 1.    Security forces, who have been acquiring more hardware and  men in recent months, are currently conducting limited  operations against LTTE positions in the island's east ahead of  the local election.

Konovalov, Russian deputy atomic  energy minister, France now occupies a special place in the  struggle for world atomic markets and nuclear fuel quotas. It  has been striving to supply even atomic power stations to the  Czech Republic and Slovakia. For this reason, the agreement of  the European Union to our atomic exports is important.    Konovalov said prices for low-grade material are falling  sharply. This is connected with a surplus and free capacities at  most enterprises.    Since the collapse of the USSR, the fuel and nuclear complex  has been concentrated in Russia. We are now producing  everything including atomic fuel, highly sophisticated equipment  for atomic power stations, and the cheapest energy. We are not  building new stations but we are completing the construction of  a number of uranium units and making some things for China and  East European countries. According to the deputy minister, we  are not purchasing anything abroad. However, four conversion  production lines have been delivered and they have made it  possible to convert the parts of the Krasnoyarsk chemical  combine which once carried out military atomic orders into one  of Europe's largest production facilities for audio and video  cassettes. The Germans are taking uranium rods for their  nuclear power stations in payment. Because of a failure to pay,  we are unable to supply our fellow-countrymen, and this  threatens our own nuclear power stations with closure.     "

Kincade and Jonathan L. A. Shrier, William H. Kincade teaches in  Georgetown University's National Security Studies Program. Jonathan L.A. Shrier  is the research director at ACCESS: A Security Information Service. The views  expressed here are their own.      WASHINGTON      George Bush, despite bipartisan advice to the contrary, seems ready to redefine  arms control by emphasizing conventional and chemical negotiations and putting  nuclear arms talks on the back burner.    The premises of a changing course are beguiling: Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's military reforms remain an uncertain basis for ""deep cuts"" in  nuclear arms, conventional force reductions could lessen U.S. nuclear leverage  and Soviet decline allows the United States to call the arms-control tune.  There is also the view that Ronald Reagan's arms-reduction legacy is a fluke,  seen by liberals as product of Reagan's opportunism and Gorbachev's initiatives  and by conservatives as a sellout, an aberration, ripe for replacement by a  more cautious approach.    Yet the Reagan legacy is consistent with the basic themes of American national  strategy over the last dozen years: seeking deep cuts in nuclear forces while  reducing the risks of inadvertent nuclear war and ensuring that arms control is  not detached from U.S. concerns about regional conflict and human rights.  Progress made in these areas by Reagan will be jeopardized by Bush  Administration ""bait and switch"" tactics that attempt to substitute a chemical  arms agreement for a strategic nuclear one.    Two realities further mock a postponement of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks  (START) in favor of progress in the Conventional Forces in Europe talks and  negotiations for a chemical weapons pact:     -- Before a START agreement, the Bush Administration cannot wisely make the  urgent budget choices called for on two expensive bomber programs (B-1B and  B-2) and two costly and uncertain missile programs (rail-mobile MX and  Midgetman).     -- Americans and West Europeans are concerned about the nuclear dilemma;  conventional forces cuts are not likely to come soon enough or be deep enough,  in the first instance, to ease budget problems or impress voters in North  Atlantic Treaty Organization countries.    The worthy efforts for a chemical-arms agreement do not respond to concerns of  publics or security elites. Granted, chemical arms are weapons of mass  destruction, but not of possible social or national destruction. There are no  itchy trigger fingers capable of firing all our chemical weapons, should we  decide the Soviets were thinking about firing theirs. Bush's vow last Oct. 21  had a hollow ring: ""If I'm remembered for anything, it would be this: A  complete and total ban on chemical weapons. Their destruction for ever. That's  my solemn mission.""    Such a pact would resound politically with the noise of a feather, doing  nothing to satisfy the deep, if now muted, public desire for cuts in strategic  nuclear weapons. Finally, Bush cannot deliver on his ""solemn mission."" Any  country with a fertilizer plant can make chemical weapons, the poor nation's  deterrent.    Against this backdrop, the case for ignoring the Reagan agenda needs testing;  up close, the arguments don't add up.    Change in the Soviet Union. Soviet foreign-policy changes in the late 1980s --  withdrawing from Afghanistan, paying U.N. debts, freeing emigration, settling  regional issues and initiating arms accords -- do not depend on Gorbachev. They  stem from an elite consensus that previous policies were counterproductive and  costly. Gorbachev is the agent of change, but the impulse for such reform  predates his rise. Support from the military and lack of dissent from the  Politburo indicates the trend will continue even if resistance to domestic  economic reform ends in Gorbachev's ouster.    The consensus is that Moscow needs relief from security burdens and pressures  to remedy chronic deficiencies of crisis proportions. Military leaders see  economic stagnation and decline as long-term threats to Soviet security. They  also entertain the notion that military exertions stimulate responses adding to  insecurity and are trying to define a strategy of ""reasonable sufficiency.""     Western Leverage. ""Go slow"" advice to gain concessions in the  conventional-force talks before a START accord on nuclear arms presumes the  United States has nuclear bargaining leverage to alter a Warsaw Pact numerical  edge in conventional forces. This neglects evidence of Warsaw Pact  determination to achieve conventional cuts. With Moscow's support, the Warsaw  Pact sought new negotiations for asymmetrical European force reductions in the  first place, a change indicating readiness for concessions.    Further, nuclear-force cuts would not yield opportunities for resource  transfers in the economically beleaguered Warsaw Pact nations, except the  Soviet Union, and would not provide Moscow the industrial and manpower  resources needed for economic reforms. Significant deactivation of conventional  units drives Warsaw Pact interest in conventional-force reductions.    Nuclear and conventional negotiating situations and any agreements that emerge  must be judged by how they serve Western security -- individually and together.  This does not mean one must wait upon the other. Rather, the Western  conventional negotiating posture is influenced by developments in START. More  linkage than this risks a failure to gain the security advantages of both.     Vulnerability/Survivability. A major plaint of START critics is that the  treaty would not reduce and might even increase the vulnerability of U.S.  land-based ICBMs. But although START was never intended to remedy the  vulnerability of fixed, land-based ICBMs, it would, nonetheless, be  complementary.    Since the 1960s the United States compensated for the increasing vulnerability  of ICBMs in fixed silos by dividing its nuclear forces among bombers,  submarines and ICBMs, a hedge against increases in vulnerability of any one leg  of the triad. (The Soviets, in contrast, have emphasized land-based ICBMs.)    Some critics have complained that under START the ratio of Soviet warheads to  U.S. missiles could rise by over a third (from 2.93:1 to 4.2:1). However,  because of the rule of thumb that a prudent targeter will assign two warheads  to every missile silo, this change would be militarily insignificant, since the  Soviets would be able to double-team each U.S. silo with or without a START  agreement. On the other hand, the ratio of U.S. MX missile warheads (the most  accurate U.S. ballistic missile) to Soviet SS-18s would more than double (from  1.6:1 to 3.25:1), making the SS-18 force actually vulnerable to the MX force.    START would be militarily significant in two other ways. First, it would  prevent the Soviets from building new strategic weapons targeted against Europe  to offset the intermediate-range forces being eliminated under the INF Treaty.  Second, START would make it feasible to reduce U.S. ICBM vulnerability. A  consensus exists among politicians and policy analysts for START plus ICBM  modernization, reflecting a view that modernization will be more effective if  the Soviets are prevented by a START agreement from counterbalancing  deployments. Those most concerned about ICBM vulnerability should be leading  supporters of START.     Verification and Compliance. The Reagan Administration pioneered innovative  and intrusive verification methods; the Soviet Union broke new ground by  accepting them. Opponents say these techniques lack proved reliability and  place Soviet spies in our midst (though this means both denying their previous  charges that the U.S. was an ""open book"" for Soviet intelligence and renouncing  the U.S. quest for intrusive verification). Insistence on perfect verification  overrates the risks of a militarily significant violation going undetected and  underrates those of nuclear uncertainty and rivalry.    Both START and the conventional talks impose verification challenges more  demanding than INF, which banned a whole class of weapons rather than limiting  them. The logical next step is to pursue opportunities for verification  measures relevant to strategic and conventional forces, capitalizing on the INF  momentum to establish new standards for force visibility and data exchange.    Some observers have taken a contrary step -- imagining exaggerated scenarios in  which the Soviets suddenly ""break out"" of prospective START limits and spring a  huge arsenal on an unsuspecting United States. They suppose the Soviets could  cheat on an unprecedented scale without a hint reaching the United States.  Given that such a revelation would galvanize U.S. opinion and restart the  missile race (without eliminating the U.S. nuclear retaliatory capability), it  is more plausible that risks of exposure would deter the Soviets from  militarily significant cheating. Sensible studies -- ones that include  assessments of the reasons why or the conditions under which the Soviets might  attempt to break out of a treaty -- are prudent and would aid in planning  verification to guard against realistic risks. But nightmare scenarios are  obstructionist distractions.    Reaping the rewards of Reagan's course in arms cuts and avoiding pitfalls  requires a farsighted, integrated and comprehensible approach. The zigzag  quality of much U.S. arms-control policy has made it mysterious to the public  and open to criticism from left and right. Bush must establish realizable  objectives and priorities among various initiatives -- strategic, conventional,  chemical -- and show how they can mesh in U.S. security policy. He should avoid  nuclear-balance dogmatism, specifically the idea that a reduction in or  addition to numbers or performance in either superpower arsenal leads easily to  nuclear blackmail or nuclear war.    Arms accords can produce a less volatile strategic environment that enhances  Western security by: 1) reducing specific threats and contingencies, 2)  diminishing uncertainty in military and political planning, 3) aiding strategic  intelligence and 4) permitting more orderly procurement. Unilateral American or  Soviet force cuts, like those Gorbachev advanced in New York last December,  cannot contribute to a stable nuclear setting; neither side knows where or when  such reductions might come or how deep or lasting they may be.    A more stable nuclear balance safeguarded by arms limitation won't yield a  quick ""peace dividend"" for domestic programs or tax cuts. That could come  later, by skillful resource planning. Agreements increase costs for  verification capability and for hedges to cope with risks in the early years of  significant reductions. But stable strategic planning does mean forgoing  expenditure in nuclear-related forces and diverting funds to deficiencies in  readiness, air-lift and sea-lift. Arms limitation assists both peace and  strength.    The fundamental goals of negotiation are to improve Western security through  nuclear threat-reduction and to keep American security requirements in line  with available resources. This latter consideration has grown in importance as  U.S. resources have declined relative to other countries. Effective arms  agreements also provide incentives for compliance with existing accords and  negotiating new ones, thus helping to avoid the delay and mistrust of  stop-and-go negotiating.    The benefits of negotiated security are not available without a policy  specifically designed to gain them, one that is sustainable over time in terms  of U.S.-Soviet relations and domestic support. Reagan's deep cuts can be  managed if they are related sensibly to conventional reductions and phased in  with confidence-building measures to allay anxiety.    A disjointed approach to arms control -- lacking a broad view of opportunities  in security policy and East-West relations, failing to enunciate a clear  picture of aims and steps to accomplish them and prizing novelty over  continuity -- runs a high risk of eventually failing at home, whether or not it  succeeds at the bargaining table.

More  linkage than this risks a failure to gain the security advantages of both.     Vulnerability/Survivability. A major plaint of START critics is that the  treaty would not reduce and might even increase the vulnerability of U.S.  land-based ICBMs. But although START was never intended to remedy the  vulnerability of fixed, land-based ICBMs, it would, nonetheless, be  complementary.    Since the 1960s the United States compensated for the increasing vulnerability  of ICBMs in fixed silos by dividing its nuclear forces among bombers,  submarines and ICBMs, a hedge against increases in vulnerability of any one leg  of the triad. (The Soviets, in contrast, have emphasized land-based ICBMs.)    Some critics have complained that under START the ratio of Soviet warheads to  U.S. missiles could rise by over a third (from 2.93:1 to 4.2:1). However,  because of the rule of thumb that a prudent targeter will assign two warheads  to every missile silo, this change would be militarily insignificant, since the  Soviets would be able to double-team each U.S. silo with or without a START  agreement. On the other hand, the ratio of U.S. MX missile warheads (the most  accurate U.S. ballistic missile) to Soviet SS-18s would more than double (from  1.6:1 to 3.25:1), making the SS-18 force actually vulnerable to the MX force.    START would be militarily significant in two other ways. First, it would  prevent the Soviets from building new strategic weapons targeted against Europe  to offset the intermediate-range forces being eliminated under the INF Treaty.  Second, START would make it feasible to reduce U.S. ICBM vulnerability. A  consensus exists among politicians and policy analysts for START plus ICBM  modernization, reflecting a view that modernization will be more effective if  the Soviets are prevented by a START agreement from counterbalancing  deployments. Those most concerned about ICBM vulnerability should be leading  supporters of START.     Verification and Compliance. The Reagan Administration pioneered innovative  and intrusive verification methods; the Soviet Union broke new ground by  accepting them. Opponents say these techniques lack proved reliability and  place Soviet spies in our midst (though this means both denying their previous  charges that the U.S. was an ""open book"" for Soviet intelligence and renouncing  the U.S. quest for intrusive verification). Insistence on perfect verification  overrates the risks of a militarily significant violation going undetected and  underrates those of nuclear uncertainty and rivalry.    Both START and the conventional talks impose verification challenges more  demanding than INF, which banned a whole class of weapons rather than limiting  them. The logical next step is to pursue opportunities for verification  measures relevant to strategic and conventional forces, capitalizing on the INF  momentum to establish new standards for force visibility and data exchange.    Some observers have taken a contrary step -- imagining exaggerated scenarios in  which the Soviets suddenly ""break out"" of prospective START limits and spring a  huge arsenal on an unsuspecting United States. They suppose the Soviets could  cheat on an unprecedented scale without a hint reaching the United States.  Given that such a revelation would galvanize U.S. opinion and restart the  missile race (without eliminating the U.S. nuclear retaliatory capability), it  is more plausible that risks of exposure would deter the Soviets from  militarily significant cheating. Sensible studies -- ones that include  assessments of the reasons why or the conditions under which the Soviets might  attempt to break out of a treaty -- are prudent and would aid in planning  verification to guard against realistic risks. But nightmare scenarios are  obstructionist distractions.    Reaping the rewards of Reagan's course in arms cuts and avoiding pitfalls  requires a farsighted, integrated and comprehensible approach. The zigzag  quality of much U.S. arms-control policy has made it mysterious to the public  and open to criticism from left and right. Bush must establish realizable  objectives and priorities among various initiatives -- strategic, conventional,  chemical -- and show how they can mesh in U.S. security policy. He should avoid  nuclear-balance dogmatism, specifically the idea that a reduction in or  addition to numbers or performance in either superpower arsenal leads easily to  nuclear blackmail or nuclear war.    Arms accords can produce a less volatile strategic environment that enhances  Western security by: 1) reducing specific threats and contingencies, 2)  diminishing uncertainty in military and political planning, 3) aiding strategic  intelligence and 4) permitting more orderly procurement. Unilateral American or  Soviet force cuts, like those Gorbachev advanced in New York last December,  cannot contribute to a stable nuclear setting; neither side knows where or when  such reductions might come or how deep or lasting they may be.    A more stable nuclear balance safeguarded by arms limitation won't yield a  quick ""peace dividend"" for domestic programs or tax cuts. That could come  later, by skillful resource planning. Agreements increase costs for  verification capability and for hedges to cope with risks in the early years of  significant reductions. But stable strategic planning does mean forgoing  expenditure in nuclear-related forces and diverting funds to deficiencies in  readiness, air-lift and sea-lift. Arms limitation assists both peace and  strength.    The fundamental goals of negotiation are to improve Western security through  nuclear threat-reduction and to keep American security requirements in line  with available resources. This latter consideration has grown in importance as  U.S. resources have declined relative to other countries. Effective arms  agreements also provide incentives for compliance with existing accords and  negotiating new ones, thus helping to avoid the delay and mistrust of  stop-and-go negotiating.    The benefits of negotiated security are not available without a policy  specifically designed to gain them, one that is sustainable over time in terms  of U.S.-Soviet relations and domestic support. Reagan's deep cuts can be  managed if they are related sensibly to conventional reductions and phased in  with confidence-building measures to allay anxiety.    A disjointed approach to arms control -- lacking a broad view of opportunities  in security policy and East-West relations, failing to enunciate a clear  picture of aims and steps to accomplish them and prizing novelty over  continuity -- runs a high risk of eventually failing at home, whether or not it  succeeds at the bargaining table.

Responding to whether Bolivia will follow Colombia's lead with  regard to the legalization of drug consumption, they stated on  10 May that this issue cannot and should not be considered from  a unilateral standpoint, but rather as a part of a general  context. The government rejects this because it wants to  prevent the country from becoming a ""Mecca"" for drug traffickers.    Both ministers seek to ward off the possibility that Bolivia  will embark on a legalization process, since, as Government  Minister German Quiroga pointed out, it would turn the country  into a ""Mecca for drug trafficking.""    Quiroga said: ""The trafficking issue must be assessed within  a general perspective rather than individually, as a nation. It  would be terribly dangerous if one country became the  traffickers Mecca. This is why we must be part of a general  approach, part of the measures adopted by all countries, both  producers and consumers.""    Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar called the issue delicate  and pointed out that it must be solved by the international  community as a whole, as the community of nations is now  debating this issue.    The government minister, who holds more radical ideas,  voiced  his firm opposition to the decriminalization of cocaine as  Colombia proposed. He believes it would turn the country into  the ""Mecca"" for the production, consumption, and peddling of  psychotropic drugs and a place where drug kingpins would thrive.    Quiroga pointed out that the legalization of consumption  should be part of a consensus process and policy among several  countries. He added that it would be most inappropriate for  Bolivia to make a unilateral decision.    He stated that Colombia's stance on this issue should be  considered as ""leaving one's opponent unmarked and making a  false move,"" which may have appalling consequences for the Latin  American country that may become the world's center of drug  consumption and distribution. He added: ""This is most  dangerous.""    Quiroga noted that one cannot favor the legalization of  drugs  on the premise that interdiction has allegedly failed since the  two points are different, but at the same time, are constituent  parts of a whole. Interdiction is a fundamental part that seeks  to track and punish traffickers while crop substitution programs  seek to devise economic solutions to solve the problem of  surplus coca production. ""The two paths should run parallel:  Interdiction and crop substitution could otherwise run  separately instead of being part of an overall policy,"" he said.    Quiroga said Bolivia should coordinate with other countries  toward a coordinated action. The government minister remarked  that the country has achieved very encouraging results in its  struggle against trafficking, even though it did not eradicate  all surplus coca plantations. He added that this subject is  under discussion with U.S. authorities.    Quiroga contended that aid for the balance of payments  should  not be exclusively linked to the reduction of coca crops, but  should also consider blows dealt to trafficking, the destruction  of maceration pits, the dismantling of laboratories, and the  number of drug gangs arrested. He said: ""It is not just a  question of destroying coca crops, it is a war against  trafficking."" Quiroga also denied any alleged pressure over the  mandatory eradication of surplus plantations and a reduction in  economic aid toward the balance of payments.     "
0,FT944-5766 ,"FT944-5766 _AN-ELBDWAAKFT 941202   FT  02 DEC 94 / How the cement cartel came unstuck: A look at the European Commission investigation of price-fixing      By EMMA TUCKER   The fat file sitting on European commissioner Karel Van Miert's desk is, he says, as good a read in places as a roman policier. Unfortunately for the curious, Mr Van Miert is not publishing his file but he could probably be forgiven the hyperbole given that it took three of the Commission's staff against 'an army of lawyers' five years to come up with its contents. The file's contents relate to the alleged illegal manoeuvrings of 33 European cement producers, plus one international cement association and eight national ones that over a period of 10 years colluded to rig Europe's cement market. On Wednesday, a triumphant Mr Van Miert, competition commissioner, announced the imposition of record fines totalling Ecu248m (Pounds 193m) on the producers but warned that industry was getting better and better at hiding evidence of collusive behaviour. 'There are still cartels in some sectors and they will do anything they can to avoid us finding any evidence,' he said. The chairman of one leading cement producer is alleged to have said at the end of a collusive get-together that no minutes of the meeting would be 'necessary'. The participants were, however, not careful enough. A series of raids on the headquarters of all the leading EU cement companies towards the beginning of the investigation produced enough evidence to satisfy the Commission that a powerful cartel was operating. It alleges that the European Cement Association - Cembureau - established what was known as the 'Cembureau agreement or principle of not transhipping to internal European markets'. Through the exchange of information on prices the principle allowed producers to reduce price differences between countries so as to remove any temptation to export and to get those producers who did export to align their prices with those of local producers. In effect, the system allowed the producers to maintain artificial frontiers on the basis of domestic markets. As Mr Van Miert said yesterday: 'If a German business wanted to buy cement from a French producer, just 20km inside the frontier, it was not allowed to do so.' Conclusions to one Cembureau meeting on intra-community trade said: 'Pressure from inter-member trade had slackened considerably through improved bilateral contacts. Exports had tended to shrink, but there was still a threat from outsiders'. According to the Commission, exchanges of notes between French and Italian producers, for instance, reveal their decision to share the Cote d'Azur market. And at several meetings, the Portuguese and Spanish producers, represented by their associations, monitored cement exports between the two countries so as to ensure that markets were shared. One note from a meeting between the Spanish and Portuguese stated that: 'The parties present, who may be regarded as the repres-entatives of Spanish and Portuguese cement producers, expressed their clear support for the principle that there should be no cement movements from Spain to Portugal or from Portugal to Spain.' In 1986, after the loss of key Middle East markets, Greek producers started to threaten other markets with cheap exports. Cembureau reacted swiftly. It set up a joint trading company, called Interciment, to absorb Greek cement and prevent it from being exported to other markets. Using heavy-arm tactics the Italian cement producers also took action, ensuring that a big contract between an Italian buyer and Greek suppliers was broken. Meanwhile, other European cement producers ended contracts with Greek producers to curb exports. These practices continued right up until last year, according to the Commission. The companies - most of which are appealing - have three months to pay fines that in some cases amount to 4 per cent of their annual turnover in cement. The Commission hopes its action will introduce competition into Europe's cement market. It has pointed out that cement can be supplied profitably even over long distances. 'Cement supplies are possible from Germany and Spain to the UK and Ireland, while Italian producers are able to cross the Alps and supply cement in Switzerland,' it said yesterday. The relevant market is therefore Europe, it concluded. 'If the markets were sealed off by distance, there would be no reason for the behaviour of the firms as described in the infringement.'

0,FT933-9980 ,"FT933-9980 _AN-DHFBQADMFT 930806   FT  06 AUG 93 / Personal View: Save the planet without costing the earth      By DAVID VARNEY   'Better in the black than clean and green'. The title of David Lascelles' review of the new publication, Environmental profiles of European business (July 15), encapsulates one of today's most crucial issues - how to regulate for environmental improvement without impairing the wealth-creation on which we all depend. Worldwide, the liberal market economy is now accepted as the most efficient and responsive basis for economic activity. Certainly the more successful non-OECD economies are industrialising and developing at breathtaking pace. Meanwhile, world population is growing at 80m a year. It is not fanciful to project fourfold growth of the world economy over the next 30 years and a doubling of global demand for energy and other natural resources. The impact on the natural environment of human activity expanding at this rate represents a formidable challenge. The all-important question is how to devise environmental policy and legislation which leads to a positive relationship between economic development and environmental improvement. When founded on sound principles and proper cost/benefit analysis, this can stimulate innovation and ingenuity in pursuit both of environmental improvement and of market competitiveness. But in Britain - and Europe - the pressures on politicians to respond rapidly to environmental concerns have led to a wave of regulation, too much of which is ill-considered, prescriptive, and uncosted. Some of the effects will be perverse, damaging business confidence, discouraging investment, and driving industrial activity abroad. This will impair the very economic development and innovation on which environmental improvement depends. Europe's oil refining industry is a case in point. A big environmental challenge is certainly posed by continuing growth in car use, and related urban pollution. Influenced by US practice, and particularly by California, the EC has been introducing progressively more stringent specifications for automotive fuels. Yet trade-offs between different environmental objectives have not been fully resolved. Nor have the different environmental impacts of different vehicle emissions. Nor, indeed, has the fundamental mismatch between the costs faced by Europe's refining industry to achieve compliance, and the funds being generated by this industry from intensely competitive markets. Environmental choices are clearly illustrated by the EC requirement to lower the sulphur content of diesel fuel. There is a trade-off between achieving this and tackling the threat of global warming. Removing sulphur takes more energy, which means that the additional carbon dioxide from refineries will be about 10 times greater than the sulphur dioxide eliminated from exhausts. This is emphatically not an excuse for inaction. We must continue to invest in improving the quality of our environment. But we must do so with a clear understanding of the costs and trade-offs, and with a clear order of priorities. Today, European refiners face having to invest more than Pounds 40bn for the piecemeal application of tighter fuel standards. This is without a comprehensive assessment of the costs, benefits and impacts of the package as a whole, and without similar consideration of other options. In road transport, these include incentives to greater fuel efficiency, more stringent environmental standards for older vehicles, or speed controls. Ultimately, consumers will bear the consequences, either in higher costs passed on in the marketplace, or in reduced security of supply as Europe becomes more dependent on imported oil products. The current environmental debate, and much of the regulation flowing from it, is flawed - by an unwillingness to accept how little we know, and by a mistaken belief that improvements come at little cost. Environmental measures are proposed which place a burden on businesses disproportionate to their benefits. The burden affects companies' profitability, competitiveness, costs to their customers, and ultimately the health of the entire economy. Political leaders must decide environmental goals and priorities. But we have a right to expect them to do so with an informed grasp of the implications and thorough analysis of the costs and benefits. We in business must continue to demonstrate our commitment to real environmental improvement, not only by harnessing technical expertise to practical solutions, but also by clearly articulating costs and implications of proposed measures. The environmental debate must now be conducted with a new realism. The author is president of the UK Petroleum Industry Association and managing director of Shell UK.

According to an article by Ewa Stenberg in  the 3 February DAGENS NYHETER on page 9, the kickoff of the  Social Democratic campaign for membership ends what some SDP  [Social Democratic Party] members had criticized as a period of  passivity in which the party left it to the conservatives to  argue for membership. Anders Lindstrom, a member of the group's  board, said that this passivity gave many Social Democratic  voters the impression that ""the European Union is a rightist  project that will require reduced social benefits in Sweden.""  The manifesto tries to convince voters otherwise, arguing that  EU membership is necessary to maintain the welfare state.  Sweden can only take measures to stimulate the economy and  eliminate the high unemployment that threatens the welfare state  in the context of a larger market; the massive speculation  during the 1992 currency crisis showed that a small country  cannot keep the economy in balance by itself. The manifesto also  cites a common security policy and joint action on the  environment as benefits of membership. Lindstrom believes that  if Europe had had a common security policy, ""the war in the  former Yugoslavia could have been prevented.""    Even the liberal DAGENS NYHETER praised the Social  Democrats'  manifesto. In an editorial on 4 February on page 2, the paper  said: ""The program is aggressive and modern. It focuses not on  the Swedish exception but on a radical ambition to join in and  improve Europe's employment situation, welfare, environment, and  security together with other countries and parties.""

'Women's sport is about sex first, performance second.' In European golf, particularly in Britain, the prejudices are nursery school and public school in equal measure, this means three supremely talented players are almost unknown. Jack Nicklaus could be fat and famous. But Helen Alfredsson, Laura Davies and Trish Johnson need to play like Hogan and look like Madonna. Is the deft and devious mind of an agent truly unable to sell mere skill and personality? Will his next-of-kin, the sponsor, really not buy it? When it comes to Alfie, Laura and Trish, perhaps personality is a polite way of putting it. Each is blessed with charm, tenacity and vulnerability, but they are all highly competitive and live as fiercely as they play. The facts that these three Europeans (who play this weekend at the BMW European Masters at Golf du Bercuit, just outside Brussels) are all in the US LPGA Tour top ten and all played in Europe's drubbing of the crabby, ungracious Americans in last year's Solheim Cup is of interest only to a faithful handful. Alfredsson, 28, spent her youth in stilettos as often as spikes. She was a catwalk model in Paris. But she gave that up: 'It was a meat market. It was just make-up, calories and drugs. And I got out of it fast. Now I wear long shorts to hide my cellulite.' She trained in Sweden's elite golfing academy, before going to college in San Diego. There she was twice banished from the golf team and went off with the soccer coach, Leo Cuellar. Cuellar, a former Mexican footballer, is now her fiance. 'We play many games together, but whether it's backgammon or cards, we have to beat the hell out of each other,' she says. To Alfredsson quitting is anathema, tantrums occasional. Spectators like her tantrums. They can be louder and more richly worded than many of Lenny Bruce's best performances. Last year she was America's rookie of the year. This year, she has already won their first major, the Nabisco Dinah Shore. Davies has become accepted in British sporting circles less because she won the British and US Opens of 1986 and 1987 respectively than because she is far more knowledgeable than most of the men on the television quiz A Question of Sport. Her golf game is built on instinct and gargantuan power. And no coach. She continues to support the European circuit in spite of its disastrous management history. During tournaments she organises football and cricket matches. And plays in them. (You can just imagine Nick Faldo doing that. What would his personal fitness trainer say?) She is a mediocre spin bowler, a sterling bat and a bit like Niall Quinn, the gangling Irish striker She says: 'I like a gamble. I like driving cars too fast. I love sport. Any sport.' Talk to her about football, for example, and you get neither ignorance nor platitudes. Rather: 'Graham Taylor is a prat. I lost all respect for him when he dropped Chris Waddle. And you can quote me.' This sort of outspokeness gives agents hypertension. Johnson, Davies' 27-year-old partner in cricket and crime on tour, finally found recognition this year by winning two consecutive US tournament. Her long game is less spectacular than either Davies' and Alfredsson's, but from 80 yards or less she is deadly. At last year's European Masters she was unwise enough to have me caddy for her, when her regular valet was stranded in the US. Her concentration, dedication and shot-making are on a par with, say, Vijay Singh on the men's tour. But I bet Vijay does not drive to the course like Trish. She became intolerant of Belgian traffic and every morning for six days insisted on driving the wrong side of the road. This was not a little bit of overtaking. This was stretches of up to a kilometre at 120km an hour. Johnson, Davies and Alfredsson, like to live a little. They are throwbacks to the days before golfers played to earn rather than to win. They play for love first, money second. They play for a win, not a place. A game populated by a thousand clones of Scott Simpson ought to be grateful.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The growing demand for health care will lead to a fundamental restructuring of its provision, according to the survey which questioned more than 2,700 health experts in 10 European countries. The study concludes that public sector health spending will decline as a proportion of total health expenditure in all 10 countries. Private insurance, company schemes and household spending is expected to increase. European governments will need to balance what taxpayers can afford with constant political pressure to provide every citizen with ever-better access to higher quality care. Most will react by increasingly guaranteeing universal access to only a specified minimum level of care. This will mean patients will be obliged to contribute more for treatment and medicines. Simultaneously, governments will implement a range of cost containment strategies. These will include increased use of generic drugs and limited lists of reimbursed medicines, combined with increased contributions from patients for their treatments. Doctors will increasingly be forced to make decisions on the basis of cost. Patients will be moved away from expensive large hospitals to outpatient care, local treatment centres, and their own homes.

The bill would be paid at the end of the  embargo decreed by the United Nations after the invasion of  Kuwait on 2 August 1990. ""For the moment, importing Spanish  medical supplies in the amount of 1.45 billion pesetas would be  sufficient to meet our needs,"" said Iraqi Minister of Health  Umid Midhat Mubarak in an interview with this newspaper. ""We are  optimistic with respect to Iraq's future, but now we need our  friends. As the Orientals that we are, we never forget those who  are with us in difficult moments,"" Mubarak added.    Although the UN embargo allows Iraq to import medicines and  other civil goods essential for the population, the prohibition  against oil exports leaves Iraq without the hard currency needed  to pay for such imports. The funds that were frozen in several  Western countries under the embargo--with the exception of those  related to oil and its derivatives, which were transferred into  a UN account--have been slowly unfrozen to pay for exports of  goods of humanitarian nature, and in many cases these funds have  been exhausted.    According to Mubarak, there are more than 1.5 billion  pesetas  still frozen in Spain. The Iraqi Embassy in Spain reduces that  figure to ""some 300 million pesetas,"" belonging to two Iraqi  banks. And Jose Ramon Baranano, assistant director of the  Spanish Foreign Ministry's International Economic Relations  Section, asserts that Iraq ""now has not a single frozen peseta  left in Spain.""    Searching for Formulas    With or without funds, what the Iraqi government suggests is  that Spain ""find formulas, because they do exist, to prevent  suffering by the Iraqi population."" ""We do not want to  manufacture weapons, we want to keep people from dying,"" asserts  the minister of health.    Data compiled by UNICEF are hair-raising: Infant mortality  has tripled; 80 percent of the children are born with less than  normal weight because of the mother's malnutrition. Hospital  occupancy has dropped to approximately 30 percent. ""Without  medical supplies, people do better remaining home."" And of the  200 ambulances existing in 1990, only 37 throughout the country  are in operation. ""We have run out of tires and batteries, and  as one breaks down, we use its parts to fix another.""    The Spanish Government says that it ""understands"" Iraq's  problems, but argues that the Security Council allows no margin  of maneuver whatever, forbidding any type of credit, even if it  is for humanitarian reasons. Diplomatic sources assert: ""We are  complying with UN regulations, and we hope that Iraq continues  to show its willingness to cooperate, as it has been doing  lately, so that the embargo may be lifted the soonest possible.""    Fearing that the United States may veto the lifting of the  embargo even though it may be fulfilling the requirements of UN  resolution 687 (forbidding Iraq to sell oil until the UN  ascertains the dismantling of its mass-destruction arsenal, and  to install an anti-arms warning system), Baghdad meanwhile is  seeking alternatives and is offering ""large future  compensations"" to those enterprises that may take the chance of  ""delivering today and collecting tomorrow.""    ""We have already signed some substantial agreements with  several European enterprises. Spanish companies should not lose  this opportunity to cash in on lucrative profits in a not too  distant future,"" says Umid Midhat Mubarak.     "

'For ten years and more 'environment and development' has been on everybody's lips but despite all the talk we find there is no hard scientific evidence for any real improvement,' he declared. Last night it emerged that Ms Elizabeth Dowdeswell, assistant deputy environment minister in Canada, will take over in January from Dr Tolba, who is stepping down after 16 years. Dr Tolba's speech, which fiercely attacked the ineffectiveness of the Rio Earth Summit in June, accompanied Unep's report on the world environment since 1972. Last night ministers from UN countries began flying to Nairobi to mark Unep's 20th anniversary. Despite Dr Tolba's pessimistic comments, Unep's 800-page report finds encouragement in the measures industrialised countries have taken to curb pollution. In the US, Canada and western Germany, carbon monoxide emissions, mainly from traffic, fell by more than 25 per cent between the mid-1970s and the late 1980s.

CONSERVATION  GROUPS WANT THE NEW DENVER FACILITY TO FORM A NATURE SANCTUARY.      By STEVEN K. PAULSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS      DENVER      A pair of bald eagles is on a collision course with Denver's new $2.3-billion  airport, and conservationists say the eagles and 330 other bird species that  nest at Barr Lake State Park could be in danger.    Conservationists and wildlife officials want Denver International Airport to  establish a buffer-zone nature sanctuary to prevent houses, offices and shops  from sprouting up on its northwestern fringes near Barr Lake.    The airport, which opens in 1993, will not pay.    ""We don't feel we should,"" said airport director Bill Smith. ""We aren't adding  anything to the problems in the area, and we're not increasing any problems  that exist.""    Wildlife experts are surprised that the birds chose to nest just 18 miles from  downtown Denver, and 3 miles northwest of the airport.    The eagles were the first on record to nest and to colonize on the Rocky  Mountains' eastern slopes in 1986. Previously, the eastern Colorado Front Range  served only as a resting stop for eagles migrating south from Canada toward  Mexico, New Mexico and Texas for the winter.    The birth of two eaglets last year drew numerous bird watchers. The eaglets  later flew off, and wildlife officials are hopeful they will soon return to  nest.    ""There are only 10 bald eagle nesting sites in the whole state, and only one  along the Front Range,"" said Mike Carter, director of the Colorado Bird  Observatory. ""Don't airport officials understand the principle of the straw  that broke the camel's back?""    Carter worried that the airport will destroy a unique opportunity for the  endangered bald eagles to grab a foothold if it refuses to help out.    If the worst happens, the construction of the airport's fringe developments  would at least enable observers to document the destruction of a bird refuge,  he said.    ""There have been very few studies with 80 to 90 years of records, and this  could be our first chance to document these changes,"" Carter said. ""I don't see  that as a benefit. This could destroy 100 years worth of resources.""    The airport already has concluded in a $35,000 study that, because of the  airport's noise regulations, incoming planes will not pose a threat. But  construction near Barr Lake may drive the birds away, Carter said.    Barr Lake Park is made up of 2,000 acres of water and two narrow strips of land  on each side that measure 700 acres. Wildlife records from the area have been  kept since 1909, and 330 species are documented.    Warning signs prohibit entry to the eagles' nesting area, and violators face a  $20,000 fine and a year's imprisonment. But outdoors enthusiasts can cross a  narrow ridge and watch the birds through binoculars.    The Denver Audubon Society and Colorado Department of Natural Resources want  the airport to put aside some of its discretionary funds for wildlife  conservation to buy a 2,000-acre buffer zone around the lake, or buy  development rights to prevent construction there.    The land's cost has not been determined.    ""All the buffer zone will do is keep developers away from the lake,"" said its  chairwoman, Polly Reetz. ""In addition to the eagles, we have a lot of animals  that move in and out, and raptors that hunt in fields adjacent to the park.""    Carter, of the Colorado Bird Observatory, would prefer a wildlife sanctuary on  the airport grounds, a 2,000-foot-wide zone stretching from the airport to the  nearby Rocky Mountain Arsenal, which already serves as a wildlife refuge.    Denver planners are negotiating with the Army, which owns the arsenal, to move  fences and allow bike trails in the area to take advantage of arsenal wildlife,  which include antelope, deer and coyotes.    The airport is being constructed to replace Denver's Stapleton International,  one of the nation's busiest. It will occupy 50 square miles, and its main  terminal will be heavily landscaped with greenery to promote the image of an  oasis on the plains. Indoor waterfalls and fountains also are planned.    Carter said that without action, development will occur around the lake because  of plans to complete a beltway around Denver. But he thinks the state and  conservation groups should share with the airport the cost of protecting the  birds and other wildlife.

However, the Panamanian head of state denied Italian reports  that arrests were made in his country in connection with the  ""Unigold"" operation, which on Wednesday destroyed a network that  laundered $100 million monthly from the sale of Colombian  cocaine in the United States through large amounts of gold sent  to Panama.    In statements to EFE, Endara said that according to the  security reports he has received, an international operation was  conducted with the participation of Italian police, and although  Panama ""was not directly involved, it was kept informed of the  situation by other agencies.""    The cooperation, Endara added, was ""at the level of  information,"" which the Italians did not request directly but  received through unidentified organizations.    Endara said he does not believe that these kinds of  drug-related activities affect the international image of  Panama, whose international banking system and Free Trade Zone  have been considered by U.S. counternarcotics experts as ""very  vulnerable"" to money laundering.    ""This happens in all countries, and we always cooperate when  asked,"" the president stressed.    According to reports by authorities, the network dismantled  in Italy was led by Colombian citizen Gustavo Jesus Upegui  Delgado, former accountant of late Medellin Cartel chief Pablo  Escobar and currently one of the main financial leaders of the  ""Cali Cartel."" Upegui has been arrested in Vicenza (northeast  part of the country). Seven Italian businessmen were arrested in  Vicenza and Arezzo on charges of participating in the money  ""laundering"" network.    Reports from Italy said that four other unidentified people  were arrested in Panama, but Endara asserted that no arrests had  been made in his country in connection with the ""Unigold""  operation.    Italian authorities began the investigation last June after  receiving a lead from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA).    According to reports from Italy, the dismantled gang used  ""narcodollars"" to buy some 1,000 kg of gold bars per month,  which were sent to Panama, where they were resold and the  ""laundered"" money wired to the Cali Cartel in Colombia.    Alessandro Pansa, director of the operation and one of the  individuals responsible for the Central Operation Center of  Italy's Criminal Police, said in his country that the  trafficking operations were so large that they threatened to  alter the gold market.    Endara said that unlike other countries, Panama does not  control the sale of gold, which ""comes and goes without a  problem.""    Italian investigators identified three corporations, all  based in Arezzo, as the owners of bank accounts where the  ""narcodollars"" were sent. The corporations are Simar Joyeros  Mayoristas, which has an outlet in Panama, Aurea Trading  International, and Eurocatene.    Panamanian sources at Simar Joyeros Mayoristas told EFE that  their corporation had not participated in any drug money  laundering operation, that no employee had been arrested, and  that last year an investigation conducted by the Panamanian  Customs Directorate cast no doubts on the corporation's  activities.    According to government sources, the jewelry corporation in  Panama is owned by Saul Schwartz, a Jewish businessman who on 1  June was kidnapped under strange circumstances by unidentified  individuals who released him uninjured after an unspecified  ransom was paid through a rabbi.

The Munich-based insurer said the Berlin authorities' objections to the shareholding in the bank - and to its business relations with the bank  - were without foundation. The cartel office delivered its detailed objections to Allianz and Dresdner  -two of Germany's most powerful institutions - on Tuesday night. These were the conclusions of a study started last summer when it emerged that Allianz had taken its stake in the bank to more than 22 per cent, up from a hitherto disclosed 10 per cent. The authorities have made two specific objections to Allianz's relations with Dresdner. They want Allianz to cut its direct holding in the bank from 22.3 to 19.1 per cent, and they do not want it to proceed with plans to establish a joint marketing strategy in Germany's new Bundeslander. Ideally the authorities would like the agreement in the west to be unscrambled as well. Berlin wants the stake cut to 19.1 per cent as it believes that only at this level will Allianz stop having considerable influence over the bank's commercial strategy.

The group, assembled by the Commissariat du Plan, the French government think-tank, issued a report calling for 'an informal Emu among the hard-core countries' of the present European Monetary System. This could start once the Maastricht treaty was ratified, and take the form of 'semi-institutional' agreements by the hard-core countries to stabilise their currency parities, the study said. Mr Jean-Michel Charpin, senior economist at the BNP bank who presided over the group study, said last September's monetary crisis had sown serious doubts in the markets about Emu's feasibility. These doubts could only be removed by a new initiative, he said. Creating a network of specially close monetary co-operation between some EC states would not be contrary to the Maastricht treaty, and could be achieved within the framework of the European Monetary Institute to be set up under the treaty, the report claimed. The report reflects similar sentiments inside the French presidency and in the opposition, which has pledged to give autonomous status to the Banque de France soon after its expected election victory this month. But, in contrast to the economists, most French politicians do not want to say anything in public which could jeopardise ratification of the Maastricht pact in Denmark and Britain.

The two have for some time been in talks over the terms of their joint venture: it will be handled by Siemens' air traffic control management division and by its French partner's defence and control systems subsidiary. Europe air traffic is notoriously congested. Officials at the Inter-national Air Transport Association (Iata) have warned that the network faces 'meltdown' in which a technical hitch could lead to delays bad enough to leave pilots aircraft stranded at the wrong airports. Iata and Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based body responsible for co-ordinating air traffic control across the continent, are working together to establish an improved air traffic control system by 1995-6. Siemens and Thomson-CSF are likely to face stiff competition for the contract from IBM, the US computer company. The initial contract, estimated to be worth FFr500m (Pounds 52m), involves supplying 500 work stations for the air traffic controllers under the aegis of Eurocontrol. The long-term project could be worth between FFr10bn and FFr20bn over the next 10 to 15 years. Thomson-CSF has won contracts recently for air traffic control equipment at Athens airport and in the Commonwealth of Independent States.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

The company, based at Stocksbridge near Sheffield, is Europe's leading manufacturer of engineering steels used by the automotive, energy, power generation, aerospace and general engineering markets. Its announcement comes 10 days after British Steel said it was raising the list prices of its strip products by between 7 per cent and 10 per cent from January 1. UES Steels said carbon and alloy prices were set to rise at least 10 per cent, with minimum increases of 12 per cent for spring steels. Stainless prices would rise at least 7 per cent. Mr Martin Howell, commercial director, said: 'We anticipate that there will be further increases in the course of 1995. It is vital that the steel industry as a whole achieves the price increases it is seeking in order for the efficient European producers to retun to profitability.' Along with British Steel, UES Steels is trying to take advantage of the recent increased demand for steel.

JAERI explained the results of its research to the Japan  Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC).    The plutonium from dismantlement, which is said to be about  200 tons, is about 94 Pu239, and whether to utilize this  for  peaceful uses or put them under storage and control has become a  topic of international debate. Since JAERI's once-through type  fuel can be manufactured easily in existing fuel fabrication  plants without dilution, and almost 100 of the Pu239 can  be  annihilated without building a separate mono-fuel combustion  reactor, it probably will draw international interest as well.    JAERI emphasized three points in its research: (1) the fuel  should be once-through type, and the spent fuel should become  high level waste while kept in coated pipes and not have to be  reprocessed or solidified; (2) from the viewpoint of stability  of waste and use of fuel manufacturing technology, the fuel  should be an oxide base; and (3) for purposes of safety, the  fusion point of the fuel should be 2,000 or more.    From this viewpoint, two types of ""fluorite oxide fuel"" have  been nominated for a fuel with irradiation stability and fission  product solid solubility and stability: (1) Thoria base  (compound of plutonium, thorium and alumina) and (2)  zirconia-gadolinia base (compound of plutonium, zirconium,  gadolinium and alumina). Data showing that 99  annihilation of  nuclear weapon grade Pu239 at about 60,000 MWD/ton burnup was  achieved for both types. In terms of void coefficient, however,  the thoria base fuel was negative, whereas the  zirconia-gadolinia base fuel was positive (or greater excess  reaction).    With this fuel, to increase plutonium burnup, the greater  the  proportion of cooling water to the cubic volume of reactor fuel  the better. Therefore, existing LWRs with a 1.9 ratio or the  VVER-1000 are better than fast reactors, and because fast  reactors also have the characteristic of not burning up Pu239,  the LWR is more advantageous in practical application of this  fuel. Although a high-temperature gas reactor could be used, its  plutonium load is about 2 tons, and it cannot burn more than the  LWR's 6 tons.    Moreover, with once-through fuel, the spent fuel has more  weathering stability than glassified waste after reprocessing,  and can be buried as is (radioactivity is about the same). It is  also maintained that this fuel can be manufactured in existing  facilities because it is an oxide.    JAERI already has completed the basic study, and plans to  continue research to find the optimum composition for the fuel.    The purpose of the once-through type fuel is burnup and  annihilation of high-grade (94 pure) plutonium, and it  is not  directly applicable to Japan's fuel recycling system. However,  the Science and Technology Agency is hoping that this effective  technology will be ""one option"" for the peaceful use of  plutonium from dismantlement, however. JAERI plans to unveil it  at the ""7th international conference on innovative nuclear  energy systems,"" which will begin on 20 September at the  Makuhari in Tokyo.     "

Although VW's consensual style enabled it to grow into the biggest European car manufacturer, it has lately stifled its response to the industry's rapidly-changing dynamics. VW's failure to change out-dated working practices has left it perilously exposed as Europe's car market lurches downwards. Its European sales could fall by 340,000 units this year. VW's new chief executive, Mr Ferdinand Piech, has signalled a fearsome intent to tackle VW's problems head-on. He has been assembling a strong management team, although the last minute failure to appoint Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who was credited with turning round General Motors' European operations, is a big setback. There may be old-guard departures at senior level, but what matters most tomorrow is whether Mr Piech can at last produce a concrete plan for quickly cutting labour costs. Only that will show whether he has persuaded the trade union and regional government officials on VW's board of the need for drastic redundancies. The sense of crisis at VW may be his greatest ally. Unlike many of its rivals, VW's balance sheet is in reasonable shape. German car sales may fall 20 per cent this year, but they would still exceed those of 1990.

The promise of an upturn in advertising spend, the high operational gearing of many companies, television bids, and racy headlines about the wonders of multimedia have fuelled demand for media stocks. But the rise has been somewhat indiscriminate. It now appears there are some worrying cross-currents in the wind for printed as opposed to electronic media stocks. Recent media groups to have reported, such as Reed Elsevier and Mirror Group Newspapers, have seen little or no top line sales growth. Big paper producers, such as Arjo Wiggins Appleton, MoDo, and SCA have also been talking excitedly about the possibility of pushing prices higher. Demand for paper is increasing as Europe's economies claw their way out of recession. The pick-up in UK advertising has already been translated into fatter newspapers. Merchants are restocking in the belief that the paper cycle has turned. Utilisation rates in many paper mills seem set to climb to more than 90 per cent. Fine papers for magazines have already experienced strong price rises this year. Newsprint prices, too, appear to be pushing upwards - or, at least, discounts are being reduced. Many publishers have locked into fixed price contracts for newsprint for months ahead.

It calculates that the average income of the bottom fifth of households fell from Pounds 3,442 in 1979 to Pounds 3,282 in 1989 at that year's prices. The average income of the top fifth rose over the same period from Pounds 20,138 to Pounds 28,124. One reason for the increased gap is changes to the tax and social security systems, a report from the unit says. Most of the benefit of income-tax cuts went to taxpayers at the top of the scale, while increases in indirect taxes such as value added tax and National Insurance have been borne by low-income families. The report says the number of adults earning less than the Council of Europe's 'decency threshold' increased during the 1980s from 7.8m, or 38 per cent of the workforce, to 10m, or 47 per cent. The 'decency threshold' defines low pay as 68 per cent of the mean earnings of full-time workers. The unit argues for a national minimum wage. Poor Britain.

The Finnish group, one of Europe's few profitable steel-makers, reaffirmed an earlier forecast that it would achieve an improvement in full-year profits over the full-year surplus of FM144m achieved last year. It said sales in the first four months grew to FM2.4bn from FM2.2bn, while operating profit surged to FM288m from a loss last time of FM154m. The group cited stronger demand in Finland, Scandinavia and the US, and higher prices in both export and home markets. Rautaruukki, which concentrates on flat steel products, said the growth in demand was expected to continue in Finland and Scandinavia, where economic recovery is under way after several years of recession. Prices were also expected to go on rising, although the pace of increase was slowing. Profits growth would depend partly on lower financing costs and cost savings. The group raised FM792m earlier this year through a global share offering, which led the Finnish state's holding in the company to drop to 68.7 per cent from 81.1 per cent.

The message which emerges is clear - if you can enhance value for each of these 'stakeholder' groups you will earn a prize. But if you can use the principle of value enhancement to drive all your operational, investment, and financial decisions then you will earn the glittering prize. Enhancing value for its stakeholders is one principle that drives MS. 'Value for money' is delivered to the customer by a business strategy that creates the greatest cash value for the shareholder. The recent 'outstanding value' sales campaign exemplifies MS's ability to meet the needs of both customers and stakeholders: it raised turnover by 10 per cent, year-on-year, without an apparent reduction in margins. Higher returns, lower risk and more rapid growth are used by Percy Barnevik and his team at ABB to create value for their stakeholders. Shareholders benefit from a continuous push into growth markets, a focus on reducing fixed costs and reductions in net debt. Customers receive an unusually high level of customer service; and employees benefit from the devolution of responsibility which is a hallmark of Barnevik's strategy. MS and ABB have distinctive leadership and management styles which receive much praise from their peers. Their success highlights the message that delivering value to stakeholders is intrinsically linked to sound management. In ABB's case, this is a decisive vote for the company's 'matrix' management structure, which allows Barnevik to manage a business with 200,000 employees from a head office of only 150 people. Top management must not only allocate resources and resolve conflicts, but also create a common purpose, challenge the status quo and stimulate corporate renewal. Elsewhere in the rankings, information technology has propelled Reuters into the 'most admired' category. Some 90 per cent of the group's revenue now comes from financial information and transaction products. Reuters' dominant position in the dealing rooms of the world's financial centres has been gained through aggressive acquisitions, strong market positioning, advanced products and buoyant cash generation. It is a recipe for gaining and retaining the commitment of the company's stakeholders. Shell's positive attitude to its stakeholders has also received strong endorsement in the survey. The company's position is strengthened by strict debt control and commitment to targets of 14 per cent return on capital employed and and 12 per cent return on investment. British Airways' customer service record helped make it the overall winner in the transport sector. BA is also committed to its employees: mechanisms such as regular employee surveys give staff a say in how the business is run. At Unilever, co-chairman Sir Michael Perry says shareholder value is high on his list of priorities. The group's strategy - attacking the cost base, focusing corporate resources more tightly, and innovating in brands - earns it strong endorsement from its peers in the food and drinks sector. Brands are also essential to BMW, which tops the automotive sector. Its brand image of high quality and high performance is a symbol of its commitment to its customers. Brand strategy will be the key to its relationship with newly-acquired Rover - the two brands will be kept distinct and will be developed independently. BMW may be a better-known brand, but Siemens is German industry's bellweather. Many of its divisions operate in depressed markets, and the growth rate of its biggest market, telecoms, will slacken as the initial stages of wiring up East Germany are completed. But the company retains the admiration of its competitors in the electronics sector. In the banking sector Deutsche Bank is most respected by its peers for its overall business performance and market leadership. With over half its shareholders outside Germany, and with strong local subsidiaries in in Spain, the UK and Italy, Deutsche Bank must successfully address the interests of a wide-spread group of European stakeholders. The message of the survey is that the most successful top managements now judge their business decisions by the value that they create, and that they are judged in turn by their ability to deliver value to their stakeholders. For those who wish to join the select ranks of Europe's most respected companies, the message is equally clear: to aspire to this list, you must identify the key factors that add value to your business, and make them work for you.

However, it has once again served to highlight Europe's  comparative impotence in dealing with Tokyo on matters of trade.  In a concerted bid to break into Japan's obdurate business  culture, Washington has threatened Japan with trade sanctions if  it fails to reform the bidding process by which it has  historically excluded foreign contractors.    In an eleventh-hour move last week, the government of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced a plan to increase the  openness and fairness of its construction market. The  concession comes on the eve of further US-Japan bilateral trade  negotiations next month at which Washington will press Japan to  open its markets to American cars and components and provide  greater access for its semiconductor manufacturers.    Progress on these and other trade-related matters are being  closely monitored by the European Union [EU],which faces similar  problems in its relations with Japan.    Despite the illusion of unity created by a single market,  however, the interests of the Union's 12 member states are still  far too diverse and uncoordinated for any comparable moves by  Brussels. Playing governments off against each other is an old  Japanese sport to which there is really only one solution: total  European union. The difficulty in achieving a more unified  stance is that while some countries seek protection from  Japanese imports, others are eager to attract Japanese  investment.    Yet Washington's problems of greater market access and a  huge  trade imbalance with Japan are no less real for the economies of  the European Union. This has seen the Union's trade deficit  increase from $18.5 billion in 1990 to $31.2 billion in 1992  which, despite a small improvement in 1993, is equivalent to 3.2  per cent of Japan's economic output. Indeed, a feeling persists  among many Union manufacturers that Japan still tends to favour  US exporters to the detriment of Europe.    ""If Airbus Industrie has achieved a 30 per cent share of the  world civil aircraft market,"" asks Bernhard Salzer, chairman of  the European Parliament's trade delegation to Japan, ""why is the  corresponding share in Japan only ten per cent? And why has  Rolls-Royce sold no aircraft engines in Japan since 1970?""    Japan is a master at denying foreign firms access to its  local markets. The techniques employed in targeting the  economies of so-called trading partners while simultaneously  protecting their own have varied from the unwritten  ""administrative guidelines"" issued by the much-vaunted Ministry  of International Trade and Industry (MITI), to the spoiling  tactics of an overzealous customs service.    Every embassy in Tokyo has its own favourite tales of the  ruses employed by Japan and its compliant bureaucracy at denying  foreign companies the right of entry to the world's second  largest economy. Through the pretence of language difficulties,  cultural misunderstandings and the invisible hand of government  officials dedicated to keeping foreign companies out, Japan has  long enjoyed the dual benefits of a protected domestic economy  coupled with easy access to most foreign ones.    Through its mission in Tokyo, the European Commission  battles  for reforms and the removal of these obstacles which, says the  Union's chief trade negotiator Sir Leon Brittan, ""are simply  unacceptable in an open trading system"".    The most frequent complaint of European companies is the  over-dependence of Japanese companies and government agencies on  traditional suppliers -- usually Japanese -- and the refusal to  explore the possibility of working with new ones. Others point  to the long list of excluded sectors and exemptions contained in  the country's anti-monopoly law and to its over-burdensome  regulations.    Prior to Kantor's recent successes, these have been  particularly marked in the area of public procurement.  According to the Commission, there are specific procedural  obstacles for foreign companies -- most notably the system of  prequalification and the demands for very high guarantees --  which effectively exclude foreign companies.    As the pressure on Japan to adopt more liberal trading  practices has mounted down the years, its exclusion techniques  have become more sophisticated and obtuse. The major hotels of  downtown Tokyo have grown rich on the steady stream of foreign  businessmen and government delegations attending this or that  trade conference seeking ways of penetrating Japan's invisible  trade barriers.    Creating joint committees and working groups to investigate  trade and protectionist grievances is a stalling tactic well  known to anyone acquainted with the intractable problems of  doing business with Japan. While the world is now a little  wiser to these ploys, it is remarkable how many gaijins  (foreigners) succumb to the charms of Japanese hospitality and  still come away believing they have wrung concessions from their  hosts.    ""It can be depressing to look at the past,"" notes the EC's  chief trade negotiator. ""Over the past 15 years, Japan has  pushed through a total of 13 economic packages to stimulate  growth and reduce the trade imbalance. And yet the surplus has  barely diminished. In 1992, it represented 3.2 per cent of  Japanese gross domestic product (GDP) and was over 3.5 per cent  of GDP in early 1993.""    As Europe's trade deficit with Japan hit a new high of $35  billion in 1990, the Union demanded that Tokyo take immediate  steps to reduce this lopsided situation by opening its markets  to European exporters and removing the barriers that frustrate  commerce. The outcome of subsequent EC-Japan talks in July 1991  was another classic piece of highminded diplomatic rhetoric  backed by little substance which, say critics, will probably  achieve very little.    After more than two years of ""co-operation and partnership"",  the reality is still a yawning chasm in trade volumes as  Japanese ships dump huge quantities of manufactured goods at  European ports and return home with Plimsoll lines well above  sea level.    Taking inter-dependence to its logical conclusion, insists  Brittan, the 20 million unemployed in Europe are as much Japan's  problems as they are Europe's.    As Japan's economic fortunes wane and recession bites  deeper,  however, there are signs of greater understanding and humility  from the Tokyo side. Once quick to dismiss trade difficulties  as more about the inability of foreign firms to understand  Japanese markets and meet the high standards of the Japanese  consumer, the beleagured Hosokawa government has already shown a  greater willingness to address some of these longstanding  grievances than most of its predecessors.    For Europe, the creation of a single market is also helping  the EU to organise a framework of contacts and an agenda for  negotiations with Japan. Inevitably, such efforts continue to  focus on trade where -- although recession in Europe and a  strong yen have temporarily arrested the slide -- the underlying  imbalance continues to exacerbate relations between the two side.    Unlike the US's tougher line, the Commission is adopting a  softer, less confrontational approach in the hope of benefiting  from the new political mood now pervading Japan. Known as the  trade assessment mechanism (TAM), it focuses less on questions  of market share in given industrial sectors and more on a joint  EC-Japan analysis of specific products and how they perform.    ""The idea,"" explains the Commission's Tokyo spokesman Gerard  Legris, ""is to detect products which do not enjoy the same  market share in Japan as elsewhere. Selection is on statistical  criteria rather than partisan interest and aims to provide a  representative basket.    ""Having mutually agreed those areas or products,"" he adds,  ""we then analyse the factors behind this poor showing. It may  well be that the fault lies with Europe, or it may be with the  Japanese.""    The Commission hopes this will allow both sides to identify  trouble spots and agree remedial steps. It also believes this  pianissimo approach is essential if the Commission is to gain  the cooperation of Japanese ministries and avoid tying the  exercise to the specific problems of individual companies.  Several TAM meetings have already occurred in Brussels and  Tokyo and their findings are due to be discussed at the next  round of EU-Japan ministerial meetings.    Once again, Japan's priority is on the US dispute in  readiness for the Hosokawa-Clinton summit on 11 February with no  date agreed for the European talks. Are Europe's interests,  therefore, once again playing second fiddle to Washington's?    The strategy of a country which produces 16 per cent of  global GNP but attracts only one per cent of direct foreign  investment has never been hard to fathom. Europe must learn  that, to the Confucian mind, a paper tiger poses no threat.     "

The company also announced the issue of a Pounds 100m mortgage debenture, primarily to pay for the Trocadero Centre in London's West End, which was purchased over the summer. Turnover showed a similar increase, rising from Pounds 5.11m in the same period last year to Pounds 11.5m. Earnings per share advanced by a more modest 34 per cent to 1.6p (1.19p), reflecting February's Pounds 100m rights issue. Besides the Trocadero deal, which cost Pounds 94m, Burford spent Pounds 103m on a commercial property portfolio from Ladbroke during the first half. Together with some smaller deals, Burford estimates that its annualised rental roll will be Pounds 35m at the end of the financial year, double its expectation a year ago. Rental income at the interim stage had increased from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 10.8m. Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said the refurbishment of the Trocadero, on one of Europe's busiest thoroughfares at Piccadilly Circus, would begin as soon as the company took possession later this month. The company intended to strengthen the centre's entertainment facilities, taking advantage of its vacant 120,000 sq ft of office space. He estimated the refurbishment cost at about Pounds 7m.

0,FT922-2286 ,"FT922-2286 _AN-CFRBNAAAFT 920618   FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building  Construction (1): Quietly flows the workload - In most European countries activity is declining as the recession bites. The outlook is likely to remain depressed, with little improvement next year. But one glimmer of light is that infrastructure spending is holding up      By ANDREW TAYLOR   THE GOOD times have ended for European construction. The heavy earth movers, tower cranes and mobile generators, which in the late 1980s gave some of Europe's biggest cities the appearance of one vast building site, are being switched off or dismantled. Construction output is flagging in many countries as economic recession and high interest rates have taken their toll on private investment in new offices, shops and industrial plant. Earnings of contractors and building material companies, as a result, are under pressure as order books and profit margins have declined and competition for a diminishing workload has increased. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Britain where a steady flow of developers, contractors and building material suppliers, including several publicly quoted companies, have been forced into the hands of receivers. Other companies which had embarked on speculative development have had to make large provisions as the value of residential and commercial property has fallen sharply. British construction groups may have come off worse in the recession, but other markets are also suffering. French contractors and building material companies which had expanded aggressively into other European countries, making expensive cross-border acquisitions, have been hit as these markets have gone into recession leaving the former predators themselves weak and vulnerable to takeover. The struggling Societe Auxiliare d'Entreprises was snapped up earlier this year by rival French construction group Fougerolle in a deal worth FFr4.6bn (Pounds 468m). Italcementi, Italy's largest cement company, recently bought control of Ciments Francais, France's second biggest cement for FFr6bn (Pounds 611m). Ciments Francais, in particular, had been very active in making cross-border acquisitions, leaving its balance sheet badly stretched as building output across Europe, including France, moved into reverse. French cement sales are forecast to fall by 5 per cent this year with domestic construction activity, particularly in the private sector, expected to stagnate after rising sharply in 1989 and 1990. Construction output in most northern European markets is likely to stand still or decline this year. Growth in Spain - until recently Europe's fastest rising construction market - is expected to slow markedly as a result of economic pressures and as big building programmes for the Barcelona Olympics and the World Trade Fair at Seville come to an end. Delegates attending today's conference in Helsinki held by Euro Construct, which represents European construction research agencies and economic forecasting bodies, will be told that the outlook for most European contractors and building material companies is likely to remain depressed with most countries expecting only a slight improvement in 1993. Even Germany, Europe's strongest construction market, expects growth to slow this year. The cost of integrating the former east German republic is placing an increasing burden on the domestic economy. As a result, building investment opportunities are being restricted in other parts of the country. In some European cities, over-development of offices has left too many empty buildings chasing too few tenants as companies have been shedding labour and closing unwanted premises. Financial services, which had expanded rapidly during the 1980s, has been particularly hit by the recession which has curtailed the activity of industrial and commercial clients. This is most apparent in London, one of Europe's biggest commercial property markets which, at its height in the late 1980s, attracted developers from all over the world, notably from Japan, Sweden and north America. Many of these companies are now regretting their enthusiasm for the British market as the value of their investments has plummeted. Olympia  York, the Canadian-based property developers owned by the Reichmann family, has been brought to its knees by the failure of its ill-fated Canary Wharf office development to attract sufficient tenants in London's former Docklands. The decision to place the development into administrative receivership threatens to cause further hardship to already beleaguered sub-contractors which have been working on the development. According to a report by the British National Economic Development Office (NEDO), about 33m sq ft of office space was either empty or available for occupation in London at the end of last year. This represented 16 per cent of the total office space of the capital and NEDO said it would take six years to occupy at normal letting rates of take-up. As a result, commercial construction in the UK is expected to fall by about a fifth this year and total construction by about 5 per cent. Forecasts to be published at the Euro Construct conference are expected to show falls in output, mostly of around 3 per cent, in the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Output in France, Italy and Belgium is likely to show little or no growth. In Germany and Spain growth rates are expected to dip sharply. There are some glimmers of light. Spending on infrastructure, particularly on transport, is holding up much better than private investment in residential and commercial property. The need for central and local government to make economies has curtailed some of the more ambitious proposals. Nonetheless, infrastructure spending is still rising in some countries although at a slower rate than previously. In the advanced economies of northern Europe there are plans to upgrade many motorways and to reduce congestion and speed the flow of goods and services by constructing high-speed rail links between main cities. If these plans go ahead, the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France will be a crucial link in a revitalised European rail network. In southern Europe the demand is for new construction to provide the roads and services which will allow rising economies to flourish. European construction companies and building material companies seeking to take advantage of new opportunities for work have been busy making acquisitions, taking stakes and forging strategic alliances with local companies mostly in Spain, but also in Greece and Portugal. The decision to remove barriers to free trade between European Community countries at the end of this year has also prompted a spate of cross-border mergers and stakes between between European contractors. French and German companies have been among the biggest spenders among contractors while British building material companies have built up commanding positions in the European roof tile, plasterboard, ready-mix concrete and glass industries. But not every acquisition has been a success. Some German and French companies have had a lean time of it since they bought into British groups at the height of the UK construction market in the late 1980s as the value of their investments has fallen sharply. Hochtief, the West German contractor, acquired a 25 per cent stake in Rush  Tompkins only to see the British construction and property company go into receivership in 1990. Companies such as Ciments Francais in France and Steetley, the British building materials group which made expensive cross-border acquisitions in the 1980s, have themselves been taken over. Steetley, which had become France's biggest aggregates producer earlier this year, fell prey to Redland, a rival British materials group and Europe's biggest roof tile manufacturer, after a bitterly contested fight . Latterly, European contractors and building materials companies have focused on making acquisitions and stake building in the former communist countries of eastern and central Europe. These have a big need for new construction if their fledgling market-driven economies are to thrive. The problem is not in identifying a need for new construction but in finding the money to pay for it.  The Financial Times   London Page 33  "

The Union of Industrial and Employers Confederations of  Europe (UNICE) said the way to economic recovery lay through  lowering the burden due to the state, improving labour  flexibility and boosting small business.    ""There can no longer be any question of imposing more  charges  on businessmen. They are sinking. They are no longer  competitive,"" UNICE president Francois Perigot said.    He presented a UNICE report entitled ""Making Europe More  Competitive"" which said that businessmen needed to wean  themselves away from state aid and that EU governments should  not depend on business to fund swollen welfare programmes.    The report called for deregulation and privatisation of such  government sectors as posts and telecommunications, energy and  transport, plus a more efficient public sector and more open  public procurement tenders.    It urged stricter conditions for unemployment, health and  other welfare handouts, along with a lower minimum wage, fewer  restrictions on dismissing workers, and pay rises pegged to  productivity.    Perigot rejected suggestions that governments should fund  welfare programmes from an energy tax.    ""For 30 years we have been continually expanding the sources  of (government) revenue without ever attacking spending,"" he  told a press conference.    UNICE's call came four days ahead of an EU leadership summit  on Friday and Saturday which will look for ways to cut  unemployment and boost Europe's declinin competitiveness against  the United States and Asia.

Once again the political reality of trade liberalisation against the background of world recession will ensure that the requisite domestic restructuring and consequent economic dislocation are neither affordable for the public purse nor politically acceptable at the ballot box. A change in agenda which enhances the international status of the Japanese, the only nation currently able to pump-prime world economic activity, is more likely to succeed than US pressure for managed trade and European pressure for immediate reductions in the Japanese trade surplus. Japanese industrial hegemony and the resultant Dollars 150bn forecast trade surplus may be a destabilising factor in world trade. The Japanese, however, are rightfully proud of their success post Hiroshima. They should not be publicly castigated, but rather shown a new agenda by the G7 leaders which requires Japan to shoulder its share of the cost of global security. Such an initiative would have the Japanese being applauded by the international community for their global statesmanship rather than hounded by our elected representatives because of Japanese industrial superiority. The end of the cold war and the defeat of the heavy hand of communism have brought a greater threat to world security than at any time since President Kennedy faced off the Soviets in the 1960s Cuban missile crisis. The cold war is over but Ukraine is sabre rattling, the nuclear missiles are still in place, the Black Sea fleet has yet to get clear direction and there are more than 20 nuclear reactors in Russia alone, which should be shut down immediately if more Chernobyls are to be averted. Surely this threat to global security is an agenda item which, in our own self-interests, should be the major focus of the G7; an item which national electorates can more readily understand than the dismantling of protective bilateral tariffs on spirits, rice, corn and textiles. The G7 nations have the capacity and the technology to assist the Commonwealth of Independent States in its basic needs and to underwrite global nuclear security, but not through World Bank strait-jackets and trade wars with the Japanese. By allocating geographical areas within the CIS to each G7 member we can move with the speed required to meet the immediacy of CIS needs. Such a programme needs a financial catalyst and the Japanese are in the position to shoulder the costs of materials and technology transfer. To succeed we need to create the agenda and ameliorate the mutual distrust of the Russians and the Japanese which is so manifest in such issues as the ownership of the Kurile Islands north of Japan. What should our elected leaders be pursuing - managed trade and Japanese humiliation or managed security and Japanese willing statesmanship in pump-priming world security and, through it, economic stability? For me, at least, and more importantly for the future of my children, I will vote for the latter. This is the necessary and legitimate contribution of our generation to securing world peace with the added dividend of stimulating world economic activity.

Mr. Major confirmed in the Commons last night that the  European summit in Brussels had agreed to repeal the 10-year-old  bathing and drinking water directives and replace them with less  intrusive regulations, enabling ``broad, general standards'' to  be applied at national level.    Seventeen EC directives have been withdrawn or amended in  the  purge of legislation, part of an Anglo-French initiative to  apply the principle of ``subsidiarity'' to laws which gave  Governments little flexibility.    Two key EC directives on water quality remain in force: one  aimed at reducing pollution from nitrates and another on urban  waste water treatment, which Mr. Clarke, Chancellor, said  recently would cost Britain 10 billion to implement  instead  of the original estimate of 2 billion.    According to Mr. Yeo, Environment Minister, water  bills--forecast to rise by up to 100 by the end of the  century in some areas--would now rise more slowly.    Mr. Major said other Governments were listing EC laws to  axe.  ``We are determined to maintain high standards, but we are  determined, too, to simplify European legislation, to make it  less intrusive and leave more room for national choice.''    However, officials stressed that the extent to which Britain  would be allowed to relax standards for drinking water was not  clear, as new directives had to be agreed in the spring.    ``We cannot repeal EC laws simply because we think the  standards are set too high,'' said one. ``The aim is to simplify  decision-making and meet the Maastricht Treaty requirements that  as much legislation as possible is conducted at national level  unless it can be shown that it would be more effective at EC  level.''    The cull of EC directives has been led by Mr. Major and Mr.  Clarke, against the advice of Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary,  who has said it would be politically unpopular to be seen  dismantling EC pollution controls.    Ministers argued yesterday that there would not be a fall in  Britain's standards.    Mr. Yeo said the Government would be using the new  flexibility to determine its own standards for drinking water,  incorporating the latest advice from the World Health  Organisation on relaxing the standard for some pesticides.  Britain provides water in excess of the present EC pesticides  standards to 14.5 million people. The WHO recommends, however, a  five-fold tightening of standards for lead, one of the most  toxic substances.    Mr. Yeo said: ``I see it as part of my job to protect  consumers against the extraordinary demands of some of the Green  lobbies, who have the Brussels bureaucrats totally in their  power and who are pressing ahead with demands for improvements  which have no scientific or medical basis at all.''    ``We do not want to waste money on things that have no  benefit to the consumer.''    Mr. Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, called the  legislative changes a disaster. ``This is a smokescreen for  saying the Government wants lower standards because they want  lower costs. What this represents is a major step away from the  fight against pollution.''    Mr. Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth,  said: ``The idea that the British Government can be trusted on  its own to ensure compliance with the highest standards to  protect the quality of our rivers or drinking water is a joke.''

Responding to whether Bolivia will follow Colombia's lead with  regard to the legalization of drug consumption, they stated on  10 May that this issue cannot--and should not--be considered  from a unilateral standpoint, but rather as a part of a general  context. The government rejects this because it wants to  prevent the country from becoming a ""Mecca"" for drug traffickers.    Both ministers seek to ward off the possibility that Bolivia  will embark on a legalization process, since--as Government  Minister German Quiroga pointed out--it would turn the country  into a ""Mecca for drug trafficking.""    Quiroga said: ""The trafficking issue must be assessed within  a general perspective rather than individually, as a nation. It  would be terribly dangerous if one country became the  traffickers Mecca. This is why we must be part of a general  approach, part of the measures adopted by all countries--both  producers and consumers.""    Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar termed the issue delicate  and pointed out that it must be solved by the international  community as a whole, as the community of nations is now  debating this issue.    The government minister--who holds more radical  ideas--voiced  his firm opposition to the decriminalization of cocaine as  Colombia proposed. He believes it would turn the country into  the ""Mecca"" for the production, consumption, and peddling of  psychotropic drugs and a place where drug kingpins would thrive.    Quiroga pointed out that the legalization of consumption  should be part of a consensus process and policy among several  countries. He added that it would be most inappropriate for  Bolivia to make a unilateral decision.    He stated that Colombia's stance on this issue should be  considered as ""leaving one's opponent unmarked and making a  false move"" which may have appalling consequences for that Latin  American country which may become the world's center of drug  consumption and distribution. He added: ""This is most  dangerous.""    Quiroga noted that one cannot favor the legalization of  drugs  on the premise that interdiction has allegedly failed, since the  two points are different, but at the same time are constituent  parts of a whole. Interdiction is a fundamental part that seeks  to track and punish traffickers while crop substitution programs  seek to devise economic solutions to solve the problem of  surplus coca production.    ""The two paths should run parallel: Interdiction should not  be conducted without crop substitution, nor should the latter  take place without drug enforcement. The two should be part of  an overall policy,"" he said.    Quiroga said Bolivia should coordinate with other countries  toward a coordinated action.    The government minister remarked that the country has  achieved very encouraging results in its struggle against  trafficking, even though it did not eradicate all surplus coca  plantations. He added that this subject is under discussion  with U.S. authorities.    Quiroga contended that aid for the balance of payments  should  not be exclusively linked to the reduction of coca crops, but  should also consider blows dealt to trafficking, the destruction  of maceration pits, the dismantling of laboratories, and the  number of drug gangs arrested.    He said: ""It is not just a question of destroying coca  crops,  it is a war against trafficking."" Quiroga also denied any  alleged pressure over the mandatory eradication of surplus  plantations and a reduction in economic aid toward the balance  of payments.     "
0,FT943-2815 ,"FT943-2815 _AN-EIRAQAAJFT 940917   FT  17 SEP 94 / EU action on textiles pact 'a travesty'      By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor   The European Union, the world's largest textiles and clothing importer, appears set to take only token steps to open its market when it starts implementing a landmark Uruguay Round accord to liberalise trade in the products from the start of next year. Though permissible under the Uruguay Round, the approach currently favoured in Brussels was described by one European government official yesterday as 'against the spirit of the Gatt.' The Uruguay Round agreement brings textiles and clothing for the first time under Gatt rules and commits the body's members to eliminate by 2006 the Multi-Fibre Arrangements, which tightly restrict the Dollars 240bn (Pounds 154bn) annual world trade in the products. Under the deal, countries have to subject at least 16 per cent of their textiles and clothing imports to Gatt disciplines in the next three years. This is the first of three phases in the planned dismantling of the 20-year-old MFA. However, the Commission is proposing - with apparent backing from most EU states - to carry out this commitment in a way which would leave the range of products covered by MFA quotas virtually unchanged until 1998. The Commission plans to do this by subjecting to Gatt rules products which are mostly exempt from MFA quotas. Many will be chosen from a list which includes items such as hats, umbrellas, car seat belts and parachutes, but excludes mass-market products such as cotton garments. The EU imported about Dollars 51bn of textiles and clothing products in 1992, mostly from developing countries. The World Development Movement, a Third World lobby group which has analysed the Commission proposals, estimates they would result in the EU lifting restrictions on only 0.1 per cent of products on which it imposes quotas. It said the EU's move was 'a travesty' of the agreement to phase out the MFA. Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark are pressing for a more liberal approach but are strongly opposed by southern European EU members, which have politically powerful textile industry lobbies. Gatt members must submit final proposals for implementing the accord to the organisation by October 1. The US, which also has many textiles quotas, has yet to announce how it plans to meet its Gatt commitment. But President Bill Clinton has said it will not move quickly to lift curbs, and many US textiles producers and importers believe his administration will adopt an approach similar to that of the EU. Countries which do not remove MFA quotas will nonetheless be required by the Gatt to gradually lift ceilings on imports covered by the restrictions. Japan and Switzerland are the only industrialised countries which do not impose MFA quotas. Though heavily influenced by domestic political motives, tough EU and US attitudes are partly intended to press developing countries to open their textiles and clothing markets. Officials in Geneva say the two trade powers are co-ordinating their efforts closely. Under the Uruguay Round, most developing countries are required to lower the often punitive tariffs they impose on imports. However, India and Pakistan, two of the world's leading textiles exporters, have so far balked at liberalising their import regimes. Producers in the US and Europe believe that they could sell large volumes of clothing to middle-class consumers in India and Pakistan if they had freer access to their markets.

Party chairman from 1983 to 1985, he had seemed consigned to a series of low-profile jobs in the Treasury, local government and agriculture. The move demonstrates his place as one of Mr John Major's political cronies and part of the 'East Anglia Mafia' - his Suffolk coastal constituency is close to Mr Major's, and he co-proposed Mr Major for prime minister. While environmental groups accuse Mr Gummer of having maintained an 'uneasy silence' on controversial issues such as river pollution, he claimed last year to be Europe's greenest agriculture minister. A fluent orator, he has a reputation for easily summoned indignation and for anti-permissive instincts - he quit the Church of England's general synod last year in protest at women priests. But he is known as an enthusiast, not a deep thinker. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary said: 'Gummer is a disastrously lightweight appointment - he will lack seriousness of purpose and lack clout in the cabinet.' Mr Gummer's move shows that the environment portfolio is low on the political agenda now that the council tax appears to have bedded down. He inherits tricky problems, however, particularly whether to approve British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield.

Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance minister, does not anticipate a stampede of foreign investors, but the conference might accomplish something more useful: the start of a much-needed dialogue between businessmen and government mandarins. 'We want to project Kenya's new image, but we also want to listen to the needs of investors and their suggestions for further reforms,' Mr Mudavadi says. The liberalisation measures of the past year have radically changed the operating environment for private enterprise. Import licences have been scrapped. Almost all government controls on foreign exchange transactions are gone. Exporters can keep their dollars and multinationals can repatriate profits without restrictions. All price controls, except those on petroleum products, have been dismantled. As a result, business confidence in Kenya is returning. A majority of multinationals polled by the East Africa Association say they have significant investment plans. Exporters and bankers are thriving in the newly deregulated environment, while local manufacturers have also taken advantage of the devaluation of the shilling to export to neighbouring countries. Kenya's exports rose by 15 per cent last year to Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 733m). After two years in the doldrums, the Kenyan economy may show some stirrings of growth in 1994. With Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya adopting converging economic policies, central bankers are now discussing the convertibility of their currencies to boost regional trade. Mr Mudavadi is guaranteed an enthusiastic reception at the investors' conference, if only because local businessmen know he needs all the support he can get. Inside government, the 33-year-old finance minister is fighting a formidable coalition of anti-reformers who resent the loss of patronage and opportunities for corruption his market-based reforms will fight. 'My fear is that the anti-reformers have so much to lose that they may go to any lengths to sabotage Mudavadi and his plans,' says a foreign executive in Nairobi. Having survived 18 difficult months in office, the young minister faces challenges far greater than economic deregulation. He must impose financial discipline on free-spending government ministries and a bankrupt parastatal sector which are fuelling inflation and creating a mountain of public debt. Kenya's annual inflation rate has risen above 50 per cent, while debt-servicing consumes 42 per cent of government expenditures. This leaves little room for paying salaries, let alone investing in Kenya's dilapidated infrastructure and social services. Politically unpalatable choices lie ahead, including the firing of thousands of civil servants in cities where one in three adults does not have a job. Mr Mudavadi plans to raise government revenues by improving the collection of import duties in the customs department. He is also trying to impose 'performance targets' on state corporations. But across the state sector, managerial skills are in short supply. Businessmen are advising Mr Mudavadi to tread cautiously: the scales are still too finely balanced between progress and a political backlash against reform. Mr Mudavadi, conscious of the fragility of his achievements, is not crying victory yet.   Countries:-  KEZ  Kenya, Africa.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.

'No improvement or even stabilisation in steel demand can be expected in the short term, nor is an improvement in the macroeconomic climate or in steel-consuming sectors on the cards,' it says. The 'working document' will be reviewed by EC industry ministers at their meeting in Brussels tomorrow, according to Reuters. The document provides a gloomy backdrop to the meeting, which will discuss the progress of the Commission-backed plan to restructure the industry. It confirms reports from the big steel producers, which say that demand for steel is still falling in Germany, Europe's biggest market. The only big market where steel demand is rising is the UK. The Commission's document says a major deterioration in sales on the EC market had only partly and temporarily been offset by an increase in exports, especially to China. It estimates that crude steel production in the EC will reach 125m tonnes in 1993, down about 10 per cent from 1991. 'The financial results of the undertakings will therefore be disappointing and in many cases they will make a loss in 1993,' it says. However, prices are up about 10 per cent from the beginning of 1993, partly because of reduced imports.

It is a much more precise description than talking about the establishment of a political union in Europe. We should not underestimate the magnitude of our job. And for one simple reason: the political and economic landscape in Europe has undergone significant changes. After the Gulf war it has become clear that the threats to our societies have diversified. We should no longer pay attention to the developments in the Soviet Union only. Crises in the Near and Middle East, mass-migration, world poverty and threats against the environment should be added to the list. Denmark considers the European Community to be the most important block on which to build our New Europe. It has a true magnetic pull. It is based on law. It is based on sound principles: basically shifting coalitions between member states - which make the national interests converge. Not a small achievement, considering Europe's past. At the inter-governmental conferences (IGC) we now have to sketch out a way towards an economic and monetary union (Emu) and towards a political union. Denmark has tabled proposals which show a way forward. Our goal is to widen and deepen the Community. We want to enlarge it with new member states: the Efta (European Free Trade Association) countries and countries in central and eastern Europe. We also want to strike a balance between growing internationalisation and regionalism. We want to shape a new relationship between the over-regulated society and market forces. Originally, the European Community was set up in order to promote and enhance French/German reconciliation. The goals were political, the means economic. History forces us to redress the former equation. We have to discuss how to handle the questions of a common foreign and security policy, of the European pillar in the defence of Europe. In essence, it is necessary to strike a proper balance between the European Community, WEU (Western European Union) and Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation). It is the Danish view that the common foreign and security policy should in principle extend to all aspects where unanimity can be achieved among the member states. Military co-operation proper should be undertaken within existing alliance structures with member states' present defence commitments being honoured. Member states should unanimously establish the common foreign and security policy. Denmark and the UK share the view that, whatever the outcome of the negotiations, one thing will remain certain: without Nato, European defence arrangements would lack credibility, nor would they inspire confidence in the remaining part of Europe. The strength of the security glue, which for 40 years has kept western Europe together, is being reduced. That is why we consider it a major goal to avoid a re-nationalisation of defence policies in the new European Architecture. Europe's voice in the New World Order should be strengthened - economically, politically and defence-wise. If we fail and leave a disproportion between Europe's economic strength and its political resourcefulness, we would also leave a Europe on dangerous tracks. The days are gone when it really made sense to talk about autonomy and sovereignty. The issue before us is about pooling resources. By strengthening international co-operation you necessarily limit your room for manoeuvre - but also for making mistakes. To drive my point home: an economic and monetary union makes it impossible for a member state to pursue a high inflationary policy coupled with successive devaluations. We consider Emu a necessity. To some extent it is a natural consequence of the liberalisation of capital movements. We want to go ahead with the project after sufficient economic convergence has taken place, primarily because you can reap all the benefits only in the third phase. Second, because we want to have a say in the decisions which, in any case, set the framework for our own national policies. What does Europe really need then? We need the right blend of visions and ideas - of prudence and pragmatism. Ideas should be far-reaching, but not out of step with reality. Otherwise they could backfire and create a credibility problem. It may seem odd to hear such words from a Danish foreign minister. After all, we have for some years been seen as footdraggers in the Community. But we have reversed our policy. I admit it without hesitation. We have learned some lessons, and we consider it imperative to strengthen the Community in order to create our New Europe in the New World Order.

GERMANY ADMITS IT HAS MISSILES BANNED BY TREATY      By ROBERT C. TOTH and JOHN BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      WASHINGTON      Dealing a potentially serious blow to confidence in U.S.-Soviet arms pacts,  East Germany acknowledged Wednesday that it has 24 previously undeclared  Soviet-made missiles that were banned by the 1987 medium-range missile treaty.    The East German government said that it will destroy the SS-23 missiles, which  are capable of carrying nuclear warheads but apparently were equipped with  conventional explosives or other non-nuclear devices. It said two launch  platforms were destroyed last month.    The Bush Administration, which discovered evidence of SS-23 components in East  Germany last week, has asked Moscow to explain how the Soviet-made missiles got  there and why they were not disclosed when information was exchanged on  missiles covered by the 1987 accord.    The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty called for elimination from  superpower arsenals of all missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,400 miles. The  SS-23 missiles have a range of 550 miles.    The East German SS-23s may not constitute a violation of the treaty, however,  if ownership of the weapons was transferred from the Soviet Union before the  pact took effect, because the agreement technically covers only U.S. and Soviet  weapons.

Lehman said it was ""premature"" to speculate on the impact of the disclosure on  the strategic arms treaty expected to be completed this year.

""The Soviets are going to look bad on this, even conniving,"" predicted a senior  U.S. official. ""Why didn't they come back to us on this earlier and say the  East Germans had these weapons, particularly after they made such a fuss over  the West Germans' Pershings during the negotiations?""    During the INF Treaty negotiations, Moscow demanded that the Pershing 1  missiles be dismantled because they fell within the banned missile range. The  United States argued that it did not own the weapons, but West Germany  unilaterally declared that it would destroy all 70 Pershing 1 missiles in its  arsenal to resolve the impasse.    In 1984 and 1985, the Soviet Union moved a number of SS-23s from its territory  into Czechoslovakia and East Germany in an effort to intimidate Western Europe.  Moscow had broken off arms talks and wanted the Continent to reject deployment  of U.S. Pershing 2 missiles.    At some point, ownership of the SS-23s stationed in East Germany apparently was  transferred to the government in East Berlin during the hard-line regime of  former East German Communist Party leader Erich Honecker, who resigned in  disgrace late last year.    The Soviets never announced that they had transferred possession of the  missiles to either country. The fate of the SS-23s in Czechoslovakia is  unclear.    The disclosure of the hidden missiles raises questions about the effectiveness  of U.S. surveillance efforts, which rely primarily on satellites to detect  undeclared missiles.

Total world scheduled airline passenger traffic will rise at an average annual rate of 6.6 per cent, indicating a 38 per cent increase in passengers by 1997, IATA forecast at a traffic outlook conference. This could well be double world economic growth in real terms. Cargo traffic is expected to rise at an average annual rate of 7.6 per cent. North American passenger growth will be 6.1 per cent and Europe's 5.9 per cent, reflecting more mature markets and persistent recessions, said Mr Michael Brown, senior forecaster. Eastern and central Europe will grow at 10.2 per cent, from a low base. Asia-Pacific growth is seens as averaging 7.5-8.5 per cent until 2000, based on surging economic growth, improving infrastructure and booming international trade, according to IATA figures. By 2001, Asia Pacific will account for 39 per cent of international scheduled passenger traffic. Latin America, with improving conditions in countries such as Chile and Argentina, should grow by nearly 8 per cent annually until 1997. Mr James Halstead, transport analyst with Swiss Bank Corp in London, said traffic growth through 2000 implies a 30 per cent increase in the world aircraft fleet. 'By 2010, the cost of re-equipment and fleet extension will reach Dollars 850m (Pounds 568m), against net book value of the present fleet of Dollars 125m. A few profitable global airlines will emerge, with a handful of good regional carriers and another group of state-supported airlines,' he said.   Countries:-  XLZ   East Europe.     XOZ  Asia.

He was also received by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.  Kinkel held joint consultations beforehand with Douglas Hurd  and Hikmet Cetin, his British and Turkish counterparts,.    Kinkel said in Ankara that Bonn backed cultural autonomy for  the Kurdish minority and firmly rejected frontier alterations in  the region. He spoke in favor of a stronger regional role for  Turkey, which was an important partner for Europe. Germany  supported Ankara's efforts on the path toward the European Union  (EU).    The meeting with Hurd and Cetin, which was organized at  Kinkel's initiative, also focused on developments in the  Balkans, the Caucasus, and Iraq. Kinkel said the talks  highlighted Turkey's special role in Europe's new security  structure at the frontier with Asia as well as between  Christianity and Islam.    Ankara would have to carry out domestic reforms in the field  of justice, for example, and still had ""a certain amount of  homework to do,"" Kinkel said. In this context, he drew  attention to the human rights situation, the Kurdish question,  and the fight against the banned militant separatist  organization PKK (Workers Party of Kurdistan), as well as to the  burden that Islamic fundamentalism posed for the NATO state  Turkey.    He reaffirmed Germany's obligation to look after almost 2  million Turks, who must not, however, be allowed to settle  political disputes on German soil. ""My party and I support dual  nationality as well as local election voting rights for  foreigners, including citizens from countries such as Turkey,  which are associate EU members,"" Kinkel said.

An official said the company had been considering increasing output at ferro-chrome and ferro-silicon smelters. But it was now reviewing the plan and might have to reduce capacity even for aluminium. Elkem consumes about 8.5bn MW/hours of electricity annually for light-metals production but on an annual basis it buys just 10 per cent of its electricity needs in the spot market. The remainder is supplied under long-term, fixed-rate contracts and from its own generating plants. Norway's electricity market has been undergoing reform during the past couple of years and is considered one of Europe's most liberal. Because of this the government has refused to intervene to stem rising prices. Energy analysts say prices have risen because of the unusually cold weather and speculation that electricity suppliers have not secured large enough trading agreements with neighbouring Sweden and Denmark to cover a shortfall in domestic production. The government said that it would allow the ceilings for imports of electricity to be lifted so that suppliers could cover any shortfall in domestic production. It has also consulted Swedish and Danish authorities on the issue. Average prices for electricity so far this year have been NKr0.18 a KWh, according to government figures, but have shot up in the past two days to around NKr0.48 during the day and NKr0.35.5 in the evening.

The move came as unionists - responding to a warning by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, that the IRA might in time return to violence under a new leadership - urged the government to make the IRA hand in its guns. Mr Adams, visiting the US, tried to qualify his remarks, made in an interview with the Boston Herald newspaper. He said he had been speaking hypothetically and did not believe that the peace process would fail. Mr Hume said last night that he was 'absolutely certain that the Provisional IRA has totally ended its campaign. I have no doubt that the campaign has totally finished'. His reception was for his part in bringing about the IRA ceasefire. It also emerged that the dominant socialist group at the Strasbourg assembly intends to get the parliament to nominate the SDLP's lone MEP for the Nobel Peace Prize. The parliament voted overwhelmingly for more aid and a cessation of violence by all paramilitaries in the province in order to reach a settlement which 'must earn the allegiance and agreement of all traditions' in Ulster. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party and also an MEP, was the sole dissenting voice in the debate. He reminded the parliament that the IRA had still not agreed to a 'permanent' ceasefire, and that Mr Adams had warned of a return to violence in three years if the IRA 'does not obtain satisfaction'. The vote was carried by 380 votes to five but Mr Paisley's four apparent supporters later contacted the parliament authorities to say that they had inadvertently pressed the wrong voting button. Mr Peter Schmidhuber, European Union commissioner in charge of the budget, welcomed the parliament's backing for increased funding. He said the commission proposed raising the EU's contribution to the International Fund for Ireland from the Ecu15m (Pounds 11.8m) a year it has contributed since 1989 to Ecu20m. The EU has already allocated Ecu1.23bn in structural aid to Northern Ireland for 1994-99 - up from Ecu1.07bn in 1989-93 - to develop infrastructure, research and development, training and small businesses. The emphasis of yesterday's debate was less on numbers than on reconciliation. Mrs Glenys Kinnock, the prominent Labour Euro-MP, was behind the effort to nominate Mr Hume for a Nobel Prize, never previous-ly attempted by the parliament. She was firmly against any attempt to include Mr Adams in the nomination and said it 'would not be appropriate now' for the Sinn Fein leader to address the parliament. Meanwhile, Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, urged the government to insist on the dismantling of the IRA's military machine and the surrendering of its weapons before Sinn Fein was allowed into the peace process. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, said Mr Adams' comments were entirely predictable. 'It was always envisaged that they would eventually . . . drop dark hints on resuming violence,' he said.

The move follows the recent rise in volatility in Germany's bond and stock markets. An official said the new margin requirement took effect yesterday, and would remain in force until further notice. 'The 30-day volatility in the bund future was higher than we had assumed under our worst-case scenario,' the DTB said. 'Last Thursday, the (March) contract closed 108 ticks below the previous day's close, while our worst-case scenario assumed a maximum move of only 100 ticks,' it said. Margins represent the collateral that an investor must deposit to secure an investment position. The DTB's margin on the bund future was raised to DM3,000 (the equivalent of a 120-tick move on the future) per contract from DM2,500 (100 ticks). The margin on the DAX future was increased to DM13,000 (130 index points) from DM11,000 (110 index points). Europe's other large exchanges are not envisaging similar moves. 'The exchange is not planning to change its initial margin on the bund future,' said a Liffe official, noting there was always the possibility of making intra-day margin calls at times of high volatility. Liffe's initial margin requirement on the bund future is currently DM2,000.

The stake has been purchased on the open market from Banco de Santander. A spokesman said that the Kuwait Investment Office, which owns 39 per cent of Ebro through Torras, its Spanish holding, planned to maintain its shareholding. It is understood that Mr de la Rosa, who is a close associate of Ebro's chief executive Mr Manuel Guasch, would continue buying into Ebro with the intention of acquiring 24.9 per cent, just short of the level that under Spain's stock market rules would force a full takeover bid. The development puts an end to speculation over the investment strategy chosen by Mr de la Rosa, one of the most active businessmen in Spain, as well as one of the wealthiest. Ebro, which is the dominant sugar company in Spain and the fifth largest in Europe, has moved aggressively to become Europe's leading rice producer following a string of acquisitions outside Spain. Its sales totalled Pta180bn last year. The company is poised to expand further through the acquisition of Elosua, the second largest domestic edible oils producer.

0,FT944-78 ,"FT944-78 _AN-FAAACACZFT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Kim Jong-il puzzle - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers)      By JOHN BURTON   When North Korea threatened to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in March 1993, Kim Jong-il, the 52-year-old son and heir of President Kim Il-sung, took public responsibility for the act that precipitated an international crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. Analysts debated the motives behind the decision. Some believed that North Korea was fearful that the International Atomic Energy Agency would discover the country's nuclear weapons capability as inspections became more intrusive. Others saw the action as a desperate attempt by an isolated and ailing North Korea to gain diplomatic recognition and economic aid from the US in return for its compliance with nuclear safeguards. Another explanation was that Kim needed to build his credibility as a strong leader and refute criticism by domestic rivals that he was not fit to succeed his charismatic father as the country's new head. After 18 months of tense diplomatic brinkmanship, Kim has apparently succeeded in achieving all these goals. Under an agreement reached with the US in October, North Korea was promised diplomatic ties with Washington and badly-needed energy supplies to revive its crippled economy in exchange for dismantling its current nuclear programme and accepting safer light-water reactors provided by an international consortium. Moreover, North Korea won as much as five years' breathing space before the IAEA is allowed access to several facilities that could disclose the full extent of the country's past nuclear activity. The deal, which was concluded three months after the death of his father, has also bolstered Kim's reputation. But it is still uncertain why he has not yet formerly succeeded his father as general secretary of the ruling Korean Workers' party and national president. North Korea is reaping other benefits from the agreement, including exploratory visits by foreign businessmen seeking to invest in the country. What is extraordinary is that the country, which had a very poor hand to play, was able to gain such results. Pyongyang, using bluff and intimidation, played on regional fears that if it was pushed too far, it would lash out. The US found that it lacked support from its Asian allies for a policy of confrontation, such as economic sanctions. The only realistic alternative was offering concessions to North Korea to persuade it to adhere to nuclear safeguards. Nonetheless, the nuclear deal could still become unstuck. North Korea has so far refused to resume political dialogue with South Korea, although it promised to do so under the accord. Pyongyang is hoping to isolate Seoul from its US ally in the same way that South Korea successfully weakened Russian and Chinese support for North Korea in the early 1990s. Continued refusal to negotiate with Seoul could jeopardise the agreement. The recent downing of a US army helicopter over North Korea has also cast at least a temporary shadow over the deal. More significantly, the agreement poses a potential threat to Kim's government in spite of the gains that it offers. The infusion of foreign investment and influence into North Korea's closed society could eventually undermine public support for the rigidly authoritarian state. Even if the nuclear agreement proceeds smoothly, Kim will still be engaged in a delicate balancing act to open his country without provoking social unrest.   Countries:-  KPZ  North Korea, Asia.

0,FT932-8571 ,"FT932-8571 _AN-DERDAAF8FT 930518   FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China appears ready to remove barriers against foreign miners      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   AFTER YEARS of procrastination, China at last appears willing to begin dismantling nationalistic barriers against foreign involvement in its mining sector, including gold prospects. Participants in a conference held in Beijing last week, among them representatives of some of the world's biggest mining houses, came away convinced that change was in the wind; although it was unclear how quickly China would replace existing legislation. Mining company representatives, used to sterile discussion on the need for liberalisation, were surprised when, on the eve of the conference, Chinese officials, responding to international pressure, halved the rate of gold royalties in draft legislation. While the proposed 10 per cent royalty rate is still outrageously high by international standards, especially compared with those in developing countries where rates of between 2 and 3 per cent apply, apparent Chinese flexibility was regarded as a good sign. Chinese regulations at present ban foreign companies from involvement in the exploitation of gold reserves, but China is anxious to secure capital and perhaps more important the advanced minerals treatment technology required to exploit this lucrative area. Mr Graham Reid, a senior manager of CRA of Australia, said that although the Chinese had a 'fair way to go' in their efforts to attract foreign miners, he had found attitudes displayed by officials of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources 'very encouraging'. He noted that Chinese officials responded with alacrity to suggestions by the foreign participants, who included representative of Newmont Mining of the US, Cominco of Canada, De Beers of South Africa, and BHP of Australia; although he also observed that substantial change to legislation would require the approval of the Chinese parliament. Among the more positive developments was a Chinese undertaking to study a proposal that the country should adopt a model 'contract of work' allowing prospective mining ventures to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, thus facilitating much greater flexibility. Mr Reid, CRA's general manager for exploration, noted that this approach was operating successfully in parts of Africa and in Indonesia  - a contract of work's main appeal is that it overrides existing laws - where it had proved an effective means of 'kick starting' mining exploration and development. Chinese mining officials have made it clear that they are under pressure to boost activity in the mining sector, which is lagging far behind the rest of the economy. China's economic boom has heightened demand for a whole range of minerals, both ferrous and non-ferrous. Mr Reid said that foreign miners would, however, proceed cautiously and would want to be sure that any new mining regulations were consistent with domestic laws. 'Western mining companies like laws that are drafted with particularity and clarity,' he observed. Western miners were also likely to insist that disputes be settled by international arbitration and not within the Chinese system. This was a concept that was fairly alien to the Chinese. Foreign mining representatives also pressed the Chinese last week on the need to make available larger areas for exploration, but at the same time urged regulations that would oblige exploration companies to surrender prospective areas that were not being exploited, thus ensuring 'turnover'. Other issues that preoccupied the conference, jointly organised by the United Nations, included access to foreign exchange, and guaranteed unlimited rights to export product. The Chinese were also pressed to clarify a tax regime that might apply to new mining ventures   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P1099 Metal Ores, NEC.     P1041 Gold Ores.

The Swindon plant started production in October and aims to reach its capacity of 100,000 cars a year with two car ranges in 1995. Productivity at Japanese carmakers' new plants in Europe, mainly in the UK, is setting tough standards for European producers, whose productivity is often half the best Japanese levels. Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK, said it had cut 'hours per car' for its UK-built Primera - similar in size to the Accord - to 12.5. He said 'the best of the Europeans are running at around 20 hours per car' for the same class of vehicle. European competitors in this market segment include the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, Ford Mondeo, Peugeot 405 and Volkswagen Passat. The hours-per-car yardstick used by Nissan and Honda measures so-called direct labour in the body welding, painting and final trim and assembly parts of the manufacturing operation. These processes are becoming established as a standard definition in measuring car plant productivity. Carmakers differ on the measurement of hours in their plants, but the size of the competitive gap has startled European producers. Honda's European sales push, Page 2   Companies:-  Honda Motor.

The shake-out could produce some 'interesting opportunities' for the financially stronger mills, since there are good reasons to integrate downstream into stockholding, says the study by London-based CRU International. Almost all European mills have expanded into stockholding - many during the late 1980s, when profits from steel production were high. British Steel also has stockholding interests in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Ireland, Spain and Norway. Usinor-Sacilor, meanwhile, has bought stockholders in nine European countries outside France where it is based. Some mills have acquired stockholders to gain market share. But CRU says that the most compelling reason for integration between a steel mill and a stockholder is that it adds to the mill's processing capacity. The capital spending needed for additional processing facilities could introduce a valuable barrier to entry into a business where barriers are now low, says CRU. This could cause two types of stockholders to emerge. Larger companies, often owned by steel mills, will tend to specialise in the product range of their parent companies, and will increasingly focus on processing steel. These companies may have better profit margins than the second category of general stockholders, which do little or no processing. But takeovers may be more frequent in this category, because asset values have been depressed by the recession or owners have come under financial pressure. Steel Distribution in Western Europe.

In a communique issued after an EU foreign ministers'  meeting  failed to agree on changes to voting procedures after four new  member states are admitted to the Union, Andreatta said ""I  believe that at the basis of the solution there must be a  compromise between those members which, like Italy, wish to see  a gradual political and economic integration between member  countries and, on the other hand, an acceptance of some nations'  concern to not allow the isolation of a minority which  represents a significant part of Europe's citizens.""

With the four new members, who now seem unlikely to enter  the  Union on January 1, 1995 as planned, the number of votes in the  council of ministers would rise from 76 to 90. Some nations,  including Spain, want the blocking minority to rise from its  current 23 votes to 27 votes, to reflect this increase.    The Europarliament, which would have to ratify the new  memberships before they go to referendums in the countries  involved, has already said that it will not accept a blocking  vote of less than 27. The Parliament will be dissolved shortly,  to allow for elections in June.     "

Political measures  are called for that can stimulate economic activity and promote  investment in the economy, which is in reality independent of  the rest of the world. This is the opinion of Allan Larsson, who  headed a joint working group for the European Social Democratic  Party on combating unemployment. He presents the group's  conclusions.    Is it possible to garner broad support for a new economic  policy that unites West Europe in the struggle against mass  unemployment? Or are we so divided that there can be no hope for  gathering the necessary forces?    There are at least some positive signs. In early 1993,  Jacques Delors and the Danish Government under Paul Nyrup  Rasmussen, which at that time held the chairmanship of the EC,  placed the battle against unemployment high on the European  agenda. The summit meeting in Copenhagen in June was a small but  important step forward. Work on Delors' white paper has focused  political attention this fall on Europe's greatest  misfortune--the fact that more than 20 million people are out of  work, half of them for more than a year.    But the public debate gives the impression that there is a  deep split. On one hand, there are those who cherish the  laissez-faire mentality that led Europe into this crisis of mass  unemployment. They simply offer more of the same, a fine tuning  of the neoliberal policy with deregulation, reduced government  responsibility, and increased insecurity. On the other hand,  there is a growing number of people--ordinary citizens who are  deeply concerned, perceptive economists, conscientious  politicians--who regard the present situation as so serious that  they want to see a thorough analysis and rethinking of the  policy that led to this record level unemployment. They want a  total new direction, not just fine tuning of the present policy.    In order to promote the need for new ideas, new directions,  and innovative measures, Willy Claes in Belgium, Felipe Gonzalez  in Spain, Franz Vranitzky in Austria, Wim Kok in the  Netherlands, Ingvar Carlsson and all of the other party leaders  of the European Social Democratic Party (PES) initiated a  comprehensive program--The European Employment Initiative. Under  my leadership during the fall, the study group worked with  leading economists in Europe, with Delors and his colleagues on  the EC Commission, and with experts in diverse national organs.  In connection with this work, I visited 15 countries in West  Europe in order to gain some insight into various national  situations and to obtain advice on designing a new policy on  full employment.    We have now handed over the report, entitled ""Put Europe  Back  to Work,"" to the chairman of the PES [Social Welfare Committee],  Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes, who is also  chairman of the EC Council of Ministers, and to all of the other  party leaders. The report will provide the basis for their  discussions and resolution at a meeting in Brussels tomorrow  (Thursday), the day before the European summit meeting.    We concentrated upon Europe's two major economic threats:  mass unemployment and the growing deficit in public finances.  These two problems are closely related and must be approached  through a common economic policy.    We posed five questions in the quest for answers concerning  the high and growing unemployment: Is unemployment due to trade  and overwhelming international competition? To new technology  that replaces jobs? To an imbalance between savings and  investment, that is to say, a lack of demand? Or is it  sluggishness in the labor market that prevents Europe from  increasing its rate of growth sufficiently to push down  unemployment? Or is it due to an antagonism between the  integrated European economy that we have created and the fact  that every country continues to conduct its own national policy?    We have come to the conclusion that answers can be found in  all five areas, but mostly in the last three mentioned:  structural problems in the labor market, faltering demand, and  the lack of a coordinated policy to take advantage of the  integrated European economic potential.    I will present a few facts that will open new perspectives  on  what can and should be done.    The European countries, the EC and EFTA [European Free Trade  Association] nations, are economically so closely interwoven  that we now have in practice a single integrated European  economy. This integrated economy is surprisingly independent of  the rest of the world. No less than 93 percent of all investment  and all consumption stems from production in West Europe. Only 7  percent is derived from imports from other parts of the world.  This tells us that there is much more scope than is generally  imagined for a concerted action that promotes growth and creates  new jobs. This tells us also that there is a greater need for  free trade than is generally believed.    Our integrated European economy is currently suffering from  weak demand on the one hand and structural problems in the labor  market on the other. There is a gap between investment and  financial savings in the private sector on the order of 6  percent of GNP, a lag in demand representing 8 to 9 million jobs.    The surplus of financial savings, which in reality is an  expression for a deficit in real savings, or investment, has a  flip side, namely a deficit in public finances that currently  amounts to 6 to 7 percent of GNP.    The weakness in economic activity in the private sector is  the source of the deficit in the public sector. When jobs  disappear and unemployment rises, public finances are undermined  from two directions: Expenditures grow and revenues weaken. The  underlying structural deficit mirrors a second structural  problem: long-term unemployment and cuts in social services.    We concluded from this and other factors that a program of  action is needed that in magnitude and duration diverges  radically from all that has been tried and discussed before.  Such a new economic policy for full employment must have two  pillars: investment in business and investment in education and  skills.    Above all, Europe needs more businessmen, more businesses,  and greater investment in the private sector. Political measures  designed to stimulate economic activity play a decisive role in  creating confidence in the future and interest in investment. We  wish to generate as many confidence-creating measures as  possible through monetary policy. We suggest that ECOFIN [EC  Council of Economic and Finance Ministers], that is, the EC's  economic and finance ministers, as well as EMI [European  Monetary Institute], the new monetary institute, mount a  concerted action to bring down interest rates in Europe. Low  interest rates make productive investments more profitable and  promote a balance between savings and investment, a key  objective of monetary policy.    A new economic policy--based upon investment in business,  research and development, infrastructure, housing, and urban  renewal--is necessary but not sufficient. It is just as  necessary to deal with the structural problems in the labor  market, the lack of correspondence between the demand for  training and job skills on the one hand and the range and  quality of education on the other. Europe has a labor market  that is out of phase due to the fact that demand for labor  changes quickly as a result of new technology and international  competition, while change is slow in the educational system,  which is not organized for the new job market.    Thus we propose joint initiatives aimed at forcefully  increasing investment in training and job skills. We would like  to increase quality and capacity by an additional 5 million  places in education, job training, retraining, and skill level  development. An investment such as this will impact  approximately 2.5 percent of the work force and will have very  positive, long-term effects on growth and immediate effects on  the battle against unemployment.    A new economic policy for full employment--with the object  of  first and foremost creating jobs in the private sector--is the  most important measure for revitalizing healthy public finances.  Cutting unemployment in half will go far in helping to balance  Europe's national budgets.    Our program ""Put Europe Back to Work"" is based upon the  simple but fundamental insight that work is a greater  contribution to economic and social progress than unemployment  is. It is also based upon the insight that Europe has an  enormous potential for growth through the mobilization of  people's desire and ability to work and create new resources. It  is high time for joint action, for a collective policy that  builds not on the limitations of national economies, but on the  great possibilities that an integrated European economy offers.     "

A bill of the parliamentary foreign affairs commission  recommended that Estonia seek compromises with Russia in border,  economic and humanitarian issues.    Vello Saatpalu, the chairman of the foreign affairs  commission and a member of the Social Democratic Party,  suggested on behalf of the commission that an Estonian-Russian  top level meeting be arranged with the help of mediators, if  necessary, to resolve the problems concerning the border and the  Tartu Peace Treaty. In his words, Estonia should also consider  placing the Estonian-Russian border issue under a moratorium.    Foreign Minister Juri Luik in his report assured that  Estonia  stands firm that Russian troops must be unconditionally  withdrawn from Estonia by Aug. 31, 1994.    Russia has so far refused to set the final pullout deadline  and keeps linking it to the demand that more than 10,000 retired  military be allowed to remain in Estonia.    Luik maintained that the Russian military retirees' issue  can  be solved only in accordance with Estonian legislation. What  makes finding a solution more difficult is that Russia hasn't  presented a list of its military pensioners in Estonia, striving  to solve the problem by the ""pig-in-a-poke"" method, the foreign  minister noted. He said the Russian Embassy claims there are  10,500 Russian military pensioners in Estonia, while Tallinn has  information their number amounts to 11,500.    Commenting on the dismantling of the nuclear reactors in  Paldiski, Luik said the operation lags behind the planned  schedule. He said an international monitoring group of  representatives from the Council of the Baltic Sea States and  the United States was set up in May, and that the group insists  on prompt removal of the nuclear fuel rods from Estonia.    Luik said the linkage of nuclear reactor removal to other  issues is internationally totally unacceptable.    Touching on the Estonian-Russian border dispute, the foreign  minister said the key issue is Russia's unwillingness to  recognize the 1920 Tarty Peace Treaty. It is extremely  regrettable that Russia didn't agree to discuss the issue in the  context of the European Stability Pact, known as the Balladur  Plan, Luik said.    Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn noted that the  situation in Russia is at present considerably more stable than  over the last few years. In his words, the power in Russia is  more or less centered in President Boris Yeltsin's hands and the  Western states have less leverage in influencing Russia's  decisions.    The Estonian ambassador, however, predicted trouble for the  autumn in Russia. He said the problems still on the agenda in  Estonian-Russian relations should be resolved within the next  two or three months.    The legislature suspended the discussion of Estonian-Russian  relations until September. Tiit Sinissaar, the chairman of the  Pro Patria faction in parliament, said the faction moved to  postpone the discussion because the purpose of the bill was  putting Estonian-Russian relations on the parliament's agenda  and now the discussion can be resumed after the summer recess.    Endel Lippmaa, a member of the Assembly Party council, told  reporters today that his party was against a provision of the  bill stipulating that ""solutions to problems of Estonian-Russian  relations should be sought in compromises in border, economic  and humanitarian issues."" In Lippmaa's words, ""it sounded as if  Estonia were willing to make any concessions (to Russia).""  Assembly Party members didn't support adoption of the bill.     "

Mr Andrew Jones, manager of Honda's Pounds 300m plant in Swindon, Wiltshire, said the company aimed to achieve an assembly time of 12.5 hours a car for its large family car, the Honda Accord. The Swindon plant started production in October and aims to reach its capacity of 100,000 cars a year with two car ranges in 1995. Productivity at Japanese carmakers' new plants in Europe, mainly in the UK, is setting tough standards for European producers, whose productivity is often half the best Japanese levels. Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK, said it had cut 'hours per car' for its UK-built Primera - similar in size to the Accord - to 12.5. He said 'the best of the Europeans are running at around 20 hours per car' for the same class of vehicle. European competitors in this market segment include the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, Ford Mondeo, Peugeot 405 and Volkswagen Passat. The hours-per-car yardstick used by Nissan and Honda measures so-called direct labour in the body welding, painting and final trim and assembly parts of the manufacturing operation. These processes are becoming established as a standard definition in measuring car plant productivity. Professor Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at Cardiff Business School, said the productivity of European car assembly plants, measured by direct hours and excluding support staff, averaged 20 to 22 hours per car.

0,FT931-17111 ,"FT931-17111 _AN-DACAXABFFT 930102   FT  02 JAN 93 / Leading Article: A cause for celebration   'TRY NOVELTIES for salesman's bait,' wrote Goethe. 'For novelties win everyone.' Europe's single market, which officially started yesterday, is a welcome novelty, and not just for political and commercial salesmen seeking a winning slogan in a bleak winter. It comes into force at an unpropitious moment, with west and east Europeans beset by recession and upheaval. Yet hope sometimes finds its firmest footing in a time of gloom. Opening up closed industrial, service and financial sectors to more competition may cause short-term pain, but it is the best recipe for growth. Provided companies, individuals and governments grasp the opportunities, the single market offers Europe its best chance of prosperity. Acrimony and fragmentation have characterised European politics in the past 12 months. But the Community deserves congratulation for enacting on time virtually all of a complex legislative programme, first outlined in 1985, allowing free movement of persons, goods, capital and services. Despite the impediments and imperfections remaining, the EC has pulled off an impressive feat. Placing the measures on the statute book was onerous. Making them work will be still harder. The EC faces four challenges. First, member countries will have to apply the rules firmly and equitably. The EC's new insistence on subsidiarity must not impede effective enforcement. Second, governments should seek ways of countering the currency instability, seen by many chief executives as undermining the single market's prospects of success. Increased access Third, the new market must be outward rather than inward-looking. This is crucial for relations with North America and Japan, and also for allowing increased access for exports from central and eastern Europe - all the more important in view of the EC's plans for enlargement. Fourth, the single market must be made attractive and inspiring to Europe's citizens - at a time when 16m people in the EC are without jobs, and economic growth is the lowest since 1981-82. If the EC now faces difficulties, the story of the single market shows how such tests can be surmounted. Following 12 years of debilitation after the 1973 oil shock, the single market was conceived as a means of bringing the Community back to life. The relaunch was accomplished through amendments to the Treaty of Rome which came into force with the Single European Act in 1987. The act was relatively uncontroversial, yet it encompassed far-reaching steps towards a supranational Europe. Along with the aim of establishing 'an area without internal frontiers', the act brought in qualified majority voting as well as the objective of economic and monetary union. Investment surge In some senses, the single market existed before it was born. An investment surge by companies anticipating abolition of borders, combined with the effect of German reunification, made 1986-90 a buoyant period. During that time the Community registered annual average growth of 3.2 per cent, three times the OECD's forecast for this year's performance. Without this helpful background, the single market may well have run into the type of opposition that has befallen the Maastricht treaty. As it is, the single market starts life punctually, but in a world made uncertain by change. One of the EC's prime problems is its flagging competitiveness, starkly underlined by a trade deficit with the rest of the world of Dollars 60bn to Dollars 70bn a year (against a Dollars 20bn surplus in 1985). Conscious of this handicap, not least vis-a-vis newly industrialised countries, large European companies seem likely initially to use the single market above all to spur further productivity gains, through rationalising and concentrating their activities. Over the longer term, the single market opens a path to a more cohesive and competitive Europe which will create and not destroy jobs. By encouraging countries and companies to adopt the best available business and labour practices, it lays groundwork for deeper integration, including, perhaps, monetary union. So the new year beacons of celebration shone in a good cause. The milestone of the single market shows how far the Community has travelled; and it provides a sense of direction and purpose for the arduous but rewarding journey still to come.

0,FT932-780 ,"FT932-780 _AN-DF0AKADPFT 930626   FT  26 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Lower rates are key to Nordic markets' success - Christopher Brown-Humes says that prospects are still bright for some of Europe's best performers      By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES   A potent cocktail of falling interest rates and rising corporate earnings, spiced by devaluations and dollar sensitivity, has put the Nordic stock markets among Europe's top performers this year. Indeed, Finland's Hex index has led continental Europe with a 34 per cent rise, while Oslo's all share index has shown a 28 per cent gain. With both Copenhagen and Stockholm having strong runs, the Nordic Securities Market calculates that the average rise for the four exchanges this year is close to 20 per cent. Falling interest rates and the expectation of further cuts have been the main influence. This has increased prospects for economic recovery, soothed nervousness over the state of the region's loss-making banks, and bolstered corporate earnings. Interest has been enhanced by increased buying by foreign investors switching away from the German and French markets. The upturn in both Finland and Sweden has been helped by significant currency depreciation, following the decision to float the markka and krone last autumn, and by the expectation that both economies will emerge from three years of negative GDP growth in 1994. But perspective is important here. At the end of May, the Nordic markets were only up 6 per cent from the same time last year. That is a good indication of the extent to which Stockholm and Helsinki, in particular, have recovered since the autumn currency turmoil. The question, as they go into their summer lull, is whether the impetus can be maintained. Some analysts feel that much of the corporate earnings recovery is now discounted in Sweden and Finland, and they are nervous about prospects in Denmark, with its strong currency and dependence on the German market. There are also worries about new political turbulence in Sweden and Finland in the autumn, as well as the general economic malaise in Europe. At the same time, the firm expectation that European interest rates will follow German rates downwards over the rest of the year has led most analysts to conclude that the Nordic markets stand to make further gains during the autumn, with little talk of anything more than a technical downward correction. Finland has already seen a correction, the Hex having fallen by around 12 per cent since its May 24 high of 1,258. Having more than doubled since last September, its ebb on pre-holiday profit-taking was hardly surprising, but it has prompted some commentators to suggest that the market has got ahead of itself. Sweden also saw a correction this week as a weakening currency postponed hopes of further interest rate cuts, and the market reacted to news of a 3.8 per cent fall in first quarter GDP. But there is a feeling that share prices could move further ahead if the dollar strengthens further, and as companies begin to feel the full benefits of last November's effective devaluation in the second half as hedging programmes expire. Nevertheless, there are outstanding concerns over the robustness of the economy and the size of the budget deficit. Expectations are arguably highest for Norway, in spite of the spurt it has already put in this year, because of improving economic fundamentals and the high percentage of corporate earnings linked to the strengthening dollar. There are also clear indications that the country is past the worst of its banking and insurance crisis. A strong recovery in shipping share prices - based on dollar strength rather than improving market fundamentals - is already under way, with the Oslo shipping index rising to 505 this week from 345 at the beginning of March. Mr Tom Skjelstad, a stockbroker at Norse Securities, believes there could be further gains in the autumn, taking the total index to around 550 at the end of the year from 485 this week. In the meantime there is likely to be nervousness about the outcome of the September election, with the governing Labour party likely to poll fewer votes because of its support for EC membership. Denmark is probably the least favoured of the four. The 'Yes' to Maastricht is May was already discounted, and so is likely to have little bearing on the market's development over the rest of the year. In addition, the country's exporters are struggling with a strong currency, worsening conditions in Germany, and a negative impact from recent tax reform proposals. In spite of this, not everyone is pessimistic. Mr Fleming Madson, head of equity research at Danske Securities, predicts that Danish corporate earnings will still rise by 17 per cent this year, and that the market can rise by a further 10 per cent over the next 12 months.

The sources said that the  arrest campaign concentrated on the capital Baghdad and on the  Iraqi town of al-Mawsil in the north.    Earlier reports spoke of large-scale arrests, including  officers on active service as well as retired officers, in  Baghdad and other towns following the distribution of leaflets  attacking the Iraqi regime on the occasion of the Iraqi Army's  73d anniversary on 6 January.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has obtained a copy of the first  communique  issued then by the ""provisional national leadership,"" which,  according to Iraqi opposition sources, consists mostly of Iraqi  Army officers. According to the communique, this group operates  inside Iraq within the ranks of the Army with the aim of  overthrowing President Saddam Husayn's regime ""and transferring  the constitutional powers to the Iraqi people and their  institutions"" after a six-month transitional period.    The communique declares that ""Iraq's giant -- the army --  has  now awakened...to end this tyranny,"" and that the birth of this  leadership ""marks the beginning of the march for the destruction  of that germ.""    An official of an Iraqi opposition group which operates  abroad and which has received a copy of the communique, says  that it was distributed in Baghdad, al-Mawsil, and other towns  and that one of the copies was smuggled out by travelers to  Jordan.    The communique appears to have been drafted in simpler and  more realistic language than the statements issued usually by  professional politicians of the Iraqi opposition abroad, and its  emphasis is on a decisive role by the Iraqi Army to change  Saddam Husayn's regime.    The group in whose name the communique was issued is  probably  trying to cause a split within the security and intelligence  organs and the Republican Guard, which are under the tight  control of Saddam Husayn and members of his family, after the  failure to secure their support in past coup attempts.    The communique appealed to ""our brothers and sons in the  armed forces and internal security forces, including the Army,  the Republican Guard, the police, the public security forces,  the intelligence forces, and the special security forces, as  well as the brothers in the party organizations."" It reassured  them that their lives and rights would be protected.    This is the first time that a military group has announced  itself inside Iraq with the stated aim of changing the regime.  In the past such statements were issued by small groups of  officers who managed to escape abroad during the years of the  Iraq-Iran war, the occupation of Kuwait, and the war which led  to the liberation of Kuwait.    The communique said that the next regime should ""steer our  political and economic courses in a manner suited to our  capabilities as a Gulf oil state...to build a modern Iraq and  divert its economic resources to the service of its people not,  as Saddam did, squander billions and billions of hard currency  on the purchase and manufacture of arms of mass destruction and  an arsenal which destroyed Iraq and slaughtered its people and  which was used to invade Kuwait and threaten the states of the  region and undermine their security.""    The communique also said that the aim of the group which  issued it was to overthrow Saddam Husayn's regime and ""transfer  power to the people so that they would rule themselves through  their representatives elected by free ballot and in the  framework of a system of government approved by the people, with  emphasis on the impartiality of the judiciary and on the rule of  law...without discrimination between Iraq's nationalities,  communities, religions, sects, or political or ideological  trends, with emphasis on the neutrality of the armed forces and  the internal security forces."" It stressed that the  transitional period during which the group itself would govern  would not exceed six months.    Directly addressing the neighboring states and the  international community, the ""provisional national leadership""  said in its communique that it would abide by the ""UN charter  and resolutions, the Arab League charter, and international  conventions."" It affirmed that it would ""open a new and bright  era of relations based on mutual respect and interests. We also  emphasize that we would resolve all border problems permanently  so as not be preoccupied with them ever again in the future.""     "

According to unconfirmed reports, the bidders are Time Warner of the US and CanWest Global Systems of Canada. Vox is one of nine German-based private broadcasters competing for viewers with 15 publicly-owned channels. Their move is understood to have been initiated last month when the publisher of the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, decided to dispose of its 20 per cent stake in the struggling broadcaster. Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media business with widespread international interests in print and electronic media, holds a 24.9 per cent stake. Other shareholders include the WMB holding company, of which 47 per cent is in the hands of the public sector bank, WestLB. Bertelsmann yesterday would confirm only that it was in talks which should lead to 'stabilisation' of the shareholdings in Vox, which had a shaky launch into the crowded German TV market just over a year ago. The company said a group of American investors was seeking a 49 per cent stake, but that the current owners were not offering that amount. It said that although Bertelsmann had no plans to reduce its stake, an announcement could be made in the next few weeks. Originally conceived as an information channel, much of Vox's output is now entertainment. The Suddeutsche Zeitung, which supplies a magazine programme, S-Zett, and other services to Vox, is believed to want to pull out because of the format change, and the unexpectedly high start-up losses, exacerbated by recession.

The group said yesterday it planned to buy a large mining project. Metall is 'aggressively pursuing' the acquisition of a large copper mining project. The company currently has a modest exposure to copper. It is developing the Izok Lake property in Canada's Northwest Territories, believed to be North America's biggest undeveloped zinc and copper deposit. Metall said it expected copper demand and prices to improve as countries in south-east Asia, South America and eastern Europe expanded their housing, infrastructure and communications facilities. Expansion in copper smelting would also reduce the company's vulnerability to changes in copper treatment charges, and improve its chances of acquiring mining assets. Copper and other metal smelting charges have risen sharply in the past two years. The centrepiece of the company's plans is the possible acquisition of MG's substantial copper smelting and refining assets. These include a 35 per cent stake in Norddeutsche Affinerie of Hamburg, one of Europe's biggest copper producers, and a 40 per cent interest in Austria's Montawerke Brixlegg. Metall would pay a 'substantial portion' of the purchase price by issuing common shares to MG. The German company presently has a 59 per cent stake in Metall Mining. Metall directors have retained NM Rothschild, the UK merchant bank, to prepare a valuation of MG's copper smelting assets. Smelting capacity may also be increased at 87 per cent-owned Copper Range, an integrated producer in northern Michigan.

Documents determining the nuclear-free status of Ukraine were  signed at the tripartite consultative (?) meeting in Moscow. We  had already written in the last issue of NEZAVISIMOST that these  decisions had been determined in advance, as attested by the  words of A. Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of Russia, who  by no means considers the tripartite accords the main result of  the Moscow summit, and the very vague statement of L. Kravchuk  at the news conference in Borispol, which may be formulated  briefly approximately thus: Ukraine cannot go against the wishes  of the main world powers.    Well, let us once again spread out the cards in the nuclear  solitaire to better understand what kind of legacy we are  renouncing. And why.    Arsenal No 3    The reader who has been following the problem closely might  have noticed that Ukraine's nuclear potential has frequently  been defined as third in importance after the United States and  Russia. What did this arsenal No. 3 represent?    Of the components of the strategic triad (ground-based and  sea- and air-launched missiles), the first and the third were  represented here. Broadly speaking, each element of the triad  worked for the others, complementing and mutually reinforcing  the others.    Strategic offensive arms (SOA) in the system of the Ministry  of Defense of the former USSR were always considered the ""holy  of holies."" In all the years that I have been writing on  military matters not once have I spent time on operational duty  in units of the strategic missile forces or on a nuclear-powered  submarine equipped with ballistic missiles. Nonetheless, I  learned a great deal in those, ""stagnation,"" times. Although the  main information was still obtained when the disarmament process  was actively under way.    Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM's) were rightly  considered the basis of the Soviet SOA. Those in the fixed-site  category were deployed in launch silos--most intricate  underground structures capable of withstanding a nuclear blast.  The shaft of the silo is covered by a special metal roof, and  the launch canister, fitted with a reliable shock-absorption  system, is capable of withstanding colossal impact. The  post-boost section of the Soviet missiles could carry from 1 to  10 nuclear warheads.    Almost one-fifth of the warheads of the ground-based  component of the triad is deployed in Ukraine. This is more than  the nuclear warheads of Britain and France put together. Two  ICBM bases are known. SS-19's are based in Pervomaysk of  Nikolayev Oblast, as in the environs of Khmelnitskiy. These are  quite powerful two-stage liquid-fuel rockets. A very important  detail: The three-stage solid-fuel SS-24's--the main part of the  Soviet ICBM's of this type of silo basing--are deployed in  Pervomaysk also. It is these missiles that were manufactured in  Pavlodar, which is in the Dnepropetrovsk region. And SS-18's are  manufactured in Dnepropetrovsk itself, at the celebrated  Yuzhmash. These missiles, the world's only heavy type, were with  good reason christened Satan. Each of them is capable of  delivering to target up to 10 one-megaton warheads.    The air component of the triad, less significant (but with  its advantages), was composed of heavy bombers capable of  carrying nuclear bombs or long-range nuclear cruise missiles.  Note that each ""cruise"" could carry one nuclear warhead, but  each bomber could be fitted with 16 such missiles. There are two  major heavy bomber air bases in Ukraine--in Kiev and Poltava  Oblasts.    Although we have no test ranges or centers for instruction  in  work with ICBM's, there is a facility for converting and  eliminating ICBM's in Sarny.    Heroic Surmounting of Difficulties    In May 1992 in Lisbon the heads of the foreign policy  departments of the four ""nuclear"" republics of the former USSR  and the U.S. secretary of state signed a protocol to the  Soviet-American Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms (START I),  which was to have been followed by the ratification of START I  by the parliaments of these states. Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and  Belarus not only confirmed the USSR's START Treaty obligations  but also undertook to completely eliminate the strategic  offensive arms deployed on their territory within seven years.  In addition, the three states promised to subscribe to the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as nuclear-free states. This  step afforded Russia the opportunity to lay claim to the status  of ""sole legitimate nuclear successor of the USSR.""    Handsome gestures, splendid declarations.... How much in our  history have we lost on account of the ineradicable passion for  political posturing! Without murmur, almost, we allowed the  tactical nuclear weapons on our territory to be withdrawn. And  although in March 1992 L. Kravchuk announced a suspension of the  withdrawal of the tactical nuclear weapons, many observers  merely smiled ironically at this inasmuch as they believed that  the withdrawal was wholly controlled by Moscow. In addition,  from the formal viewpoint this decision of the president's was  contrary to the declaration on the nuclear-free status of  Ukraine. Thus was the first step en route to the world  community's distrust of Ukraine's ability to keep its word taken.    The euphoria from the proclamation of independence caused  problems. We should, oh how we should, have consulted  specialists. And then, perhaps, events would have developed  differently. While having agreed to the destruction of our part  of the SOA's, we could perfectly well have kept for ourselves  the tactical missiles. We would not here have acquired so mighty  an opponent as the United States (the strategic missiles  deployed in Ukraine are targeted against the United States, and  fighting Russia with them is impossible). The nuclear warheads  would not have needed to be replaced for a very long time or the  missiles could have been converted to deliver point weapons,  say. There would doubtless have been problems in the  international arena here also. Nonetheless, I believe that  mobile and efficient tactical nuclear weapons would have been  far more suitable for us from the viewpoint of deterrence than  the strategic missiles, which are not only a target for the  ICBM's of a probable enemy but which also, if launched, would  cause the deaths of the inhabitants of the villages in the  vicinity of the silos.    But the tactical missiles were removed, and only then did  the  bargaining over compensation begin. Bitter arguments arose over  the SOA's also. In a word, the Ukrainian state followed the  distressingly well-known principle: Having initially created the  difficulties, it set about heroically overcoming them.    `For'...    The West's policy in regard to the nuclear weapons that  constitute the legacy of the USSR has in this time been quite  clearly defined. This is how it was formulated by B. Clinton:  Europe would be more stable were Russia to be the sole nuclear  power-successor of the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, certain  political scientists advocated Ukraine's nuclear status. They  adduced as the main argument the historically difficult  relations between Ukraine and Russia. Giving our country serious  guarantees of its security was proposed, therefore. Forecasting  the course of events, the scholars examined several possible  causes of a significant deterioration in the mutual relations of  Ukraine and Russia. They include the common unprotected border,  the danger of hyper-nationalism, an escalation of existing  tensions (Crimea, the Black Sea Fleet), and the problem of  Russians in Ukraine and Ukrainians in Russia.    The supporters of nuclear deterrence believe that Ukraine's  nuclear weapons could be an effective means against an attack  involving the use of conventional armed forces or against  nuclear blackmail. Their arguments were approximately as  follows: In the pre-nuclear world between 1900 and 1945 there  were two world wars, in which approximately 50 million Europeans  died. In the nuclear era only 15,000 Europeans died in small  wars between 1945 and 1990. And to speak of the superpowers, on  the other hand, there was a stable peace between them. It is  nuclear weapons, in their opinion, that have been the firm basis  of this peace (the concept of ""nuclear stalemate,"" when neither  side can win inasmuch as it would itself perish, is well known).    ...and `Against'    Who could have guaranteed that Russia would have handed over  to us its nuclear weapons unimpeded? After all, we are not in  command of them even now, essentially. Would we have had the  experience and wisdom sufficient for correctly disposing of the  nuclear legacy of the USSR? Their storage and maintenance have  constituted a serious problem. And were we, for all that, to  take over the command and control of the SOA's, Russia would  know full well how to paralyze the launch complexes, and nuclear  espionage would develop to exaggerated proportions, which would  only poison the two countries' mutual relations. Add the  political instability in Ukraine: What if forces that might want  to make use of the missiles were to come to power?    It is most unlikely, observers believe, that nuclear weapons  could resolve all the problems of Ukraine's security. The  missiles of the nuclear powers would be retargeted on it in an  instant. It is perfectly possible that the possession of SOA's  would lead Ukraine's leaders into the temptation to brandish the  ""nuclear nightstick"" a little. And preservation of the nuclear  status would hardly contribute to our country's integration in  the European process. And in conclusion, some calculations. Were  Ukraine to want to become a medium-sized nuclear power (like  France or Britain), it would have to spend up to $5 billion  annually on its nuclear programs.    According to some estimates, Ukraine would need no fewer  than  10 years and expenditure put at hundreds of billions of dollars  to make good the supplies of components and fuel for the missile  plants, create its own enterprises manufacturing nuclear  warheads and guidance systems, and develop the facilities and  methods of the control and safe operation of strategic systems  and an early-warning system, space-based missile-targeting  facilities, and sites for testing nuclear munitions, spacecraft  launches, and missile testing (it would, in addition, be  necessary to obtain the consent of neighboring countries to the  flight over their territory of the missiles being tested).    Blackmail and Threats    Peering into the future, political scientists have observed  that the basis of the new multipolar Europe will be rivalry  between Germany and Russia in the field of security. An  independent Ukraine could ease this rivalry. It is, after all, a  considerable barrier between Germany and Russia. But take away  this key barrier, and the borders of the two strongest states of  Europe draw closer for there are weak countries between them,  after all. Thus Ukraine becomes an arena of new political  rivalry.    In the case of the nuclear weapons it is absolutely clear  that Russia (and, broadly speaking, the United States inasmuch  as it is the latter that is the rival of Germany in the world,  as Russia is in Europe) has bested the FRG. Everything has been  used to achieve this goal: from disinformation of world public  opinion and economic blackmail through a refusal to maintain  Ukraine's nuclear arsenals, despite current agreements.    One Further Option    At the time when Russia was attacking Ukraine's nuclear  policy ""on all azimuths,"" in de Gaulle's well-known expression,  the United States was deafeningly silent. But this could not  have lasted long, and new approaches were manifested at the time  of Les Aspin's visit to Kiev, apparently. What was Ukraine's  nuclear potential at that time? Some 130 SS-19 missiles (six  warheads each), 46 SS-24's (10 warheads each), and 30 strategic  bombers, which all together can carry 416 bombs. It was rumored  that Ukraine could aspire to definitive control of the strategic  bombers and could launch those SS-24's that had been built in  our country. And, indeed, had things turned out differently,  this could have been a prospective program. Even in this case  Ukraine's nuclear potential would have remained the third in the  world.    There is reason to believe that these matters were discussed  during the negotiations with Les Aspin. It was at this time that  the idea of international control of the nuclear warheads from  the missiles stood down from alert status, which would have been  warehoused on the territory of Ukraine until a decision on the  amounts of compensation for them had been adopted, was advanced.    Observers allow that Aspin's negotiations were a deft  maneuver aimed at increasing the political isolation of Ukraine  as a ""latter-day European aggressor."" This worked in the Western  press. Many publications appeared on this subject.    This is why B. Clinton's speech in Brussels and,  subsequently, his meetings in Kiev and Moscow assumed the nature  of a sensation.    Way Out of the Impasse. But Which?    Ukraine has, for all that, I believe, emerged from the  impasse to which it had been brought by irresponsible petty  ""peacemaker"" politicians. Russia has agreed to compensation for  the withdrawn tactical nuclear weapons, the amounts of which  will be determined by experts. On the basis of an agreement  between Ukraine and Russia the uranium from the warheads of our  strategic missiles will be compensated by fuel for the nuclear  power stations. Technical assistance in the dismantling will be  rendered. Ukraine's rating in the international arena has risen.  Economic assistance has been promised. True, all this is  possible, in my view, only if Ukraine sails, if not in the wake  of Russian (or, rather, Russian-American) policy, at least a  parallel course.    And whereas what we noticed at the meeting in Borispol was  our president's forced smile, in Moscow it was his shifty eyes.  Of what was agreed there is, as before, much that is unclear.  The security guarantees, for example. The Treaty on Nuclear  Nonproliferation cannot be deemed such on account of the  imprecision and vagueness of the wording contained therein. L.  Kravchuk's references to the ""honest word"" of the presidents of  the United States and Russia are naive.    Or take the problem of the missile silos. How are they to be  destroyed? Explosions would cause the region's ecology  irreparable damage.    One way or another, the deed is done. In acquiring (de  facto)  nuclear-free status Ukraine is, it would seem, losing part of  its independence. Ukraine has never yet throughout its history  been absolutely independent, for that matter. The question is to  what extent and on whom we will be dependent today.     "

Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State, announced the military relief effort, codenamed Operation Provide Hope, yesterday at the end of a two-day conference of 47 nations in Washington called by the US to co-ordinate aid to the ex-Soviet states. The US proposal, involving 54 US Air Force flights, runs counter to German arguments that land and sea transport is more effective and less costly, but Mr Baker said at the State Department yesterday that the use of US forces was symbolically important. '(It) can vividly show the peoples of the former Soviet Union that those that once prepared for war with them now have the courage and conviction to use their militaries to say 'we will wage a new peace',' he said. The US has dispatched airlifts to select republics in recent months, but the latest relief effort - reminiscent of the Berlin air-lift in the late 1940s  -seemed more ambitious. The flights of C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft from Frankfurt will last between one and two weeks. The aim is to target orphanages, hospitals and other needy groups in all 12 independent states. Advance teams from the Pentagon and other Federal agencies will oversee the on-site distribution. The hope is to prevent the chronic corruption which has to date plagued the western relief effort. European diplomats suggested yesterday that the use of C-5 aircraft from Rhein-Main air-base could herald a fresh campaign to use Nato forces to oversee the relief effort. Mr Baker pointedly noted Nato's earlier offer of logistical support. Using Nato forces could run into opposition from France which this week expressed reservations about the Washington conference which also involved five international financial organisations including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. France dispatched its deputy foreign minister, criticised the decision to bar the ex-Soviet republics from attending and called for practical on-site mechanisms to ensure distribution of the food and humanitarian aid already available. In Washington, EC trade commissioner Frans Andriessen said nations outside the EC would have to do more to help out the former Soviet Union, as the current 'burden sharing doesn't reflect the global nature' of the issue. In spite of these reservations, the participants described the conference as a useful exchange of views which had produced detailed plans of action to help the republics in dismantling their centrally planned economies. The US defused rivalry with Europeans by agreeing to a follow-up conference in Lisbon this spring, to be sponsored by the European Commission and attended by the republics. Japan, which has been accused of dragging its feet over aid because of its claim to the Kurile islands, has offered to host a third conference.

0,FT944-12041 ,"FT944-12041 _AN-EKCEGADCFT 941103   FT  03 NOV 94 / Technology: Military eyes in the sky - A look at a French project to make Europe's spy satellites less US-dependent      By DAVID BUCHAN   In one respect, president Saddam Hussein's imitation of the grand old Duke of York in marching his men to the Kuwaiti border and then marching them back again came at just the right time for the French government. It helped remind France's politicians, taxpayers and European partners how essential satellite intelligence was to tracking the vagaries of Iraqi troop movements this time, just as it was during the Gulf war of 1991; it reminded everyone of why Paris plans to raise spending on military space activities, mostly spy satellites, by 24 per cent to FFr5bn (Pounds 590m) in 1995 alone. France's overall political aim is to make itself in particular, and Europe in general, less dependent on the US for military satellite information. In the 1991 war France's Spot civil satellite produced a useful complement to the Pentagon's KH (Key Hole) military satellites, because Spot produces stereoscopic photos, providing a three-dimensional image. But Spot lacks the pinpoint detection of America's 'Big Birds', as it is unable to detect anything less than 10m wide. France has been spending heavily on military satellites since 1986 when it started the Helios I programme with Italy and Spain which are funding, respectively, 14 and 7 per cent of the programme. Early next year Ariane is due to put into orbit the first Helios 1 satellite, whose images will be processed at Torrejon in Spain. This ex-US Air Force base near Madrid has been converted into a satellite picture processing unit run by the Western European Union, the defence wing of the European Union, which has so far only been fed by images from Spot. The French are well aware, however, that Helios I is far from completely answering Europe's needs. It may cost more than FFr11bn, but it is simply an optic system and can take photographs only during the day and in good weather. Enough, perhaps, to cope with the interests that Helios I's three partners have in the Mediterranean, but not much good for covering the often-cloudy regions of northern and eastern Europe. Nor will the planned successor programme, Helios II, be much better in this regard; its infra-red imaging will penetrate night, but not heavy cloud. Spain also said this summer that it would drop out of the FFr7bn Helios II programme because it could no longer afford its 7 per cent share. But hopes are rising in Paris that Germany may at last join in - not necessarily in Helios, but possibly in France's Osiris project for a radar satellite, or in a much more ambitious Europe-wide project being discussed in the WEU. The German government and industry are much more interested in spy satellite detection by radar that pierces clouds and can even reveal subterranean objects, such as bunkers, lying in several metres of loose soil, such as sand. A feasibility study conducted for WEU defence ministers by some 30 companies under the leadership of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) and a subsidiary, Dornier, which makes medium-range turboprop aircraft, puts the cost of a complete system at up to Ecu14bn (Pounds 11bn) over a life of roughly 1997 to 2022. This seems expensive, but perhaps less so given that WEU's 10 member countries could split the cost over a quarter century and given that the system would include a mix of manoeuvrable radar and optic/infra-red satellites with space-based relay stations. The optic/infra-red satellites would have a resolution down to 50cm-100cm, while that of the radar satellites would be 3m. Different platforms are needed because radar imaging is carried out at an oblique angle and therefore on a satellite on a different orbit to optic or infra-red photography which is conducted vertically above the target. As for relaying images to the processing centre, the only alternative to space-based relay stations would be to have ground stations around the globe. Not surprisingly, the WEU project is hanging fire. Cost is the overwhelming drawback for all WEU members. But there is perhaps another element in the opposition of the two most reluctant countries - Britain and the Netherlands. While both are attached to Nato, the UK is the only Nato ally to which the US gives raw images from its satellites, rather than the processed data Washington gives to the rest of the alliance.

The money was allegedly on its way from a Swiss bank to the  paymasters of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. But it was  intercepted by the Garda.    The 2m pounds was intended to help fund the IRA's armed  struggle in Northern Ireland, condemned as the ""six-county  prison house"" by Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president.    ""The account holder claims it is all legitimate,"" says a  high-ranking Garda officer. ""But it stays exactly where it is  until the killing stops.""    Exactly what happens to the Navan cash when one of the  world's most intractable conflicts finally ends is low on the  list of current republican concerns.    The recent shadow boxing with the UK government has involved  matters of much greater moment, such as agreement on the meaning  of Irish national self-determination and the fate of hundreds of  convicted IRA prisoners kicking their heels in jail.    Ann Anthony, a protestant mother of two from Lurgan in the  north, could be forgiven for wanting the prisoners to stay where  they are. This month, with the death toll from 2.5 decades of  street warfare rising beyond 3,000, the IRA blew up her husband.  Charge: working as a cleaner at a police station. Penalty:  death.    The cycle of hatred has also cut deep into the flesh of an  innocent Catholic community caught in the sectarian crossfire.  Eamon Fox and Gary Convie died together five days after Fred  Anthony as they tucked into lunchtime sandwiches; 76-year-old  Roseanne Mallon ended her life alone, at midnight, in a  bullet-riddled armchair.    And yet, in spite of the latest, random murders and the  cries  of ""no surrender,"" the 25th anniversary of the deployment of  British troops in Ulster approaches with hope, not despair, in  the ascendant.    As republicans pick at the Downing Street declaration, a  document intended to be all things to all parties, a widespread  belief persists that the end-game is under way.    Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster  Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force, expects  heightened savagery in the short-term but hopes to see an end to  most terrorist violence within three years. Jim Molyneaux,  leader of the Ulster Unionists, reckons the worst could be over  in a year. Adams himself, who has sounded at his most  optimistic this week, claims the struggle has entered a new and  final phase.    But the choice between peace and another 25 years of human  tragedy is testing to the limits the cohesion of hardline  republicans intent on a 32-county socialist state. In the words  of a convicted IRA bomber: ""Not long ago, the mere idea that  men married to armed struggle should talk to the Brits would  have meant a beating. Now even the big boys are into it.""    Out of sight small groups, united under the ""ballot box and  armalite"" creed of Sinn Fein and the IRA -- Adams concedes they  ""draw water from the same well"" -- are debating the unthinkable.    Could violence, which alone has given the cutting edge to  the  Irish question, soon be over? Might it be possible to  decommission the IRA, the world's most technically advanced  terrorist organisation?    The pressures on the republican movement for a political  deal  have intensified since last December's declaration, which united  London and Dublin in leaving open all options for Ulster's  future but rejected coercion of one part of the Irish community  by another. Despite unprecedented publicity for the republican  case and the platform given to the tactically astute Adams to  sell his peace agenda, the unbending London-Dublin stance has  won overwhelming backing.    Electoral support in the north for Sinn Fein, which won  78,291 votes in the 1992 general election (10 per cent of the  vote) has halved, though the British government stresses it  recognises the party's modest mandate. In the republic, polls  suggest the party is backed by barely 1 per cent of voters.    Political isolation, however, holds no demons for the  battle-  hardened men at the heart of the IRA -- the dominant partner in  its intimate relationship with Sinn Fein -- who number about 400  -- with perhaps another 50 key players in the south. It is  these men, who numbered about 1,000 20 years ago, presided over  by an Army Executive and a seven-man Army Council, who guard the  soul of the IRA.    They look to Belfast, still the political centre of the  organisation, for guidance. A northern command structure split  into 11 operational areas (southern command embraces the entire  republic) plans attacks mounted by active service units.    There are thought to be at least two units currently on the  British mainland. In Ulster, active service units are supported  by similar numbers of part-time volunteers blooded in minor  sorties. Behind the volunteers, within the Catholic strongholds,  are the supporters who offer safe haven in an estimated 2,000  homes: ""There is always someone to run them a bath to wipe out  the evidence,"" says an senior intelligence source.    In Ulster border towns such as the largely republican  Crossmaglen, the British army survives under siege, and lamp  posts carry mock, triangular signs warning: ""Danger: Sniper at  work.""    Not all support for the IRA in Ulster is freely given.  Intimidation of Catholics by Catholics is widespread. On a  night of terror in April, IRA ""punishment"" attacks in Belfast  left one man dead and 16 with gunshot wounds to the legs.    Growing sections of the IRA leadership now share a  conviction  that the prospect of a glorious victory is as remote as the  threat of complete defeat. And most grass-roots republicans no  longer have any stomach for slaughter, as a series of Sinn Fein  public meetings staged to debate the Downing Street declaration  made clear.    At the same time, the IRA confronts a combined north-south  assault on its manpower, weaponry and financial resources. In  the republic, which is spending 200m irish pounds a year to  bring the IRA to heel, the Garda claims recent arms finds have  dealt a hammerblow to IRA quartermasters moving arms and  explosives up to the 282-mile border.    With Libya no longer supplying the arms which sustained the  IRA in the 1980s, fresh sources are proving hard to find. The  recent exposure by British intelligence of attempts to forge new  supply links with Iran is a further set-back though, for the  time being, weaponry is not a problem for the IRA, which has  stored enough to sustain the fight for another 10 years. The  IRA arsenal includes more than 600 AK47 rifles, 30 machine guns,  nine SAM7 missiles, a dozen hand-held, surface-to-surface  missile launchers, eight flame throwers, hundreds of Webley  pistols and tons of imported Semtex, Irish security sources say.    The organisation's engineering and electronics experts can  add to the arsenal with home-made devices. Though icing sugar  and fertiliser are still sometimes mixed to provide a deadly  cocktail, a bomb factory discovered in Kilcock, near Dublin,  recently yielded sophisticated equipment.    Waging a high-tech war -- the IRA now has electronic devices  to break into police and army frequencies is expensive. The  annual cost is estimated by the security forces at up to 7m  pounds, and the rising number of bank raids in the south  suggests the books are not balancing.    Most IRA income comes from organised in the province and in  the republic -- a network of racketeering and fraud, which  ranges from video and audio tape piracy to tax abuse. In the  eyes of those who fight the IRA, this makes it more of a Mafia  than an army of liberation and means its activities are unlikely  to be extinguished by a political settlement.    The RUC's C13 anti-racketeering unit, which has overseen  prosecutions involving nearly 50m pounds destined for IRA  coffers since 1982, has now been bolstered by a finance unit of  30 tax inspectors, lawyers and accountants. This unit played a  large role in the recent joint operation, codenamed ""Madronna,""  between police on the British mainland and on both sides of the  Irish border to nail the sources of IRA financing. Meanwhile,  in the US, funds for the IRA have been dwindling since the early  1980s.    The combination of political and financial pressures on the  IRA and Sinn Fein to enter the peace process is not lost on  elements in their leaderships. But they are acutely aware of  the dangers of moving too far too fast. ""If Adams screws it up,  he could end up with a bullet in his head,"" says a senior member  of the RUC.    A majority within the IRA army council is now said to favour  searching for a political accord, but one which will not oblige  republicans to endorse the Downing Street agreement. A second  ceasefire this year has not been ruled out.    But, remarked a source claiming to be close to one council  member: ""They know it would be of no use just to sign up  tomorrow. They first have to bring with them the constituency of  armed, physical-force tradition people. That will take time,  carries great dangers and will also need the Brits to play the  game."" A former IRA volunteer indicates the scale of the  challenge within the organisation: ""Sure, we are tired, they  are tired, everyone's tired. But we'll see them out of the six  counties or in hell before we give up.""    There are some in the high command opposed to going further  down the political road, which historically has always ended in  traumatic disintegration for republicans.    To the hard men of south Armagh, east Tyrone and Fermanagh,  the only option is to continue to wage a war so sacred as to  justify the killing of schoolchildren in Warrington, nurses in  Enniskillen and six-month old infants in Germany.    Talk of a split, however, provokes impatience among Sinn  Fein  heavyweights such as Martin McGuinness -- publicly branded a  senior IRA figure by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland  secretary. ""Do you really think,"" says McGuinness, ""we have  come this far without ensuring full agreement on our position  each step of the way. There is no split, there will be no  split.""    An RUC intelligence officer agrees: ""The name of the game is  to get people on side and gradually isolate the others.""    The highest levels of the IRA appear confident that before  the year-end, the organisation will again be in contact either  directly or indirectly with the British government. Moreover,  they believe that, ultimately, they will be able to bring their  argument to the heart of Whitehall not in a stolen, mortar-laden  van but in a briefcase.    This week London and Dublin offered republicans more time to  choose between peace and continuing armed struggle. The ""Brits""  say they are more than ready to talk. But there is, first, the  one precondition: an end to all violence; just 12 weeks of  peace will do.    Like Gerry Adams, who recently quoted Irish poet Patrick  Galvin to express his wish, London and Dublin, too, ""dream of a  green land without death, a new silence descending, a silence of  peace.""

0,FT911-2561 ,"FT911-2561 _AN-BD2BCAD5FT 910429   FT  29 APR 91 / National champions become laggards: Europe's electronics industry is in crisis and may not last the decade - Why?      By GUY DE JONQUIERES and ALAN CANE   It has long been a tenet of European industrial policy that a successful modern economy depends on a healthy electronics sector. Yet the deepening crisis among Europe's electronics producers suggests that their biggest challenge this decade may be to survive at all. Most European-owned chipmakers made losses last year, as did many computer companies and Philips of the Netherlands, the biggest electronics group. Savage cutbacks across the industry have brought almost 100,000 job losses, while the European Community's annual electronics trade deficit has swelled to almost Dollars 35bn. Distress signals are multiplying. Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of the French state-owned Thomson group, is openly urging more trade protection. Earlier this month, he and other industry leaders sought more EC support at a 'mini-summit' chaired by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The industry has long argued for special treatment on two grounds. One is that the market for its products is growing fast. The other is that they are used by so many sectors, from cars to financial services, that failure to retain a European presence in electronics could jeopardise industrial competitiveness across a broad front. Many national governments and the EC have responded sympathetically. In the name of safeguarding a 'strategic' sector, they have repeatedly supported indigenous electronics producers with subsidies, preferential procurement and trade protection. Yet these remedies have failed to cure deep-seated problems - and may have prolonged them. Not only have misjudged policies perpetuated bad habits in the industry, they have often been inconsistent with the larger goal of disseminating advanced technology throughout the economy. The first error has been to confuse invention with product innovation. Most EC funding has focused on expanding research and development, emphasising collaborative projects intended to boost European companies' technological firepower. Some critics say EC subsidies have been too thinly spread to be effective. More fundamentally, they do not address one of European manufacturers' biggest traditional weaknesses - a belief that laboratory breakthroughs can substitute for efficient manufacturing and aggressive marketing. That is a costly delusion in an industry ruled by short product cycles and steeply falling prices. Japanese companies have thrived by concentrating their technical resources on product development and production engineering and fine-tuning them to the market. Europe's industry structure has also adapted sluggishly to rapid technological advance. In the US, the established order is regularly challenged by home-grown market entrants. The industry shake-up instituted by innovative newcomers such as Compaq and Sun Microsystems is as responsible as the recession for the current difficulties of traditional US computer companies, including IBM. In Japan, the most potent agent of change is also intense domestic competition. But there it is chiefly between large vertically-integrated groups, where the thirst for business drives them constantly to invade each others' markets. In Europe, by contrast, lack of a fertile start-up culture has left slow-moving older companies dominating the indigenous electronics industry. Direct competition between them is often timid: most European computer makers still rely heavily on their home markets. European companies have also often been late into hot new products such as camcorders and scientific workstations. Europe's three main chipmakers - Philips, Siemens of Germany and the Italian-French SGS-Thomson - are being heavily subsidised in their efforts to catch up in chip technology. They are also discussing pooling research. But they account for only about 10 per cent of world production - and barely 30 per cent of European sales - and are poorly represented in the high-volume microprocessor and memory segments. Indeed, the only electronics equipment sector in which Europe boasts consistently profitable world leaders is telecommunications, where monopoly procurement of network equipment in most countries continues to shelter entrenched suppliers and maintains high margins. Inadequate home demand is often blamed for industry weaknesses. Though Europe's spending on information technology has been rising, it is still lower per head than in the US and Japan. The market is also divided by differing national standards and fragmented distribution channels, which add to selling costs. However, volume of demand is probably less important than its quality. As computer power grows steadily cheaper, the sophistication and complexity of the applications to which it is harnessed play a bigger role in expanding the market. Producers are depending more on customers to set the pace and direction of the industry. But large European information systems users are notoriously cautious about pioneering leading-edge applications: those which do often prefer US suppliers for their superior expertise. Brussels is now considering plans to boost demand by persuading national authorities jointly to back a futuristic Europe-wide electronic information network. tions. First, whether the large contracts it would generate could legally be reserved for the European-owned suppliers it is intended to benefit. Second, whether it would not simply repeat at the EC level European countries' largely unsuccessful use of public procurement to bolster national champion suppliers. The result has often been to induce dependence on captive markets. Putting the interests of producers ahead of customers has been a consistent  -and often unsatisfactory - theme of European electronics policies. For instance, the EC's faltering strategy for high-definition television (HDTV) has been shaped largely by European equipment makers anxious to keep Japanese competitors at bay. Only recently has an effort been made to involve broadcasters, whose commitment is vital to HDTV's success. Perhaps most dubious of all have been EC attempts to use trade protection to strengthen indigenous producers. During the 1980s, repeated EC anti-dumping actions led to price rises of as much as 50 per cent on electronics imports from computer printers to video recorders. Since offending exporters have often agreed, under EC pressure, to raise prices unilaterally, they have reaped windfall profit gains paid for by European consumers. Yet there is little evidence that threatened European producers have taken advantage of anti-dumping relief to step up investment and raise productivity. In semiconductors, the EC has followed the US by engineering trade arrangements which require Japanese producers to co-operate in limiting price reductions at times of glut. That is profoundly ironic, since European chipmakers have long warned that if they were unable to compete, Japanese producers would collude to rig the prices and supply of components sold to European customers. If that was ever a serious risk, it has been mitigated by the rapid growth of large Japanese-owned chip plants in the EC. It would hardly be in Japanese companies' interest to restrict output to local customers after laying out billions of dollars on production capacity. Indeed, the recent influx of Japanese and US investments is one of the main sources of European electronics industry growth. Yet it is also posing new policy dilemmas, underlined by the outcry over the acquisition of ICL, Britain's largest computer maker, by Fujitsu of Japan last year. ICL has since been expelled from the European industry's most influential lobby group and partially excluded from Jessi, the Dollars 5bn EC-funded microchip research programme. That response was doubtless intended as a warning to the Japanese. However, it also poses awkward questions about the EC's insistence on defining the electronics industry narrowly in terms of a shrinking number of European-owned suppliers. Behind the indignant chauvinism lies, nonetheless, a more serious concern: that if Europe's electronics industry passed entirely into foreign hands, critical management and technological functions would move overseas. The industry could be reduced to branch plants making mature products, with little capacity to innovate. Yet in this context, corporate ownership is something of a side-issue. For many companies, including Bull, ICL, Olivetti, Thomson and Siemens already rely heavily on overseas competitors for products and vital technologies. The flow is almost all one way - and is growing. The industry's options appear limited. Trans-European mergers, frequently touted as a way to strengthen indigenous producers, have often proved tricky to arrange. In microchips and consumer electronics, such mergers have also been disappointingly slow to deliver improved scale economies and financial returns. Meanwhile, the EC Commission is refusing to bail out troubled companies, and its competition watchdogs are investigating French state aid to Bull. In any case, the French government's largesse is bounded by budgetary constraints, which recently prompted it to relax its opposition to privatisation. Nor would further trade barriers offer much of a solution. Past EC trade protection has proved a Maginot Line, easily outflanked by overseas companies which have set up plants to compete from inside the EC. Barring a miraculous recovery in their performance, the outlook for many of Europe's embattled electronics manufacturers is likely to be further retrenchment and takeovers. The most optimistic prognosis may be that, as they retreat, innovative home-grown competitors will spring up in their place. That is what has happened in the US. However, the US has also long had a dynamic and demanding home market. The lesson for Europe may be that indigenous suppliers can only be as vigorous as the customers they serve.

Treuhand officials said they were 'disappointed' because the agency, despite opposition from the Germany's Steel Federation, is anxious to speed up the sale of the mill so as to secure jobs, investment, and markets for the region. Riva, the Milan-based privately-owned company, obtained sole negotiating rights earlier this month from the Treuhand to buy Ekostahl, and had until yesterday to spell out its efficiency and production plans. The Italian company confirmed it had not responded to the Treuhand's request for more details, but declined to explain why it had missed the deadline. Riva is expected to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, while the Treuhand will hold the remaining 40 per cent stake. Together they will invest DM1.2bn (Pounds 470m) in building a hot rolling mill, the equivalent of a mini mill with an annual capacity of about 900,000 tones. Treuhand officials said it was unclear if the delay by Riva was caused by last week's opposition by Britain, France and the Netherlands to proposals put forward by the European Commission to restructure western Europe's steel sector. British officials yesterday confirmed that Mr Johannes Ludewig, a senior economics advisor in the Chancellor's office, last Friday called in Sir Nigel Broomfield, Britain's ambassador to Germany to discuss the UK's opposition to the Commission's plans. A British official said that opposition from Mr Tim Sainsbury, the UK industry minister, was not directed specifically at Ekostahl but at the steel industry in general.   Companies:-  Riva Group.

GALVIN SAYS IT IS TIME TO DISCARD ALLIANCE'S OLDEST AND MOST  HALLOWED CONCEPTS.      By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ST. AUGUSTIN, Germany      While European leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization grope for a  new strategy in the post-Cold War period, the alliance's military commander,  Gen. John R. Galvin, is providing some guidelines for such a doctrine.    At a recent seminar of diplomats, soldiers and academics at the Konrad Adenauer  Foundation in this Bonn suburb, Galvin spelled out his vision of a new,  slimmed-down NATO force for the years to come.    The white-haired, four-star U.S. general indicated that some of NATO's oldest  and most hallowed concepts, having served their purpose, are on the way out.    These include ""flexible response,"" which envisioned possible early use of  tactical nuclear weapons, if needed, against a Soviet mass attack; and ""forward  defense,"" which called for positioning troops as far east as possible in what  used to be West Germany.    Galvin said he believes that NATO's nuclear deterrent will suffice with a  ""greatly reduced stockpile"" because there will be a much longer ""nuclear  threshold,"" particularly after new conventional arms cuts in Europe.    And ""forward defense,"" previously insisted upon by West Germans because of  domestic political considerations, will no longer be needed because of the  buffer zone created by changing political conditions in Eastern Europe.    While the new doctrine has not yet been agreed upon by NATO's 16 member nations  or even formulated by its planners, Galvin suggested that an educated guess  indicates much of what the new strategy will be. The main changes include:    * Greatly reducing troop strength in Europe among all allies, particularly  those stationed in Germany, possibly cutting U.S. forces in Germany to a single  corps of ground troops, with backup logistic and air support.    * Developing a more mobile force among the thinned-out units in order to cover  the same area. This would mean troops would not be stationed right up against  the German-Polish border but in a more central location.    * Reducing the number of headquarters units, though Galvin said such command  and control elements are an essential component of the integrated military  structure of NATO.    * Placing only limited reliance on short-range, battlefield nuclear weapons,  possibly phasing them out almost entirely eventually.    * Bringing in chemical weapons only in case of an emergency buildup by a  potential enemy force.    * Cutting large-scale maneuvers and low-flying training missions by jet  fighters to a minimum in order to spare the citizenry.    * Forming more multinational units, even though, because of differing languages  and equipment, their value remains to be tested.    * Emphasizing further arms cuts that could be negotiated between NATO and the  Soviet Union, with NATO continually adapting its tactics to such reductions.    However, Galvin, who has held his post for more than three years, emphasized to  questioning Germans that this is no time to consider dismantling NATO, which,  he said, has served its members well for more than 40 years.    ""There is no substitute for NATO's integrated military structure,"" he said,  indicating that such a system is unique in the post-World War II world.    But he acknowledged that the current crisis in the Persian Gulf has focused  military and public attention, particularly in the United States, outside the  borders of NATO members.    In the United States, he noted, some critics have said that NATO members should  have provided more forces for service in the gulf region. Galvin said that  after the crisis is over, NATO members will discuss whether the alliance should  consider out-of-area action when the vital interests of its members are  involved.

0,FT943-14987 ,"FT943-14987 _AN-EGLEZADPFT 940712   FT  12 JUL 94 / Personal View: Europe must sharpen competitive edge      By EDGAR S. WOOLARD JR   Would the chief executive of a multinational company with Dollars 1bn to invest choose Europe as a location during the next decade? My experience is that many large companies are directing discretionary investment elsewhere. Why? Europe is an enormous market, but despite rises in gross domestic product per capita, Europe's ageing population and low birth rates point to slower growth in the future. Moreover, the World Competitiveness Report, compiled by the Imede business school in Switzerland, points out that a region's competitiveness is grounded in processes that turn assets into results. It concludes that Europe is not transforming ideas into better products, more quickly and more cheaply than other regions. Increasing trade deficits and unemployment are the result. At the same time, it costs more to produce in Europe today than anywhere else in the world. One factor is the high cost of labour and the inflexibility of rules and regulations affecting it. Another is the fact that energy, many raw materials and telecommunications cost more in Europe than in the US and Japan. All this suggests Europe has yet to confront its competitive disadvantages - or pursue its competitive advantages. Policymakers should focus their attention in four areas. First, giant strides have been made towards a genuine single market, but the job of freeing up business is far from complete. The Uruguay Round is important, but free trade is about more than the absence of tariffs - it requires the elimination of old mindsets that are still evident in Europe. Consider an example: improving efficiency in the workplace. Instead of a dialogue about how production processes can be streamlined, we have seen in Europe a long, unresolved debate about procedural mechanisms for consulting workers. In other regions, new work systems are being tested and adopted to make companies more aggressive, customer-orientated and productive. Second, European Union laws and regulations should be simplified to allow companies to organise themselves efficiently. One particular problem is the variety of national requirements in Europe which mean companies have to organise networks of local subsidiaries. The administrative costs of parallel national subsidiaries add cost but no value to the customer. In the US, a company can be incorporated in one state and operate in all 50. Third, policymakers should recognise that industrial restructuring is essential to long-term competitiveness. It can take several forms, including the shutting down of excess capacity or obsolete plants, modernising assets to make them globally competitive, and purchasing or selling businesses to focus a company's strengths. A year ago DuPont acquired ICI's nylon business and ICI acquired DuPont's acrylics business. Approval for that agreement was given by the European Commission in a timely way - more timely than the process required by the US Federal Trade Commission. We found officials of the European Commission to be enlightened, focused on economic and competitive realities, and quicker than US counterparts. European companies should see that as an advantage. While facing up to the need for restructuring, Europeans should also realise that eastern Europe is not a drag, it is an opportunity - a frontier. But standard project analysis is likely to preclude many companies from investing in eastern Europe because of risk and long-term payment concerns. Business and government will require leadership and determination to see eastern Europe as an opportunity rather than western Europe's special burden. Finally, it is important that Europe adopts a single currency. From the international perspective, this is essential for European integration and for creating a transparent market. Without a single market it is difficult to harmonise the terms under which we deal with our customers in different countries - who are, after all, competing in a single market. Years of patient and difficult effort to promote a level playing field have been undone overnight by recent devaluations. We are, for example, still feeling the effects of the devaluations of the Spanish, Portuguese and Irish currencies, as well as the floating of the Italian and British currencies - some of which took place nearly two years ago. I believe Europe can find the resolve needed to make progress on social, economic and political fronts. But the successful integration of the European market is not a foregone conclusion and it is not clear Europe has yet realised the change needed to become internationally competitive.

An out-of-court settlement between the two sides means that the utilities, headed by RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, will be guaranteed 70 per cent of the electricity market in east Germany for the next 20 years. The local authorities have agreed to generate from their own power stations no more than 30 per cent of the total requirement. In return, the suppliers have agreed to protect jobs in the east German brown-coal industry, which still employs some 80,000, and embark on new investments valued at up to DM30bn (Pounds 12.3bn). The local authorities will be allowed to choose whether to take over full ownership and control of electricity and district heating supply and distribution facilities on their territory, or cede the right in exchange for up to 49 per cent of the shares in their regional electricity supply organisation. The deal could fall foul of EC competition rules. It is likely to mean foreign electricity suppliers will be effectively excluded from access to the east German market for the next 20 years, industry analysts say. Foreign suppliers have shown an interest in the east German market, including Electricite de France, Britain's PowerGen, National Power, and Scottish Power. The German utilities have been attacked by German industry as among Europe's most costly power suppliers.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "
0,FT944-6863 ,"FT944-6863 _AN-EK1C5ABUFT 941128   FT  28 NOV 94 / Beer town left flat after Pirelli move northwards: The reasons for the tyre maker's decision to transfer operations from Burton on Trent      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Much of the fizz has gone out of the economy of Burton on Trent. But it has nothing to do with the beer for which the Staffordshire town is renowned. In spite of the breweries which dot Burton's skyline, Pirelli, the Italian tyremaker, was for decades the town's biggest employer - until last year, when 700 jobs went almost at a stroke with the end of car tyre-making. Now truck tyre-making has gone, with another 300 jobs. Mr Carlo Mazzantini, the UK chairman and managing director, heads an administrative staff at Pirelli's UK headquarters, still on the town's Derby Road. SMC and Central Tyres, Pirelli's fast-fit and tyre retailing chains, have moved in with their warehousing operations. But research and development has been moved out and soon some vestigial production operations such as compounding and fabrication will also go, leaving fewer than 300 people working for the group. Burton's car-tyre production has been transferred to a more modern plant at Carlisle, 150 miles to the north-west. Its location, far from any car plants, is the legacy of past regional aid policies. Pirelli has committed itself to investing Pounds 20m in upgrading and expanding its Carlisle facilities to double its production from 10,000 tyres a day before the transfer. The Carlisle plant, which employs 875 people, is also being given a new design and development role in a Europe-wide restructuring of Pirelli's tyre production capacity. The restructuring has started to return the Italian group to profit, after a string of heavy losses. Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, group chief executive, in London for this month's Pirelli calendar launch, made clear that the restructuring envisaged a stand-alone future for Pirelli after its costly and abortive attempt to take over its rival tyremaker, Continental of Germany. The UK upheavals are part of a European consolidation in which more than 20 plants have closed and resources have been moved to some of the remaining 80. Nearly 12,000 jobs have been lost worldwide, leaving fewer than 40,000. Mr Mazzantini said: 'In January 1993 we were producing 5,000 car tyres a day at Burton with a production workforce of 700, and 10,000 at Carlisle with nearly 1,000. Now, with 800 fewer people, Carlisle is already producing 13,000 to 14,000 tyres a day. And that is with a higher level of quality and without major investments.' A mid-term target is 15,000 a day with half the total UK production workforce of January 1993, rising to 20,000 as the full benefits of investment in new plant and equipment are realised. Truck tyre production has almost certainly left the UK for good, however, prompted partly by the worst slump in continental Europe's commercial vehicle markets since the second world war. Mr Mazzantini said: 'Europe's truck market collapse could not be overcome. No one was to blame. We need strategic production units and at 7,000 to 8,000 truck tyres a day Burton was too small.' The Carlisle facility is being pushed into the unfamiliar role of developing premium tyres for some of Europe's more up-market carmakers. One early result is a sole-supplier contract with Jaguar for its new XJ saloon range. Purpose-designed tyres are also on the stocks for Saab and Volvo, Rover Group and Toyota's and Honda's UK 'transplant' car factories - for which the Carlisle plant will also be the supply source. Mr Mazzantini said: 'Everyone wants tailor-made products now.' That means flexibility in tyre development and manufacturing processes to a degree that the tyre industry could not have contemplated a few years ago - batches of fewer than 400 of a type are now regarded as viable. Much of the planned investment centres on more flexible, high-quality processes. Carlisle will concentrate on premium sector tyres, where prospects for profits are brightest. Such profits do not, however, come from original equipment supplies to vehicle makers. Margins here are almost non-existent. The attraction is in replacement sales. Mr Mazzantini said: 'When it comes to high-performance and prestige cars like Jaguars the pull-through is very strong. If the car has been fitted originally with Pirellis it is certain that the driver will replace them with the same tyres.' It was not surprising, he added, that this was the market sector in which Pirelli mainly wanted to be. The UK tyre market has 107 brands jostling for sales, of which 99 are in the 'commodity' sector - sold almost entirely on price rather than performance. Korean and east European tyremakers have been targeting this sector. 'Countries like Poland and the Czechs are looking mainly for hard currency, so they don't care what price they sell at,' Mr Mazzantini said.   Companies:-  Pirelli UK.

The promotion of Mr Hughes from his post as chief executive of Opel, GM's German subsidiary, follows the surprise appointment last month of Mr Robert Eaton as chairman-elect of Chrysler, the third largest of the big three US vehicle makers. Mr Eaton will succeed Mr Lee Iacocca as chairman and chief executive of Chrysler at the end of the year. Although educated as a mechanical engineer Mr Hughes, 43, has enjoyed a rapid rise through the finance hierarchy of the world's biggest car maker. Before becoming chairman and managing director of Opel in April 1989, he held successive posts as finance vice-president of GM of Canada and then GM Europe. He was previously assistant treasurer in the US with general responsibility for international activities involving financing and new business ventures and played a key role in GM's negotiations with Toyota to set up a manufacturing joint venture in Fremont, California, in the early 1980s. As president of GM Europe Mr Hughes is taking over the leadership of probably the most profitable volume car maker in Europe and the most successful part of GM's troubled automotive operations. While GM worldwide made a net loss of Dollars 4.5bn last year, GM Europe, with a workforce of 128,000, achieved a net profit of Dollars 1.76bn last year on a turnover of Dollars 25.4bn. GM Europe's core Opel/Vauxhall operations produced a record net profit of Dollars 1.96bn. GM, whose US management hierarchy has been thrown into turmoil this week by board changes which have effectively limited the power of Mr Robert Stempel, chairman, and have demoted his chief lieutenant Mr Lloyd Reuss, is vitally dependent on its European operations as it seeks to staunch massive losses in North America. As chairman and managing director of Adam Opel, Mr Hughes, who was born in Cleveland, Ohio, has taken pains to assimilate himself into the higher echelons of the European motor industry. He has learned German well enough to use it as his everyday business language at Opel's headquarters at Russelsheim, near Frankfurt. His presence in the inner circles of German business has been helped by the high profile role GM is playing in investment in eastern Germany with the building of a 150,000 cars-a-year assembly plant at Eisenach, close to the site of the old East German Wartburg factory. At GM Europe he will have overall responsibility for continuing the group's effort to increase its production capacity by 25 per cent by the mid-1990s in the face of mounting Japanese competition. Mr Hughes will lead the company's vital new product programme - a key to its recent success - with the launch next year of the new generation Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova small car range. GM Europe is also committed to an ambitious expansion in eastern Europe, not only with the Eisenach plant but also with important projects in Poland and Hungary. At Opel Mr Hughes has been closely identified with GM Europe's efforts to introduce so-called 'lean production' techniques, and with the Eisenach plant GM is seeking to reach levels of productivity and efficiency to match some of the best Japanese car makers.

This figure has  been reported in the Latvian media for the first time.    Judging from officials' reports, the debt has built up  steadily. Having turned into a chronic defaulter, the ""Latviyas  Gaze"" (""Latvian Gas"") state enterprise is also committed to pay  considerable sums in fines to its Russian suppliers. Last year  the money owing to Russia for its natural gas supplies was paid  off with the help of international loans. Since then the  situation has not changed for the better.    The leaders of ""Latviyas Gaze"" reported that this year an  agreement with Russia on gas deliveries had been concluded on  ""terms advantageous to the Latvian side."" Nonetheless, it has  not proved possible to pay the sum required. It is as if Latvia  is receiving gas on credit. The DIENA newspaper has reported  that Russia issued an official warning in mid-January to the  ""Latviyas Gaze"" state enterprise, demanding that it change its  payment policy for the gas it has used. It is proposed that  this demand be met by 1 February, otherwise gas supplies will be  cut by 50 percent.    But Latvian consumers are not threatened with any particular  unpleasantness as a result of this reduction in the supply of  Russian natural gas. The fact is that Europe's largest  underground gas storage facility, into which Russian gas has  constantly been pumped, is located in the republic at Incukalns.    Russia has agreed to forgive the debts in return for part of  the Incukalns gas storage facility and the network of gas  pipelines running across Latvian territory.     "

The central  issue was Bosnia and Russia's new position regarding the drama  in the Balkans. Here is a report from Giuseppe De Carli:    [De Carli] This was a strictly private meeting without  speeches or official communiques, but the arrival at the Vatican  of the rising star of the Yeltsin government, Viktor  Chernomyrdin, was far from routine. John Paul II wanted to find  out about the new Russian prime minister's intentions and, above  all, to jointly evaluate the position to be taken with regard to  the drama in Bosnia.    Here, we must say, the Vatican and Russia have positions  that  are far apart and, in some respects, irreconcilable. In the  last few weeks, the governments of the West have learned that  Russia is against any use of force. Yeltsin has asked for the  Security Council to be convened and has insisted on a political  solution to the crisis in the Balkans. The chief cause for  concern is Russia's pro-Serbian line. It is no longer West  against East, but the Christian world against the Muslim world.    This is not the Pope's position. He is desperately trying to  build bridges between Christians and Muslims in order to find  common grounds for tolerance. The Vatican is particularly  concerned about the mood of Islamic nations angrily watching  Europe's indifference towards the massacre of Bosnian Moslems.  John Paul II once again told Chernomyrdin that after the  collapse of the walls, it is absurd to be building new ones  using the spur of nationalism and conflicting religious beliefs.  According to official sources, the Russian prime minister  listened attentively and was receptive to this line of reasoning.     "

Yeltsin under the ""Nuclear  Center Warns..."" rubric: ""Creators of Nuclear Weapons Have  Passed to NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA a Letter for the Russian  President""]    [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich!    We employees of the Russian Federal Nuclear  Center--All-Russia Scientific Research Institute of Technical  Physics [RFNC-ARSRITP] are deeply concerned at the situation  which has taken shape in the nuclear weapons complex. While  conscious of the whole complexity of the economic situation in  Russia, we are nevertheless forced to draw your attention to the  inadmissibility of the current process of virtual destruction of  such a unique project as our enterprise.    The RFNC-ARSRITP, one of two Russian federal nuclear  centers,  was formed in the city of Chelyabinsk-70 (now a closed  administrative-territorial formation, Snezhinsk city,  Chelyabinsk Oblast) in 1955. The past decades of peace and  creative building in the life of our state have shown that  active pursuit of nuclear weapons projects, including the years  of work on creating appropriate nuclear weapon systems, is the  most effective means of deterring any aggression. More than 50  percent of the nuclear weapon systems now in our arsenal include  nuclear charges developed at the RFNC-ARSRITP.    In recent years there has been a substantial change in the  state authorities' attitude to the military-industrial complex  as a whole, including the two federal nuclear centers. The  RFNC-ARSRITP is currently being funded at such a low level that  there is a real threat that work on the state defense order will  cease, not to mention the development of conversion areas. At  the same time three similar centers in the United States are  continuing to function at the former level -- they are  recognized as the country's national asset.    Constantly inadequate and late funding has brought the  RFNC-ARSRITP to crisis point. The enterprise's debts run into  tens of billions of rubles and are increasing, owing inter alia  to enforced expenditure on paying fines and credits.    The equipment is aging physically, and there is a  catastrophic shortage of materials, tools, and special clothing;  energy suppliers have repeatedly warned that they will cease  supplying gas and electricity. As a consequence, there is a  growing risk that emergency situations will arise, even  involving technologically dangerous production sections.    Systematic delays over paying wages to employees over the  past two and a half years are creating a very complex,  physically and morally difficult social situation in the labor  collective. People simply do not have the wherewithal to live  or to feed their children. In such a psychological state they  have to work under particularly harmful and dangerous conditions  -- which can have grave consequences.    An extremely complex situation is also occurring in the  social sphere. Medicine ekes out a pitiful existence, the birth  rate has fallen, and the level of sickness and mortality has  increased. There are no funds to improve the health of working  people and their children. Housing construction has virtually  stopped, the number of needy people is growing, and there are  families with three children living in a hostel. The subsidiary  agricultural enterprise has been forced to reduce the numbers of  livestock and poultry, cannot supply the working people with  food, and is essentially falling apart.    Concerned at the current processes and at the threatened  loss of the technical and scientific potential which had been  attained and which it will be impossible to restore, the  leadership and the trade union committee of the RFNC-ARSRITP  have repeatedly asked various state organs to examine questions  of the enterprise's financial and economic position. There is a  draft government decree on funding the federal nuclear centers  which has been discussed repeatedly in the Ministry of Finance,  the Ministry of the Economy, and the Ministry of Labor. But the  majority of the labor collective's appeals have gone unanswered,  and the draft decree remains just a draft.    We once again ask all state management bodies and you  personally, Boris Nikolayevich, to consider our problems and to  adopt corresponding decisions without delay, primarily on these  questions:    approval of the Russian Federation Government decree on  funding the federal nuclear centers;    repayment of debts and payment of delayed wages;    allocation of the necessary funds for housing construction,  medicine, and other areas of the social sphere.    We are sure that Russia needs our labor, and we are ready to  give our knowledge, strength, and experience in the name of our  motherland's independence and might. We hope for wisdom and  farsightedness from the president, the government, and Russia's  other administrative bodies.    The appeal is signed by 7,369 employees of the RFNC-ARSRITP.     "
0,FT931-6178 ,"FT931-6178 _AN-DCCCKAAVFT 930303   FT  03 MAR 93 / EC in new agreement on small print in contracts      By ANDREW HILL      BRUSSELS   THE European Community yesterday gave consumers a new weapon to use against unfair small print in contracts. EC consumer affairs ministers agreed a directive to outlaw standard contracts weighted against the consumer. The accord ends 16 years of discussion between member states, and could open a range of previously acceptable agreements to legal challenge, including banks' contracts with customers, package holiday deals which allow tour companies to impose surcharges, and even broad warnings that customers use services 'at their own risk'. But consumer organisations said yesterday that the new legislation, which will not come into force until December 31 1994, did not go far enough, and was too vague. They believe it should include a definitive list of illegal clauses, rather than an 'indicative' list, and should cover all contracts, including those negotiated by the consumer. Ms Monique Goyens, legal adviser to Beuc, the European consumers' organisation, said: 'We are pleased that this directive is almost on the statute books, but it will bring few concrete benefits to any of Europe's consumers.' Other consumer groups said its main benefit would be to raise consumers' awareness of the dangers hidden in the small print. Ms Rebecca Evans, barrister with the Consumers' Association in London, said: 'A big piece of legislation coming in will reinforce in the public mind that they are not stuck with the small print, and there are things that companies can't do.' Mr Jan Trojberg, the industry minister in Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, said the directive would raise minimum consumer protection standards in southern EC countries such as Spain and Portugal.

It does so at at time when, in line with the  Maastricht treaty, the decision-making and supervisory powers of  the newly elected parliament have been enlarged.    EU policies have taken on a significance for Germany that in  many spheres is equivalent to that of national policies. More  than 60 per cent of the legislation affecting business and  consumer affairs is now determined at a European level, and is  thus dependent on the European Parliament's decisions. To give  the parliament a broad democratic basis, German industry made  clear during the campaign that it favoured a high turnout in the  elections on Sunday [12 June].    The German presidency and the new parliament will be  starting  their work at a time of great political and economic challenge.    After the large-scale upheavals which have taken place in  Europe during the last few years, including the reunification of  Germany, the task now is to press forward along the path of  European integration.    The main item on the agenda is to strengthen Europe's  position as a centre for economic activity by overcoming points  of structural weakness and reducing unemployment.    Last December, the European Council drew up an action plan  based on the Commission's white paper on growth,  competitiveness, and employment. That provides the foundations  for a successful common strategy during the medium term, which  should reinforce companies' competitiveness and increase  employment.    Broad-based investment and a clear reduction in unemployment  can be attained only if companies are able to stand up to  increasingly intense international competition.    To achieve that aim requires: a reduction in the burdens of  taxes and other levies on European companies, which are very  high by international standards; more flexibility in labour  markets, deregulation and privatisation of many important areas,  such as telecommunications, energy, and transport; improvements  in infrastructure, making use of private as well as public  sector capital; and promotion of innovation by means of  well-coordinated and application-orientated research and  development policies.    From the point of view of German industry, the German  presidency of the EU should aim to press forward speedily and  consistently with the aim of completing the single market  programme.    Of the measures putting the programme in place, 95 per cent  have now been agreed. However, across the EU, only 87 per cent  of the measures have been placed on the statute book so the  single market cannot yet said to be fully operational.    Moreover, only 50 per cent of the measures have come into  effect in all 12 member states. Partnership and co-operation  are necessary to ensure that single market rules are applied in  an efficient and even-handed manner. That is the only way to  overcome competitive distortions.    Consolidating the single market also requires harmonisation  of tax policies and reduction of fiscal hindrances. Action is  called for to end burdens on industry stemming from provisional  VAT [value-added tax] rules. This would require a decision on a  new system for country-of-origin VAT collection.    Fiscal barriers for cross-border capital transactions and  corporate restructuring must also be removed. A  well-functioning joint export control regime is also needed  encompassing so-called dual use goods i.e. those capable of both  military and civilian applications.    Another priority is cross-border environmental protection.  Common policies are required to control and to prevent  environmental problems, particularly with regard to waste  disposal but also with recycling and with the re-use of  materials.    There is further need for action in the European Union's  external relations, of utmost importance for assuring  competitiveness. There may well be important landmarks here in  the application of the GATT Uruguay Round agreement, as well as  in the establishment of the World Trade Organisation. The EU  needs to assume a leadership role in this respect alongside the  United States.    The Union's trade policy must be strongly geared to the  principles of multilateralism and openness towards the rest of  the world. The leading industrialised countries' trade policy  will be credible only if they refuse to countenance one-sided,  discriminatory measures or threats of sanctions.    A decisive point for Europe's external relations will be the  extension of trade and industrial co-operation with the reform-  minded states of central and eastern Europe. The German EU  presidency should devote special energy to supporting these  countries' economic reform efforts.    In line with the principle of ""self-help,"" trade and  economic  co-operation can provide the right conditions to allow these  countries themselves to generate the revenues needed to finance  these reforms.    Another central issue for the German presidency will be  preparing the conference to review the Maastricht Treaty in  1996. Here I anticipate improvements on the details of the  treaty as well as decisive steps towards developing European  integration. In particular, we must meet the challenges  associated with enlargement towards some of the EFTA [European  Free Trade Association] states and further economic and  political rapprochement with Central and East Europe.    It is important to extend the European parliament's  co-decision rights. Such reinforcement forms an essential part  of efforts to strengthen the EU's democratic structures and to  increase further the parliament's involvement in the European  integration process.     "

The  question of knowledgeable people whether he had acted upon  whisperings from the Elysee Palace or the Quai d'Orsay or  whether he broke all the rules of diplomacy on his own account  is secondary, no matter how interesting it may be to those  affected.    Obviously, a rules violation was necessary to tear through  the veil of a cover-up. It is true: Germans and French are  having a row. Neither Bonn nor Paris are capable of coming to  grips with the new state of affairs. The political class in  France is unable to accept that the central location of the  larger Germany means an increase in power in an expanded  European Union. How nice it was when the just semisovereign  neighbor had to cling to Paris' coat-tails.    German foreign policy is in danger of underestimating how  strongly the ghosts of the past are still haunting Europe. It  must not overlook how difficult it is for neighbors in the west  and in the south to stomach the relativization of their  importance. The Germans are the ones who have benefited most  from the end of the Cold War and now also from Europe's growing  together. Anyone who is so enormously lucky should keep alive  all the sensitivity of which he is capable to correctly  understand the nervousness to the west of the Rhine and  alleviate it in time.     "
0,FT944-15178 ,"FT944-15178 _AN-EJSE2AGSFT 941019   FT  19 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU urged to reduce sugar beet production      By ALISON MAITLAND   The European Union should seize the opportunity of forthcoming reforms to of the sugar regime to cut beet output and help competing cane producers in developing nations, according to a London-based development agency. The Catholic Institute for International Relations said in a report* on the regime that the millions of tonnes of subsidised sugar the EU exported each year depressed world prices and deprived producers in developing countries of badly-needed foreign exchange. It urged the EU to phase out price support for beet production that exceeds domestic demand, compensating farmers for loss of revenue through other payments, for example linked to environmentally-friendly farming. The European Commission is due to unveil proposals for regime's reform in the next few weeks. The charity said that the Uruguay Round trade deal driving the reforms would do little to raise world prices and help developing nations. A fall in EU sugar exports of about 250,000 tonnes at most would be 'a drop in the ocean' compared with its exports of 5.7m tonnes last year and would unlikely raise world prices by more than 0.5 per cent. But cuts in EU support prices triggered by the Gatt requirement to reduce subsidised exports would have a disproportionate impact on former colonies which have preferential trade agreements with the EU under the Lome convention. 'For the high-cost ACP producers of the Caribbean, even a small price fall would have serious consequences,' it said. *Sugar: Europe's bittersweet policies.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pledging with West German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl that their countries would work together to develop ""a peaceful  European order,"" made clear Moscow's preference for a place in the ""common  European home,"" as he put it, over the role of a superpower with global  interests.    ""Although the continent has been divided for decades, the awareness of Europe's  identity and common assets has endured and is becoming ever stronger,"" the two  leaders said in a joint declaration. ""This development must be encouraged.    ""The Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany consider it a paramount  objective of their policies to continue Europe's historical traditions and thus  contribute towards overcoming the division of Europe. They are resolved to work  together in the search to develop a Europe of peace and cooperation -- a  peaceful European order, a common European home. . . .""    The Soviet Union hopes that such efforts will end its long isolation from the  political coalescence and the economic development that have brought Western  Europe such stability and prosperity and now threatens to leave Moscow and its  allies in Eastern Europe behind completely as the European Community moves to  establish a unified market in 1992.    ""Gorbachev realized -- and it took much insight and integrity to do so -- that  the Soviet Union had lost in the arms race to the United States, was losing in  the economic race to Japan and the European Community and would become a third-  or fourth-rank power in 20 or 30 years,"" a senior European ambassador said in  Moscow recently. ""The Russian fear is that they will be thought of as Asians,  irrelevant to Europe, and just forgotten as we move ahead.    ""Gorbachev's best bet, politically and economically, was to return to Europe if  the Soviet Union has any chance of keeping up. But that means ending the old  thinking of 'We are bigger and stronger than you' or 'We have a better system  than you,' and it means more than slogans about peace, friendship and  cooperation. If the Russians want a place in Europe, they will have to earn  it.""    In West Germany, however, Gorbachev found a partner willing -- more than  Britain and France so far have been -- to respond to Soviet needs and accept  Moscow's desire to participate in shaping the Europe of the 21st Century.    ""The 'division of Europe' has a special meaning here,"" a senior West German  official remarked Wednesday, ""and while Kohl understands something different  from what Gorbachev means when he says it, there is enough common ground for us  to cooperate.""    A political commentator put it more tartly on West German television Wednesday:  ""Mikhail Gorbachev was looking for a solid boulder to be his anchor while he  winched the Soviet Union into political and economic modernity, and Helmut Kohl  said the Federal Republic of Germany would be that boulder.""    In return, the Soviet Union has already begun to soften its opposition --  adamant and often angry in the past -- to the possible reunification of East  and West Germany. Talking with journalists after signing the joint statement,  Gorbachev said of that issue, ""Let time decide.""    ""I think that the world is changing, and changing for the better,"" the Soviet  leader said, ""and it is opening possibilities for better contacts between all  states.    ""If we are wise and far-sighted, then a good number of profound changes can  take place in Europe and in the whole world.""    In October, Gorbachev had bluntly told Kohl in Moscow that even talking about  reunification was dangerous, for it threatened Europe's postwar stability.    And one Soviet specialist on Europe, Vladislav Belov, went as far last week as  to suggest that he could see growing cooperation between socialist East Germany  and capitalist West Germany leading to a decision by them -- as ""two  independent and sovereign states"" -- on some sort of reunification.    The Berlin Wall, Belov added, would then be little more than a museum piece if  it still existed.    ""As a symbol, I believe the Wall will be destroyed sometime,"" he told a  briefing at the Foreign Ministry in Moscow.    On this trip, Gorbachev emphasized that, in signing what has already become  known as the ""Bonn Declaration,"" ""we are drawing a line on the postwar period .  . . (and taking) a decisive step in the direction of one another.""    For the Soviet Union, the joint statement signed by Gorbachev and Kohl does  mark a substantial change in the way it views the world -- and itself.    As one of the fundamental shifts in Soviet strategy under Gorbachev, the  decision reflects a harsh appraisal by the Soviet leadership of the country's  problems and capabilities, according to senior Gorbachev advisers.    ""We inherited an empire and made it even grander, but we cannot afford it or  even run it,"" one top Soviet foreign policy specialist said here, explaining  the reorientation of his country's strategy. ""Today, our people realize that,  until we build our own country and make it strong within, anything we do abroad  will be little more than an adventure. . . .    ""But, if we are not to be a superpower, then what are we? First of all, we are  a European country -- not a small one, perhaps even a great one, but definitely  a European nation. So, let us find our place in Europe.""    Moscow, which until a year ago refused to recognize the European Community,  although its 12 members were reshaping the continent, accepts now that its  future in Europe requires active cooperation with the community and with the  larger Council of Europe, which it had also long disdained.    The joint efforts pledged by Gorbachev to elaborate with Kohl and other  European leaders new concepts of cooperation will give a Soviet foreign policy  a different and, in some ways, a tighter focus so that European concerns become  far more prominent.    ""These are relations between great powers,"" Vitaly V. Zhurkin, director of the  Soviet Institute of Europe, said in appraising the Soviet-West German summit --  diminishing the Soviet Union as he elevated West Germany a bit.    Moscow realizes, of course, that its international responsibility will  continue, senior Soviet foreign policy specialists say. Soviet military power  remains second only to that of the United States, and arms reduction agreements  will require time to negotiate.    The Soviet Union is also a major Asian nation, facing Japan and bordering on  China, and these interests must be balanced with the new emphasis on Europe.    ""We will have a European focus and an Asian focus and a special relationship  with the United States,"" a Soviet political commentator with the Gorbachev  delegation remarked, ""but the chronic overreaching of the past has ended.""    Moscow is hoping, however, that a significant improvement in relations with the  West as a whole will follow.    ""Our relations with West Germany will go a long way toward shaping Europe for  the rest of this century and well into the next,"" Georgy A. Arbatov, director  of the Soviet Institute for Study of the U.S.A. and Canada, said here. ""This  will also have a substantial impact, we believe, on Soviet-American relations.    ""We should recall that when something happens in our relations with West  Germany, it signifies a turn for the better, as happened with our peace treaty  in 1970, or for the worse. There is a strong movement for global changes that  are ripe, or even overdue, and this development should help them.""    Changes in domestic policies are also implicit as the Soviet Union seeks to  re-establish itself as a European country and no longer emphasizes the  socialist character of its political and economic system.    After dismissing the democracies of Western Europe as ""bourgeois"" or even  political shams for many years, the Soviet Union has committed itself to a  political order in the Bonn Declaration that enshrines their most basic ideals.    With its own economic system evolving away from central planning toward ""market  socialism,"" the Soviet Union is actively seeking assistance from West Germany  and other capitalist countries not just to develop its backward economy but to  train market-oriented managers to run it.    ""The future is economic integration, not isolation,"" an economist in the Soviet  delegation said. ""We thought central planning could do it all, and we were  wrong. We thought that by relying on our own resources we could grow faster and  become stronger, and we were wrong. And, quite foolishly, we thought we should  protect our 'socialist purity' from contamination by the market.""    Although Soviet ideologists had long claimed that socialism had created a ""new  Soviet man"" and a ""new Soviet culture,"" both superior to anything in the West,  the country will now be seeking to re-establish what was European in its  traditions as a basis of ensuring the country's reintegration into Europe.

0,FT933-9696 ,"FT933-9696 _AN-DHHAJAE8FT 930807   FT  07 AUG 93 / Hawks  Handsaws: Update for the KGB bosses      By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL   I WAS struck, this week, by a worrying thought. I realised that I had left the KGB bosses in St Petersburg dangling in the lurch. Not that they are called the KGB any more. They are known as the Russian security ministry. But in the lurch they dangled. I first made contact with the security bosses in St Petersburg 10 months ago. I did so because I had read that they were miffed that Barbara Hay, the new British consul-general to that city, had been offered sumptuous quarters near the town hall in which to ply her dangerous trade. The security bosses were miffed because ultra-secret cables carrying government messages run under this building. As a result, they believed that the British intelligence service would be able to tap into these cables 'using various technical means and devices'. So I sailed to Ms Hay's rescue. I rang Andrei Korodkhov at the security ministry, and told him that if he would get Ms Hay bedded comfortably in her new quarters I would radio him, regularly, intelligence news from London to counterbalance anything Ms Hay might learn by tapping into the security cables beneath her building. I sent my first bulletin to St Petersburg on October 30 1992, and a second two months later. Then - nothing. I forgot about the KGB, which was not a good career move. So this week I made amends by radioing a bumper bulletin, encrypted, as before, in five-digital numerical groups transformed (via false addition: 2 + 3 = 7) by a second devious encryption. To start with, I filled them in on the ERM. 'The collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism', I radioed, 'holds important lessons for fledgling Russia. First, never trust the Germans. Second, never believe the French. The ERM was an attempt to bring stability to western Europe's warring currencies. Unfortunately, it worked reasonably well for a long time and then surprisingly badly for a short time. A bit like democracy, in fact. 'The ERM collapsed because it produced appalling unemployment, dangerous smog levels, dirty beaches, a plague of boll weevils, a fall in standards throughout Europe's media, rioting at cricket matches and a surge in reported cases of rudeness and date rape. You are lucky you have got the rouble to anchor you to reality.' Then I gave them a business story. They like a nice business story in St Petersburg. 'UK corporate biggie Cadbury Schweppes', I radioed, 'plans to sell chocolate pandas to Chinese children - all 999m of them  - as part of a plan to grab market leadership in the Chinese confectionery market. In 1991, the Chinese consumed only 11,000 tonnes of chocolate whereas Britons consumed 507,000 tonnes. Cadbury's chocky is even more addictive than opium. Russia had better toss its hat into the ring, because full-scale chocky wars are predicted by century's end.' Apart from business and money matters, the Russians like to hear about the British aristocracy and monarchy (the two are very different), so I updated them on the eclipse of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, whose memorial service was held in London this week. ''Intrigue follows penniless society beauty to grave',' I started, quoting The Times' headline. Then I returned to normal mode: 'The duchess was a woman of prodigious and fleshly appetites', I radioed, 'just like Catherine the Great. Her behaviour shocked everyone. In a democracy, the advantage of having aristocrats and a monarchy is that their cavortings, caperings, sprees and feuds help take the heat off the government when times are hard. The Russian parliament should restore your monarchy at once and create several hundred noblemen. Then sit back and watch the fun.' After that I turned to fashion, with this quote from The Face: ''Casual nouveau est arrive . . . on the post-rave back of 1,000 stoned lads who've seen fit to spend less cash on records and more on clothes. In its most literal form, this reawakened interest in . . . conspicuous consumption and obscure sportswear is unashamedly and simply retro'.' I had no idea what this meant, but the code-breakers in St Petersburg are skilful and resourceful. Finally I sent a joke, from the FT's Observer column: 'When is the ERM not an ERM? When it's an ERM-aphrodite.' I bet they loved that in St Petersburg. Probably split their sides.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.   Industries:-  P99   Nonclassifiable Establishments.

The extension, agreed by the MFA's 44 members yesterday, was made necessary by the repeated delay in concluding the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. If the round is successfully completed by the deadline of next Wednesday, the MFA will be phased out over a 10-year period from 1995. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, said the latest extension, the sixth since 1974, was 'the final lease of life for the MFA'. Members of the MFA, which legitimises a web of bilateral quota deals between rich and poor nations, accounted for Dollars 136bn or 80 per cent of world textile and clothing exports in 1990. Representatives of Europe's textile and clothing industry were also in Geneva yesterday to raise concerns over the terms under which the MFA will be dismantled. The proposed Uruguay Round deal was 'far from offering the necessary guarantees of fair and balanced competition', the Brussels-based European Textile and Clothing Coalition said in a statement, arguing that the EU was one of the most open markets in the world. The coalition said the US offer to lower very high tariffs on clothing was inadequate and criticised the refusal of some developing country exporters such as India and Thailand to open their domestic markets to imports. The European industry said it would continue to press for a Uruguay Round package incorporating lower tariff and non-tariff barriers worldwide, and tougher action against unfair trading practices in developing countries including counterfeiting, dumping and subsidies.

His criticism comes two days before the government and the water industry will press for a revision of the EC 1980 drinking water directive to allow countries more discretion in setting standards. Speaking in Manchester at an international environmental conference hosted by the government, Mr Yeo said the 'temperature, taste and odour' of drinking water were 'not the European Commission's business'. Tomorrow's meeting of government officials in Brussels was organised by the commission after months of lobbying by Eureau, the association of European water suppliers. It will be the first attempt to renegotiate the drinking water directive. Mr Yeo called the directive 'very out-of-date'. Much of the UK water industry's Pounds 45bn investment programme is directed towards meeting EC standards on drinking water and sewage treatment. The water services association, which represents the 10 large UK water companies, together with Ofwat, the industry regulator, have called for a revision of the standards to help slow the rise in bills. Mr Yeo acknowledged that other countries - particularly the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark - may call on Britain to tighten controls on agricultural pesticides. Any move to restrict farmers from using pesticides, which contaminate water supplies and need expensive treatment to be removed, is likely to provoke controversy between the government and farmers. The Eureau proposals call for new drinking water standards to focus on health, not 'aesthetic factors', and to specify average levels of permitted substances instead of maximum levels.

But the successive salvos of stinging attacks  by Cambodian co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and  Deputy Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut last week hardly  served to address the crux of the problems.    By airing their grievances to the mass media, both Ranariddh  and Sirivut must have hoped to drum up international pressures  to force Thailand to terminate what they believe is continuous,  clandestine Thai support for the outlawed guerrilla faction.  But although they might have succeeded in re-focusing media  attention on the subject, the crude tactics they adopted also  achieved the counter-productive effect of souring the atmosphere  of bilateral relations with Thailand.    Ranariddh kicked off the latest anti-Thailand barrage by  claiming he possessed photographic evidence that showed Thai  troops helped Pol Pot escape the recent Cambodian government  attack on Pailin. But he clarified his accusation a day later by  explaining that he actually meant the Pol Potists--a reference  to the Khmer Rouge--but not the guerrilla leader himself.    Since the said evidence was not made public, it wasn't clear  whether Ranariddh was just bluffing. Indeed Ranariddh could  contribute to improving relations by producing the evidence if  it was really in his possession, so that this bilateral  sore-point could be seriously addressed.    There are enough Thais in this country who do not condone  clandestine support for the Khmer Rouge and would certainly  question any such shady military practice. Given the persistent  denials by the Army leadership of any such assistance, it would  be bound to weed out undesirable elements stationed in the  border areas which violate the policy that is, on the face of  concrete evidence.    But the breach of diplomatic protocol committed by Sirivut  was more disturbing. What on earth was he trying to achieve by  publicizing this contentious issue in Kuala Lumpur aside from  further aggravating an already strained atmosphere of bilateral  ties with Thailand? Surely he could have been more discreet,  especially since this is very much a Thai-Cambodian problem  which can be resolved only by the two countries.    As a result of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's recent visit  to  Cambodia, Bangkok and Phnom Penh were supposed to put into place  a hotline to coordinate various bilateral problems of a serious  and urgent nature. But judging from the surprised reactions by  senior Thai officials, who claimed they have to verify  wire-service reports to ascertain that both Ranariddh and  Sirivut were not misquoted, it was apparent there was a  breakdown of communications both through the normal diplomatic  channels as well as the special hotline contact.    Notwithstanding the Cambodian leaders' undiplomatic  outbursts, the deep-seeded resentment inherent in their latest  accusations nonetheless call for serious attention and  investigation by the Thai side. In essence, it would require a  combination of policy adjustments and changes in attitude by  both sides for relations to improve. Thailand and Cambodia are  neighboring countries that have no other choice but forging at  least a proper relationship of peaceful coexistence if not  substantive political and economic ties.    With the embarrassing police discovery of a huge secret  arsenal near the Thai-Cambodian border last December still fresh  in our memory, the Thai Army cannot simply dismiss the latest  Cambodian accusations outright. Army Commander Gen. Wimon  Wongwanit should be believed and trusted when he says the Thai  military does not support the Khmer Rouge. Indeed there is  probably no such policy. But the conduct of certain military  officers stationed at the border who enjoy longstanding  connections and share certain vested interests with the Khmer  Rouge is a different matter.    One alleged piece of `evidence' warranting investigation is  an undated photograph found in Pailin and released by AFP which  purportedly shows senior Khmer Rouge commanders and Pailin chief  Kim Chean toasting out-of-uniform Thai soldiers at an  undisclosed Khmer Rouge headquarters in western Cambodia. Are  those identified as Thai soldiers really Thai soldiers? That  should be easy enough for the army to find out.    The Thai civilian and military leaderships have the  collective task to weed out whatever wayward elements stationed  on the border areas which collude with the Khmer Rouge. It is  the conduct of these elements that presents the bone of  contention with Cambodia and casts Thailand in a poor light  internationally. Persistent accusations of complicity by some  officers in the gems and timber trade with the Khmer Rouge must  be investigated and those found to do so eliminated. Otherwise,  the mistrust of the Thai military will not be mollified.     "
0,FT923-11802 ,"FT923-11802 _AN-CGWASAAJFT 920723   FT  23 JUL 92 / Brussels moves on air control      By ANDREW HILL      BRUSSELS   THE European Commission yesterday restarted the process of nudging EC member states towards a single air traffic control system and relieving congestion in the skies. Commissioners adopted legislation aimed at harmonising and integrating air traffic control equipment in Europe's 54 control centres. The centres currently use 31 different and incompatible technical systems and 70 different computer languages. Under the Commission's plans, new surveillance, navigation and communication systems would have to conform to a single set of standards developed by Eurocontrol, the 14-nation air traffic control organisation based in Brussels. The Commission has already tried once to persuade member states to harmonise the complex European system. Three directives were produced in 1988, with broadly the same aim, but they were rejected by EC ministers keen to protect sovereignty over their own airspace. Now, according to Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC transport commissioner, the time is ripe for a new effort. 'Little by little, the member states have begun to change their minds,' he said yesterday. 'They now recognise that the Community has an important role to play.' In March, transport ministers from the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) outlined a plan to improve the air traffic control system, and last week European airlines called on the European authorities to act quickly to relieve congestion. But Mr Van Miert made clear yesterday that progress would be gradual and that this directive was only the first step. Delays and cancellations have now become a notorious feature of air travel in Europe, particularly in the summer.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Clinton made the pledge at a conference held here on Sunday  [9 January] after his arrival for a NATO summit starting today.    ""I have come here today to declare and to demonstrate that  Europe remains central to the interests of the United States,  and that we will help to work with our partners in seizing the  opportunities before us all,"" he said.    The President also talked about a new security for Europe  and  promised that the U.S. will be a ""strong partner"" in building  that security.    ""The new security must be found in Europe's integration --  an  integration of security forces, of market economies, of national  democracies,"" he said.    He pointed out that the new security for Europe needs three  elements -- military strength and cooperation, greater economic  vitality, and democratic process in the Central and East  European countries. The first element is the most important, he  added.    ""The Cold War is over, but war itself is not over. It rages  today not only in distant lands but right here in Europe and the  former Yugoslavia,"" said the president.    Clinton also stressed the importance of NATO's role in  providing security for Europe and called for NATO's closer  cooperation with the former Warsaw Pact countries.    He said the partnership for peace, a proposal due to be  adopted at the NATO summit, will create a framework in which  former Warsaw Pact member countries and other non-NATO members  can participate in joint military planning, training, exercises  and other efforts.    But he did not give promise to let them become members of  NATO.     "

From Associated Press      RIO DE JANEIRO      The Copacabana Palace Hotel, a Rio landmark that once hosted European royalty  and Hollywood movie stars but fell on hard times, has been taken over by the  American businessman who restored Europe's Orient Express train.    ""The Copa,"" on Rio's famous Copacabana Beach on the South Atlantic coast, has  been declining for more than 20 years. But James Sherwood has pledged to  restore the hotel's glory.    The new general manager, Philip Carruthers, would not say how much Sherwood  paid in September to buy a controlling interest in the hotel. Local press  estimates ran from $70 million to $100 million. But he said no expense would be  spared to modernize and improve the hotel.    ""The hotel is considered to be part of the country's heritage, so the facade  won't be touched. But the inside will be completely modernized, so we can make  the place successful again,"" Carruthers, a Brazil-reared Englishman, said.    Sherwood is chairman of the London-based, $2-billion Sea Containers Ltd., a  leading producer of shipping containers.    Sea Containers owns 42% of Orient Express Hotels Inc., which will run the Copa.  The purchase of the hotel is the first tourism investment in South America by  Sherwood, whose firms already run hotels in the United States, the Bahamas,  Italy, Scotland, England and Portugal.    Orient Express Hotels refurbished the famous train of the same name, which  during its heyday in the 1920s ran from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, crossing  the English Channel by ferryboat.    The train, which suspended service in the early 1970s, resumed operations in  1983 and now makes twice-weekly runs between London and Venice.    ""The Orient Express has been re-established as a luxury form of transport,  fully restored in 1920s style,"" said Carruthers, adding that Sherwood hopes to  do the same with the Copa, once considered one of the world's 20 best hotels.    ""Mr. Sherwood has always been keen on the hotel. It's an imposing building on  an extraordinary site, with wonderful black and white pavement,"" said Sea  Containers Ltd. spokeswoman Naida Stancioff in London. She was referring to the  wide mosaic sidewalk that lines the 2 1/2-mile long Copacabana Beach.    The Copa, inaugurated in 1923, was the creation of Brazil's then-president  Epitacio Pessoa, who lamented Rio's lack of a first-class luxury hotel to  accommodate prominent visitors with the same pomp with which Pessoa was  received in Europe.    Businessman Octavio Guinle, whose family controlled the Copa until it was  bought by Sherwood, told Pessoa he would construct a hotel to rival Europe's  finest if he could install a casino. At the time, Rio had no large tourist  market and Guinle felt gambling was necessary to make the hotel profitable.    Pessoa agreed. Guinle imported cement from Germany, marble from Italy, crystals  from Czechoslovakia and furniture from France.    The hotel, designed by architect Joseph Gire, contains 223 rooms, including a  huge presidential suite overlooking the ocean, 14 party rooms, a theater and  the ""Golden Room"" for special attractions. The facade, inspired by hotels in  Cannes and Nice, France, is a mix of classical styles.    The hotel has been famous for social significance -- people here say there was  a time when coming to Rio and not staying at the Copa was like going to Rome  and not seeing the Pope.    Over the years, Maurice Chevalier, Nat King Cole, Edith Piaf and Ella  Fitzgerald performed in the Golden Room.    The hotel has welcomed world leaders ranging from Dwight Eisenhower to Eva  Peron, Fidel Castro to the Shah of Iran. Animals were prohibited in the Copa  after Magda Lupesco, paramour of King Carol I of Romania, kept eight Pekingese  in her room and they ate the drapes.    The most legendary stories concern movie stars.    Orson Welles threw a bed into the swimming pool from his second-floor window  after Delores Del Rio broke off their romance.    In 1939, Errol Flynn pranced naked through the halls. Nudity reared its head  again in the early 1960s when Jayne Mansfield nonchalantly sat topless at pool  side and made headlines for a week.    Other famous guests of the Copa have included Brigitte Bardot, Joan Crawford,  Clark Gable and Tyrone Power.    In 1946 President Eurico Dutra outlawed gambling, and the Copa casino closed.  But the hotel continued to reign as queen of Rio's social life until 1960.    In that year, the national capital was moved from Rio to the inland city of  Brasilia, and the hotel lost the glamour of putting up visiting VIPs.    The real crunch came in the 1970s, when several international firms opened  modern five-star hotels in Copacabana. By the early 1980s the number of Copa  employees had been cut by two-thirds, and the hotel was barely breaking even.    ""The Copa had been resting on its laurels for years. The owners were so used to  being the hotel in Rio they felt they no longer had to compete,"" said  Carruthers.    He said current problems range from leaky plumbing to shoddy interiors.    But renovations, set to begin by next April, should be completed by mid-1991.  Carruthers said there are even plans to reopen the Golden Room and bring back  world-class performers.

Europe is back.    The 1980s, with the dawning of the era of the Pacific Rim, was a decade in  which most of the economic attention -- and conflict -- between the United  States and its trading partners centered on Japan and the growing export  prowess of such Asian nations as South Korea and Taiwan.    No longer. At least for now, Washington's trade problems with Japan and the  rest of Asia are receding into the background. And tensions between Washington  and some of its European allies are rising.    A newly ebullient Western Europe is emerging from the pessimism that gripped it  in the early 1980s. Its own impending economic integration in 1992 and Eastern  Europe's plunge toward free markets are bound to make the United States and  Europe ever more interdependent and prone to economic and trade fights.    ""With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the sheer magnitude of the issues facing  the United States in Europe are going to dominate the Administration's  attention,"" says David Hale, an economic historian who heads Kemper Financial's  economic research unit in Chicago. ""At the same time, people have simply gotten  tired of re-running the U.S.-Japan conflict over and over again.""    The quarrels between Washington and Europe will range from such small issues as  steel quotas and growth hormones in cattle feed to far more fundamental  disputes over farm subsidies, transatlantic investment and how best to absorb  the crumbling Soviet Bloc into the world economy.    ""In terms of both policy challenges and business opportunities, most of the  action in the 1990s will be in Europe,"" says Michael Aho, director of the  international trade project at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York.  ""We still have problems with Japan, but many of them are decades old.  Meanwhile, the European Community is changing the rules of the game.""    The seven-nation economic summit here provides telling evidence of just such a  shift in focus. While U.S. officials had nothing but praise for Japan, the Bush  Administration wasn't so kind or gentle with respect to Europe.    As the summit opened Monday, both Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter and  U.S. chief trade negotiator Carla A. Hills trained their big guns on the  12-nation European Community's longstanding intransigence in the ongoing  negotiations over its massive farm subsidies.    ""Our concern with . . . the European Community thus far is that they simply  have not been engaged,"" Yeutter said. ""We cannot negotiate with ourselves.""    Going further, Yeutter directly challenged Europe's claim that its small  farmers deserve special consideration.    ""The fact is the community is not competitive in agriculture and that's why it  does not prefer free trade. The community, of course, is strongly in favor of  additional trade liberalization in areas where it is competitive,"" Yeutter  said. ""It's nice to be able to have your cake and eat it, too, if you can --  but that's really not the way the world works.""    When Hills weighed in, she was just as blunt. The dispute over agricultural  trade, she said, pits the EC against ""all exporting nations, of which the  United States happens to be one. Could the United States be . . . more  flexible, less stubborn, and succeed? The answer is no. Were we to not get  fundamental reform . . . we would have 40 nations get up and leave these  negotiations.""    Meanwhile, even though public attention is still riveted on the potential  economic threat from Asia, the decades-long trade dispute between Washington  and Tokyo has moved to the back burner.    ""People may be far more concerned about Japan than the Europeans,"" said Alan  Stoga, economic analyst at Kissinger Associates in New York, ""but as far as the  Bush Administration is concerned, the big strategic issues are in Europe.""    Last month's broad Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) agreement, which  covered such wide-ranging issues as expanding public investment in Japan and  shrinking the U.S. budget deficit, ""concludes an era in U.S.-Japanese  relations,"" said a senior Administration official. ""It marks a real turning  point in our relationship.""    Not everyone is convinced that troubles in Asia are over.    ""The fundamental causes of trade friction between (Japan and the United States)  have not been addressed,"" argues Clyde Prestowitz, a former U.S. trade official  who now heads the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. The SII agreement,  he adds, creates ""a false impression of solving problems when we should be  preparing to manage continued bilateral tensions.""    Indeed, there's little doubt that the United States has not seen the last of  its trade conflicts with Japan, which continues to maintain deeply entrenched  business practices that serve to keep out foreign goods. ""If the trade deficit  with Japan starts widening again,"" said Stoga, ""the issue will return with a  vengeance.""    Nonetheless, not only Washington but the whole world is clearly obsessed with  the historic developments in Europe.    ""Europe is at the dawn of a new era,"" trumpeted the seven summit nations in  their political declaration Tuesday.    While unquestionably welcome, the economic revival of Europe will pose entirely  new challenges for the Bush Administration.    ""The rest of the world understands better than we do that the world economic  stage now has three elephants -- the U.S., Europe and Japan -- rather than just  one,"" says the Foreign Relations Council's Aho. ""Unless we develop a vision of  how to deal with that, it could get pretty crowded up there.""

No longer. At least for now, Washington's trade problems with Japan and the  rest of Asia are receding into the background. And tensions between Washington  and some of its European allies are rising.    A newly ebullient Western Europe is emerging from the pessimism that gripped it  in the early 1980s. Its own impending economic integration in 1992 and Eastern  Europe's plunge toward free markets are bound to make the United States and  Europe ever more interdependent and prone to economic and trade fights.    ""With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the sheer magnitude of the issues facing  the United States in Europe are going to dominate the Administration's  attention,"" says David Hale, an economic historian who heads Kemper Financial's  economic research unit in Chicago. ""At the same time, people have simply gotten  tired of re-running the U.S.-Japan conflict over and over again.""    The quarrels between Washington and Europe will range from such small issues as  steel quotas and growth hormones in cattle feed to far more fundamental  disputes over farm subsidies, transatlantic investment and how best to absorb  the crumbling Soviet Bloc into the world economy.    ""In terms of both policy challenges and business opportunities, most of the  action in the 1990s will be in Europe,"" says Michael Aho, director of the  international trade project at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York.  ""We still have problems with Japan, but many of them are decades old.  Meanwhile, the European Community is changing the rules of the game.""    The seven-nation economic summit here provides telling evidence of just such a  shift in focus. While U.S. officials had nothing but praise for Japan, the Bush  Administration wasn't so kind or gentle with respect to Europe.    As the summit opened Monday, both Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter and  U.S. chief trade negotiator Carla A. Hills trained their big guns on the  12-nation European Community's longstanding intransigence in the ongoing  negotiations over its massive farm subsidies.    ""Our concern with . . . the European Community thus far is that they simply  have not been engaged,"" Yeutter said. ""We cannot negotiate with ourselves.""    Going further, Yeutter directly challenged Europe's claim that its small  farmers deserve special consideration.    ""The fact is the community is not competitive in agriculture and that's why it  does not prefer free trade. The community, of course, is strongly in favor of  additional trade liberalization in areas where it is competitive,"" Yeutter  said. ""It's nice to be able to have your cake and eat it, too, if you can --  but that's really not the way the world works.""    When Hills weighed in, she was just as blunt. The dispute over agricultural  trade, she said, pits the EC against ""all exporting nations, of which the  United States happens to be one. Could the United States be . . . more  flexible, less stubborn, and succeed? The answer is no. Were we to not get  fundamental reform . . . we would have 40 nations get up and leave these  negotiations.""    Meanwhile, even though public attention is still riveted on the potential  economic threat from Asia, the decades-long trade dispute between Washington  and Tokyo has moved to the back burner.    ""People may be far more concerned about Japan than the Europeans,"" said Alan  Stoga, economic analyst at Kissinger Associates in New York, ""but as far as the  Bush Administration is concerned, the big strategic issues are in Europe.""    Last month's broad Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) agreement, which  covered such wide-ranging issues as expanding public investment in Japan and  shrinking the U.S. budget deficit, ""concludes an era in U.S.-Japanese  relations,"" said a senior Administration official. ""It marks a real turning  point in our relationship.""    Not everyone is convinced that troubles in Asia are over.    ""The fundamental causes of trade friction between (Japan and the United States)  have not been addressed,"" argues Clyde Prestowitz, a former U.S. trade official  who now heads the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. The SII agreement,  he adds, creates ""a false impression of solving problems when we should be  preparing to manage continued bilateral tensions.""    Indeed, there's little doubt that the United States has not seen the last of  its trade conflicts with Japan, which continues to maintain deeply entrenched  business practices that serve to keep out foreign goods. ""If the trade deficit  with Japan starts widening again,"" said Stoga, ""the issue will return with a  vengeance.""    Nonetheless, not only Washington but the whole world is clearly obsessed with  the historic developments in Europe.    ""Europe is at the dawn of a new era,"" trumpeted the seven summit nations in  their political declaration Tuesday.    While unquestionably welcome, the economic revival of Europe will pose entirely  new challenges for the Bush Administration.    ""The rest of the world understands better than we do that the world economic  stage now has three elephants -- the U.S., Europe and Japan -- rather than just  one,"" says the Foreign Relations Council's Aho. ""Unless we develop a vision of  how to deal with that, it could get pretty crowded up there.""

Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, yesterday persuaded Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, to set up joint commissions to head off confrontation over the Bos-Gabcikovo hydroelectric project. The timetable for agreement is tight because construction is approaching the point of no return. Slovakia plans in mid-October to force much of the flow of Europe's largest river into a 25km channel elevated up to 18 metres above the surrounding plain and bigger than the Suez canal. The Hungarian prime minister said in unequivocal terms yesterday that Hungary would consider the diversion of the river a 'territorial violation' and an infringement of the post-war peace settlement. Despite the agreement on further talks, yesterday's meeting between the prime ministers in Budapest left the two sides as far apart as ever. The Hungarian government can ill-afford to give in for domestic political reasons. The democratic opposition which toppled the former regime was born out of hostility to the communist-inspired dam. Slovakia, on the other hand, remains adamant it cannot afford to halt project. The Bratislava government says the work is too far gone and 20bn korunas (Dollars 746m) has already been spent on the dam, which will supply 10 per cent of the country's energy needs. Bilateral relations, already poisoned by the intractable dispute over the Gabcikovo barrage, are troubled further by disagreement over the status of the 800,000-strong Hungarian minority in Slovakia.

The contract is believed to be the largest awarded to power suppliers worldwide in recent months, and underlines the importance of the fast-growing Malaysian market for power equipment, due to the country's strong economic performance. It comes six weeks after Malaysia imposed a ban on UK companies bidding for public contracts in protest at reports in the UK media of corruption. The ban was a blow to UK power equipment suppliers and contractors such as Rolls-Royce and John Brown, although contractors have been hoping they could still win orders from private customers. The Lumut order was placed by Sikap Energy Ventures, a Malaysian independent power producer. There were no rival UK bidders to ABB. The gas-fired plant will be Malaysia's largest combined-cycle power station, and ABB said it would supply about 11 per cent of the country's electricity needs. Construction will begin immediately and the first stage of the project is due to be operating by July 1996, with the rest ready by July 1997. The station will be equipped with six ABB gas turbines, two steam turbines and eight associated electrical generators. It will incorporate ABB's low-NOx burners to produce high fuel efficiency with low emissions.

The company said it would monitor its use of agrochemicals and artificial fertilisers more closely as well as looking at the use of rotation systems and different forms of cultivation in order to farm in a more environmentally-friendly way. 'We are really taking modern technology and combining it with the best traditional methods,' an official said. The new study will take place on 24 hectares on the company's Bundish Hall Farm, which is adjacent to Boarded Barns where organic methods have been employed on 24 hectares for the past five years. Rhone Poulenc has found that the gross margins on its organic sector have consistently been around half of those achieved on its conventional acres. Over a four-year period, the cumulative gross margin per hectare has been Pounds 2,557 for the organic part and Pounds 5,487 for the conventional fields. 'All our indications are that the gap will continue to widen between the organic and conventional profit levels,' said a company official, 'with ICM we're looking at a refinement of the conventional system.' The new ICM approach aims to be as profitable as conventional farming since any slight reduction in yields should be compensated for by the lower cost of agrochemicals and other inputs which will be reduced. A large cost for the organic land is the need to grow a fertility crop such as clover every couple of years in the land's rotation system to improve soil fertility.   Companies:-  Rhone Poulenc.

0,FT942-4103 ,"FT942-4103 _AN-EFLAKABWFT 940611   FT  11 JUN 94 / Trouble bubbles on the Y-front: Europe's soap powder war may get dirtier      By TONY JACKSON   Attentive readers of Europe's popular press in the past few days will have noticed some slightly odd full-page advertisements for well-known brands of washing powder. There are no smiling kids and mums, no ugly stains before and after: just sober, reassuring text. Persil Power, says the UK advertisement, does less damage to clothes than competing powders. Omo Power, Dutch and Austrian readers are told, carries a full money back guarantee: if you are worried, ring this number. For the owner of the brands, the Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever, this is the latest stage in an increasingly hectic attempt at damage limitation. The new brands are in fact identical, and represent a major offensive in Unilever's age-old war against Procter  Gamble of the US for dominance of the world detergents market. According to Procter, Unilever's claims are the reverse of the truth: the new powder, under whatever name, is unacceptably harmful to clothes and should be withdrawn. For the public, the debate has so far been mostly knockabout: lurid photographs of tattered boxer shorts, and tabloid headlines about froth, lather and dirty linen. But the issue is deadly serious, and is preoccupying both companies at the top level. Procter's first assault, in late March, was made by no less a figure than Mr Edwin Artzt, Procter's chairman, who flew from Cincinnati to London to accuse startled Unilever executives of their product's failings. Since the dispute became public a month later, at least one of the blizzard of hostile press releases from Procter has borne the imprint of Mr Artzt's second-in-command, Mr John Pepper. At Unilever, the affair has been absorbing boardroom time for many weeks, particularly that of Mr Niall Fitzgerald, head of worldwide detergents and strongly tipped as the group's next joint chairman. Procter's case is technical in nature, and the argument has become tangled. The essence, however, is simple enough. For many years, the detergents industry has sought to improve its products by incorporating manganese, which makes powders more powerful but tends to damage fabric. Unilever claims to have hit on the answer in 1988. The resulting manganese-based catalyst - dubbed the Accelerator - has been incorporated in a new generation of concentrated powders for the European market, sold in different countries as Persil Power, Omo Power and Via Power. Procter has retaliated by producing apparently damning evidence - backed by the findings of independent research institutes - that the manganese in the Accelerator, far from being kinder to clothes, does them serious damage. Unilever rejects the claims as meaningless. First, it says, the laboratory tests which produced Procter's results bear no relation to real life. Second, in the long run it is the consumer, not the laboratory technician, who decides whether the product succeeds or fails. What Procter has done, Unilever claims, is stand one of the industry's time-honoured tricks on its head. If you want to prove your product superior to a competitor, you pick the exact specifications - type of fabric, type of dye, type of stain - which show it in the best light and the competitor in the worst. You then commission independent tests to those specifications. The result is another of those standard TV commercials showing that new X washes whiter than Y. But the reverse is obviously possible. Pick a thin cotton garment which is heavily dyed, for instance, and wash it repeatedly. By the time the bleach in the detergent has finished removing the dye, there will be little left of the cotton. Unilever claims to have produced this kind of result with Procter products, but dismisses the fact as irrelevant. Any bleach-based detergent would do the same. Procter may or may not have been adopting this kind of tactic. Either way, it is generally felt to be guilty of bad form, since it is giving the whole testing game away. At least one reputable British research institute finds itself in the embarrassing position of having tested Persil Power for both parties, with predictably opposite results. Unilever's case, however, suffers from one crucial weakness. It is now bringing out an amended version of the powder with less Accelerator in it. The plain implication is that when confronted, Unilever has blinked first. The company is defensive about this. It had already decided on the change, it says, as a means of broadening the product's usage. Originally conceived as a heavy-duty detergent, the powder has proved so successful that it is worth re-launching in a diluted version for more delicate fabrics as well. At the same time, this is a simple way of spiking Procter's guns. Well, perhaps. But this brings us to the second strand of Unilever's argument: that the verdict on the product rests with the consumer. While undoubtedly true, the argument is double-edged. Whatever the technical merits of Procter's case, if it succeeds in alarming consumers it will have achieved its object. So far, the row has largely been conducted through the business press, thus having little impact on the mass of Unilever's customers. But it is starting to spill over into the tabloids, thus forcing Unilever to contemplate a full-scale campaign of rebuttal. In itself, this risks making Procter's point. There are few worse ways of introducing a new product to the public than to deny there is anything wrong with it. The big question is what Unilever stands to lose if, in a worst case, the product had to be recalled. Long-established brands such as Persil would be damaged, but the immediate financial effect would be scarcely material to a company of Unilever's size. Several hundred million pounds have been spent on developing and promoting the product, but that is sunk cost spread over a decade. Unilever's total sales of concentrated detergent powders in Europe - all of which are being replaced by the new product - are only around Pounds 300m, which is just over 1 per cent of group turnover. Stocks sold into the trade so far probably total around Pounds 25m. The real risk is one of lost opportunity. It seems clear, if only from Procter's reaction, that the Accelerator - whether flawed or not - poses a real technological threat. Its chief property, as emphasised by this week's advertisements in the UK, is to wash at lower temperatures. In the world outside Europe and North America, clothes are typically washed in cooler water, or even cold. The developing world is the real growth market for detergents, and it is one in which Unilever historically has the edge over Procter. An Accelerator-based powder has just been quietly introduced into Thailand and is claimed to have had huge initial success. The ultimate opportunity could be an attack on the US market. Unilever's record in US detergents is one of deep gloom enlivened by fitful success, and its market share has of late slipped disastrously. The US market is different from Europe's in numerous ways, and the Accelerator technology is not immediately relevant. But one can assume - as Procter doubtless does - that Unilever is looking for ways to change that. All this suggests that neither side can easily back down. There may also be a personal element. Mr Artzt of Procter, on his way to retirement, will badly want to win. Mr Fitzgerald of Unilever, with the chairmanship dangling before him at the young age of 48, can hardly afford to lose.

Forests, are one of the most contentious issues of the summit, and there has been little progress on bridging the north-south divide on the subject. With only one day of working group discussions left it seems unlikely there will be any agreement on deforestation which is continuing at a rate of 17m hectares a year. Mr Andrew Lees from Friends of the Earth said there was a danger the summit was losing sight of vital environmental problems because so much was being negotiated simultaneously in Rio. Forest devastation was continuing 'unhindered' in the meantime. A convention had to be dropped long before the summit and replaced by a non-binding declaration of forest principles which says little other than that forests should be conserved and managed sustainably. Even this is causing controversy at the conference with developing countries, led by Malaysia, seeing it as an infringement of their sovereignty. NGOs argue that the declaration is so weak as to be almost worthless particularly as it includes no firm commitment to halt deforestation. The NGO demands presented to ministers last night include a commitment to follow up the principles with a legally binding instrument, and to allow signatories to set up national policies against trade in unsustainable forest products.

0,FT934-337 ,"FT934-337 _AN-DL2BSAB1FT 931229   FT  29 DEC 93 / Tide of gloom starts to ebb: There is reason to believe that European economies are bouncing back      By PETER NORMAN   It is easy to be glum about Europe. Overall output in the continent's 19 advanced industrialised countries is thought to have fallen this year for the first time since 1975. Western Europe's jobless total is rising inexorably. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris forecasts that 22m, or 11.5 per cent, of the region's labour force will be out of work in 1995. Unemployment, now about 10.7 per cent, has more than doubled in the 18 years since the first serious recession of the postwar years. Business and consumer confidence is weak. For most, the long upsurge of prosperity of the 1980s is a distant memory. So is the age of political miracles that brought the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism just four years ago. With few exceptions, Europe's political leaders appear exhausted. Their governments are deeply unpopular and, saddled with rising budget deficits, incapable of pump-priming economic recovery. Yet 1993 may turn out to be the year in which Europe's fortunes turned. Although it will be remembered for recession, currency crises and lengthening dole queues, 1993 is ending more positively for the members of the European Union and their immediate neighbours. The economic fundamentals have improved. More important, the sense of drift has stopped. Businesses, governments and the European Commission have woken up to the remorseless increase in competition worldwide. Britain's two tough budgets this year, the 'Standort Deutschland' debate in Germany and the Bonn government's subsequent conversion to the doctrine of more work and less leisure, plus the Commission's white paper on Growth Competitiveness and Employment, are symptoms of a change of mood. More telling is what is happening in businesses in the UK and on the continent. Companies are becoming leaner and meaner. The spectre of competition from the newly industrialising countries of east Asia has made the US practice of 'downsizing', with heavy job losses, respectable in Europe. Trade unions are for the most part quiescent and in some cases willing to aid management rationalise operations. This month's boardroom clear-out at Metallgesellschaft, the German industrial conglomerate, after the discovery of large losses, was novel in its ruthlessness. Even the long-running and baffling business soap opera centring on allegations of theft and industrial espionage against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the Volkswagen group production director, began with a serious purpose when VW sought out the former General Motors director to push through a cost-cutting revolution within the group. Such trends are sure to intensify once this month's Uruguay Round accord to liberalise world trade comes into force. The agreement, even before ratification, could act as a spur to companies to invest and rationalise. Over time, the Gatt accord should promote growth, with Europe standing to gain more than most other regions of the world from freer trade. Computer simulations from the OECD suggest that the Uruguay Round will add at least Dollars 270bn in 1991 prices to world income in 2002. The European Union's share is estimated at Dollars 71bn, equivalent to 1.7 per cent of the region's gross domestic product, while that of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries is put at Dollars 38bn or 6 per cent of regional GDP. The real benefits should be greater. Such computer calculations take no account of the increased business confidence that should flow from freer trade or the fact that this month's accord has been felicitously timed after so many years of delay and frustration. Several European economies have performed unexpectedly well in recent months. Britain's recovery is firmly established. German gross domestic product grew in the third as well as the second quarter. France appears to have touched bottom. Trends in smaller economies such as Austria, Switzerland, Ireland and Denmark have been encouraging. The charts, showing relative unit labour costs in manufacturing, illustrate how several big European economies (Germany is an exception) are more competitive internationally than they were a year ago, while Japan has suffered a substantial set back. Short and long-term interest rates have fallen over the past year as the Bundesbank has cautiously eased its monetary policy. The German 'repo rate' is at 6 per cent compared with 9.75 per cent in September 1992, just before the first European monetary crisis, which resulted in the exit of sterling and the lira from the exchange rate mechanism. Since then, UK and Italian short-term rates have roughly halved. France's short-term borrowing costs have fallen close to German levels from about 14 per cent in the 1992 currency crisis and 9 per cent in late July this year before speculative flows forced the August decision to widen the system's fluctuation margins to 15 per cent. Inflation in Europe is low, with the OECD projecting a deceleration for its European members, excluding Turkey, to an average annual rate of 2.3 per cent by the end of 1995 from about 3.1 per cent at present. Oil prices have fallen in real terms to levels last seen before the first oil shock of 1973. Large gaps between potential and actual output in countries such as Italy, France and the UK suggest that home-made inflationary pressures will remain subdued. To be sure, there are risks. Given the political instability of the Middle East, only the brave would bank on oil prices remaining at their present low levels of less than Dollars 15 a barrel. In spite of the past year's falls in nominal interest rates, real rates are relatively high. Some of the optimism that propelled European equity markets to new peaks this month could evaporate if German inflation proves more stubborn than expected and the Bundesbank slows its cautious rate-cutting policy. In some countries, tighter fiscal policies to combat swollen budget deficits could weaken recovery. German GDP is widely expected to fall again in the first half of 1994 as benefit cuts, higher petrol taxes, a wage freeze for civil servants and increased pension contributions take DM60bn from consumers. In Britain, voters have reacted less positively than financial markets to Mr Kenneth Clarke's November Budget, which, with that of Mr Norman Lamont in March, will cost taxpayers a cumulative Pounds 15bn to Pounds 17bn in three years. The fiscal legacy of the recession years in most countries, heavy household debts in the UK and Scandinavia, the continuing need for businesses to restructure to stay competitive, and consequent high unemployment will make for a joyless recovery. There will not be much of a 'feel good' factor in Europe in the years ahead. Europe will seem to many of its citizens to be in recession long after growth has returned, posing a real threat to incumbent governments. Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden go to the polls next year and political upheavals cannot be ruled out. But looking beyond 1994, there is a good prospect of steady, if unspectacular, growth over a prolonged period with low inflation. Western Europe may even be moving into what future generations will call a 'golden age'. But it could take many years before it feels that way to its inhabitants.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.

The Euro-MPs suspended their plenary session to flock into one of the most crowded meetings in the city's recent memory. It was hosted by Mr Alain Carignon, France's communications minister. But the real draw was the constellation of French cinema stars he had in tow: a cast including Gerard Depardieu, Isabelle Huppert, and the director Claude Berri. Mr Carignon pleaded for audiovisual trade to be taken out of Gatt's Uruguay Round negotiations, to preserve Europe's 'cultural specificity' and diversity, in the face of the Hollywood avalanche burying European, especially French, cinema. In 1979, US films accounted for 31 per cent of cinema ticket receipts in France, whereas in 1989 the US take was 57 per cent. 'French films work,' a French Gatt negotiator said, 'but they are only attractive within a system which allows them to survive'. France wants to be able to continue subsidising its cinema, and to require its national TV stations to air a minimum of 60 per cent EC-made programmes. EC legislation recommends that member states put on a majority of European programmes, and EC trade negotiators reckon that getting some form of 'cultural specificity' enshrined in Gatt will impede unilateral sanctions from the US. Mr Carignon's companions were having none of this. 'We should not allow the Americans to deal with us the way they dealt with the redskins,' Mr Berri exclaimed. 'If the Gatt accords succeed as currently framed, the European cultural identity has had it,' he added, using a slightly earthier verb.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

Norway decided last week that it would allow the killing of 296 minke whales in defiance of an eight-year ban on whaling by the International Whaling Commission. Of the total, 160 whales were allotted as commercial catch; the balance for scientific research. Tengelmann, which has 4,500 food stores, imports Norwegian food and fish products worth an estimated NKr100m (Dollars 14.3m) annually. Total German imports of Norwegian products, excluding petroleum, reached NKr15.9bn in 1992. Of the total, NKr1.4bn represents food products of which NKr1.26bn is fish, mainly salmon. An executive with the Dusseldorf arm of the Norwegian Trade Council said Tengelmann stressed it would stick to its boycott decision until Norway conformed to the IWC ban. Tengelmann banned imports of food products from Iceland in 1988 when it resumed commercial whaling and has long been known for its green policies. The trade council said that Nordsaade, a member of the Unilever group, had also decided to stop buying Norwegian products from all companies and suppliers which had either direct or indirect connections to Norwegian whalers. The Norwegian government reiterated the argument yesterday that its decision to resume whaling is based on scientific research and responsible management of marine resources. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Norwegian fisheries directorate, which is responsible for assigning individual whale quotas, said yesterday that 32 boats had qualified for commercial whaling permits, although he added that not all of the whalers had decided to resume the commercial hunt this year.

After the setbacks since 1991 to the Maastricht treaty goal of European union, most governments had accepted the likelihood of a multi-speed Europe. Already in immigration, foreign and defence policies, as well as monetary co-operation, different groupings in the European Union have been implementing integration at disparate paces. The results of the European parliament elections on June 9 and June 12 indicate that post-cold-war Europe has become still more heterogeneous. Euro-diversity now stems from the power of the ballot box. The variety of the poll results helps explain why the plan for European unity agreed in 1991 has been looking increasingly unrealistic. Europe's political map, only three years ago painted in uniform integrationist hue, is now polychrome. 'We have a multi-polar Europe,' says Lord Dahrendorf, the German-born sociologist and former European Commissioner who is now Warden of St Antony's College, Oxford. 'In nearly all countries, there is a tendency towards greater splintering of political preferences.' An article in 1991*, co-authored by Mr Karlheinz Reif, the head of the European Commission's survey research unit, held out 'the prospect of an EC that is united, not only politically, but also economically (as) no idle dream.' That Euro-optimism has now withered in the harsher economic climate and resurgence of inward-looking policies across the EU. Mr Reif says electorates will again grow supportive of integration as the economy recovers, 'but the problem (of attitudes on a united Europe) as such will not disappear.' Surprisingly, the Maastricht treaty is being questioned even by some of its firmest supporters. In a book published this week, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, is quoted in an interview as calling the treaty over-ambitious and poorly drafted. 'We shouldn't have made a treaty on political union, it was too soon.'*** In similar vein, Prof Andre Szasz, an executive director of the Dutch central bank, who strongly backs the Maastricht aim of economic and monetary union (Emu), says: 'Rarely was a treaty concluded with such far-reaching implications and such lack of clarity as to what was intended and why.' Mr Szasz says the prospective widening of the Union - to 15 or 16 countries next year, 20 or more by early next century - increases the necessity of 'deepening' existing structures. 'The alternatives are not either widening or deepening. It is both or neither.' But far more clarity is needed. 'The authorities should consider how long they can continue to argue that monetary union requires economic and even political union'. The one country that clearly favoured European integration on Sunday was Austria, where 67 per cent of voters approved membership of the EU next year. But Austria is aware of slackening momentum behind the Maastricht treaty. 'On the question of institutional deepening, I remain rather sceptical,' says Mr Manfred Scheich, Austria's ambassador to the EU and negotiator on EU accession. 'Maastricht has exhausted, if not over-exhausted, the potential for qualitative steps forward in this field.' Austria will be part of the 'hard core' of countries eventually participating in Emu, Mr Scheich predicts. But, recalling that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had recently queried whether Emu was feasible by 1999, he added: 'We all have doubts about the timetable laid down in Maastricht. In economic integration, we should concentrate on making the single market work.' The questioning of Maastricht is just one of Europe's uncertainties. Fissiparous tendencies in western Europe mirror the breakdown of political structures and allegiances in eastern and central Europe during the past five years. Prof Loukas Tsoukalis of Athens university says cynicism about European union and establishment politicians is part of a general malaise. 'This time of pessimism is different from those in the past. It is linked to a crisis of governance in most European countries.' According to Mr Brian Gosschalk, managing director of the UK's Mori opinion research company, 'There is a sense of disillusionment. Europe is suffering from a lack of positive symbols.' His organisation has just carried out a poll across Europe indicating only 30 per cent of the EU electorate supports a 'United States of Europe', against 50 per cent who are opposed. Since no member of the European parliament wields executive power, Euro-elections - with a built-in tendency to amplify protest votes - provide only an imperfect gauge of the public's views on European integration. But the voting on June 9 and 12 gave some pointers to political trends. Voter turn-out across the 12 members was 57 per cent, the lowest of the four direct elections since 1979. Particularly large falls came in Ireland, Netherlands and Portugal, states traditionally enthusiastic about integration. Under Maastricht and the 1987 Single European Act, governments have given the parliament significant new powers to help correct Europe's 'democratic deficit'. But a large proportion of voters still regard it with lack of interest or sympathy. Additional powers for the parliament could thus, ironically, widen rather than narrow the gap between European decision-makers and the people. Public doubts about the role of the parliament could increase if the greater variety of parties represented there - especially on the right  - undermines its cohesiveness. As a foretaste, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, apparently failed this week to persuade Mr Kohl to allow his victorious Forza Italia movement to join the Christian Democrat group in Strasbourg. Overtly anti-Maastricht parties did well in France, Belgium, Greece and Denmark. The conservative Popular Party, which topped the poll in Spain, is more lukewarm on Emu than the governing Socialists. In Italy, Mr Berlusconi emerged with his position reinforced as Italy's first Eurosceptic prime minister since the second world war. The elections brought contrasting results in France and Germany, the traditional driving forces for greater European co-operation. In France, the shift from mainstream groupings resulted in the two governing parties, the neo-Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF, gaining just 25.5 per cent of the vote. In Germany, the governing parties showed they could still rally voters. Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, achieved a better-than-expected 38.8 per cent, with anti-Maastricht parties failing to win seats. But fragmentation is making its presence felt in Germany, too. The score of Mr Kohl's three coalition parties, including the Free Democrats, was 42.9 per cent, the lowest government result in a national German election since 1949. Low scores for left- and rightwing mainstream parties in France was because both the RPR/UDF and the Socialists 'mishandled the internal contradictions of their European policies', according to Mr Didier Witkowski, a political analyst at France's Sofres opinion research company. By contrast, he says, Mr Kohl benefited from the general German perception that the country is now the stronger partner in the relationship with Paris. The French government wants to 'bind' reunited Germany within a strengthened European framework. But a substantial part of the French electorate appears to doubt whether French eagerness to follow a German lead over Europe is in France's interests. Some of these doubts seem to be shared by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister. Mr Balladur, who said this week the splitting of the French presence at Strasbourg would weaken France's voice, warned in 1989 it was an 'illusion . . . (that) we can bind Germany irreversibly into western Europe'.** Mr Kohl's success on Sunday underlines how he has become Europe's pivotal leader. But for all the good intentions being displayed by Bonn ahead of Germany's six-month EU presidency starting next month, any increase in German assertiveness is likely to brake rather than speed moves towards European unity. One Bonn official says Mr Kohl benefited particularly from the support of older people worried about a resurgence of nationalism in eastern Europe. He adds, however, that these are voters generally hostile to the Emu objective of replacing the D-Mark with a single currency. Mr Gunther Nonnenmacher, co-editor of the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, says Mr Kohl succeeded in 'defusing' monetary union as an election issue. This reflects last October's ruling by the Federal Constitutional court that Emu can come about only via strict fulfilment of the rigorous Maastricht 'convergence criteria'. Mr Hans-Joachim Veen, head of research at the Christian Democrats' Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Bonn, says two-thirds of Germans oppose monetary union. Mr Kohl is seen as the 'guarantor that, if the Ecu, or common currency, comes one day, it will not be a radical change.' Since Bonn is sticking to the slogan that 'stability (of the future European currency) is more important than the timetable', Mr Veen accepts the date for introducing Emu may slip beyond 1999. On the future, he says, about 25 per cent of Germans want Europe to deepen integration, 30 per cent want to widen it to the east, and 45 per cent favour the status quo. 'We will have to muddle through.' An opinion poll by Germany's Allensbach organisation this month showed ambivalence in German attitudes to Europe. Although most Germans say they favour closer co-operation, they show strong opposition to concrete projects affecting German sovereignty. If in coming years the future of Europe is to be determined by any one country, it seems likely that the continent will be marching to music composed in Germany. Yet it will not be a fast drum-beat, rather a slow and cacophonous waltz with many pauses and contradictions. The travellers along the European trail will be moving at varying speeds. And some, on the evidence of this week's news, will be heading in different directions. * Eurobarometer, ed. by Karlheinz Reif and Ronald Inglehart, (Macmillan, 1991) ***Delors, by Charles Grant, (Nicholas Brealey, 1994) ** Il faut repenser l'Europe, Le Monde, 16.11.89   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

The 50-50 partnership between Europe's two largest subscription television companies is designed to take advantage of 'future technologies in satellite transmission, digital compression and encryption'. Engineers are increasingly optimistic that digital compression can be used to squeeze up to four television channels into the space now occupied by one. Encryption, or scrambling, of the television picture can be used to run pay-per-view services - charging to view a film or sporting event. A working group of senior executives of the two companies has been set up to work out an agreement on programming, technology and strategy. In each European country, including the UK, the aim would be link up with a large local company to distribute any new services created. Canal Plus claims a total of 4.5m subscribers to its pay television channels in France, Germany, Spain, Belgium and western Africa. Cable News Network and Financial Times Television said yesterday that from the end of this year they would no longer jointly produce World Business Today.

Official figures to be issued today are expected to show that about 12.4m passengers used the airport last year compared with 10.8m in 1991. 'We think this is tremendous, considering the recession,' Mr Gil Thompson, the airport's chief executive, said yesterday. Its passenger figures compare with about 19m for Gatwick and 40m for Heathrow, but controversial plans for a second runway within five years are likely to push Manchester towards 30m passengers a year and about 12th place in the world's airports league. The second runway is being vigorously opposed by local residents and environmental groups but the airport's owners - the 10 borough councils of Greater Manchester - say up to 50,000 new jobs would be generated. British Rail laid the last length of track this week to the airport's new rail terminal, which starts operation in May, providing the airport's first rail link with Manchester city centre. Manchester's new Pounds 570m Terminal Two will open in March, the first step towards increasing the airport's capacity to 23m people. All long-haul traffic except British Airways services will transfer to the new terminal, which will initially handle about 6m passengers a year. The existing Terminals A and B will be renamed Terminals 1 and 1A. British Airways will continue to use them for its domestic, Continental and long-haul services alongside other short-haul UK and Continental operators.

0,FT941-6865 ,"FT941-6865 _AN-EB1DPABRFT 940228   FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Convergence in the workforce - Labour unity      By DAVID GOODHART   Talk of a single market for labour in the European Union may seem premature in light of the differences between regulations and costs in the 12 member states. But Europe's individual labour markets are coming to resemble one another more closely - and in the next 10 to 15 years this convergence is likely to accelerate. The result may even be an improvement in competitiveness rather than the deterioration of which some observers have warned. Viewed from the outside, Europe's labour markets already have much in common, especially in terms of regulatory framework. But within Europe there is also great variety. Average hourly pay in Portugal is Dollars 4.69, compared with Dollars 25.34 in Germany. It is easy and cheap to fire people in Britain, but it remains expensive and complex to do so - at least in the formal sector of the economy - in Spain, Italy, France and Germany. Only 5 per cent of the Italian workforce works part-time, compared with more than 30 per cent in the Netherlands. Non-wage labour costs range from 3 per cent of wage costs in Denmark to over 45 per cent in France. A closer look at these divergences suggests, however, that they are seldom at the root of comparative advantage. For example, differences in wages tend to be matched by differences in productivity, leaving unit labour costs at similar levels all over Europe. Differences in non-wage labour costs may also be less important than they seem, as low non-wage labour costs will usually be compensated by higher direct wage costs, and vice versa. Companies are interested in the whole package of labour costs, flexibility and skill levels. When all these factors are taken into account, pluses and minuses often cancel each other out in Europe. Britain has a deregulated labour market but a patchy record in education and training. Germany is expensive and highly regulated but has highly motivated and skilled workers. Some of the southern European economies, such as Portugal, have low unit labour costs but also tend to be highly regulated. For these reasons, 'social dumping' - the feared transfer of capital from countries with high standards of labour protection to those where labour is least protected - has not materialised in Europe. But economic integration means that developments in one European labour market are now influencing others. The threat of locating new plants abroad has recently persuaded German workers at Bosch and Daimler-Benz to make concessions. And Britain - with its opt-out from parts of the EU's 'social dimension' - may continue to attract a disproportionate amount of inward investment. The result is a gradual trend towards greater flexibility across Europe, whereby continental countries are adopting some aspects of British-style deregulation without abandoning European social partnership. For example: Obstacles to part-time and temporary work have been relaxed in Spain and Italy, and the German government is now pushing for a big increase in part-time work. Minimum pay rules are generally still in place but they have in some countries been allowed to fall in value. One partial example is France's salaire minimum de croissance (Smic): the government is now allowing companies to pay young workers less than the Smic rate, provided they spend most of the money thus saved on training. Union power has been on the retreat everywhere, with the possible exception of Germany, although even there power is shifting from sectoral collective bargaining to agreements at plant level. IG Chemie, the chemical union, recently agreed to lower pay rates for new workers taken off the dole queue. On labour costs, the gap between the poorer and richer economies is narrowing markedly. According to Professor Douglas McWilliams, at the UK's Centre for Economics and Business Research, the degree of divergence in European wages will fall from 46 per cent in 1974 to 24 per cent by the end of this decade, with upward pressure in the poorer countries as productivity rises and downward pressure in the high-cost countries. One sign of convergence is that economic migrants from Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal, who previously flocked to the richer northern European countries, have lately been returning home, where better remunerated opportunities now beckon as their economies begin to catch up.

Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, is seeking a meeting on the subject with Mr Tim Smith, the Northern Ireland minister. Mr Winterton, chairman of the Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance, an industry pressure group, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' by replies from Mr Smith to a series of parliamentary questions. He described the decision to earmark aid for the Pounds 157m project as 'one of those great civil service blunders that have affected British industry for several years'. Mr Christopher Whitehouse, the alliance's chief executive, said: 'We want it stopped.' Mr Winterton's remarks came a week after it emerged that the recently established Commons Northern Ireland committee is to probe aspects of the project as part of its inquiry into employment creation in the province. The plant - to be built by a Malaysian division of Hualon, a Taiwanese conglomerate - will represent the largest industrial investment in Northern Ireland since the failed De Lorean car venture. It became the subject of controversy in May, when it emerged that the European Commission overrode strong objections from its own officials in approving the UK government grant. In his answers Mr Smith said the government had no plans to review its decision to assist the project, which it had concluded would not cause any significant job displacement in the UK. Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, Europe's largest textiles company, has warned that 'as many as 1,000 jobs in Lancashire' could be lost because of the project.

However, for Europe and the United States, which have  experienced various difficulties such as the indifference and  mutual distrust brought about by the disappearance of the Cold  War threat, the several deadlocks that have occurred in the  Uruguay round of negotiations, and the divergence of views over  intervention in the Bosnia-Hercegovina civil war, the importance  of this issue is even more important. Between 9 - 16 January,  U.S. President Clinton made his first visit to Europe since  taking office. Since one of the main goals of this visit was to  refashion the relationship between the United States and its  European allies, and between NATO and East Europe and the  countries of the former Soviet Union, President Clinton chose  Brussels as his first stop, and took part in the NATO heads of  state conference there. Foreign public opinion gave fairly high  marks to this visit, feeling that President Clinton's first trip  to Europe was truly something that had a new and far-reaching  effect.    Establishing a ""Peaceful Partnership"" Between East and West  Europe    The first change in NATO brought about by the two-day  Brussels heads of state conference was passage of an  U.S.-sponsored plan for a ""peaceful partnership,"" which formally  answered the question of whether and how NATO would be extended  to the east, which had been outstanding since the end of the  cold war.    East Europe's difficulties in freeing itself from restraints  to establish its own independence and security following the end  of the cold war made it very anxious to enter NATO. The recent  clamor from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland,  in particular, had been loudest. Two years earlier, the NATO  heads of state conference in Rome had decided to set up a North  Atlantic Cooperation Committee that would accept East European  and former Soviet Union countries as members to improve  relations and cooperation between NATO member states and their  erstwhile adversaries, and to move these countries in the  direction of a western-style democracy. However, some of the  East European nations were no longer entirely satisfied with  that kind of extremely loose and entirely symbolic cooperation.  Faced with the ""power vacuum"" in East Europe following the end  of the cold war, the potential threat of a revival of Russian  great nation chauvinism, and the instability caused by extreme  nationalism and ethnic clashes in East Europe, some East  European nations urgently demanded genuine security guaranties  from NATO. The clamor to joint NATO increased with each passing  day.    In their heart of hearts, both the United States and its  West  European allies naturally very much wished to extend NATO  eastward. At the beginning of the cold war more than 40 years  earlier, the United States singlehandedly planned establishment  of NATO with the goal of doing all possible to stem the  increasing expansion of Soviet influence, and doing all possible  to expand eastward western military power and even the west's  free and democratic system. Now that the cold war was over,  naturally the United States could not abandon this opportunity  that it had yearned for. It was for this reason that U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher hastily said, ""During this  crucial transition period, building of such a (east and west  Europe) relationship will make it possible for democracy and  reform to succeed, and the possibility of this success will be  far greater than the opportunities that a war would bring.""  However, the United States had some apprehensions about what  specific actions to take. In the view of the Clinton  administration, the extension of membership status to all the  East European nations was really premature. First of all, in  addition to the lack of any real basis at the present time for  these East European countries to carry out within NATO the  assurances of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty (namely, that an  attack on one member nation would be regarded as an attack on  all members), the tangled and complex ethnic conflicts and the  latent territorial conflicts prevailing in East Europe might  cause conflicts that would make the heads of NATO member states  hesitate to act. NATO feared that too early acceptance of these  East European nations might result in NATO becoming bogged down  later on in regional conflicts like the war in  Bosnia-Hercegovina. Furthermore, even though NATO has for many  years successfully maintained a relationship between two  antagonistic member nations, Greece and Turkey, there was no  reason for NATO leaders to believe that the East European  nations would do the same thing. Second, and more important,  was the Clinton administration's unwillingness to countenance  ""drawing a line at the western border of Russia to replace the  former iron curtain."" The United States worried that too early  and too speedy NATO acceptance of these East European countries  that were formerly allies of the Soviet Union might intensify  Russia's feelings of isolation and stimulate an anti-American  and anti-western tendencies in the Russian public. It might even  increase ultra-nationalist forces within Russia, thereby  weakening the forces of democratic reform factions such as  Yeltsin's that the United States supported. These apprehensions  found greater expression when the Radical Nationalist Party  headed by Zhirnovsky gained the second largest number of seats  in Russia's Duma in December 1993. In fact, on the eve of  Clinton's visit to Europe, a strong reaction occurred within  Russia to the formal application for entry into NATO of Latvia,  one of the three Baltic nations. Russian President Yeltsin  warned the west not to do ""anything to isolate Russia."" Because  of the above worries, President Clinton adopted a fairly  cautious attitude about expanding NATO, showing that the issue  is not whether to expand NATO but ""how and when to expand it.""    The peaceful partnership plan that the NATO heads of state  passed was a deft compromise to avoid stirring up Russia  following careful consideration by the United States. In  accordance with this plan, non-NATO member East European  countries and former republics of the USSR will gradually  develop their military relationship with NATO member countries,  conducting joint training and exercises. These ""peaceful  partners"" will become a planning team that cooperates closely  with NATO in the organization of joint training and exercises in  preparation for possible future joint military action. It is on  the basis of this conception that NATO will nurture the ability  to deal with ""challenges to Europe's common security.""  Henceforth, should the territorial integrity, political  independence, and security of any partner country be threatened  at any time, NATO will conduct deliberations at once. According  to Warren Christopher, founding of such a mechanism will  ""eliminate feelings of insecurity among East European and former  Soviet Union partners, strengthening the political relationship  between NATO and them.""    In order not to dash the hopes and to support the requests  of  some East European and former Soviet Union republics who desire  immediate NATO entry, during his visit to Europe President  Clinton constantly reiterated that the ""peaceful partnership,""  plan does not replace arrangements for entering NATO, but is  ""the first step toward entering NATO."" The United States  explained to Europe that partner nations could demonstrate their  desire and their ability to assume NATO obligations and enjoy  NATO benefits by approving this plan's provisions for  strengthening political and military cooperation. In future  years, the situation will show which countries possess the  conditions for formal entry. Then NATO can consider the question  of whether to grant them formal membership status. To use  Clinton's words, this is a ""gradual and case-by-case expansion  procedure.""    The Clinton administration believes that the ""peaceful  partner relationship"" plan that it devised can kill many birds  with a single stone. First, it satisfies, to a certain extent,  the desires of those East European and former Soviet republics  that eagerly sought entry into NATO, and it increases their  confidence. It enables them to continue and accelerate progress  toward western democracy while at the same time it avoids  arousing ultra-nationalist sentiment in some Russians so that  they do not regard NATO expansion as a military threat. Second,  the plan's provisions for an expansion of military cooperation  with East European countries will help NATO improve its ability  to act in important new fields of crisis management,  humanitarian rescue, and peace keeping, thereby effecting a  smooth change in NATO's functions. Third, since the Clinton  administration says that in the future NATO will unilaterally  have the right to decide when to increase membership, this  ""single track system"" of examining credentials will force those  East European nations that wish to enter NATO to listen to what  the United States says. They must not only take an active part  in NATO activities, but more importantly -- as Clinton said --  they must demonstrate ""their decision to respect the values on  which NATO depends for its survival."" This includes respect for  individual freedom, human rights, and a system of law, and  peaceful resolution of disputes without the use of armed force  to change existing national borders. Thus, the United States  has transformed NATO expansion, which was formerly a matter of  examining member nations credentials, into a powerful lever for  ensuring the peace, stability, and freedom of East Europe.    Therefore, the United states has a deep sense of  satisfaction  about NATO heads of state approval of the ""peaceful partnership""  plan, as well as the acceptance of this plan by East European  countries like the Czech Republic and Poland. it believes this  to be an important result of President Clinton's trip to Europe.  However, whether this carefully conceived plan will truly be  workable, and whether it can attain the goals that the United  States envisages will depend on the the test of time.    Recognition of West European Allies Autonomy in Defense  Matters    The second important change in NATO that President Clinton  brought during this visit was the United States' decision to  recognize the autonomy of its West European allies on defense  matters. This gives them the right to independent military  action that they, particularly France, have long desired.  Contrary to the United States Government's past position, during  this heads of state conference, President Clinton explicitly  recognized that Europe has authority over defense matters  affecting its own independence; thus, West Europe has the right  to make its own decisions and take independent actions to deal  with defense matters purely within Europe. For this purpose, the  United States said it would permit its West European allies to  use NATO matriel and equipment for their own military actions.  This means that the West European allies may take military  action using NATO's command, reconnaissance and logistics  systems in the name of the West European alliance or in the name  of joint French and German forces rather than in the name of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In addition, this NATO heads  of state meeting decided to set up a new military entity termed  a multinational task force. Acting under the leadership of the  West European Alliance or NATO, this force could undertake peace  keeping, human rights rescue, and other military tasks. The  United States could decide whether to take part in these  military actions as circumstances warrant. United State  Secretary of Defense Les Aspen said that according to this plan,  ""military forces and equipment that are an organic part of the  NATO military organization could be used to deal with unexpected  incidents of purely European concern without U.S. direction.""    When the cold war first ended, the United States felt at a  loss about what to do for a time. On the one hand, the United  States realized that the disappearance of the tremendous Soviet  threat meant that it would no longer have to concern itself with  every matter regarding Europe's security as it had done in the  past. The United States no longer saw it worthwhile to go to war  and shed blood over conflicts in regional conflicts such as the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the United  States, which had been accustomed for more than 40 years to  issuing orders to Europe and attending to everything itself, was  unwilling to be cast aside now, allowing West European nations  to make their own decisions and carry out their own actions, and  it was apprehensive about it. It was with these conflicting  feelings that the former Bush administration, and the Clinton  administration at its outset always vacillated and contradicted  itself on European affairs. This characteristic was demonstrated  most markedly on the Bosnia-Hercegovina civil war issue. The  West European allies were extremely unhappy about this, and  U.S.-European relations consequently blew hot and cold. All  these events showed that the United States Government had formed  no clear-cut consensus on U.S.-European relations. It lacked a  consistent policy.    The change in the United States Government's position now  shows that the Clinton administration has a new understanding of  United States-European relations after having gone through a  period of consideration.    No matter how one looks at it, the security of Europe is of  crucial importance to the United States; therefore, the United  States must remain in Europe and continue to play a leading  role. However, the United States cannot both want to play the  part of leader and also side with West Europe in making empty  promises when a crisis occurs in the European situation. The  only workable approach is for the U.S. Government to change its  former equivocal and ambiguous attitude, clearly recognize and  respect Europe's autonomy in certain defense matters, and let  the European allies handle matters themselves in return for  their cooperation and support in matters of importance to U.S.  defense. Clinton embraced just such a clear-cut understanding in  making a trip to Europe. While affirming that Europe remains at  the heart of U.S. security, he said that ""the common enemy on  both sides of the Atlantic Ocean has disappeared, but common  dangers have not disappeared."" By this he meant that although  not as mortal as the former Soviet threat, the ""quiet  instability that has appeared"" in Europe is fraught with danger.  Both the United States and West Europe must react to this.  However, this reaction should be selective. According to the  current thinking of the United States Government, when a major  threat occurs that endangers the western value system, the  survival of the western system, and reverberates on the  situation on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States will  work in concert and bend efforts to cooperate with Europe. When  a partial or regional crisis occurs in Europe that does not  threaten the overall situation within a short period of time,  acting in the spirit of ""Europeans handling European affairs,""  the United States will not intervene. Actually, the  Multinational Task Force was born out of the U.S. desire not to  shed blood in European regional disputes, and in Europe's desire  to make a rapid response to them.    This change in the U.S. Government's position was welcomed  by  West Europe, especially France. For a long time, France has  wanted the right to take independent military action and  maintain an independent West European military force. The United  States always refused, however, because it feared that this  might lead to a disintegration of the western alliance. The  United States' unexpected declaration at the NATO heads of state  meeting and the results it obtained evoked a joyous response  from France. The French Minister of Defense termed the new  Atlantic alliance following this heads of state conference the  ""second NATO."" The United States termed the proposal it made at  this conference and the existing North Atlantic Treaty ""each  attending to his own affairs,"" but not each going his separate  way. This means that NATO and the West European Alliance will be  complementary rather than mutually exclusive in the future.  Nevertheless, the U.S. attitude shows that its effect on  European affairs has declined. It is a choice that the United  States had to make after the situation changed in order to avoid  even grater damage to Europe-U.S. relations. No wonder that  after President Clinton said that the United States was resolved  to remain in Europe that some European public opinion still  suspected that this change in the U.S. position might be the  first step in its gradual withdrawal from Europe.    Results of the Brussels heads of state conference showed  that  a change in the control and even the purpose of NATO was  unavoidable. The direction that this conference set for  east-west and Europe-U.S. relations, in particular, means that  the Brussels heads of state conference has become yet another  important milestone in the more than 40 year history of NATO. As  a WASHINGTON POST editorial said, the conclusion of this  conference marks ""a quiet revolution"" that is going on within  NATO.     "

The latest vehicle sales statistics from North America show that, in the first 11 months of this year, Americans bought 5.6m of what are described as light trucks - four-wheel drive cars such as the Jeep Cherokee and Range Rover, multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) that seat seven or eight adults with car-like handling, and pick-up trucks. These 'cult' sectors of the US market have accounted for 43 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales in 1994. 'It's been trucks, trucks, trucks - we can't build enough,' according to Mr John Maciarz, a spokesman for market leader General Motors. This year, more than any other, light truck sales have outperformed the conventional car market in the US by a large and growing margin. Sales are nearly 15 per cent higher than in the same period last year, compared with growth in car sales of just 5 per cent. In some western US states and provinces of Canada, their sales now outnumber those of ordinary cars. Indeed, the single best-selling vehicle in the US is not a car, but a pick-up: Ford's F-series model outsells the country's best selling car, the Ford Taurus, by a ratio of 3 to 2. For most of their owners for most of the time, these vehicles are not ideal choices: four-wheel drives and MPVs are usually much bigger than they need; pick-ups have few passenger seats; and all three are simply irrelevant to any kind of need other than the emotional. Most also consume far more fuel than anyone needs for basic transportation. US vehicle makers claim to be almost as nonplussed as environmentalists by the gulf between the public support for energy and environmental conservation and the purchase of eccentric gas-guzzlers. This year, Chrysler has taken the pick-up cult to a new extreme with the Dodge Ram Laramie SLT Magnum V10. Only three adults can squeeze into its cab; its rear load deck is open to the elements; and under its bonnet is an engine with 10 cylinders, eight litres and the ability to out-drag most sports cars. Such eccentricity is unlikely to remain confined to the land of Dollars 1-a-gallon gasolene, however. Chrysler's UK importer currently has one on test, assessing it for a possible niche in the European markets. Despite several attempts by manufacturers to promote them as both leisure and utility vehicles, pick-ups have never really caught on in Europe. In the UK, only slightly more than 3,000 are expected to be sold this year, almost all to builders and other traders. But four-wheel drive cars are another story. They have already provided the beachhead through which Chrysler is re-establishing itself as a manufacturer to be taken seriously in Europe, with sales of around 20,000 units a year of its Cherokee, Grand Cherokee and Wrangler models, some assembled at a plant in Austria. Last year, according to statistics from market monitoring group Automotive Industry Data, Europeans bought 300,000 leisure/utility four-wheel drives. AID forecasts that sales should rise to around 500,000 by the end of the decade. Japan's choked roads provide the best support available for those who contend that the European four-wheel drive market has a long way to grow. Although the Japanese have even fewer opportunities than Europeans to take their vehicles off-road, because of greater urban sprawl and tight controls on the countryside, four-wheel drives account for 6 per cent of the new car market. To date, their share in Europe is under 3 per cent. According to AID, buyers justify their purchases by a desire 'to venture off-road where the mountain goat tenacity of such vehicles is likely to be needed'. AID's report on European four-wheel drive prospects to the year 2002 says that those interviewed claimed other features, such as styling, were much less important. But the report's research into how these vehicles are used showed that most buyers had little or no need for an off-road capability. 'The overwhelming majority of vehicle owners, around 95 per cent, are using their four-wheel drives for nothing more demanding than driving to the office, or for the daily school run.' Embarrassed though most buyers might be to admit it, AID suggests, the real reason for their purchase is simply 'to stand out from the crowd'. To underline the point, it reports that four-wheel drive owners on average were found to spend nine times as much as their car-buying counterparts on appearance-improving extras. In terms of both purchase and running costs, four-wheel drives can be a very expensive way of being different. In September, the UK Rover Group's subsidiary, Land Rover, launched the latest version of its flagship Range Rover model, developed as part of a four-year, Pounds 300m investment programme. Priced at up to Pounds 44,000, it has taken the vehicles into direct competition with established luxury car producers such as Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, BMW and Lexus (Toyota). The Range Rover, its cheaper stablemate the Discovery and the more utilitarian Land Rover Defender have been big success stories in the world market for four-wheel drives. The company's output at the end of the 1980s was fewer than 50,000. This year the total will reach a record 85,000, and the company expects to sell 100,000 units or more in the new year. With so much at stake, Land Rover executives strongly defend their four-wheel drive vehicles, maintaining they offer more than an ego trip. The Discovery, they say, is gradually taking over the market for big estate cars, typified by Volvo, because of its commanding driving position above other traffic and multi-seat flexibility, as well as style and image. Critics maintain that the perception of usable space is exaggerated. They add that the current cult status of the vehicles could quickly be undermined if there is a revival in concerns over the stability of these cars, which have a high centre of gravity. Small Suzuki four-wheel drives faced a barrage of criticisms over rollover safety in the 1980s. More recently, the deaths of a woman and her two children in a motorway accident in the UK, when their Range Rover rolled over the central barrier into oncoming traffic, has revived industry unease over the safety image of four-wheel drive cars. Yet manufacturers continue to crowd into the sector, and the vehicles themselves grow ever more varied. Volvo is reported to have developed a four-wheel drive prototype; Ford may introduce its large Explorer model into Europe; and Korea's SSangyong will introduce its first four-wheel drive to Europe during 1995. Meanwhile, Japan's Mitsubishi has just launched a Japan-only, 600cc mini version of its popular Pajero/Shogun vehicle. Two of Europe's biggest carmakers, Peugeot and Fiat, stand out from the trend, however, as absentees from this sector of the market. Both Peugeot's chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, and Fiat Auto's director-general, Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, maintain that four-wheel drives will end up in a market wilderness and that the best growth prospects for niche vehicles lies with multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs). Their own efforts have gone into producing such a vehicle jointly, already in production as the Fiat Ulysse, Peugeot 806 and Citroen Synergie. But for 'green' critics of Europe's current modest craze for the fuel-gulping, macho-looking four-wheel drives, the future looks bleak. The latest vehicle sales statistics from North America suggest that, short of a public outcry over their safety, there will be many more of these vehicles on Europe's roads by the end of 1995.

The group forecast a rise in profits of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent for the full year, an upward adjustment of earlier forecasts. Group sales increased 10.5 per cent to DKr7bn from DKr6.33bn. The group has interests in sugar, distilling, snacks, frozen pea production, food ingredients and packaging. All did better than last year, according to the interim report. Food and beverages sales increased to DKr4.2bn from DKr4.07bn and operating profits rose to DKr504m from DKr394m. Sugar sales were strong in the first half, but are expected to dip in the second half because the beet harvest was below normal. The group said Sweden's decision to join the EU would have a positive impact on results. Danisco acquired Socker Bolaget, the Swedish monopoly sugar producer, two years ago and is in a position to consider structural changes in the Swedish industry, the interim report said. In Germany, rationalisation at factories in eastern Germany has been completed. Danisco's EU sugar quota in Denmark is 425,000 tonnes. The group said production would exceed this but would not reach last year's 521,000 tonnes. In Germany, the quota was 126,000 tonnes, but production this year would not be more than 105,000 tonnes. In Sweden, production this year is expected to be about 330,000 tonnes, about 50,000 tonnes less than in 1993-94. Grindsted Products, the food ingredients company, which produces enzymes for food processing, increased sales to DKr1.10bn from DKr999m and operating profits to DKr165m from DKr152m.

0,FT941-671 ,"FT941-671 _AN-EC2DQAEHFT 940329   FT  29 MAR 94 / A Europe that deserves support: Leon Brittan outlines a strategy for rebuilding confidence in the EU - and its competitiveness - after recent crises      By LEON BRITTAN   A strange paradox lies at the heart of the European Union, a paradox that mirrors the ambivalence so many Europeans currently feel towards the rest of the continent. In times of crisis the Union is seen to have let its peoples down, notably by failing to act to stop the killing in Bosnia; at other times it is cast as a secretive, self-inflating bureaucracy bent on over-regulating the lives of its citizens just to keep its staff in business. It is at once too powerful and yet not powerful enough, a beast showing the strength of a bear and the timidity of a door-mouse, and both on the wrong occasions. For many, Europe has temporarily lost its bearings. Recent history helps explain why: the painful reunification of Europe has collided with the deepest recession since the 1930s, leaving the shining emblems of a bold and prosperous Europe in the 1980s looking tarnished alongside the unemployment of the 1990s. As the Danes rejected Maastricht and the money-changers gambled on France doing the same, it seemed the dominoes of Europe's delicate consensus in favour of integration were falling one by one. Europe must rebuild the confidence shaken from it by recent history to face the tough decisions that history has now thrust upon it. The countries of central and eastern Europe, fearful of backsliding in Russia, are knocking ever louder at the Union's door; the vexed question of monetary union is now resurfacing; Bosnia has exposed the need for a shared foreign and security policy but also the immense obstacles to achieving it; the interdependence of the world economy is calling on Europe to restore its industrial competitiveness, and seemingly unstoppable growth in Asia is telling it to do so fast. If the Union is to confront these issues with unity and resolve, it needs to carry the people with it. This, above all, means putting the principle of subsidiarity - enshrined in law for the first time in the Maastricht treaty  -to work. Subsidiarity, properly practised, should defy the pro- and anti-federalists alike, for it means striking a balance between intervention and abstention, allowing decision-making to settle at the most appropriate level. It is not a static principle but one which should allow for the ebb and flow of responsibility between regional, national and European authorities, according to the need for Europeans to act alone or together at any moment. If it is to stall excessive centralisation, the burden of proof must fall on those arguing for decisions to be taken by the Union itself, and the least restrictive instrument should be used. All legislation should be screened accordingly, and no powers should be set in stone - indeed, there may be cases where national governments have acquired the expertise to perform the task hitherto allotted to the Union just as adequately, and the reins could then be handed back to them. Knowing when to stop will, therefore, be instrumental in restoring the Union's credibility. But equally, the true application of the principle of subsidiarity means that, where acting together at European Union level enables something more desirable to be achieved more effectively, the Union should not hesitate to take the necessary action. Europe's collective achievements - the creation of a unified market and effective single policies on competition and trade, for example - should have proved to its detractors by now that team work at European level can enable each country to score more highly for itself than it could have done alone, however tiresome its team-mates may seem at times. Yet widespread distrust persists. The Union's duty, therefore, is not simply to accrue power when times are good and wash its hands of those responsibilities when times are bad: it is to assist governments in the search for the best level at which to take each decision, and draw ordinary people into that process. To do that, the democratic element in the European Union must be reinforced. With 12 national parliaments and one European Parliament all empowered to scrutinise European laws, Europe has considerable means of democratic expression, but much of that potential is wasted. National parliaments seldom analyse European laws with the degree of scrutiny those laws deserve. They appear to exert little influence over their ministers when the latter meet at Union level to adopt new laws. Often national and European MPs are locked in opposition, one suspecting the other of tugging policy too far towards, or away from, the centre of Europe. This need not be. For, if harnessed jointly to the decision-making wheel, they would complement each other. Through a Committee of Parliaments, national MPs could be assigned specific powers alongside their counterparts in the Strasbourg assembly, so reassuring voters that power over their lives is not ebbing abroad to bodies they did not elect. The Committee of Parliaments could ensure power was exercised at the right level and on the right legal grounds: it could watch over subsidiarity, with the power to ask the European Court of Justice to adjudicate if necessary; ensure laws have the correct legal base (a common battleground among governments fearing the Union may be growing by stealth); and check when governments consider extending the Union's authority. Only if it realises its democratic potential can the Union face the greatest challenge: the drive to maintain efficiency as it takes in more countries. The Union's decision-making machinery, which has hardly changed since the Community began, is already creaking under the weight of 12 countries. It will creak more loudly with 16, and grind to a halt if Europe enlarges thereafter. But to lock out central and eastern European countries on these grounds is inexcusable. Instead the inter-governmental conference that is to be held in 1996 should centre on the simple, but intractable question: how should we change the way the European Union is run to enable us to admit a substantial number of new countries without the Union grinding to a halt? This involves looking at how the Union's institutions work: the Commission and the parliament, as well as the Council of Ministers - and a fresh look at the voting questions which have caused such agonised debate. But we would also have to widen our analysis if the countries of eastern and central Europe were to be absorbed into the Union in due course. The collapse of communism is forcing a more sharply focused consideration of Union policy towards its eastern neighbours. The question is no longer one merely of foreign policy - it is central to the future of the Union itself. The loss of Soviet markets made east Europeans look west for business, but the threat of Russian nationalism is sharpening their demand for membership of the European fold, in economic, political and security terms. War in Europe, too, is forcing Nato to confront the need for its European members to develop a more autonomous security policy within the alliance, as Soviet might gives way to smaller, less easily identifiable security threats closer home. The old dichotomy between reinforcing the European pillar of Nato and maintaining the transatlantic link is withering away as the US encourages Europe's autonomy within the Western European Union and France begins to shed its staunchly independent view of defence. Developing a true European pole within Nato, but one also capable of acting outside it under the WEU, is now realistic and should be encouraged. The European Union should also gradually lift its remaining barriers to trade from the east, while urging eastern Europe to adopt competition and other market rules similar to its own. Yesterday those countries needed aid and advice on how to build a market economy; today they also need investment and the infrastructure and economic stability to attract it as painful reforms take root. The west's role must also be made more visible, to help prevent people turning their back on those reforms. Ultimately it is economic prosperity that will weld the continent together, leading to a joint political future in one Union, each country in its own time. Prosperity is also the most effective agent of integration in western Europe  -a lesson apparent from the lack of support for European integration as the recession and unemployment bite. The Union will sink or swim on its ability to restore the competitiveness of its economy. Through its role as 'steward' of Europe, the Union must establish order among a series of often competing priorities - for example, the protection of Europe's rural communities while encouraging agriculture to compete without excessive subsidies; or the creation of a social safety net which does not stifle industry; or the need to close the wealth gap by bringing poor countries up to richer ones, and not vice versa. Any attempt to muddle through - merely to 'manage' these issues rather than to introduce real reform where necessary - will not work. The reason is that one priority thwarts all others: the need to compete on world markets. Only a detailed and dispassionate analysis of Europe's economic woes can find a common cure. This process has begun with the Commission's white paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment. It is clear the Union must pursue existing policies with renewed vigour, for example by completing the single market; loosening the grip that monopolies still hold over Europe's transport, energy and communications networks, while channelling private capital more smoothly into those networks; and ensuring that we and our competitors abide by the stringent new trade rules agreed in the Uruguay Round. We also need improved research to turn good ideas into market-beating exports; to encourage the growth of small companies and entrepreneurship; to reduce state subsidies to ailing enterprises; and to ensure more efficient spending of the Union budget, not just by quashing fraud but also by shifting staff more quickly to confront new challenges. Of the cures, two of the most potent are also among the most controversial. First Europe has to improve the versatility of its workforce. This does not mean neglecting health and safety, or hiring and firing for short-term gain; rather, it means removing rigidities which discourage employers from creating jobs, and correcting the mismatch between the skills people learn and those they require for the posts available. The Union itself can remove barriers to workers seeking jobs abroad; provide 'marriage guidance' for industries looking for the most suitable training schemes in Europe; and help distil conflicting national views on social policy into common principles upon which European industry can rely, not through coercion but through debate. This will help governments shift their focus away from merely protecting old industries towards propagating new ones. Secondly, the European currency crisis has not destroyed the Continental consensus in favour of a single currency, although it has shifted the debate over how to achieve it and by when. Far from exploiting their monetary freedom after the crisis, most EU countries have followed fiscal and monetary policies consistent with the approach laid down in Maastricht. In fact they have not used the greater freedom given to them by the wider band in the revised ERM. It might be, however, that the best way of achieving Emu would be to seek agreement on a trans-Union non-inflationary monetary target, and for each country to be able to lower interest rates, provided this would not risk breaching that target. This might mean more rapid emergence from recession and a pattern of exchange rates based on economic fundamentals which could, in due course, provide the basis for a single currency. That goal seems to me to be as valid and as attainable as ever, even if by slightly different means. It is ironic that people are most tempted to spurn the European Union when their countries' need for it is greatest. Grafting a split continent back together is no mean feat, particularly when it forces radical change to the structure of the European house and brings fresh competition to an economy grappling with recession. The overarching aim must be to achieve that unity while assuring Europe's place in an ever more competitive world. It can only be done by a Union that is democratic, transparent and restrained enough in its actions to be confident and deserving of the public support it needs.

0,FT924-4554 ,"FT924-4554 _AN-CLBBRAAIFT 921202   FT  02 DEC 92 / Europe's executives expect gloomy year ahead      By DAVID MARSH, European Editor   LEADING European companies forecast a gloomy new year of low growth and rising inflation and unemployment, according to a survey of business opinion in the seven biggest European Community economies published today. Only 38 per cent of leading European business executives believe their company's prospects will improve during the next 12 months, while 19 per cent think the position will worsen. The survey - the UPS Business Monitor - was conducted for the US-based delivery company United Parcel Service by Harris Research. Interviews were carried out in seven countries - Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK - after Europe's September currency upheavals. The findings show how concern over flagging economic dynamism and the faltering pace of European integration has forced companies to lower their sights for 1993. There has been a sharp rise in pessimism since the spring. When surveyed in February and March, 55 per cent of business leaders thought their company would do better during the coming 12 months, and only 6 per cent believed the position would get worse. This means that the 'optimism index' (the gap between optimistic executives and pessimistic ones) fell from 49 points in March to 19 in the autumn. Business chiefs across the continent foresee a small increase in inflation next year in all countries except the Netherlands. Unemployment is expected to rise by 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points in most countries, while no country is thought likely to experience growth of more than 1.9 per cent. Companies in Spain, the UK, Italy and Germany all forecast growth of 1.2 per cent or less in their countries' economies next year. Companies in the Netherlands and France are slightly more optimistic, expecting expansion of 1.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. Executives in Germany are most gloomy about next year's prospects, with 22 per cent saying their company's position will improve in the next year, and 33 per cent forecasting deterioration. There has been a striking decline in German optimism since March, when 36 per cent saw an improvement against only 11 per cent forecasting deterioration. In spite of the restrained outlook for British growth, UK executives are most optimistic about an upturn in prospects, reflecting the view that the two-year recession in the UK may be about to end. Of British executives surveyed, 60 per cent said they thought their companies would do better during the next 12 months, while only 8 per cent said they would fare worse. However, this relative confidence marked a decline in optimism since March, when 74 per cent foresaw improvement and only 4 per cent deterioration. Across the other EC countries, business confidence has also registered a steep fall since March. The 'optimism index' fell from 39 to 6 in Belgium, from 57 to 25 in Spain, from 49 to 14 in France, from 51 to 19 in Italy and from 39 to 17 in the Netherlands. Although German companies are the most pessimistic about the next 12 months' prospects, the medium-term outlook is seen as much brighter - particularly by respondents outside Germany. Seventy-one per cent of companies tipped Germany as likely to show strongest growth during the next three years, while 48 per cent believed France would be in this position, putting it in second place behind Spain. There was virtually unanimous belief (among 91 per cent of respondents) that Germany can overcome the challenges of reunification. The UK businessmen display much more confidence in British prospects than do their competitors abroad. Among UK respondents, 33 per cent expect Britain to show strongest economic growth during the next three years, while only 12 per cent of their counterparts on the continent agree. Italy is expected to show weakest economic growth during the next three years, according to 51 per cent of all respondents, and 54 per cent of Italian business people. The UK came second among the countries judged to face poorest growth prospects, ranked in this position by 48 per cent of all respondents, but by only 30 per cent of the British. One factor underlying optimism among businessmen is the advent of the single market. European companies hope to benefit as the single market comes into effect next year, in spite of doubts about ratification of the Maastricht treaty. However, 45 per cent of respondents forecast that customs procedures and controls at borders will not disappear in 1993. Although this indicates that hopes about the precise impact of next year's changes have been scaled down, a large majority (67 per cent to 21 per cent) believes that movement of goods within the EC next year will become easier. Support for the single market is uniformly strong among the countries surveyed, but there is scepticism about whether single market directives are being implemented equally in all member states.

Weak market conditions were aggravated by merger expenses and the costs of starting up a new mill, the company said. The deficit was more than double 1991's SKr248m loss and led the company to scrap its dividend after a SKr1 per share pay-out in 1991. 'The most important reason for the negative result is that product prices have fallen more than raw material prices,' the group said. It blamed industry over-capacity and increased nickel exports from the former eastern bloc for the fall in prices, while noting that demand was restrained by recession in many important markets. It said European demand for hot rolled plate, pipes, tubes and long products fell, while demand for cold rolled products rose just 1 per cent, compared with a normal 4 to 5 per cent. Sales amounted to SKr7.59bn, compared with SKr7.39bn in 1991, with SKr842m generated by British Steel's stainless operations in the two months following the completion of the merger on November 2. Excluding this contribution, sales were down 9 per cent. The overall loss would have been lower but for SKr171m adverse movement in inventory prices, SKr50m in merger costs, and SKr101m related to the start-up of the group's hot strip rolling mill in Avesta. The group originally expected the merger to produce SKr400m of annual cost savings from 1995, but now says it expects the benefits to be greater and to take effect as early as 1993. British Steel owns 40 per cent of the group.   Companies:-  Avesta Sheffield.   Countries:-  SEZ  Sweden, West Europe.   Industries:-  P3312 Blast Furnaces and Steel Mills.

0,FT934-380 ,"FT934-380 _AN-DL2BSAAUFT 931229   FT  29 DEC 93 / EU ministers wrap up agreement on packaging: But arguments on recycling are set to continue      By NEIL BUCKLEY and ARIANE GENILLARD      BONN   Consumers across the European Union could soon be sorting through their household waste to pick out bottles, plastics and other materials for recycling, following an agreement reached by environment ministers before Christmas. The compromise agreement on waste recovery and recycling targets in the EU's directive on packaging and packaging waste will have important consequences for Europe's packaging and waste management industries as well. It was reached after 18 months of wrangling between member countries and lobbying by the packaging industry, which believed original targets in a draft published last year were too severe. The argument, however, is not over. The directive must be ratified by the European parliament, and was opposed by ministers from Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, who were demanding tougher targets. Germany is expected to campaign hard for amendments. After introducing the most ambitious targets in Europe for waste collection and recycling two years ago, it is already exceeding the proposed targets and has been forced to export large quantities of packaging waste after its own recycling industry proved inadequate. The council of environment ministers agreed that within five years of the directive's implementation: Not less than 50 per cent, but no more than 65 per cent, of packaging waste should be recovered rather than simply dumped. A minimum of 25 per cent, and maximum of 40, should be recycled, with a minimum of 15 per cent of each category of material. Within 10 years, the council would have to agree a 'substantial increase' in these percentages. This is somewhat softer than the original draft, which called for 90 per cent of packaging to be recovered within 10 years, with 60 per cent recycled. Moreover, some exemptions were granted to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, because of their geographical position on the fringes of the EU, and their comparatively low consumption of packaging. Ministers also agreed that member countries would be allowed to exceed the targets, but only if this did not lead to a distortion of the European internal market for packaging through those countries exporting the waste. That means a German company, for instance, might be prevented from exporting excess packaging waste to other member states, unless there was a bilateral agreement with a country prepared to take it. The compromise received a cautious welcome from packaging organisations. Mr James Jensen, director general of the Packaging Federation, which represents some of Europe's largest packaging companies, called it a 'victory for common sense'. 'What has emerged is a good balance,' he added. Ms Jane Bickerstaffe, technical director of Incpen, the London-based Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment, was more cautious. She said the targets were 'more realistic, more sensible', but the directive faced a rough passage through the European parliament. Mr David Veitch of Procter and Gamble Europe, a member of the executive committee of the European Recovery and Recycling Association, said he was pleased ministers had recognised the need to review the targets later, according to the progress being made and available technology. Reaction in Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, has been predictably negative. Mr Hans Alders, Dutch environment minister, said the directive had been so weakened it had 'nothing to do with the environment'. Mr Klaus Topfer, German environment minister and architect of the country's environmental legislation, said the agreement would set back progress on environmental protection in Europe and force Germany to produce more waste. 'It is not supposed to be the EU's job to standardise the environmental tempo in all member states at any price or even to reverse it,' he said. Germany already recycles 66 per cent of its paper, 55 per cent of glass, 48 per cent of tin plate, and 20 per cent of plastics, and has an overall recycling target of 60 per cent by mid-1995. It says Europe as a whole already recycles more than 25 per cent of its packaging material - if figures for glass, recycling of which is well established, are included - and so the new directive may be a harmonising measure, but is not progressive. But France and the UK, in particular, have complained that German waste exports are undermining their domestic waste management companies, which can no longer compete with cheaper waste paper coming across their borders. 'It was very clear to environment ministers in Brussels that the German model needed to be scaled back to meet the concern of member states angered by German waste exports,' said Ms Nacy Russotto, director of the Association of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe. Officials at the German environment ministry counter that Germany's waste export problems are only temporary as two recycling plants in eastern Germany are due to be functioning next year and will be able to recycle nearly all the waste paper now exported to neighbouring countries.

I must  admit that I had to protest a little against the views regarding  Europe's expansion, because I am convinced that Europe can never  be expanded (or even made smaller) by anyone. Europe is Europe  regardless of the kind of institutions established in it, and  views about its expansion can only be contemplated in relation  to individual European institutions or organizations. In a  panel discussion involving the Belgian, Danish, Finnish, and  Czech prime ministers, it became obvious that this difference is  very important and that we are the ones who always point it out.  Finnish Prime Minister Aho played into my hands by quoting the  famous Finnish composer Sibelius, thus enabling me to reply that  Sibelius was not only a Finnish composer, but also --  undoubtedly -- a European one, without being recognized as such  by some European institutions. The topic of many discussions  was the future of Europe and its position in the world.    Our experience tells us that the success (or failure) of  Europe -- and, in fact, of all of us -- does not so much depend  on the existence, scope, and activities of multilateral European  institutions, but that it depends far more on the type and  structure of the political, social, and economic system that  exists in European countries. We know very well that the reason  for our own failure to keep pace with Western Europe and our  rather unhappy life during the past four decades was not the  existence of an institution like the Council for Mutual Economic  Assistance, but the existence of the communist regime. The  symmetric opposite also applies: The success of Western Europe  did not depend on European Community institutions, but on a free  society, private ownership, and a free market. This was not  only valid in the past, it is also valid for today and tomorrow.    It is being decided right now whether Eastern Europe will  uphold such a system or whether it will allow it to degenerate  into a new form of collectivism endorsed under the banner of  this or that old- new salvation-bringing ""ism."" The success of  Europe depends on the extent of individual freedom; the extent  of the free market and trade; the ability to get rid of  unnecessary state interference in people's lives and their  economic activities; curbing bureaucratic manipulation with  everyone and everything; our determination and courage to limit  the influence of the powerful and the social well being of lobby  groups; and our ability to put in order the basic economic  attributes, especially our handling of the reward we get for  them.    In this context and under these circumstances, it is  necessary to specify carefully the conditions for the possible  favorable impact of multilateral European institutions on our  future. I am concerned that the careful formulation of these  conditions is being forgotten due to the simplified and a priori  accepted argument that, without a united Europe, we will be  ""small,"" ""weak,"" and ""unable to stand up to competition"" with  the world's other regions. The favorable impact of these  institutions, however, depends on the following:    1. Whether these pan-European institutions are greater  advocates of the free market and free trade and greater  opponents of state interventionism, bureaucracy, and lobbying  than individual European states;    2. Whether the institutionalized, organized integration of  Europe produces ""bulk savings,"" or whether the rewards from the  size of the regions would be higher than the losses associated  with the functioning of too-widespread organizations;    3. Whether the idea of a unified, institutionally united  Europe is in the real interests of Europe's citizens and not  just in the interests of European politicians of a particular  ideological persuasion, as is the case at the moment.    Patiently seeking (and empirically verifying) the answers to  these questions has nothing whatsoever to do with nationalism  (or internationalism), egoism (or altruism), or not seeing  further than one's own nose (or adopting a broader view and  perspective) as is often cast up -- in an oversimplified manner  -- on certain people in our country and abroad.    The Czech Republic proceeds from the hypothesis that the  Czech lands were always part of Europe and, therefore, that they  do not want to be deprived of all the advantages stemming from  membership in European institutions. I firmly believe that we  have already crossed the Rubicon dividing the two totally  different social systems, that we deserve to be taken seriously,  and that we are prepared for further steps toward European  integration. If I say integration, it is because I do not want  to say unification or association, which are altogether  different processes.    We want to be an ""equal partner"" that does not just want to  get or acquire something, we are also prepared to give. We know  we have to resolve our problems ourselves and, therefore, we are  not asking anyone to resolve them for us. We believe that the  current form of the European integration process is not the  final one, and we would like to participate in the never-ending  process of seeking the most ideal form for it. We realize that  our communist past enables us to see some things more clearly  than the countries of Western Europe, which did not have this  past. This was a great blessing for them, but it is our duty to  constantly point out some of the stumbling blocks. We believe  that we will be listened to.     "
0,FT934-12754 ,"FT934-12754 _AN-DJYCQAERFT 931025   FT  25 OCT 93 / Monday Interview: Discreet man of steel - Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, talks to Andrew Hill      By ANDREW HILL   European Community competition policy seems to have gone quiet since Mr Karel Van Miert took over from Sir Leon Brittan as EC competition commissioner in January. Mr Van Miert has taken fewer high-profile decisions than his predecessor, delivered fewer speeches and had no 'rows' with his industry counterpart, Mr Martin Bangemann, who last year merrily lambasted competition hard-liners as over-legalistic 'ayatollahs and gurus'. The difference is due partly to a dearth of important competition cases, but mainly to a clear change in style. Mr Van Miert, affable former chairman of the Flemish Socialist party, is no ayatollah - nor, however, has he turned out to be as pliable as Europe's more interventionist governments perhaps hoped he would be. That should be little surprise to those who know Mr Van Miert. As commissioner responsible for transport, Mr Van Miert helped cajole governments and flag-carrying airlines into far-reaching liberalisation of air transport last year. But now, 10 months into his job, his discreet approach faces some of its biggest tests. He has just returned from a trip to the US and departs for Japan at the beginning of next month with the aim of challenging some of its deep-rooted restrictive business practices. Before then, he hopes finally to persuade some of Europe's largest publicly owned steelmakers to agree the capacity cuts and reductions in state aid that will allow a restructuring of the EC industry to go ahead. Under such circumstances - with the European economy squeezed by recession and lagging behind its competitors - Mr Van Miert, 51, believes the question of whether he is strict or relaxed about competition policy is irrelevant. 'It's not a matter of soft-line or hard-line,' he says. 'The question is: how can you balance and combine the legalistic approach (to competition policy) with what's happening in the real world.' As he moves out of the shadow of Sir Leon, Mr Van Miert has begun to answer that question. In speeches during his US visit earlier this month, he argued that recession and the increasing openness of world trade should change the way in which the Commission examines competition cases. In particular, Mr Van Miert is convinced the potential for job creation ought to be a factor when deciding whether or not to clear deals hovering between assent and prohibition. This would appear to re-awaken the fears of competition lawyers, among others, that Mr Van Miert might start to blur what they saw as a consistent and orthodox line pursued by Sir Leon. But Mr Van Miert says competition policy cannot stand on its own, even if it remains the principal criterion in Commission decisions. Competition policy is the motor of economic growth - but it is useless unless, as he puts it, the 'bodywork' is also kept in good condition. 'My responsibility is to look after the motor in the first place, but not forgetting that it's part of an overall structure,' he says. By taking into account employment prospects the Commission is only responding to acute concern about the EC's growing unemployment rate, which is bound to figure in debate between EC leaders at this Friday's special summit in Brussels. 'It's hard to see how a society can survive with unemployment of 15 per cent or more,' Mr Van Miert points out. (The average EC unemployment rate is 12 per cent.) 'You can't just look at your competition textbook and say: 'That has to be No, and that's it.' You need to take into account the real situation.' Mr Van Miert's other concern is that competition policy should adequately reflect changes in the market for certain products. The Commission used to examine the effect on competition in national markets or the European market, but increasingly the world market is a more appropriate reference, particularly for electronics products. 'There are no ready-made solutions,' he says. As an example, the commissioner cites the approval he gave earlier this year to a joint venture between Philips of the Netherlands, and Thomson and Sagem of France to produce liquid crystal display screens. They were the only producers in the EC, but competition on the world market is so intense that the Commission decided it could allow them to co-operate in the research, development and production of LCD screens for strategic reasons. Internationally, Mr Van Miert is keen to promote a three-stage process for removing the remaining barriers to free competition. First, he says a level playing field must be created. For the EC, that would mean protecting EC airlines and telecoms companies, for example, until they were strong enough to face their US counterparts - 'who grew strong on the back of the biggest, best protected market in the world' - on equal terms. Otherwise, he says, 'it would be like starting a boxing match between a heavyweight and a featherweight'. For the second stage, Mr Van Miert would take up an idea first mooted by Sir Leon 18 months ago: to challenge restrictive business practices worldwide, such as cartels, by setting minimum competition rules, enforced through the disputes settlement procedure of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This is one topic which Mr Van Miert hopes to discuss with the Japanese next month, building on what he claims is a new readiness by the Japanese authorities to tackle collusion between Japanese companies. 'We should tell them now: 'Really, enough is enough',' he says. Finally, and most ambitiously, Mr Van Miert - who was briefly environment commissioner last year - would like to prevent companies exploiting some countries' inferior environmental or social standards, by imposing minimum international rules in these sensitive policy areas. Such environmental and social concerns have rarely been voiced with such passion by an EC competition commissioner. But Mr Van Miert says that the broad thrust of EC competition policy has not really changed since the days of Sir Leon. In fact, in spite of his more aggressive profile, Sir Leon's approach was not always as strict as his most zealous fans would like to make out. Several of the decisions cited by Mr Van Miert as examples of Commission flexibility on job creation and markets were taken by his predecessor. Moreover, Mr Van Miert has proved himself capable of using the textbook - particularly against the public sector - when necessary. He has demonstrated genuine toughness in regulating state aid, notably to the ailing steel sector. This was the part of his job which he believed would be most challenging. Mr Van Miert insists on restricting state subsidies to some of Europe's largest publicly owned steel companies. He has banned subsidised construction of new capacity, and insisted on closures and job cuts in exchange for approval of existing state aid. In doing so, Mr Van Miert has faced down the Spanish government, which has agreed to cut capacity in the sensitive Basque region of the country, and is trying to manoeuvre the Italian and German authorities into a deal on their restructuring plans. Mr Van Miert hopes to table proposals for limiting state aid at a crucial meeting of EC industry ministers next month. To persuade them to approve the Commission proposals, he will warn ministers of what is likely to happen if they fail to take a decision. If capacity cuts are not made, he says, and state subsidies are not reduced, then recent modest price rises will be wiped out, and a potentially crippling race for state aid could ensue. 'I'm rather optimistic,' says Mr Van Miert. 'The situation in the sector is such that I think companies and governments will go for a deal.

0,FT931-5713 ,"FT931-5713 _AN-DCDB5AF3FT 930304   FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: VW steps up the pressure on suppliers - Kevin Done talks to Volkswagen group executives about the plan to cut its uncompetitive cost base      By KEVIN DONE   THE VOLKSWAGEN group, Europe's leading carmaker, is applying heavy pressure on its components suppliers to cut their prices sharply. Audi, the group's executive and luxury car division, and Seat, the group's Spanish subsidiary, have written to suppliers demanding a 5 per cent cut in prices in 1993. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chairman of the Volkswagen group and chairman of the VW volume car division, said that in some cases the VW division was seeking even more substantial concessions from suppliers. 'Maybe we need even more than 5 per cent at VW. We are talking to each of our suppliers. Sometimes we are seeking cuts of 3 or 5 or 10 per cent. It depends on the product and its history.' Mr Erich Schmitt, Audi director of purchasing, said the group had set the goal of reducing the prices of components purchased from outside suppliers by 25 to 30 per cent over the next four to five years, helped by efficiencies from the introduction of new model generations. The Volkswagen group's belated drive to cut its uncompetitive cost base is creating upheaval both internally and among its German supply base. Audi components purchases from outside the group total around DM7bn (Dollars 4.2bn), while Volkswagen division purchases in Europe total around DM15bn. The group has fallen far behind its rivals in reforming its crucial relations with suppliers. Mr Schmitt said that the number of the group's suppliers would have to be sharply reduced with Audi seeking to cut the number of its first tier suppliers from 900 at present to only 300 to 400 over the next five years. The group was seeking to cut its costly dependence on German-based suppliers. Around 90 per cent of Audi purchases were still made in Germany 'We want to start real global sourcing,' said Mr Schmitt. Mr Goeudevert admitted that the Volkswagen group was lagging seriously behind its competitors. 'Everyone in the industry knows that Volkswagen has a cost problem. We must reduce dramatically our cost structures in the next 12 to 18 months. We have two years.' Mr Goeudevert warned that Volkswagen was forecasting a drop of 20 to 22 per cent in new car sales in Germany in 1993 and a fall of 10 to 15 per cent in new car sales across west Europe. 'We have two main ambitions. Cost, cost, cost, to lower the break-even level, and quality. There will be no concessions on quality. We must leave for a while the dedication to improving sales volumes year by year. This will be the dedication of management in the next two years,' he said. With its profits plummeting and probably the worst cost structure of any of the volume carmakers in Europe, Volkswagen is facing a period of daunting upheaval to close the gap on its rivals. A further shake-up of the group's top management is expected to be announced later this month by Mr Ferdinand Piech, who took over as chairman of the VW group management board at the beginning of January. Speculation persists that Mr Piech is still trying to recruit Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the head of global purchasing at General Motors and the man credited with giving GM Europe the most competitive purchasing cost base of any of Europe's volume carmakers. Mr Goeudevert said the VW division was pursuing a 12-point programme to cut its costs including a sharp reduction in the workforce, cuts in materials purchasing costs and lower capital investment, with the delay of some key projects such as the completion of the second stage of a new integrated car plant at Mosel in eastern Germany. Job reductions were being brought forward with the aim of cutting 12,500 jobs in the VW volume car division in Germany in the two years 1993-94. Originally, these cuts were to have been spread over five years. Mr Goeudevert warned that if new car sales in Germany and west Europe declined even more sharply than currently forecast 'then we must look at a new job reduction programme.' 'We are going to reduce output in line with the falling market. We expect to keep our market share where it was,' he said. VW is carrying excess car stocks. VW is cutting 18 production days in the first quarter and 13 in the second quarter of 1993 with the aim of reducing output by 160,000 cars in the first six months. Expenditure by the group on its automotive operations was being reduced to DM46bn in the five years from 1993 to 1997 from DM51bn previously planned from 1992 to 1996.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

Speculation has been raging for weeks about who will succeed him as chairman of the management board of Europe's biggest car-maker. While pole position was held by former French academic Daniel Goeudevert, board chairman of the Volkswagen division, he has evidently been overhauled by engineer Ferdinand Piech, head of VW's Audi subsidiary and a family shareholder in troubled Porsche. Despite his reticent public manner, the latest betting rates Piech as the narrow favourite to be Hahn's replacement. Hence an audible high-revving of interest among the banqueting hacks when, after reciting the familiar list of the group's achievements, Hahn declared: 'Now let's come to talk about the successor,' and paused pregnantly before continuing: 'The successor of the Golf II, the Golf III, is proving an outstanding success. The successor must always be better than the predecessor and that must be the case in the future too, and not only for cars.'  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, said 'some especially interesting' proposals had been put forward from regional authorities. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the German group's Basque-born production director who recently defected from General Motors, campaigned fiercely at GM for his so-called Plateau 6 plant to be built in his homeland, where he retains strong political connections. The US group's refusal, and its preference for any future investments to be made in eastern Europe where costs are far below those in any European Community country, are understood to be the main reasons for his stormy departure from Detroit in March. Seat's statement yesterday, following the announcement that Mr Lopez is to hold press conferences in Hanover and Madrid next Monday, were widely seen as signalling confirmation that VW had accepted his proposals. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, told shareholders last week that the group was planning a new plant to build a cheap 'people's car'. He did not say where or when. Mr Piech, who recently ordered that development of a brand-new plant in Mosel, eastern Germany, should be slowed because of industry-wide over-capacity and the worst market slump since the war, said the people's car could only be built in a new plant. Plateau 6 is a concept developed partly by Mr Lopez while he was at GM. It involves the assembly of cars from modules mainly shipped from outside suppliers, and installed by their staff. The object is to cut costs by reducing manufacturing time to around half the current European average.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Seat.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

The deal, subject to regulatory approval, should be ready by the first quarter of 1994. First-year sales for the new company, which will have some 800 employees, should reach about L800bn (Dollars 487m). The venture will comprise EniChem Agricoltura's two most efficient plants at Ferrara and Ravenna and Hydro's fertiliser unit in Ambes, France, as well as both groups' fertiliser marketing organisations in Italy, southern France, Spain, Greece and Portugal. The merger has been triggered by difficulties in Europe's fertiliser business caused by gross overcapacity and severe price competition. Matters have been exacerbated by lower demand from farmers and a sharp rise in imports, especially from eastern Europe. 'This has led to a substantial over-capacity in the European fertiliser industry, making structural changes necessary,' said Norsk Hydro. It estimates about 4m tonnes of European fertiliser production will be shut down throughout the continent by 1994. Both companies have experienced difficulties with their fertiliser activities. Hydro suffered operating losses of NKr237m (Dollars 32m) on fertiliser sales of NKr16bn in 1992. The previous year, it took a NKr1.5bn restructuring charge for its fertiliser activities. The group has shut down about 2.5m tonnes of fertiliser production capacity. EniChem has been restructuring, although its efforts have been hampered by political difficulties and Italy's tough job protection laws. Its Gela plant in Sicily has been sold, while a unit in Liguria is up for sale. Although the fate of its other facilities is unclear, observers say the two plants being contributed to the joint venture may represent EniChem Agricoltura's only capacity in the fertilisers field.

0,FT911-3495 ,"FT911-3495 _AN-BDXBTAFTFT 910424   FT  24 APR 91 / East Europe should learn from Asia: From central planning to a market economy      By S STANLEY KATZ   East European countries engaged in the heroic change-over from centrally-planned to market-driven economic systems have been getting most of their advice from the west. They would do well to look to Asia as well. Advice to eastern Europe from western experts largely follows classical economic lines: free prices, remove subsidies, open your economies to international trade, make your currencies freely convertible, privatise the state-owned companies, invite foreign investment, close inefficient plants and retire redundant workers. This, the experts acknowledge, will involve some costs - higher prices, unemployment, lost income, and more foreign debt and servicing. But these are short-term and will be more than offset by the longer-term benefits that accrue from free markets. They urge, therefore, that their recommended reform package be adopted quickly and in full, while supporters of economic change still hold the high ground. Initially, east Europe's economic reformers assumed that advice about markets from advisers schooled in market economies could not be wrong. More recently, however, the first rush of enthusiasm for a cold-turkey approach to reform is fading. Euphoria over economic emancipation is giving way to a more hard-headed assessment of the people and institutional deficits that will have to be cleared before eastern Europe's economies can survive - much less compete - in a free-market world. The deficits are formidable: most of the basic skills and institutions needed to make a system work - double-entry book-keeping, personal property rights and a commercial banking system, to name a few - do not exist. Industrial equipment and technology are, by western standards, obsolete. Few companies can estimate their net worth or unit production costs, or judge what they could produce competitively - information all serious foreign investors would insist on. Arching over these deficits are the problems of severe environmental degradation, long-neglected infrastructure and the virtual disappearance of the region's pre-war ethic. Increased awareness of their economies' internal weaknesses, together with doubts about continued public support for a reform process that involves hardships of unknown magnitude and unpredictable duration, are raising second thoughts among eastern Europe's leaders about the wisdom of exposing their still-fragile democracies to what amounts to an economic free-fall. Other factors have surfaced as well that reinforce the need for a second look. The recent rout of agricultural subsidies by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the continuing row between the US and Japan over market access, for example, suggest that the free-market approach recommended for eastern Europe is honoured as much in the breach as in the observance by the market-oriented countries of the west. A further discovery is that the path to the market being urged on east European countries is substantially different to that taken by countries that have most recently successfully navigated the course from economic backwardness to world-class competitors. These, of course, are Asia's Newly Industrialised Countries (NICs): Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Many cultural, political and social differences separate east Europe from east Asia, and comparisons should not be pushed too far. But in terms of how to go about transforming a backward economy into an efficient, competitive one, there is much common ground and many lessons to be shared. A few examples of the differences in the approach recommended to eastern Europe and the way that NICs, and earlier, Japan, went about the work of economic reform and restructuring are perhaps instructive: Industrial strategy and support: Neither Asia's NICs nor Japan entrusted to the market, or to foreign investors, responsibility for deciding which of their industries would prosper and which would fail. On the contrary, they formulated industrial strategies based on forecasts of market developments and assessments of which of their 'neo-infant industries' could be expected to carve out a competitive niche in world markets and which could not. For the first group, they provided protection from import competition as well as export incentives, tax relief and other financial help to bolster their growth and competitiveness. To ensure that the beneficiary industries would not become protection-dependent and would become internationally competitive over time, fiscal support was provided on a declining scale. At the same time, companies in uncompetitive or declining industries were helped to diversify or phase out, and workers retrained. Eastern Europe, after 40 years of disastrous economic planning, understandably eschews all forms of central planning, including Asia's market-directed, indicative type. The same attitudes carry over to the question of transitional help for industries trying to adapt to market forces. While these attitudes are consistent with a free-market philosophy, Asia's less doctrinaire approach might save some east European companies that with reasonable transitional support could adjust to a market environment, but without it would likely go under - taking jobs and income with them. Exchange rates: Asian countries have used exchange rates as an important tool of economic policy. As typified by Korea and Taiwan, exchange rates were set to encourage exports and savings and discourage imports. Only after exports had penetrated big overseas markets - and they had amassed large reserves in the process - did these countries agree (reluctantly) to a revaluation of their currencies. East European countries are being advised to do the opposite: let the market determine the volumes of imports and exports and, by default, set the market-clearing exchange rate. Foreign investment: Japan earlier, and the NICs more recently, have acquired much of their technology through licences, franchises, market-sharing arrangements and reverse engineering (Asian for 'pirating'). They wanted knowledge and technology, not foreign partners, and foreign equity investment was (and is) not actively encouraged. During Japan's first period of modernisation in the 1860s, Japan imported European bankers - but not their banks - to help create a domestic banking system. When enough Japanese had learned to be bankers, the foreign advisers were sent home. The NICs have adopted an essentially similar technique. Price liberalisation and subsidies: Prices in Asia's NICs are nominally set by market forces. But key prices may be adjusted further by fiscal means (tax rebates, tariffs, duties, subsidies) to ensure that the buy/sell, save/invest signals they emit conform to national priorities: high savings and investment rates, aggressive exporting and relative self-sufficiency in food. It is incongruous that while east European countries are being urged to let market forces determine their domestic prices, there is no market price for imported rice in Japan - because there is no imported rice; and agricultural prices in the US and Europe are influenced as much by national budgets as by market forces. A final consideration. It is axiomatic that public support for economic reform is inversely proportionate to the distress it causes. Common to both Asia's and eastern Europe's economic restructuring efforts is the need to enlist and maintain public support for the reform process. Asia's NICs have demonstrated that it is possible to achieve market-driven economic restructuring without incurring unacceptably high economic and social costs. Eastern Europe's economic reformers might find it rewarding to take a closer look at Asia's experience.

The Prometheus research programme aims to halve the EU's 50,000 road deaths a year by 2010 through the greater use of in-car electronic information systems and other technological developments. Mr Jacques Calvet, Peugeot chairman, and Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, managing director of Fiat and president of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, warned that unless Brussels and the 12 EU member states made better progress in creating common standards and electronic languages for such items as roadside beacons transmitting information to receivers in vehicles this goal would be threatened. In addition, technology developed by Europe's vehicle and component manufacturers would be overtaken by the Japanese and North American motor industries. Also at stake were tens of billions of Ecus, which business loses every year through delays, wasted man-hours and other costs, industry leaders said. The warnings came at a Paris conference and exhibition at which 90 cars and commercial vehicles fitted with the technology developed under the programme, which started in 1986, were demonstrated. The cars could: illuminate long distances in the dark with infra-red and ultra-violet headlights; automatically avoid collision with radar; cruise 'intelligently' by automatically keeping pace with vehicles in front; stay within white lines, thanks to computer image processing; know exactly where they were on the Paris road network via satellite; and summon emergency services to the exact location of a breakdown or accident with or without any driver action. Mr Calvet and Mr Garuzzo sharply criticised 'budgeting problems' in Brussels and national governments, which have led to the 20 vehicle and component makers within Prometheus funding 70 per cent of the research programme.

TOTH, Times Staff Writer      WASHINGTON      The prospective agreement in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks with the Soviet  Union sounds like an arms controller's dream come true.    As formulated in principle by former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the treaty promises to cut almost in half the  long-range nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. It could  save the United States an estimated $2 billion a year in the short term and  even more in the long term.    Yet the treaty, as it is expected to emerge in final form from the talks that  were resumed last month in Geneva, already is the subject of intense criticism  and debate.    Whatever the outcome of that debate, any strategic arms cuts on the scale  envisioned in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) will require the  United States to make vast changes in its national security planning and its  nuclear arsenal -- changes that represent a priceless opportunity to correct  past mistakes or, critics warn, to make dangerous new ones.    ""Clearly,"" said Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services  Committee, ""our entire targeting doctrine needs to be rethought in light of the  START reductions.""    Some arms control experts, including former Secretary of State Henry A.  Kissinger, complain that the treaty, as conceived, would contain terms that  could actually make a nuclear war more likely rather than less likely.  Kissinger and others argue that, depending on how the weapons reductions are  carried out, the Soviets could have an incentive to launch a first strike.      Wiping Out the Peace Dividend    Also, the Pentagon is contending, much as it did when the first Strategic Arms  Limitation Treaty was negotiated in 1972, that it will need a variety of  sophisticated and more costly weapons as a result of a new treaty -- more than  wiping out any so-called peace dividend.    ""START has clearly put us in a bind,"" admitted a senior national security  official in the Bush Administration. He said it has exposed contradictions in  U.S. policies toward controlling the arms race, acquiring new nuclear weapons,  choosing Soviet targets for U.S. nuclear weapons and deterring nuclear war.    These issues converge at a time when Cold War pressures appear to be subsiding,  partly because of budget constraints at home and partly because of Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's warming smiles abroad.    But experts across the political spectrum agree that ironing out the  contradictions and unresolved disputes embedded in U.S. strategy becomes more  rather than less urgent as the Cold War wanes.    That military buildups undertaken without coherent plans have often proved  wasteful is a historical truism. Defense specialists warn, however, that a  weapons ""build-down"" such as that now envisaged in START could be disastrous  without a coherent strategy for obtaining weapons suited to the post-START  world and without developing effective plans for using them against Soviet  targets.    The START talks, which began under President Reagan, were delayed until June by  Bush Administration officials so they could examine how the talks had  progressed.    ""We have had some reservations about whether, if we conclude the present  agreement strictly in accordance with its present direction, we could get it  ratified (by the Senate),"" Secretary of State James A. Baker III said.    When the START talks resumed, the United States sought to speed up work on  verification measures, even though it did not know what the agreement's precise  terms would be. And Bush emphasized that beyond weapons reduction, the goal of  any agreement would be to ""enhance security and strategic stability.""    He then reaffirmed the key principles negotiated so far, seeming to brush aside  the concerns expressed by some members of his national security team.    As approved last year by Reagan and Gorbachev, the treaty would limit the  United States and the Soviet Union to 1,600 delivery systems each -- that is,  intercontinental missiles and bombers. The United States now has about 2,000  missiles and bombers; the Soviet Union has about 2,500.      'Accountable' Nuclear Weapons    These delivery systems could carry no more than 6,000 ""accountable"" nuclear  weapons -- that is, weapons such as warheads that count against that ceiling  and sub-ceilings under it. The result is that considerably more than 6,000  weapons will be permitted, in fact, on both sides.    Of these 6,000 weapons, no more than 4,900 could be ballistic missile warheads.  These warheads, because they are fast-flying and accurate, are most capable of  delivering a surprise attack aimed at knocking out the other side's hardened,  or fortified, missile silos.    Bombers, because they are slow and can be recalled after takeoff, will be  discounted: If they carry only bombs and short-range attack missiles, rather  than ground-hugging cruise missiles, they will count as only one weapon.  Because the United States has about 200 B-52 and B-1 bombers, each of which can  carry between 12 and 16 bombs and short-range nuclear missiles, between 2,400  and 3,200 of these nuclear weapons would not be subject to the treaty's limits.  The situation with the Soviets is similar.    The United States has about 13,000 long-range nuclear weapons and the Soviets  have about 12,000. START would reduce these totals by 25% to 30% overall, to  between 8,000 and 9,000 on each side, although it would reduce the number of  the most dangerous weapons -- the ballistic missile warheads -- by 40% to 50%.    Despite the START treaty's obvious appeal, some experts are critical of some of  its provisions because they could have the effect of leaving the Soviets with  relatively more nuclear warheads aimed at U.S. missile silos than they have  now.      U.S. Silos Targeted    At present, the Soviets have about three warheads targeted on every U.S. silo.  Under START, this ratio could go as high as 9 to 1, according to arms  specialists Edward L. Warner III and David A. Ochmanek, authors of the new book  ""Next Moves."" This would be the outcome if the United States reduced its forces  under START by eliminating mostly land-based missiles -- a pattern it might  follow to avoid cutting back its relatively impregnable submarine-based  missiles.    Kissinger argues that in a crisis, having so many missiles available to use  against U.S. silos could tempt the Soviets to launch a surprise attack in the  hope of wiping out this country's land-based missile force.    Warner and Ochmanek, among others, are less concerned about this possibility.  U.S. missile silos are already vulnerable to Soviet attack, they reason, and  even if the Soviets had more warheads to aim at U.S. missile silos, they would  not waste more than three on each target.    Besides, the Soviets would realize that even if they could wipe out all U.S.  intercontinental missiles, they would still have to contend with missiles  carried by submarines and bombers.    Congress would probably reject a treaty that appeared to increase U.S.  vulnerability, unless it was assured that START reductions will be structured,  and new weapons will be purchased, to avoid this liability.      Soviet Targets    Of even greater concern to some experts is the impact of the treaty on the  other side of the equation: the U.S. targeting of strategic locations in the  Soviet Union.    Part of the U.S. nuclear force is aimed at Soviet nuclear weapons sites. START  would eliminate more of these warheads -- eight or 10 times more, by some  calculations -- than the Soviet missiles at which they are targeted.    This would leave a major shortfall of U.S. weapons to cover all the targets  they now threaten. Thus one apparently inevitable consequence of the START  treaty would be that some Soviet sites now targeted by U.S. missiles would have  to be dropped. Or at the very least, the number of U.S. weapons now allocated  to particular targets would be reduced.    For example, where current U.S. targeting plans might call for firing three  warheads at each hardened Soviet missile silo to ensure its destruction, only  two warheads might be allocated to each target after START takes effect.    But such reevaluations might turn out to be a plus, many specialists believe,  by forcing the Air Force to end many wasteful targeting practices that it now  follows.      Empty Tank Farms, Barracks    The Pentagon might decide, for instance, that it is no longer necessary to  cover all Soviet missile silos for purposes of a retaliatory U.S. strike,  because -- if the United States were responding to a Soviet attack -- most  Soviet missiles would already have been launched. Similarly, if the Soviets  were to launch a surprise attack, the tank farms and troop barracks now on U.S.  targeting lists would be largely vacated in advance.    ""It's a plausible first response (to START) not to aim any longer at empty  places,"" said a highly experienced retired military officer who continues to  consult on such issues. ""That way we need not suffer a reduction in coverage  and of damage expectancy.""    Some experts have long argued that the Pentagon should have made this decision  decades ago, thereby reducing its demand for nuclear weapons and avoiding the  present vastly overbuilt stockpile.    A separate controversy revolves around the number of missiles each side should  be allowed to have. The treaty as now being negotiated would limit each side to  1,600 missiles and bombers, but Warner and Ochmanek argue that the United  States would be better off with a somewhat higher limit -- perhaps 1,800 or  2,000.    Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, appeared to favor  a higher ceiling before he joined the White House team.      More Difficult for Surprise    The rationale for this view is that having more missiles for the Soviets to aim  at would reduce the ratio of Soviet weapons to U.S. targets, making it more  difficult for Moscow to succeed in any surprise attack. That in turn would  reduce the Soviets' temptation to start a war.    To these experts, it is far more important that the treaty limit warheads  rather than the vehicles that carry them. Some go so far as to suggest that  there should be no limit on missiles at all, that limits should apply only to  warheads.    The Bush Administration has decided not to seek a higher ceiling, in part  because it could be politically dangerous to appear to be moving in the wrong  direction by seeking to keep more missiles rather than fewer.    To the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Strategic Air Command, the United States  must compensate for the reduced arsenal it would have under a START treaty by  modernizing its remaining strategic forces. In their view, all necessary Soviet  targets could be covered adequately in the post-START world and the Soviets  deterred from launching an attack if more accurate, powerful and flexible  weapons are acquired.    The problem, in an era of budget deficits, is that the shopping list is long  and very expensive. Here is what the Pentagon says it would need if the treaty  becomes effective:     -- A new ICBM program, already the subject of considerable controversy. The  Pentagon originally wanted 50 new MX missiles on rails, each armed with 10  nuclear warheads. Cost: $15 billion. Congressional Democrats as well as many  experts, including Scowcroft, then a private citizen, favored building 500  single-warhead Midgetman missiles, to be mounted on special trucks. Cost: $27  billion or more.    A compromise has been worked out in which the existing 50 MXs now in silos will  be put on rails in the early 1990s, at a cost of about $5.4 billion. Meanwhile,  work is being accelerated on Midgetman, aiming for deployment in the late  1990s.     -- The B-2 stealth bomber. This is a particularly high Air Force priority. It  would cost about $70 billion for 132 planes. The Pentagon delayed the program  for a year because of budgetary and technical problems. Initial operation of  the plane is now scheduled for 1992. But despite a dramatic test flight last  week, funding for the B-2 still remains a subject of dispute in Congress.     -- Other modernization programs. These include more Trident missile  submarines, at $2 billion each, an air-launched cruise missile using stealth  technology, at $7 billion, and more secure command and control systems, at an  undetermined cost.    ""If the modernization program should be stopped,"" the SAC commander, Gen. John  T. Chain, warned in an interview at his headquarters at Omaha, Neb., ""then I  will go (to Congress) to testify against the START treaty, and so will the  Joint Chiefs of Staff.""    The fight over which missile to buy -- the MX or the Midgetman -- for the  post-START arsenal dramatizes a basic disagreement within the national security  community over what types of nuclear weapons and what capabilities will be most  important.    The dispute ostensibly revolves around money. Midgetman is roughly twice as  expensive for each warhead delivered. But the root disagreement is over which  weapon would best deter a Soviet attack in a post-START world of drastically  reduced arsenals.    One school, made up primarily of civilian arms experts and congressional  Democrats, insists that the new missiles should be configured to survive any  Soviet attack and still retaliate. A recent Brookings Institution study  concluded that the survivability of weapons would grow in importance as the  arsenals are reduced.    The other school, centered in the military and among conservative politicians,  prefers weapons that can better fight wars and destroy the enemy's weapons,  even if they are less safe from a first strike. Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air  Force chief of staff, has said that ""survivability has been overplayed. . . .  The real issue is capability.""    This dispute reflects the tension between advocates of two strategies for  fighting a nuclear war:     -- The retaliatory strategy of assuring the Soviets that the United States can  ride out any Soviet attack and, in retaliation, destroy much of Soviet society.     -- The war-fighting strategy of being able to knock out Soviet weapons before  they can be used on the United States.    Proponents of both strategies have long recognized the need for making  intercontinental ballistic missiles mobile as the growing number and accuracy  of Soviet missiles through the 1970s made U.S. silo-based ICBMs increasingly  vulnerable to a surprise attack. A Soviet attack in which two or three SS-18  warheads were targeted on each U.S. missile silo would destroy between 66% and  95% of the U.S. ICBM force, according to Pentagon estimates.    U.S. submarine-launched missiles and many bombers would be expected to escape  and be able to retaliate. But the consensus of military and civilian experts is  that the land-based missile leg of the U.S. triad of nuclear forces should not  be permitted to become significantly weaker than the others.    The most credible solution to this problem, mobility, has already been embraced  by the Soviets. They have deployed 10-warhead SS-24 ICBMs on rails and  single-warhead SS-25s on trucks.    Paradoxically, the U.S. proposal for a START treaty would ban mobile ICBMs,  even though the Bush Administration wants to build both rail-mobile and  road-mobile ICBMs. The Administration has promised to withdraw this prohibition  element from the START negotiations once it gets assurance from Congress that  lawmakers will fund its two-missile program.    In the end, the United States probably will not be able to afford both missiles  indefinitely and will have to choose. The choice may come at the bargaining  table in Geneva, where the superpowers probably will examine whether to ban  multi-warhead mobile missiles, including the MX and the SS-24, as part of the  START treaty.    Or it may be made unilaterally in Washington, if the Administration can resolve  its internal ambivalence on which type of mobile missile to support. The White  House emphasizes the survivability of new weapons, and this indicates that it  favors the Midgetman; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney initially backed the MX.    The military's insistence on weapons that are better at war-fighting than  surviving is partly instinctive -- ""shooting first at whatever is shooting at  you,"" as one general said -- and partly fear that political leaders will  equivocate rather than act decisively in times of crisis.    For example, the Pentagon put 50 MX missiles, each with 10 warheads, into fixed  silos last year, although they are just as vulnerable as the three-warhead  Minuteman missiles that they replaced. Also, they are more attractive as  targets because they carry more warheads and are more accurate.    One four-star general reportedly declared that he wanted the MX even if it had  to be ""put in the Pentagon parking lot,"" i.e., above ground, where it would be  extremely vulnerable.    But there is more to the Pentagon's preference for power over survivability in  nuclear weapons. The less survivable the weapons, the faster the United States  must respond in a crisis. And a strategy of faster U.S. reaction means more  certain and more punishing retaliation against the Soviets, while a policy of  riding out a surprise attack before retaliating opens the way to all kinds of  problems and potential failure.    Many U.S. weapons might never be launched, military leaders believe, because  many command and control systems might not survive an initial attack. And  decision-making by political leaders could be paralyzed. Still other problems  could develop.    As a result, military leaders tend to favor acting before a full first strike  has been absorbed and, in the meanwhile, to develop weapons capable of  delivering the most devastating blows possible.    Critics, of course, note that such a strategy calls for weapons capable of  hair-trigger reaction, which could bring war closer and increase the risks of  catastrophic mistakes.    With so many complex issues to be resolved, experts say, the START treaty will  leave in its wake years of debate and decision-making, far more than the arms  limitation agreements of two decades ago.    And while the risks are certain to be emphasized, the opportunities should be  at least as great.    START would make it possible for the Bush Administration to resolve wasteful  and contradictory tension within existing policies: to create a smaller but  equally deterring nuclear force structure, to plan more efficient use of the  smaller number of nuclear weapons and to coordinate U.S. arms control policy  with U.S. weapons acquisition policy.    No Administration since the dawn of the nuclear era has had a better chance to  reform U.S. deterrent doctrine. Whether President Bush is able to do so may  become a major factor in determining his place in history.

TOTH, Times Staff Writer      WASHINGTON      The prospective agreement in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks with the Soviet  Union sounds like an arms controller's dream come true.    As formulated in principle by former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the treaty promises to cut almost in half the  long-range nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. It could  save the United States an estimated $2 billion a year in the short term and  even more in the long term.    Yet the treaty, as it is expected to emerge in final form from the talks that  were resumed last month in Geneva, already is the subject of intense criticism  and debate.    Whatever the outcome of that debate, any strategic arms cuts on the scale  envisioned in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) will require the  United States to make vast changes in its national security planning and its  nuclear arsenal -- changes that represent a priceless opportunity to correct  past mistakes or, critics warn, to make dangerous new ones.    ""Clearly,"" said Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services  Committee, ""our entire targeting doctrine needs to be rethought in light of the  START reductions.""    Some arms control experts, including former Secretary of State Henry A.  Kissinger, complain that the treaty, as conceived, would contain terms that  could actually make a nuclear war more likely rather than less likely.  Kissinger and others argue that, depending on how the weapons reductions are  carried out, the Soviets could have an incentive to launch a first strike.      Wiping Out the Peace Dividend    Also, the Pentagon is contending, much as it did when the first Strategic Arms  Limitation Treaty was negotiated in 1972, that it will need a variety of  sophisticated and more costly weapons as a result of a new treaty -- more than  wiping out any so-called peace dividend.    ""START has clearly put us in a bind,"" admitted a senior national security  official in the Bush Administration. He said it has exposed contradictions in  U.S. policies toward controlling the arms race, acquiring new nuclear weapons,  choosing Soviet targets for U.S. nuclear weapons and deterring nuclear war.    These issues converge at a time when Cold War pressures appear to be subsiding,  partly because of budget constraints at home and partly because of Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's warming smiles abroad.    But experts across the political spectrum agree that ironing out the  contradictions and unresolved disputes embedded in U.S. strategy becomes more  rather than less urgent as the Cold War wanes.    That military buildups undertaken without coherent plans have often proved  wasteful is a historical truism. Defense specialists warn, however, that a  weapons ""build-down"" such as that now envisaged in START could be disastrous  without a coherent strategy for obtaining weapons suited to the post-START  world and without developing effective plans for using them against Soviet  targets.    The START talks, which began under President Reagan, were delayed until June by  Bush Administration officials so they could examine how the talks had  progressed.    ""We have had some reservations about whether, if we conclude the present  agreement strictly in accordance with its present direction, we could get it  ratified (by the Senate),"" Secretary of State James A. Baker III said.    When the START talks resumed, the United States sought to speed up work on  verification measures, even though it did not know what the agreement's precise  terms would be. And Bush emphasized that beyond weapons reduction, the goal of  any agreement would be to ""enhance security and strategic stability.""    He then reaffirmed the key principles negotiated so far, seeming to brush aside  the concerns expressed by some members of his national security team.    As approved last year by Reagan and Gorbachev, the treaty would limit the  United States and the Soviet Union to 1,600 delivery systems each -- that is,  intercontinental missiles and bombers. The United States now has about 2,000  missiles and bombers; the Soviet Union has about 2,500.      'Accountable' Nuclear Weapons    These delivery systems could carry no more than 6,000 ""accountable"" nuclear  weapons -- that is, weapons such as warheads that count against that ceiling  and sub-ceilings under it. The result is that considerably more than 6,000  weapons will be permitted, in fact, on both sides.    Of these 6,000 weapons, no more than 4,900 could be ballistic missile warheads.  These warheads, because they are fast-flying and accurate, are most capable of  delivering a surprise attack aimed at knocking out the other side's hardened,  or fortified, missile silos.    Bombers, because they are slow and can be recalled after takeoff, will be  discounted: If they carry only bombs and short-range attack missiles, rather  than ground-hugging cruise missiles, they will count as only one weapon.  Because the United States has about 200 B-52 and B-1 bombers, each of which can  carry between 12 and 16 bombs and short-range nuclear missiles, between 2,400  and 3,200 of these nuclear weapons would not be subject to the treaty's limits.  The situation with the Soviets is similar.    The United States has about 13,000 long-range nuclear weapons and the Soviets  have about 12,000. START would reduce these totals by 25% to 30% overall, to  between 8,000 and 9,000 on each side, although it would reduce the number of  the most dangerous weapons -- the ballistic missile warheads -- by 40% to 50%.    Despite the START treaty's obvious appeal, some experts are critical of some of  its provisions because they could have the effect of leaving the Soviets with  relatively more nuclear warheads aimed at U.S. missile silos than they have  now.      U.S. Silos Targeted    At present, the Soviets have about three warheads targeted on every U.S. silo.  Under START, this ratio could go as high as 9 to 1, according to arms  specialists Edward L. Warner III and David A. Ochmanek, authors of the new book  ""Next Moves."" This would be the outcome if the United States reduced its forces  under START by eliminating mostly land-based missiles -- a pattern it might  follow to avoid cutting back its relatively impregnable submarine-based  missiles.    Kissinger argues that in a crisis, having so many missiles available to use  against U.S. silos could tempt the Soviets to launch a surprise attack in the  hope of wiping out this country's land-based missile force.    Warner and Ochmanek, among others, are less concerned about this possibility.  U.S. missile silos are already vulnerable to Soviet attack, they reason, and  even if the Soviets had more warheads to aim at U.S. missile silos, they would  not waste more than three on each target.    Besides, the Soviets would realize that even if they could wipe out all U.S.  intercontinental missiles, they would still have to contend with missiles  carried by submarines and bombers.    Congress would probably reject a treaty that appeared to increase U.S.  vulnerability, unless it was assured that START reductions will be structured,  and new weapons will be purchased, to avoid this liability.      Soviet Targets    Of even greater concern to some experts is the impact of the treaty on the  other side of the equation: the U.S. targeting of strategic locations in the  Soviet Union.    Part of the U.S. nuclear force is aimed at Soviet nuclear weapons sites. START  would eliminate more of these warheads -- eight or 10 times more, by some  calculations -- than the Soviet missiles at which they are targeted.    This would leave a major shortfall of U.S. weapons to cover all the targets  they now threaten. Thus one apparently inevitable consequence of the START  treaty would be that some Soviet sites now targeted by U.S. missiles would have  to be dropped. Or at the very least, the number of U.S. weapons now allocated  to particular targets would be reduced.    For example, where current U.S. targeting plans might call for firing three  warheads at each hardened Soviet missile silo to ensure its destruction, only  two warheads might be allocated to each target after START takes effect.    But such reevaluations might turn out to be a plus, many specialists believe,  by forcing the Air Force to end many wasteful targeting practices that it now  follows.

""That way we need not suffer a reduction in coverage  and of damage expectancy.""

Some go so far as to suggest that  there should be no limit on missiles at all, that limits should apply only to  warheads.

0,FT943-5480 ,"FT943-5480 _AN-EIDAYACMFT 940903   FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: VW studies strategy for Portuguese joint venture      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Volkswagen is to draw up a new business plan aimed at improving the viability of its Dollars 2.8bn joint venture with Ford to build multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) in Portugal, which goes on stream at the end of this year. The German vehicle maker, Europe's largest, is concerned that increasing competition in the van-like MPV sector, and adverse currency movements since the deal was signed in 1991, may make the plant less profitable. The factory is scheduled to make 190,000 MPVs a year in full production. The greenfield project, at Setubal, south of Lisbon, is the largest single foreign investment in Portugal. In full production, it is scheduled to employ 4,700 workers, and create indirectly up to another 10,000 jobs in the area. VW stressed last night there was no danger of it seeking to withdraw from or scale down the venture. The project is receiving Ecu750m (Dollars 619.8m) of EC development and training subsidies, and the Portuguese government regards it as its flagship foreign investment project. Ford of Europe, which is a 50 per cent partner with VW in the venture, last night described the Wolfsburg initiative as a 'routine' financial reassessment. It said Ford itself was not concerned about the project's viability. VW's managing board has been asked to come up with the plan in time for the supervisory board's next meeting, in November. The plant's vehicles will compete in one of the few sectors still enjoying rapid growth in Europe. Sales of multi-purpose vehicles have risen by an average 80 per cent a year since 1986, and are projected to reach 700,000 units a year by the end of the decade.

It works  very much like the celluloid film in an ordinary movie projector  -- albeit by reflecting rather than transmitting light -- and  does not have any moving parts. The prototype is based on a  sophisticated ""light-valve chip"" that electronically controls  the pixels of a viscoelastic silicon-gel film and incorporates  all the features needed for projecting digital high-definition  TV (HDTV).    Independent experts confirm that the full-colour  demonstrator  outperforms conventional liquid-crystal light-valves in  efficiency and brightness. It could replace today's enormously  bulky large-screen TV projectors with portable desktop systems  -- if only a company were willing to add some engineering and  market the device. But the Heinrich Hertz Institute is still  waiting for such a company and the project has been shelved.  The story is all too typical of European microelectronics --  good research but not enough value-added commercial products.    Engineering and research are drifting apart in Europe.  Engineers in industry struggle with managements and markets,  process yields and cost-efficient equipment, in-house resources  and external subcontractors. Researchers busy themselves with  nano- and molecular electronics, and new semiconducting  materials such as gallium arsenide, silicon-germanium compounds  and polymers. Researchers are excited by change, engineers rely  on some kind of stability over the design phase of a new product  or application.    The current speed of innovation increases the lead of  companies who can afford to take risks, and undermines the  competitiveness of those who cannot. Companies without the  profits generated by previous successful products find it  increasingly difficult to compete and can get caught in a  vicious circle. The Japanese semiconductor industry invested  some $5.2 billion (about 3.5 billion) on RD in 1992  and the  U.S. spent $3.5 billion, according to industry analyses  Dataquest. European companies only managed $1 billion. The  figures for capital spending on equipment and plant are equally  bleak; Europe only invested $0.8 billion of the global figure of  $10 billion. ""The greatest shortfall is in capital,"" says  Michael Glennon from Dataquest. ""European chip manufacturers  invest too little, stick to the wrong products and applications,  and don't export enough. Even the Asian-Pacific rim (which  excludes Japanese companies) has out-invested Europeans in  plant, giving these companies the ability to out-produce  Europeans. European companies start with a production  disadvantage -- even before products are developed.""    ""Practically speaking, the European semiconductor industry  has come to an end,"" says Lubomir Cergel from Motorola's RD  group in Geneva. The U.S. chip manufacturer currently has a  turnover of $1.3 billion in Europe, and expects it to almost  double over the next two years. But is this prediction of  Europe's prospects too pessimistic?    Strengths and Weaknesses    According to Dataquest the biggest growth areas in the  European semiconductor market over the next five years will be  data processing, communications and industrial electronics.  Unfortunately Europe's chip suppliers are strongest in slow  growth areas like transport, consumer electronics and military  applications. ""European companies are losing their share of  their own market,"" says Glennon. There are no European  companies in the top 10 of Dataquest's latest ranking of  semiconductor vendors (table 1). European chip users are also  falling behind their competitors (table 2).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1 -- The Top Ten in Semiconductors in 1993                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Company                  |Turnover (billion $)     |Market share (%)         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

Some key figures like Pasquale  Pistorio, head of SGS Thomson Microelectronics, a JESSI member,  thinks it has delivered. Europe's decline, Pistorio said  recently, has been ""stalled and stabilized."" However, this year  NEC, Japan's leading chip manufacturer, will spend 50 percent  more on RD alone than JESSI will on the whole ""food chain""  of  chip production including materials, equipment and applications.  Europe is also falling behind in the considerably smaller, but  growing, gallium arsenide market.    ""JESSI suffered from a shortage of support from Europe's  major producers and, in particular, a lack of government  backing,"" says Max Syrbe, former president of Germany's  Fraunhofer Society. ""As a pure research and technology  programme deprived of an accompanying industrial policy, JESSI  had little scope for major success."" Klaus Knapp of Siemens  Semiconductors agrees: ""The race for standard products such as  microprocessors and memories has been lost.""    However, Europe does have what Syrbe calls a ""second chance  in microelectronics"": niche markets with application-specific  integrated circuits [ASICs]. ASICs combine the circuitry of  memories and processors necessary for specific, complex tasks on  a single chip. ""Europe,"" says Syrbe ""must establish a firm hold  on the ASICs market.""    Establishing a presence in new ASICs markets -- such as HDTV  or broadband communications -- may be easier, and more  profitable, than trying to wrestle a larger share of existing  niche markets -- such as smart power devices and photovoltaics  (see box 1). ASICs could be profitable in both small and large  volumes. ""The value added in production is much higher (than  standard chips) due to their greater sophistication and hence  lower exchangeability,"" says Knut Heitmann from Daimler-Benz.  He expects the fabrication plants of the future to be small and  that manufacturing will shift from large companies to small and  medium-sized enterprises. ""Mini-fabs"" will speed up chip design  and manufacture, and cut the critical ""time to market.""    Box 1: Semiconductor Sidelines    Smart Power Devices    Semiconductor power switches have long been known as  thyristors. Modern power semiconductors are increasingly used  for process and control and automation. When these devices,  which control currents, voltages and frequencies in circuits,  are monolithically integrated with signal processing  capabilities, engineers speak of ""smart power devices.""    The world market volume for power semiconductors is  estimated  to be about $6 billion, roughly one-tenth of the total  semiconductor market. Power ICs [integrated circuits] account  for about $1.2 billion, smart power ICs for about $0.5 billion.  SGS Thomson Microelectronics is the market leader in both these  niches with an 18 percent share of the market.    Photovoltaics    More than 100,000 homes in the U.S. generate their own  electricity, with more than two-thirds of these using solar  (photovoltaic) power. However, solar power is expensive (about  one dollar per kilowatt-hour) and photovoltaic systems cost  almost twice as much as other renewable-energy systems based on  wind or hydro power.    Global sales of photovoltaic systems were about $431 million  in 1992, according to analysts, Strategies Unlimited. This  represented some 56MW of power and more than half a million  square meters of solar panels. The leading companies were  Siemens Solar (14 percent of the market), Solarex of the U.S.  (11 percent), and BP Solar, Sanyo and Kyocera (7 percent each).  Forecasts for the year 2000 are between 280MW and 440MW.    Whether photovoltaic systems can make it from a fringe  economy to the mainstream will depend on politicians. Efforts  to limit global warming could lead to carbon taxes which would  raise fossil fuel prices and make investments in solar power  more competitive. ""It's all heading in the right direction,""  says Jim Skelly, who oversees solar research at Texas  Instruments. ""But there is a lot of science and engineering to  be done to make it in the mass market.""    The mini-fabs would also implement a new manufacturing  concept in which large clean rooms are replaced by so-called  ""mini-environments,"" the semiconductor wafers are transported  and handled in scaled boxes, and all the critical process steps  (such as lithography, coating and plasma etching) are carried  out very close to the wafer. Daimler-Benz's Temic subsidiary is  about to establish a mini-fab at Heilbronn in Germany in a JESSI  flagship project called Flexible Automated Wafer-handling. The  Standard Mechanical Interface, developed in 1990 by the Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, will be used to handle and  transfer the wafers.    Temic plans to use very precise laser beams to ""write"" all  the active and passive components of the ASICs, as well as their  metallic interconnections, onto a large wafer. Although this is  slower than conventional microlithography (in which the whole  wafer is exposed at once through a mask), it removes the need to  mount and interconnect several smaller chips on a mother board.  If the demand arises, this serial processing approach for small  numbers could be stepped up to a full parallel processing for  volume production.    Heitmann is convinced that this approach represents a  ""quantum leap in technology and will create changes and  competitive advantages for all the European microelectronics  industries."" But not everyone agrees. At Motorola, Cergel  believes the ASICs strategy ""shies away from the problem"" and  that it will not solve the basic issue of competitiveness.  Another problem, he says, is that with the possible exception  of a few companies like LSI Logic, ""nobody has earned money with  ASICs yet."" Michael Glennon at Dataquest agrees: ""It is a very  competitive market and the return is very low in most cases.""    Moreover, Europe is not going to have the ASICs market to  itself. Texas Instruments is already planning a ""single-wafer  fab"" in which each silicon or gallium arsenide wafer can be  processed with different parameters. ""With cost-efficient,  small-volume manufacturing of logic chips,"" says Robert Doering  of Texas, ""the American semiconductor industry will keep its  technological edge.""

The U.S.  and the rest of the world (Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore) showed  the largest growth on 1992.   Source: Semiconductor Industry Association      ASICs allow companies to improve their products by making  them with customized circuits rather than standard components.  Although this costs more, the advantage, says Glennon, ""is a  more competitive piece of equipment."" The benefit does not come  from straightforward substitution but from extra functions and  features.    ""The trend is for more features at the same or lower price,""  says Ruediger Buerkel from ABB Ixys Semiconductors. In  electronics, he says, there are now bigger profits to be made in  systems than in semiconductor manufacturing. ""Some people even  say you cannot earn money with semiconductors,"" he adds, ""but if  you lose access to these driving forces, you will soon be out of  business."" Buerkel thinks the ASIC strategy might work if there  are strong markets.    ASICs could be successful in some traditional markets but  the  big opportunities will be in new markets. These include:    -- Image processors for HDTV sets;    -- Ultrafast components for switching, multiplexing and  compressing broadband communications signals;    -- Chips for the encryption of messages and digital  signatures with chip-cards (""smartcards"").    For many years memory chips, notably dynamic random access  memory (DRAM) chips, were a yardstick for progress in  microelectronics: 1 Mb [megabyte], 4 Mb, 16 Mb, 64 Mb... Each  new generation required smaller feature sizes on the  semiconductor. The current generation of 16 Mb chips have 0.5  micron features -- 64 Mb chips will need 0.35 micron features.  But memory chips are now a bulk commodity and there is a  widespread belief that they have lost their role as technology  drivers. ""The learning curve requires a high-volume product in  the wafer-fab for an extended time period,"" says Knapp. ""This  may be DRAMs, or microprocessors, but analogue/digital  converters for ISDN [integrated services digital network]  telephones, for example, would also do if you could produce,  say, five million pieces annually.""    The cost of innovation has also increased as feature sizes  have become smaller and more and more companies are  collaborating on RD, and not always within the same country  or  continent (see box 2).    Box 2: To Collaborate or Not?    France Telecom has been involved in a number of joint  ventures through its research centre, CNET. SGS-Thomson and  CNET have set up a silicon microelectronics research centre in  Crolles, near Grenoble, to develop integrated circuit  technologies and build prototypes for the 0.5 micron technology  needed for 16 Mb memory chips. CNET had previously transferred  expertise in 1 micron and 0.7 micron silicon technology to  Matra-MHS.    CNET has also collaborated with Philips in the development  of  active-matrix liquid-crystal displays for low-cost flat-screen  displays. It is also working with Alcatel Optronics on laser  technologies for optical transmission and distribution.    At the inauguration of the Crolles centre in September,  1992,  the French industry minister, Gerard Longuet, suggested the  possibility of other companies joining the centre. Longuet  explicitly mentioned Siemens. Are they interested? ""It depends  on what is to be done in Crolles,"" says Klaus Knapp of their  semiconductor division. ""As long as basic research is the  purpose, we are hesitant, since we already have a good research  lab in Munich.""    Siemens has since announced that it plans to establish a 2  billion German marks [DM] factory for the production of 0.5-0.25  micron chips in Dresden. Unconfirmed reports suggest that more  than DM300 million of the funds will come from the German  government. IBM and Toshiba have been invited to join the  project. The three companies are already collaborating in the  development of 256 Mb DRAM chips with 0.25 micron feature sizes.    High-Definition Problems    ASIC chips will have major roles to play in high-definition  television (HDTV), something which the microelectronics industry  has been looking forward to for almost 10 years. It is still  waiting as governments, TV and electronics companies try to  agree on a global HDTV standard. Europe's original plan, known  as EUREKA 95, was to go from conventional TV to fully digital  HDTV via two intermediate steps that combined analogue and  digital transmission techniques -- D2-MAC (multiplexed analogue  components) and HD-MAC.    Originally it was thought that digital HDTV could only be  delivered by optical fibres, but advances in video compression  mean that it should be possible to transmit the signals similar  to conventional TV. Broadcasters and governments now favour  going direct to digital HDTV and electronics companies, in  particular Philips and Thomson, have been forced to write off  enormous investments in D2-MAC and HD-MAC. The total private  and public investment is estimated to be several hundred million  marks and some 100,000 D2-MAC receivers have already been sold.    Thomas Fischer, managing director of Intermetall, a German  chip-maker involved in EUREKA 95, is angry about what has  happened. ""Europe's industry policy has completely failed in  HDTV,"" says Fischer. ""We have invested and now we say we'd  rather wait a couple of years to get a licence from the U.S. to  introduce the American technology."" But even U.S. technology is  not going to lead to products before 1996. Another problem,  according to Fischer, is that ""the Americans hold the  intellectual property rights. We are going to cut our last leg  in consumer electronics -- television sets.""    However, late last year more than 80 European electronics  and  television companies joined together in the digital video  broadcasting (DVB) project. Philips and Thomson are also part  of a ""grand alliance"" with several U.S. organizations to set a  digital HDTV standard.    The microelectronics industry is also targeting broadband  communications networks based on the asynchronous transfer mode  (ATM) as a growth area. With ATM, digital signals are packaged  into 48 byte unit cells plus a header to direct each cell to its  destination -- irrespective of whether the ""payload"" consists of  speech, data, text or video information. The same format works  for both narrow and broadband signals, making the service  independent of the transmission technique. Therefore new  broadband services will be possible on existing links. However,  ATM will ultimately need a fibre-optic network to demonstrate  its full potential, especially for multimedia applications.    Worldwide there are about 30 ATM pilot trials and 12  European  network operators have agreed to set up a transnational ATM  network. In Europe, both Alcatel and Siemens have developed  circuits to switch broadband signals at data rates of 155 Mbs-1  [megabytes per second in the -1 power]. Alcatel's ATM chip  contains 880,000 transistors and is being fabricated in-house by  its Mietec subsidiary in Belgium. Siemens has already won  contracts to deliver ATM systems to Japan's NTT telephone  company.    ""Intelligent"" credit cards containing microprocessors --  which, for example, would allow the user to control access to  various computer files and records -- could be another  high-volume niche market for ASICs. ""The chip card can become a  new pillar of the European semiconductor industry,"" says Ulrich  Hamann who markets smartcards for Siemens. The world market for  credit card chips was estimated to be almost $100 million in  1992 and is expected to rise to almost $600 million, equivalent  to 400 million cards, by 1997. With some 30 percent of global  smartcard sales, Siemens is joint market leader with Motorola;  SGS Thomson and Philips are third and fourth. The top ranked  Japanese manufacturer, Hitachi, is fifth with 6 percent of the  market.    Signature cards for electronic mail messages could be  another  growth industry. These cards would raise the status of hitherto  informal messages to the equivalent of paper documents, making  them eligible for legal proof and litigation. The cards would  be based on the Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) encryption algorithm  which also seals an electronic document against subsequent  changes. Signature cards are believed to be safer than  handwritten signatures, which can be copied and manipulated with  graphics software to forge paper documents.    However, a public authority would have to issue and  administer the cards and the present system of four-digit  personal identification numbers (as used at ""hole-in-the-wall""  cash machines) would have to be enhanced. One possible  mechanism is a biometric check: A fingerprint sensor on the  card would only allow the legitimate owner of the card to use  it. Such a card would need an array of tiny pressure sensors,  coupled to a signal processor, to compare the actual  fingerprints with the stored sample.    A digital signature card would be what electronics engineers  call a ""microsystem"" -- a device that combines microelectronic  signal processing with sensors and actuators on a single chip.  Other potential applications of microsystems technology include  miniaturized surgical instruments, in-situ dosimeters in  medicine, and micro-analyzers in bioengineering.    Hitherto, the gradual extension of precision engineering  into  the silicon microworld -- where manufacturing is governed by  epitaxial laws rather than conventional cutting and turning  techniques -- has essentially been a research activity.  However, the market for micro-machines and microstructures was  already worth $87 million in 1991, according to Market  Intelligence Research Corp., and is expected to increase to $3  billion by 1998.    Threats and Opportunities    There are many promising technologies, and huge potential  markets. But somehow they all hinge on infrastructure barriers  beyond the scope of single manufacturers:    -- HDTV needs Europe-wide (at least) standards for digital  transmission;    -- Likewise the success of ATM networks will depend on the  setting of European broadband communication protocols.  Furthermore, broadband multimedia services -- such as remote  access to databanks and public libraries, video-on-demand and  home-shopping -- all involve issues such as billing, pricing and  copyright. A huge investment will also be needed to convert  existing archives and connect them to the network;    -- Fingerprint sensors on credit and signature cards will  need an appropriate legal framework to balance benefits and  risks, otherwise the public will not accept them.    In an age when information is virtually free and globally  available, it should be relatively simple to identify a large  number of niche markets. The real challenge will be to exploit  them successfully. Cost-efficient manufacturing and effective  marketing are two important parameters. But unless scientists,  engineers and managers work together to ensure that projects  like the Heinrich Hertz Institute's video projector do not end  up gathering dust on the shelf, no amount of top-quality  research will suffice. Nothing less than Europe's ability to  compete in the high-tech markets of the next century is at stake.     "
0,FT922-11309 ,"FT922-11309 _AN-CD0A4AACFT 920427   FT  27 APR 92 / The European Market: Biotech groups find bright new world slow to dawn - Europe's patent legislation and regulations have caused frustration in the sector      By DAVID BUCHAN   EUROPE'S biotechnology sector is considerably frustrated with its European Community regulators. This is partly because only three of the 12 EC states have fulfilled their obligation to implement directives on testing new bio-techniques, patent legislation has been stalled in the Strasbourg parliament for the past four years and, at least until recently, four directorates-general inside the Brussels Commission have been at odds over biotechnology. But other sectors suffer from EC tribulations, too. The 800 companies active in the EC in biotech research are particularly frustrated because they believe their future should be bright. Biotechnology, which is less a new industry than new biological techniques applied to existing industries, is seen as boosting Europe's traditional strengths in the agrichemical, pharmaceutical, and food and drink sectors into the next century. These three sectors employ 15m Europeans. Biotechnology could create a further 2m jobs by the end of this decade, according to the Commission, if all goes right. All, however, is not going right, says the Senior Advisory Group on Biotechnology (SAGB), a Brussels-based committee of major chemical companies with biotech activities. 'If our companies can't use their innovations on a par with their competitors in the US and Japan, they will either decline or move their investments elsewhere,' says Mr Brian Ager, SAGB's director. In fact, both trends seem to be occurring. According to figures on patents registered in the late 1980s, Europeans obtained 19 per cent, compared to 41 per cent for Americans and 36 per cent for Japanese. Biotech investment, particularly by the big German chemical companies Bayer, BASF and Hoechst, is shifting to the US, where the SAGB was recently invited to the White House and impressed, says Mr Ager, by the Bush administration's 'clear awareness' of biotechnology's importance. The senior Commission co-ordinator on biotechnology counters that 'industrial lobbies are over-dramatising the situation' with criticism that is, at the very least, outdated. The Commission's 1991 biotechnology policy statement, which pledged not to over-regulate and to ensure EC legislation was coherent, 'should be recognised as a positive step'. The industry welcomed the statement but has two gripes: Existing regulation. In 1990 the EC passed two directives, on the 'contained use' in development laboratories and on the 'deliberate release' for field testing of genetically modified organisms. Mr Ager complains these set up 'a complicated bureaucratic notification and approval procedure', regardless of the actual risks involved. The industry says biotech products should be assessed on any inherent risk in the product, not on the process by which it is made. EC states were due to have put the two directives on their national statute books last October; so far only three - Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands  -have. The UK is still wrestling with how to carry out the EC directive, and when it put out its proposed regulations for public comment it received in January a tart answer from the US government. 'In our view,' the US authorities said, 'these (EC) regulations would eliminate or severely restrict the potential of UK institutions to bring products to market - and solely because methods of modern biotechnology had been used in their production.' While not conceding any past errors, EC officials harp on more recent initiatives. These include last autumn's proposal for an integrated risk assessment procedure for biotech pharmaceuticals (as part of the Commission idea for a European drugs agency); a plan for a similar procedure for 'novel foods' this summer; Commission help for the CEN standards body to harmonise equipment used in the development and manufacture of biotech products; and the setting up of an advisory group on the ethical implications of biotechnology. Patenting. In 1988 the Commission proposed a directive on the legal protection of biotech inventions. This has run into opposition in the European parliament, chiefly from the Greens and the animal welfare lobby. Earlier this month the proposal was again sent back to the legal affairs committee without getting a first reading by the whole House. The reason was MEPs' differences with the Commission, whose support the parliament needs if its amendments are to get through the Council of Ministers. While the Commission accepts MEPs' opposition to patenting human life or any part thereof, it does not back parliamentary amendments on animal protection. It is also opposed to MEPs' demands that leeway be given to farmers using genetically grown seeds. Farmers want to be able to re-use patented seeds, recouped after harvest, without having to pay royalties or seek the permission of the right-holding biotech company. The Commission takes the industry's line that without such protection companies will cut investment in bio-agriculture. The argument is false, says Lord Inglewood, a Tory MEP who is both a farmer and a member of the legal affairs committee. He reckons the biotech companies would not have a hope of collecting royalties from farmers across the Community, but could in any case rely on farmers periodically switching to new strains of seed.

The initial engineering contract will be awarded to ABB, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, and Chevron, the US oil company, its partner in the proposed project. Lummus, a US company that is part of ABB, is a world leader in the technology for hydrocrackers, which crack heavy oils into light fuels. The final contract for the plant has not yet been awarded. Mr Barnevik coupled his announcement of the initial contract, at ABB's results meeting in Copenhagen yesterday, with another plea for more western finance for power and oil-and-gas related projects in Russia and Ukraine. He said it was 'a great tragedy' that the west, with some exceptions, had contributed almost no new money to help ex-Soviet republics reach economic and political stability. Tens of billions of dollars, rather than hundreds of millions, were needed, he said. The west had missed the opportunity to support the reform programme in Russia, he said. Reforms would now take longer. Mr Barnevik said ABB saw revamping of Russia's oil and gas industry as a top priority because it would boost exports. But modernisation of polluting power stations was also important, along with increased automation to raise productivity of basic industries. He said western finance was vital for energy-related projects in Ukraine. The priority was improved safety and availability of power from nuclear stations, more district heating, more efficient use of coal, and energy efficiency in basic industry. This would help Ukraine reduce its dependence on imports of gas from Russia and Turkmenistan. ABB results, Page 19   Companies:-  ABB Asea Brown Boveri.     Chevron Corp.

The EC also agreed -- with West Germany concurring -- that the changes now  taking place must not lead to any revision of Europe's post-World War II  borders.
