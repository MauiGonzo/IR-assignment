Gumnitskiy, candidate of technical  sciences, Yuzhnoye Design Office; UDC 621.548]    [Abstract] In view of the shortage of conventional energy  sources and constant increase in power generation facilities,  researchers are devoting a great deal of their attention to wind  power systems. The main advantages of such systems are that  their production is economically pure and, unlike conventional  and nuclear power plants, they do not require the use of  expensive and scarce fuels. At present, the main directions in  the use of wind are the production of mechanical and thermal  energy to meet the electricity needs of small enterprises and  institutions and the construction of wind power plants (both  self-contained plants and plants that are components of power  systems). In many countries throughout the world, significant  funds are being allocated to RD directed toward creating  wind  power plants. Low- and medium-capacity wind power plants have  gained the greatest popularity to date. Megawatt-class units are  less prevalent; however, a great deal of RD is being  focused on  their development. Plant designs with horizontal windmill blade  rotation axes are favored over designs with vertical axes  because of the complex theoretical and practical problems  entailed in using vertical axes. Virtually all wind power plants  designed with a horizontal blade rotation axis have the windmill  located in front of the tower. Most towers are made of metal  (some are made of plastic), and windmills may be made of wood,  steel, aluminum, or plastic. Windmills used to be built without  any basic research. As wind energy continues to gain popularity,  however, increasing progress is being made in the areas of  researching their mechanics, the strength and stability of their  design, and their aerodynamics. Increasing attention is being  paid to their effect on the environment. According to various  data sources, at the beginning of the 21st century, wind power  plants will produce from 1-2 to 15-20 percent of all energy  produced. The following are among recent directions/results of  research in the area of designing and using wind power plants:  use of an Intel 8036 16-bit microprocessor in the system to  control the power output of the induction generator included in  wind power plants, development of a nomogram for graphic  determination of a wind power plant's design power factor (the  ratio of the average power developed by the wind power plant in  a selected time period to its rated capacity), studies of the  characteristics of the turbulence at the site of the WTS-4  megawatt-class wind power plant along the height of the windmill  to determine the fatigue strength of wind power plant elements  and related studies of the stresses in the root sections of  windmill blades, use of a laser anemometer to optimize the loads  of wind power plants' generators as a function of wind velocity,  development of a simple method of calculating the  characteristics of a windmill with a horizontal rotation axis,  and use of specially developed equipment to study the  aerodynamics of wind power plants. The problem of calculating  the energy characteristics of a wind power plant is extremely  complicated and continues to command a great deal of  researchers' attention. The use of nonmetallic materials in wind  power plants is also receiving a great deal of attention. A  10.7-m-long wooden ship was equipped with a wind power plant  with a three-blade windmill measuring 3.96 m in diameter  installed at a height of 5.49 m on the ship's mast. A running  motor operating on the energy supplied by a wind power plant has  produced ship speeds of 7.3 km/h, and with a head wind, speeds  of 56.6 km/h have been reached.     "

The Netherlands is embarking on its biggest windmill building program since  steam power and the internal combustion engine made wind power obsolete.    Windmills are suddenly popular as a means of cutting pollution and curbing  global warming by generating electricity without burning fossil fuel.    The original windmills helped create much of the Netherlands by draining land  in a reclamation program that got under way in earnest in the 17th Century.    The impact of their modern-day counterparts is likely to be more modest. Even  in the wind-swept Netherlands, windmills will only supplement other energy  sources, experts say.    But spurred on by a 40% government subsidy on installation costs, wind turbine  capacity is expected to more than double this year.    ""There are a lot of new wind farms being built at the moment because of the  subsidy program,"" said Ad van Wijk of Utrecht University.    He expects the country's wind power generation to rise from 40 megawatts at the  end of 1989 to 90 megawatts by early 1991 and 400 megawatts by 1995.    The government has set a target of 1,000 megawatts by the end of the century  but the unreliability of wind means this will replace only 200 megawatts of  conventional capacity, according to the electricity companies' organization,  SEP.    Current power station capacity is 15,000 megawatts.    But, with oil prices recently around their lowest level since 1973, wind power  looks expensive. It costs 8.5 cents per kilowatt hour, against four cents for  conventional power.    Supporters of wind power, however, argue that the price gap is much less once  environmental costs are taken into account and that technical improvements are  bringing costs down all the time.    ""I am confident that by 1995 we will be producing at 6.5 cents per kilowatt  hour . . . and then wind power will be cost effective,"" Van Wijk said.    He calculates that electricity from conventional power stations would cost an  extra 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour if carbon dioxide emissions were cut by 95%.    Carbon dioxide and other so-called ""greenhouse"" gases are thought to trap heat  in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.    The Netherlands intends to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions over the next  four years and an inquiry is being started this year into the use of regulatory  energy levies to penalize carbon dioxide production.    ""Global warming is a new item on the agenda,"" said Leslie de Zilwa, president  of the largest Dutch wind power producer, Ijsselmij Energy Co.    ""We are discovering that it is not only the capital costs and the fuel costs  that count but also the social costs -- that is, the cost of removing carbon  dioxide and other gases,"" he said.    De Zilwa's firm is about to build another 25 turbines, each 100 feet high, at  its wind farm at Urk in the north of the country, doubling capacity to 15  megawatts.    However, windmill operators are finding the environmental factor is not going  all their way. Wind power may be clean but many people think lines of turbines  stretching across the countryside are unsightly.    One way around the problem could be to build fewer but bigger windmills,  producing more power per square foot and cluttering up the countryside less, de  Zilwa believes.    The 400 or so wind turbines operating now generate an average of only 100  kilowatts each while those being installed this year range from 250 to 500  kilowatts. But elsewhere in Europe producers are experimenting with single  turbines generating 1,000 kilowatts or more. One turbine in the Orkney Islands  off Scotland has a capacity of 3,000 kilowatts.

A major electricity company plans to build the world's first offshore  wind-energy plant -- 11 turbines on rocks in the Baltic Sea.    Elkraft Power Co. said the plant will cost $5.8 million and, by 1991, could  produce enough electricity to supply 4,000 homes.    Clean power advocates like Torgny Moeller, publisher of a wind-power magazine,  say wind could provide 20% of Denmark's electricity needs in the year 2000.  That's double the government's goal for renewable energy use by that date.    ""Some communities in Jutland already are receiving up to 30% of their electric  power from windmills,"" Moeller said.    About 3,000 turbines across the country provide only 1.5% of national  electricity consumption.    But the Danish Energy Ministry said power generated by wind turbines is  competitive financially with power from oil and coal. And oil price increases,  such as those triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, could make wind power  more attractive.    The government began a $164-million turbine investment program 10 years ago.  Since then, the cost of a kilowatt-hour of wind-generated electricity has  fallen from 16 cents to 5.5 cents.    The cost of electricity produced from fossil fuels in Denmark is 5 cents per  kilowatt-hour.    In Ebeltoft, a string of 16 wind turbines built on a 2,600-foot pier generates  enough electricity to satisfy needs of 600 homes.    Some call them windmills, but the old-fashioned word is too romantic for these  three-bladed streamlined structures. The blades, like huge airplane propellers,  swing in unison as the wind changes direction.    From a small control room, supervisor Knud Nielsen uses a computer to monitor  the turbines.    Nielsen and one assistant maintain the machinery. ""We've learned from  experience that it's best to keep the design of windmills as mechanically  simple as possible,"" he said.    Local authorities financed half the $3.4-million cost of the project in 1985.  ""One well-placed windmill park can pay for itself in five to six years,""  Nielsen said.    The amount of energy that can be produced depends largely on the site. Turbines  in built-up areas are least efficient. Wind blowing over open land provides  power less efficiently than wind over open water.    Denmark built three more seaside turbine parks after the success of the  Ebeltoft project.    Denmark will need a combination of clean-energy sources to wean itself from  fossil fuels and from the nuclear-generated power it gets from Sweden through  the Scandinavian grid, Nielsen said.

Manufacturers such as San Diego-based Kyocera America, which makes solar  panels, and SeaWest, a local company that develops wind turbine projects, are  counting on a grass-roots energy awareness movement to boost sales.    Past energy crises have spurred utilities to rely less on fossil fuels and to  seek new ways of generating electricity, alternative energy advocates say. They  add that, as consumers become more energy-conscious, they'll become receptive  to alternative energy products, such as solar-powered recreational vehicles and  homes.    Utilities are already buying electricity from independent power producers, who  use wind, solar or hydro power to generate electricity.    ""Social responsibility is a major factor these days,"" said Karen Bernt,  marketing coordinator for SeaWest, which employs 36 workers in a  3,000-square-foot leased facility in Mission Valley. ""There's a lot of pressure  on utilities to produce electricity in a cleaner way.""    Founded in 1981, the closely held wind turbine company produces 260 megawatts  of electricity annually -- enough to power 60,000 homes -- for Southern  California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Bernt declined to release  SeaWest's revenue figures and earnings, but said the company is profitable.    Ron Higgins, a power contract administrator at SDG&E, said the local  utility is exploring ways to use renewable energy -- sun, wind or water -- but  added that extensive use of such resources is often limited by what nature  provides.    ""Hydroelectric turbines would be terrific, but we just don't happen to be  blessed with running water resources that we could tap,"" Higgins said. ""A  windmill doesn't work for us either, because we don't have areas here that  produce consistent wind.    ""I think there's a lot of interest already (to produce electricity with  renewable resources), but in some cases, like solar technology, it isn't  cost-effective -- yet,"" Higgins said.    But cost reductions from technological advances and increasing pressure to  reduce pollution should make solar equipment, for example, attractive to  utilities in the near future, Higgins said.    ""Utilities are being required to put on pollution control equipment,"" Higgins  said. ""With those additional costs, combined with the cost of solar dropping in  the future, utilities are going to be moving in their direction.""    According to Al Panton, Kyocera's solar sales manager, utilities won't be the  only ones turning to photovoltaic (PV) modules -- panels that convert sunlight  to electricity.    The cost of producing solar panels has already dropped to the point that it is  cost-efficient for houses in remote areas to use solar technology rather than  conventional generators, Panton said.    ""Typically, someone on a utility grid can buy a kilowatt hour of electricity  for 8 to 10 cents,"" Panton said. ""But it will cost you between 25 cents and up  to $1 per kilowatt hour if you're using a standard gasoline generator. With a  PV module, it'll cost you 50 cents per kilowatt hour.    ""Besides the cost savings, you don't have to worry about fueling and  maintenance, either,"" Panton said. ""Solar panels are maintenance-free. There's  no moving parts.""    Such convenience and reduced costs have already helped increase Kyocera's solar  panel sales. In 1989, Kyocera posted revenues of $10 million, doubling 1988  revenue. Panton said the company expects to hit $20 million in revenues this  year.    Kyocera America is the San Diego-based subsidiary of Kyocera Corp. of Kyoto, a  $3-billion multinational company specializing in high-technology ceramics.    Kyocera America, founded in 1969 in Silicon Valley and moved to San Diego two  years later, also manufactures ceramic packages that house computer chips used  for computers and electronic equipment. Kyocera America employs 1,200 employees  at its 300,000-square-foot facility in Kearny Mesa.    Kyocera's photovoltaic modules are made of silicon cells coated with special  chemicals that, when struck by sunlight, activate electrons that move along the  wires, generating electricity. Kyocera's standard model is a 51-watt panel, 18  inches by 39 inches, that produces 220 watt hours a day.    Although the cost of the panel has dropped to $350 from a $650 in 1983, Panton  concedes that it is still not economical for the typical resident to convert  his house to solar power.    According to an SDG&E study, a typical home in San Diego uses 450 kilowatt  hours per month, Panton said. ""That would require 60 panels . . . at an  installed cost of $30,000.    ""That's why we're currently focusing on people who live off the utility grid,""  Panton said. ""But it's already applicable for boats and RVs.""

But capacity counts too, offsetting much of that cost.    Capacity is what a utility needs to supply all customers when all of them turn  on all their appliances at the same time.    ""We can't plan our system for only one appliance at a time. We need to plan for  everyone turning on everything at once,"" said Alison Silverstein of the Pacific  Gas & Electric Co.    Utilities like PG&E have difficulty building large traditional plants to  increase their own capacity because of politics, permits and protests.    But third-party generators are not as strictly regulated. So PG & E pays  many of them for their capacity, as well as for the electricity that goes into  the grid.    Silverstein said payments for ""firm"" capacity can range from $60 to $160 per  kilowatt per year, depending mostly on availability during PG&E's peak  periods. Wind turbine operators, because of the vagaries of the winds, usually  qualify only for ""non-firm"" capacity, which pays much, much less.

Payments Vary    Payments for electricity delivered to the grid vary with type and age of  contract. Many contracts offer 10 years at a high fixed price -- 7 or 8 cents  per kilowatt hour -- based on early 1980s petroleum prices and production  efficiency and an additional 10 or 20 years at ""avoided cost,"" or what the  utility would otherwise have to pay elsewhere.    Were those contracts to be written today, the price would be around 3 cents.  Said William J. Steeley, senior projects engineer at PG&E: ""At the time, it  was right. It might well have gone up to 10 cents."" PG&E is still honoring  those contracts, ""but we really don't need energy at that price,"" he said.    ""Avoided cost,"" once around 8 cents per kilowatt hour, is now less than 3  cents, making it ""real tough"" to make money, in the words of Jerry Fuchs,  manager of project planning for the Fayette wind-power company of Tracy.    Federal law, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, required the  utilities to contract with all viable third-party producers. The purpose was to  promote efficient energy production, encourage the development of alternative  sources of energy and reduce the reliance on foreign oil. The law also called  for price incentives, which were translated by the California Public Utilities  Commission into the fixed-price contracts.    The result for PG&E in 1988 was that in August, at its all-time peak load,  it needed 18,000 megawatts. Its own capacity was 15,030 megawatts, and it had  5,963 megawatts of third-party capacity under contract. The total is more than  enough until the late 1990s or early 2000s.    Thus, PG&E is caught in a short-term dilemma of obeying the law that is  aimed at keeping third parties on line and holding down prices.    Silverstein said it can buy power from the federal Bonneville Dam on the  Columbia River for 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour. But the average it pays all  third-party producers is 5.7 cents per kilowatt hour -- compared to a  systemwide average cost of about 2.8 cents.    ""If we are required to pay 2.9 cents from a QF (third-party producer), this  precludes us from buying less-expensive power elsewhere. It's not good for the  customers,"" Silverstein said.    When the demand curve starts climbing again, Silverstein foresees an auction  system in which third parties would bid to fill holes in needs.

But capacity counts too, offsetting much of that cost.    Capacity is what a utility needs to supply all customers when all of them turn  on all their appliances at the same time.    ""We can't plan our system for only one appliance at a time. We need to plan for  everyone turning on everything at once,"" said Alison Silverstein of the Pacific  Gas & Electric Co.    Utilities like PG&E have difficulty building large traditional plants to  increase their own capacity because of politics, permits and protests.    But third-party generators are not as strictly regulated. So PG & E pays  many of them for their capacity, as well as for the electricity that goes into  the grid.    Silverstein said payments for ""firm"" capacity can range from $60 to $160 per  kilowatt per year, depending mostly on availability during PG&E's peak  periods.

0,FT943-8996 ,"FT943-8996 _AN-EHNABADOFT 940813   FT  13 AUG 94 / Minding Your Own Business: And the miller told his tale . . . - Clive Fewins hears Nigel Moon whistle for the wind      By CLIVE FEWINS   Oh damn] It's stopped] This plaintive cry is a normal part of daily proceedings as Nigel Moon looks up at the stationary sails on his 60ft windmill and whistles for the wind. Downfield Mill, a brick-built, two-sailed, late-Victorian windmill in the Cambridgeshire fen country at Soham, near Ely, has belonged to Moon for 20 years. A graduate in history and archaeology, he always wanted to buy a windmill. So, when the chance came to buy Downfield for Pounds 5,000 at the age of 22, he left his job with the Leicestershire museum service and took a variety of part-time jobs for the five years needed to restore the building to working condition. Moon has been a full-time miller since 1980, when the project was completed (apart from an enforced break in 1986 when he spent a year re-building the 36ft sails). The time has gone quickly. On milling days, a flour-covered Moon can be seen dashing frantically around the five floors, tools usually in hand as he strives to keep all systems going. On the days he is not milling, he is on the road delivering his organic brown and white flour, milled oats, rye, maize and barley to whole-food warehouses, bakers, and hotels all over the Midlands. 'Sadly, I spend far too much time on the road. Travel is my Achilles heel as I live in Leicester, 79 miles away from the mill. 'The reason I have not moved is mainly economic. Although I have tried, I have been unable to develop new markets round the fens. All my selling is in my native Midlands. To move to Soham would mean more, not less, time on the road.' Although it is an exhausting, seven-day-a-week occupation, Moon says he would not do anything else. He last took a holiday 20 years ago. 'I certainly don't do this job for the money,' he said. 'Last year I turned over Pounds 34,000, and after deducting all my overheads managed to pay myself about Pounds 100 a week. Fortunately I am single. It would be impossible to support a family on what I earn, and luckily I have the help of my mother, who is 75 but still drives over to the mill with me and does all sorts of jobs, including cutting the grass.' If he was able to cope with one more large contract Moon reckons he could raise turnover to Pounds 40,000. He had the chance to do this recently, but had to turn it down. 'Physically I just couldn't manage all the extra work,' he said. Moon has reluctantly concluded that the only way to expand his business  - and to cope more easily with the physical challenge of handling 10 tons of machinery as a one-man operation - is to sell Downfield and buy a more efficient mill. 'Even when there is no wind and the sails are down it is hard work because I have a set of stones powered by a belt drive from an electric motor I installed in an adjoining building,' Moon said. 'Working the mill this way is not as satisfying as when it is running on the sails, but the two systems often run in concert and the electric system helps to keep production going. 'I need to mill between 1 1/2 and two tonnes a week to fulfil my obligations to my customers. It can be very hard if there is no wind. I often used to get up at unbelievable hours and dash over to Soham if there was a good wind blowing. But then I realised that this area has its own peculiar weather system, so I just come when it suits me. 'Most weeks I can rely on sufficient wind to get by - but it is not always on the days when I want to be here milling] 'Downfield is a lovely old smock mill, but when it was rebuilt in 1890 by a local family they didn't use the latest internal design,' he said. 'Ideally you want a storage floor at the top with the millstones on the floor below that, not on the first floor, as at Downfield. The real object should be to achieve an on-line flow system using gravity all the time. At Soham a lot of the processes move in reverse. It keeps me fit, but I have to do a lot of charging around.' Moon has his eye on another, technologically more sophisticated windmill nearer his home. 'If I were to sell Downfield I reckon I would get more for the land around it than for the mill itself,' Moon said. 'Two years after I bought the mill for Pounds 5,000, provided by my late father, I was able to buy the quarter-acre plot that goes with it. There is certainly room for a house here. All I need to do now is to find someone mad enough to buy the mill] 'If I am able to buy the other windmill I have in mind, I reckon I could get it going with a minimum of restoration. And because it is better laid out than Downfield I am sure it would be more profitable. The books would certainly benefit from my not having to spend so much time on the road and I would be able to reduce my overdraft. I reckon transport costs me Pounds 100 a week, so I would be able to make big savings. 'Nevertheless, I am not really in this business for the money. There must be thousands of easier ways of making a living]' Downfield Windmill, Fordham Road, Soham, Ely, Cambridgeshire CB7 5BG. 0353-720333.   Companies:-  Downfield Mill.

0,FT934-919 ,"FT934-919 _AN-DLVCCACYFT 931222   FT  22 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Roll your dice, save the planet - Victoria Griffith unwraps some ecological board games in the US      By VICTORIA GRIFFITH   After the presents and Christmas pudding, environmental concerns may be far from the thoughts of most holiday revellers - unless, of course, some well-meaning gift-giver has placed an ecological board game under the tree. In that case, the dilemmas of pollution may soon be bearing down over an after-dinner game. A simple roll of the dice in Pollution Solution, an ecological board game for adults, could land a player in a tough spot. 'Farmers use electricity from coal to run irrigation equipment,' reads one card ominously. The player has to guess the solution printed on the back, which suggests that farmers use windmill power instead. Dozens of ecological board games are appearing in US toy and hobby shops, and many are big sellers. Family Pastimes, a Canadian group which makes A Beautiful Place, says it can hardly keep up with orders. Other manufacturers include Aristoplay, Family Games and Ravensburg, a German-based group. The names of the games are certainly catchy - Colourful Kingdom, Feeding Frenzy, and Bottles  Bins to name a few. Because the stated goal of the games is to teach children and adults about the environment  - while having fun, of course - the manufacturers have some clear messages to pass on. Most of the games assure consumers that recycled materials were used 'wherever possible'. Many of the games are 'co-operative', meaning no one can lose - or win, depending on how you look at it. 'When we recycle, everyone wins,' says the box of the recycling game Bottles  Bins. A Beautiful Place is more sensational: 'Players work together, not against each other to restore beauty. Can they do it before the looming Dark Clouds surround our special Beautiful Place?' A Beautiful Place has players clear away a Gotham-like drawing of a city, piece by polluted piece. The players get points for good deeds, such as turning off electric lights, planting a tree, or using public transport. Feeding Frenzy tries to increase awareness about endangered sharks by turning the players into sharks. There is no doubt who's the bad guy. Players lose points based on scenarios such as: 'Humans hunt you for meat, shark fin soup, oil, leather, and sometimes just for sport,' or: 'Toxic Waste] Chemicals dumped by humans kill your prey.' Humans do have an occasional soft spot: 'Humans lure you close by throwing fresh meat overboard. You end up starring in a nature film. Congratulations] You win five points.' Some games may be guilty of over-simplifying environmental issues. Problem 26 of Pollution Solution, for instance, reads: 'Leaky faucets (taps) and running toilets waste energy.' The easy answer? 'Residents fix plumbing.' Or take Problem 12, which says: 'This section is overpopulated. Risks to environment and health.' Solution? 'Couples agree to have no more than two children.' Players may take exception to manufacturers' opinions. One five-year-old playing Colourful Kingdom, made by Family Games of Quebec, was disturbed at the classification of a penguin as a 'water animal'. It may be no coincidence that most of the games are aimed at youngsters. Children seem especially receptive to the games, maybe because they can blithely ignore the underlying political issues. After a lively game of Bottles  Bins, in which children try to sort plastic bottles, food waste and other items into the appropriate recycling containers, I saw a group of children sit through a lecture on the difficulties of battery recycling only to return blissfully to their battery-operated toys. If the game doesn't make the point, you can always recycle the wrapping paper. A childrens' paper recycling kit is another best seller this Christmas.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

A cool morning breeze rustles the sheltering branches of an old California  pepper tree and whirls a windmill atop a turn-of-the-century-style white and  green tank house. Suddenly the air seems somehow fresher, more restful.    Ah. How nice to be in the country, away from the bustle of the city.    Well, not quite.    This particular Elysian field is Heritage Park, and it is tucked into a Santa  Fe Springs industrial park east of Interstate 605.    Heritage Park is a green oasis of Victorian Gothic ambience smack in the midst  of a highly industrialized city with a resident population of 15,000 and a  work-force population of 80,000.    The six-acre park, which opened in 1987, is a re-creation of a thriving citrus  ranch/estate that horticulturist Harvay Hawkins began there in the 1880s.      Attention to Detail    The careful attention to historic detail makes Heritage much more than a  peaceful, beautiful park. It also is a historical site, a hands-on educational  tool, a much-sought-after meeting place for local groups and even a setting for  romantic weddings.    The most ambitious undertaking at the park was totally rebuilding structures  that were destroyed as the once-grand ranch fell into ruins after oil was  discovered there in the 1920s.    The elaborate carriage barn, which cost $5,000 to build in the 1880s, burned in  1969. In its place sits an elegant replica that is a history center full of  artifacts and exhibits on turn-of-the-century life in Southern California.    The centerpiece of the barn is an Emerson surrey, carefully restored after it  was ""found in 100 pieces in a yard in Norwalk,"" says Margaret Hammon, historian  at the park.    The carriage is part of a display on transportation. Other displays include an  area where children can dress up in 1900s clothes or look through a  stereoscope.    Visitors also can imagine what it was like to be one of the barefoot children  in overalls in the near-life-size circa-1919 photo from Santa Fe Springs'  one-room schoolhouse or learn about early citrus farming -- ""When Air Was Pure  and When Money Grew on Trees.""    A conservatory also has been re-created. ""One of the important things about  having wealth a hundred years ago was to have a beautiful garden,"" Hammon says,  ""and this building is called a conservatory, a fancy name for a greenhouse.  It's based on English design. . . . We rebuilt it the way it looked a hundred  years ago.""    While Hawkins probably used the building to nurture seedlings or exotic  botanical specimens, the conservatory now is stocked with greenery and  flowering plants of the season. This summer, spider plants and asparagus ferns  hang from the roof, while pots of colorful begonias and other flowers crowd the  shelves and floor.    It's cool in the conservatory even on a warm day. Water spills from a  three-tiered fountain, and a cool breeze circulates as air is drawn through the  windows and out vents in the roof.    Nearby stands a new windmill/tank house. This building serves as a lesson on  how fields were irrigated at the turn of the century and what life was like  before modern plumbing.    Visitors can try their hands at a working pump that draws water from an  artesian well into a concrete reservoir. In the old days, the windmill ran the  pump and water would go from the reservoir into a ""standpipe"" that released it  into ditches for irrigation.    And visitors can climb steel steps to the top of the tank house to see the  whole park and marvel at its surroundings.    Added attractions are: basement and fireplace ruins of the ranch house;  English-style gardens with planters and fountains; beautiful trees old enough  to have been planted by Hawkins himself; an aviary with doves, finches, button  quail, cockatiels, pheasants and other types of birds; The Kitchen, serving  sandwiches and salads from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday-Friday, and two  archeological sites: the foundation of an 1818 adobe and its family's trash  pit, now playfully dubbed ""Rancho Rubbish.""    The land originally was zoned for industrial development when the city  purchased it in 1984. However, as the property's history became known, the idea  of a park took shape, Hammon says.    First, the archeologists found the long-rumored Patricio Ontiveros adobe site  and other artifacts. Then photos taken of the estate in the 1890s surfaced.    ""Over a period of time, the idea blossomed,"" Hammon says. ""Originally they were  just going to build the carriage barn, and then they decided to do the  conservatory and the tank house; eventually the whole site was developed.""    She says the old photos were used as blueprints to take ""a field of weeds"" and  turn it into Heritage Park.    City officials quickly realized the educational potential of the park and  placed it under the supervision of the Santa Fe Springs City Library staff,  assisted by park rangers who provide round-the-clock security and a dedicated  core group of docents who help conduct tours and answer park visitors'  questions.    ""History is my favorite subject and I love this,"" says Anita Kiesel, a  67-year-old docent and Santa Fe Springs resident. Conducting tours for children  is her favorite docent activity. ""It's a real joy,"" she says. She especially  recalls one child who told her recently, ""I didn't think this would be fun and  I enjoyed it.""    Docent Larry Oblea, 37, has lived in Santa Fe Springs most of his life. He  likes conducting tours of the tank house and the adobe foundation and says ""old  Spanish-Era history"" is his specialty.    Oblea enjoys telling visitors about when Patricio Ontiveros lived on the site  as overseer of a cattle herd belonging to Mission San Juan Capistrano. He  explains how the land belonged to the Nieto family and that the quarreling and  intrigue over cattle at that time ""could make a good soap opera.""

A cool morning breeze rustles the sheltering branches of an old California  pepper tree and whirls a windmill atop a turn-of-the-century-style white and  green tank house. Suddenly the air seems somehow fresher, more restful.    Ah. How nice to be in the country, away from the bustle of the city.    Well, not quite.    This particular Elysian field is Heritage Park, and it is tucked into a Santa  Fe Springs industrial park east of Interstate 605.    Heritage Park is a green oasis of Victorian Gothic ambience smack in the midst  of a highly industrialized city with a resident population of 15,000 and a  work-force population of 80,000.    The six-acre park, which opened in 1987, is a re-creation of a thriving citrus  ranch/estate that horticulturist Harvay Hawkins began there in the 1880s.      Attention to Detail    The careful attention to historic detail makes Heritage much more than a  peaceful, beautiful park. It also is a historical site, a hands-on educational  tool, a much-sought-after meeting place for local groups and even a setting for  romantic weddings.    The most ambitious undertaking at the park was totally rebuilding structures  that were destroyed as the once-grand ranch fell into ruins after oil was  discovered there in the 1920s.    The elaborate carriage barn, which cost $5,000 to build in the 1880s, burned in  1969. In its place sits an elegant replica that is a history center full of  artifacts and exhibits on turn-of-the-century life in Southern California.    The centerpiece of the barn is an Emerson surrey, carefully restored after it  was ""found in 100 pieces in a yard in Norwalk,"" says Margaret Hammon, historian  at the park.    The carriage is part of a display on transportation. Other displays include an  area where children can dress up in 1900s clothes or look through a  stereoscope.    Visitors also can imagine what it was like to be one of the barefoot children  in overalls in the near-life-size circa-1919 photo from Santa Fe Springs'  one-room schoolhouse or learn about early citrus farming -- ""When Air Was Pure  and When Money Grew on Trees.""    A conservatory also has been re-created. ""One of the important things about  having wealth a hundred years ago was to have a beautiful garden,"" Hammon says,  ""and this building is called a conservatory, a fancy name for a greenhouse.  It's based on English design. . . . We rebuilt it the way it looked a hundred  years ago.""    While Hawkins probably used the building to nurture seedlings or exotic  botanical specimens, the conservatory now is stocked with greenery and  flowering plants of the season. This summer, spider plants and asparagus ferns  hang from the roof, while pots of colorful begonias and other flowers crowd the  shelves and floor.    It's cool in the conservatory even on a warm day. Water spills from a  three-tiered fountain, and a cool breeze circulates as air is drawn through the  windows and out vents in the roof.    Nearby stands a new windmill/tank house. This building serves as a lesson on  how fields were irrigated at the turn of the century and what life was like  before modern plumbing.    Visitors can try their hands at a working pump that draws water from an  artesian well into a concrete reservoir. In the old days, the windmill ran the  pump and water would go from the reservoir into a ""standpipe"" that released it  into ditches for irrigation.    And visitors can climb steel steps to the top of the tank house to see the  whole park and marvel at its surroundings.    Added attractions are: basement and fireplace ruins of the ranch house;  English-style gardens with planters and fountains; beautiful trees old enough  to have been planted by Hawkins himself; an aviary with doves, finches, button  quail, cockatiels, pheasants and other types of birds; The Kitchen, serving  sandwiches and salads from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday-Friday, and two  archeological sites: the foundation of an 1818 adobe and its family's trash  pit, now playfully dubbed ""Rancho Rubbish.""    The land originally was zoned for industrial development when the city  purchased it in 1984. However, as the property's history became known, the idea  of a park took shape, Hammon says.    First, the archeologists found the long-rumored Patricio Ontiveros adobe site  and other artifacts. Then photos taken of the estate in the 1890s surfaced.    ""Over a period of time, the idea blossomed,"" Hammon says. ""Originally they were  just going to build the carriage barn, and then they decided to do the  conservatory and the tank house; eventually the whole site was developed.""    She says the old photos were used as blueprints to take ""a field of weeds"" and  turn it into Heritage Park.    City officials quickly realized the educational potential of the park and  placed it under the supervision of the Santa Fe Springs City Library staff,  assisted by park rangers who provide round-the-clock security and a dedicated  core group of docents who help conduct tours and answer park visitors'  questions.    ""History is my favorite subject and I love this,"" says Anita Kiesel, a  67-year-old docent and Santa Fe Springs resident. Conducting tours for children  is her favorite docent activity. ""It's a real joy,"" she says. She especially  recalls one child who told her recently, ""I didn't think this would be fun and  I enjoyed it.""    Docent Larry Oblea, 37, has lived in Santa Fe Springs most of his life. He  likes conducting tours of the tank house and the adobe foundation and says ""old  Spanish-Era history"" is his specialty.    Oblea enjoys telling visitors about when Patricio Ontiveros lived on the site  as overseer of a cattle herd belonging to Mission San Juan Capistrano. He  explains how the land belonged to the Nieto family and that the quarreling and  intrigue over cattle at that time ""could make a good soap opera.""    Armida Boales, 42, says it was love at first sight when she saw the park. She  lives in Los Angeles, but works in Santa Fe Springs and enjoys being a docent.  ""I love museums, and to me Heritage Park is a museum, even though most of it is  outdoors.""

0,FT932-15636 ,"FT932-15636 _AN-DDKADAE4FT 930410   FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Poor tilt at Don Quixote      By CLEMENT CRISP      THE FULL-LENGTH Don Quixote   a compendium of classical improbabilities laid at the door of Cervantes - is no stranger to our ballet repertory. Ballet Rambert acquired an intelligent small-scale production in 1962. Festival Ballet showed a rather grander and jollier version in 1970. In 1966, Rudolf Nureyev made an excellent staging of the piece as he had known it at the Kirov, and subsequently produced it around the world. A few years ago Northern Ballet Theatre also proposed an entertaining production. Now the Royal Ballet has decided to acquire a Don Quixote. And, inexplicably, has chosen the production which Mikhail Baryshnikov made for American Ballet Theatre in 1978. Everyone has had their way with Don Quixote since Petipa originally mounted it in Moscow in 1869, and revised it for St. Petersburg in 1871. In 1900 Alexander Gorsky edited the Moscow staging, and this recension was brought to Petersburg two years later and serves as source for most subsequent versions. The current Kirov and Bolshoi presentations respect Alexander Gorsky's 1900 edition. Nureyev cleaned the text, made it slightly more logical, and fired every company who presented it with a sense of classic vitality and dramatic verve that exactly suited his ebullient view of the old war-horse. As it arrived at Covent Garden on Wednesday night, produced by Anthony Dowell, with a new design by Mark Thompson and the merry old Minkus score arranged and orchestrated by Christopher Palmer, this Don Quixote is deeply depressing. Its chief fault is to mistrust the historic conventions of the original. It looks uncaring of the text, of the historic relevance of the piece, of the idea of a 19th century balletic Spain where artists can be encouraged to play joyously with roles and with the dance itself. To make sense of the choreography - even in Baryshnikov's charmless recension - requires an appreciation of how national dance attitudes may be used to colour classic rule, how academic propriety may be given a flavour of pimento. Steps must flash. Colours must be bright, and passions brighter. Whatever seriousness once obtained with the narrative, this has now given way to a parade of dance cliches and received ideas, which must be newly minted for us by vivacity in playing, by bravura, and a willingness to believe in the mad conventions of the piece. Wit is all, and there is not a witty thing in this production. Mark Thompson's designs seem to me to be wholly misconceived. The first act square in Barcelona is a claustrophobic construction of blank red and ochre walls, embellished with a vast and skied statue of the Blessed Virgin, and a suggestion of de Chirico perspective. The tavern is austere, unlikely in its wild contrasts in size of barrels and bottles; the windmill scene is so stylised as to make little sense. To 'modernise' an old ballet needs more sympathy for its conventions and attitudes than Thompson shows, and his costumes are massively unsuited for such a spectacle. Funereal black abounds. Unadorned bodices, glum and unflattering shapes, and hideous cutlet-frill tutus in the last act, betray the dance. The second act's dryads are got up in windmill head-dresses and tutus, better suited to the Lido than the opera-house. They are inexcusably crass. The version of the score is hardly more appealing. Baryshnikov hustles the action along, and Minkus is similarly streamlined. The score was never the greatest of musical shakes, but the edition performed in Petersburg is tuneful, sparkling, and its blatancies accord with the buoyancy of that staging. Christopher Palmer's editing is efficient, yet rarely beguiles the ear - and, in the final scene, is more vulgar than is appropriate. For the artists of the Royal Ballet, as for any Western company, there are huge problems in adapting to the stylistic demands of classic-Hispanic virtuosity. The Royal Ballet's first cast, led by Viviana Durante and Irek Mukhamedov, seemed bemused, and not a little uneasy - as who should say: 'Where the hell are we?'. They are in no way helped by their outfits, or by the glooming designs. Nor does the staging - as production or choreographic text - offer any inducement to gaiety. The dance looks dull, the staging ill-paced, and the narrative, such as it is, in constant danger of disintegration. Characterisations are, not surprisingly, blank. As Kitri, Durante gives the last act duet a bright edge of virtuosity, but her reading is as yet unrelaxed, without radiance or generosity. Irek Mukhamedov, a wonderfully happy and engaging Basilio in the Nureyev version with the Royal Ballet of Flanders, looks here like a man who realises he is on board the Titanic. The rest of the cast apparently felt the same: they could plainly hear the strains of 'Nearer, my God, to Thee' coming from the pit. Don Quixote is sponsored by the Linbury Trust and The Friends of Covent Garden. It is in repertory at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT934-10128 ,"FT934-10128 _AN-DKGAGAE7FT 931106   FT  06 NOV 93 / Property: Greece opens its doors - Foreigners, especially EC citizens, now find it much easier to buy houses there      By AUDREY POWELL   MEMBERSHIP of the European Community has been making a real impact at last on residential property in Greece. In the past two or three years, the country has removed most of its restrictions on buying by foreigners - something which has been of major benefit for EC citizens, especially. One knock-on effect has been the growth in the number of agents in Britain offering Greek property. And, for someone in the UK seeking a holiday home in Greece, there is a colourful choice and a broad price range. It is very much a tiered market, though. At one end is the small, renovated old stone property or the possibility oF having an equally small new home built, either way under Pounds 50,000 and probably on Crete, largest of the Greek islands. At the other end is something more glamorous, on its own and close to the water on some lesser-known island - with a price tag probably over Pounds 250,000. There are many islands to consider, along with their various transport links. The Secretariat-General for Information in Athens said in a recent official booklet that 'this small, mountainous country' had 9,841 islands - provoking the question: who had time to count? But the tourist office in London suggests a more manageable figure of 1,500 that are inhabited. The most popular is Crete, 160 miles long with mountains and spectacular gorges. And Hellenic Heritage Homes in Britain concentrates on this island, where it has a team operating. 'We have an active building programme restoring traditional Cretan houses,' says Hellenic spokesman Stefan Nicholls. The company is involved in a number of property-related activities. It has plots available and can design and build new homes. It also has businesses for sale. But it also has good advice for anyone viewing a property independently: do not show your interest but, instead, act like a curious tourist. 'If you show your delight in a property, the price will increase in proportion to your smile,' Hellenic warns. Typically, it has a stone-built property awaiting renovation at Mourne. This would make a two-bedroom home with an archway leading to an enclosed garden. It has water and electricity is ready for connection. The property is Pounds 15,000 and restoration would cost another Pounds 17,000. Alternatively, a small plot at Kissos, on the edge of the village and with views across a broad valley, would be Pounds 10,500. Utilities are nearby and a two-bedroom house could be built there for Pounds 30,000. A total of Pounds 42,000 would cover the land, property, professional fees and taxes, says Nicholls. If you prefer a holiday home on one of the other islands, the John Goodwin Greek Property Consultancy might help. A well-presented, 38-page brochure gives clear information about buying procedures and illustrates many island choices. Examples include a renovated house overlooking the yachting harbour of Patitiri, on Alonislios in the Sporades and close to mainland Greece. It has three bedrooms, a balcony and terraces plus an unrestored stone cottage. There are olive, lemon and cherry trees in the garden. Price: Pounds 105,000. On Skiathos, in the northern Sporades, there are furnished, split-level one-bedroom apartments with views to the outer islands and the Aegean sea. They are priced at Pounds 46,000. On Zakynthos, the southernmost of the Ionian islands, a picturesque, rambling, three-storey villa with four bedrooms and a separate studio/flat, in an acre plot, is Pounds 170,000. It might be possible to recoup some of this outlay with summer rentals, for which there is a big demand. Goodwin also offers property in Crete. He points out that, before 1990, non-Greeks were not permitted to buy freehold property there as it was designated a border area. Only enough properties were built to satisfy Greek requirements. When the restrictions were relaxed, demand by foreigners created a shortage on the island, with increased prices. He recommends buying a plot and building because the savings could be 'substantial.' While the Greek islands are sought-after more than the mainland, villas are more expensive to build on them. Corfu, the best-known of the Ionian chain, once was a British protectorate. Today, with 4m olive trees (the groves were planted by the Venetians during their long occupation) and its international airport, it represents the old and new worlds. It is also in the process of sprucing itself up. Greece will take over the EC presidency from January and a summit meeting is to be held on the island. Unfortunately, its new 200-berth marina, being built with EC money, will not be open until 1995. Sotheby's International Real ty has a variety of properties on Corfu, with prices from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 1.3m. One is a four-year-old holiday house on a sunny ridge, between the mountains and the sea. It has four bedrooms, and its two wings are joined by a central living room and dining area. There are several terraces, a guest studio and a large swimming pool in the middle of the lawn. Price: Pounds 650,000. On Hydra, where no motor vehicles are allowed and life centres on the harbour town, Sotheby's is offering a converted windmill on a hilltop overlooking the harbour. Accommodation includes two circular bedrooms with bathrooms, a salon with kitchen, and a terrace with wide-ranging views. The American owner is seeking Pounds 325,000.

On five weekends every year, the history of the region spanning 15 epochs is relived through a son et lumiere, one of 54 such productions across France. The action takes place on a meadow by a lake but spills over to an island and beyond to a windmill and the forest fringe. So atmospheric and entrancing are the music and the lights that a limited grasp of French is not an impairment. In seven years, Ailly-Sur-Noye's slickly-produced spectacle has come to be regarded as one of France's best, second only to that of Le Puy-du-Fou in the Vendee region in eastern France. Ten years ago the Ailly show was just a dream for Dominique Martens, a young bank clerk, who was not discouraged by those who said it was impossible to have a son et lumiere without a cathedral or castle. More than 650 local people participate, each making several costume changes during the night. Twenty horses also appear. It is possible to attend the Ailly show as part of a weekend break from London, for the village is only 100 miles south of Calais. It is staged on Fridays and Saturdays from August 27. Amiens Cathedral also runs sound and light performances, some in English. Nearer to Paris is the Meaux Seine-et-Marne spectacle - June, late August and early September - while also worth catching are the spectacles of Flagnac and Saint-Fargeau. Most shows utilise a castle or cathedral. Tickets for Ailly-Sur-Noye cost FFr70 for adults, FFr40 for children under 12 and FFr60 when part of a group 30 or more strong. They can be reserved at Terre de Picardie, 80250 Ailly-Sur-Noye, tel: (33) 22 41 06 90.

""We knew in the first inning it was going to be tough to hit her,"" said  Jennifer Ortiz, Mt. Carmel's freshman pitcher, who worked a three-hitter  heading into the eighth.    ""To throw a no-hitter against a team like that was something,"" Chula Vista  Coach Debi Daenzer said. ""(Martinez) pitched an awesome game.""    Said Martinez, just a sophomore, ""Even when I was warming up, I could feel I  was going to have a good game. I could pick out a spot and hit it. My spin, my  rise, everything was on.""    Martinez was on between the foul lines, too. She didn't come close to walking a  batter and started the game by striking out seven of the first nine.    Chula Vista loaded the bases in the bottom of the first and had runners on in  five of the regulation seven innings, but each time was denied by Ortiz (17-3).  She struck out Medina to end the first, and in the seventh got a nice double  play when first baseman Stacy Thimjon dove and caught in the air a bunt  attempt, got up and threw to first for the force.

In the bottom half of the eighth, Wilson (two for four) lined a single up the  middle that scored Slatinsky from second, and the Spartans (20-8) advanced to  Thursday's semifinal against Orange Glen at Kit Carson Park in Escondido. Mt.  Carmel finished 20-5.    Martinez (12-3) finished with her second no-hitter, 13 strikeouts and endless  praise from both sides.    ""We knew in the first inning it was going to be tough to hit her,"" said  Jennifer Ortiz, Mt. Carmel's freshman pitcher, who worked a three-hitter  heading into the eighth.    ""To throw a no-hitter against a team like that was something,"" Chula Vista  Coach Debi Daenzer said. ""(Martinez) pitched an awesome game.""    Said Martinez, just a sophomore, ""Even when I was warming up, I could feel I  was going to have a good game. I could pick out a spot and hit it. My spin, my  rise, everything was on.""    Martinez was on between the foul lines, too. She didn't come close to walking a  batter and started the game by striking out seven of the first nine.    Chula Vista loaded the bases in the bottom of the first and had runners on in  five of the regulation seven innings, but each time was denied by Ortiz (17-3).  She struck out Medina to end the first, and in the seventh got a nice double  play when first baseman Stacy Thimjon dove and caught in the air a bunt  attempt, got up and threw to first for the force.

Tyson is a 25-1 bet to waltz through Henry Tillman for his 38th victory in  their scheduled 10-round fight at Caesars Palace.    Of course the same was said about Tyson against James (Buster) Douglas before  his stunning 10th-round knockout of the former champion in Tokyo last February.    But Douglas at least had the tools to defeat Tyson, although the new  heavyweight champion appeared to do his best before that fight to hide them  under excess fat and a suspect heart.    Tillman, on the other hand, has little to recommend him as anything more than a  confidence-builder for Tyson. The joke about Tillman is that he has the chin of  a cruiserweight and the punch of a welterweight.    Tillman, 20-4, actually dropped out of boxing from March, 1988, to December,  1989, after being knocked out by Canadian Willie DeWitt, and he had not done a  whole lot to impress before then.    The real issue is the effect the devastating Tokyo take-out has had on the  23-year-old Tyson's mind.    That question may be answered in part Saturday when fans will see if Tyson has  shed the kamikaze two-step approach he used that made him an easy target for  Douglas' jarring jabs and left him groping on all fours for his mouthpiece in  his last act as undefeated champion.    Does Tyson, who will be paid $5 million for the fight, still have the fire? How  much has the loss affected his confidence, his heart? Has he stopped ""abusing""  his body, as he admitted he had done before the Douglas debacle?    What effect has promoter Don King and his hand-picked Tyson-keepers had on  Tyson? What effect will mercurial Richie Giachetti -- once former champion  Larry Holmes's trainer -- have now that he is in Tyson's corner, which was so  inept in Tokyo?    George Foreman -- 41 or 42 depending on the source -- also is on Saturday's  card as he continues his tilt at the boxing windmill in a bid for the title he  once held in 1974.    Foreman will fight Brazilian Adilson Rodrigues, 36-3, in another scheduled  10-rounder, probably Foreman's toughest test in his comeback.    Foreman, 66-2 overall and 21-0 since his comeback, knows a thing or two about  boxing and about being knocked out. Muhammad Ali knocked out Foreman in 1974 to  win the title.

By RANDYE HODER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES      After more than 50 years of running the Grizzly Flats Railroad right in his  back yard, Ward Kimball is preparing to hear the whistle blow for the last  time.

""I wanted to be involved in the project and to  ensure that Grizzly Flats had a good home.""    The museum has about 140 pieces of railway equipment, including some of the old  Red Car trolleys operated in Southern California by the Pacific Electric  Railway from the early 1900s through 1963.    ""Kimball's trains feature a unique aspect of railroad history,"" said Tom  Jacobson, president of the museum. ""It is a significant addition to our  collection.""

Kimball collected them as the era of ""narrow-gauge railroading"" in  the West came to an end.    Kimball has also donated as much as $100,000 to the museum to build a steel  engine house to store the trains. The first of the line is expected to be moved  to the museum next fall. The transfer of the entire collection will take  several years to complete, Kimball said.    The train enthusiast said he mulled several offers to house his collection,  including one from the Greenfield Village and Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn,  Mich.

Members of community historic groups are brimming with ideas for the proposed  historic village at Bartlett Park but recently have found themselves wrestling  with the nagging dilemma of how to pay for it.    The preliminary plan for the village, which the City Council approved in July,  calls for about half a dozen historic structures to be restored and located in  a one-acre area atop a bluff at the park, which now includes the landmark  Newland House site.    The city's Historic Resources Board, which advises the council on preservation  issues, has suggested that several old structures be included in the village,  including a windmill and the downtown building that 85 years ago was City Hall.  But, so far, proposals for generating income at the village have been uniformly  rejected.    Prospective developers have nixed a series of modest commercial ideas suggested  by city planners as being financially unworkable. For example, preservationists  had strongly urged that one or more of the old homes be transformed into a  bed-and-breakfast accommodation, thus creating income while emphasizing  historic preservation.    Developers, however, argued that even several bed-and-breakfasts could not  raise enough money to offset the cost, especially since the park, tucked away  behind the Newland Center at Beach Boulevard and Adams Street, has poor street  visibility.    Meanwhile, the first firm proposals offered by a developer, recently submitted  to the city by a group of firms calling themselves the Bartlett Park Village  Partners Development Co., were briskly scuttled by city planners and historic  advisers, who complained that the plans were overly commercial.    Ruth Lambert, a city associate planner in charge of the project, said the  firm's bid included three separate proposals. They ranged from a village  comprising a new restaurant and four or five historic structures, which would  incorporate a series of shops, to an attraction composed of 10 or 11 old  buildings, including as many as six shops, in addition to the new restaurant.  Members of the city's Historic Resources Board at a meeting this week sharply  criticized the developer's offer.    ""That sounds to me like it's no different than a commercial strip center,"" said  member Douglas Langevin. ""And if this is just going to be another strip center,  I'd rather see the (historic) buildings go down than be used that way.""    The city's Historic Issues Committee, which includes representatives from the  board, the city planning staff and other historic preservation groups, is now  devising guidelines that more clearly define what the members want for the  historic village, Lambert said.

Electricity Generation Efficiency and Relative Scarcity   Factor        The last term in the Petroleum Equivalency   Factor formula takes account of the remaining   parameters listed in the Motor Vehicle Information and   Cost Savings Act: The national average electricity   generation efficiency and the relative scarcity and   value to the Nation of all fuel used to generate   electricity. The term is the ratio of total output   electricity generation mix to input electricity   generation, weighed by a relative scarcity factor. The   derivation of values for this term, and therefore, for   the Petroleum Equivalency Factor, depends on the   availability of data for (1) total electricity   generation, (2) energy sources used in electricity   generation, (3) electricity generation mix, (4) fuel   source reserves, and (5) consumption of electricity   generation fuel sources.     Section 503(a)(3)(A)(ii) of the Motor Vehicle   Information and Cost Savings Act requires DOE to take   into account average electricity generation efficiency.   Electricity generation efficiency is defined as the   total output electricity generation mix (E    total    )   divided by the sum of the input electricity generation   mix (I    2i    ) values. The updated Petroleum Equivalency   Factor equation includes the effects of off-peak   electric vehicle charging in its calculation of average   electricity generation efficiency. The input   electricity generation mix values, based on off-peak   electric vehicle charging, were multiplied by the ratio   of electricity generation fuel source (quadrillion   BTUs) output (E    qi    ) to input (I    qi    ) values (Table I), to   obtain output electricity generation mix values (Table   II).

Clearly, this is not a band obsessed with Stateside  stardom.    The relentless punch with which Oil put across its songs in the late '70s and  early '80s -- when the band was playing the Hollywood Palladium and  slam-dancing audiences were the norm -- made the Clash the closest point of  reference.

The following are some of the ideas of the  minister.    I. The Implementation of the 1993 Plan    1. On electricity production and supply:    In 1993, both production and commodity electricity supplied  to satisfy economic and social needs exceeded the plan and  increased as compared with 1992. Production electricity reached  10.641 billion kwh, 5.29 percent above the planned norm and an  increase of 10.25 percent as compared with 1992. Commodity  electricity reached 7.794 billion kwh, 4.14 percent above the  planned norm and an increase of 12.45 percent as compared with  1992.    The program to overcome electricity shortages in southern  and  central Vietnam was carried on actively. In the south, as a  result of adding another 100-mw gas turbine and filling the  reservoirs of the Tri An and Da Nhim hydroelectric plants at the  end of last year and because of the measures used to mobilize  the various sources of electricity, both production and supply  electricity exceeded the plan and increased greatly as compared  with 1992. Specifically, production electricity exceeded the  plan by 9.18 percent and increased 16.48 percent as compared  with 1992, and commodity electricity exceeded the plan by 8.71  percent and increased 16.69 percent as compared with 1992. This  ensured a normal supply of electricity during the dry season and  prevented electricity blackouts as in previous years. In central  Vietnam, too, the distribution of electricity improved because  of the use of measures to strengthen obtaining electricity from  the northern system and bring electricity to Quang Ngai and Binh  Dinh in conjunction with regulating the diesel sources of  electricity among the regions. Because of this, as compared with  1992, the electricity received and produced increased 18.48  percent and commodity electricity increased 17.6 percent.    Bringing electricity to rural and mountainous areas has  continued to expand. At present, more than 81 percent of the  districts and more than 55 percent of the villages in the  country are receiving electricity from the national electricity  network.    The sector has coordinated things with the localities in  order to expand the program to reduce electric energy losses.  Very encouraging initial results have been achieved in key  areas: In Haiphong City, January energy losses in Haiphong City  amounted to 52.66 percent, but by November the figure had  dropped to 29 percent. In Hanoi, January losses amounted to 31.4  percent, but by November, this had declined to 23.5 percent.    Using many guidance and control measures, the sector has  striven to reduce the planned deficit as much as possible. In  addition to the 100 billion dong contributed to reduced the  deficit, efforts have been made to further reduce the deficit in  order to create sources of investment capital for a number of  urgent capital construction projects.    The sector must continue to strive to reduce the electricity  loss norm (in the north it is now higher than the norm set);  reduce failure rates, improve safety, and increase the prestige  of the electricity network, particularly that of the electricity  distribution network; and control the price of electricity sold  retail to consumers in rural areas.    2. On coal production and supply:    Even though there are many difficulties concerning  distribution markets (within the country, the thermoelectric  plants still use very small amounts of coal, and coal exports  are limited because of many factors), because the coal sector  has used many control measures, such as increasing internal  sales to households outside the electricity sector and exporting  small amounts and gradually raising domestic coal prices to  almost the level of production costs, the amount of washed coal  produced and sold has exceeded the planned norm and increased as  compared with 1992. The amount of washed coal produced reached  4.768 million tons, which is 100.5 percent of the planned norm  and a 6-percent increase as compared with 1992. The amount of  washed coal sold reached 5.032 million tons, which is 100.3  percent of the planned norm and a 3.7-percent increase as  compared with 1992. The value of coal sales revenues increased  5.4 percent as compared with the plan, thereby contributing to  reducing the difficulties with respect to financial balance in  production and the incomes of the laborers.    The sector and localities have coordinated things to  continue  restoring order in coal production and circulation based on mine  boundaries.    There are many reasons for the problems now confronting the  coal sector. In particular, because of fluctuations in the world  coal market in 1993, coal exports did not reach the planned norm  and declined as compared with 1992. Because of the lack of  financial balance, it has not been possible to remove the volume  of overburden and dig the number of shafts in accord with the  technical requirements in the mining process, and this has  affected the preparation of natural resources.    3. On capital construction:    In 1993, with the concentration of state investments, the  energy sector implemented a large number of capital construction  projects:    Sources of electricity: Turbines 6 and 7 of the Hoa Binh  hydroelectric plant were put on line, and preparations were made  for putting the final turbine into operation by the beginning of  1994. The Thac Mo hydroelectric project blocked the Be River in  December 1993. Together with the Vinh Son hydroelectric plant,  construction on this plant is progressing based on a schedule of  putting turbine 1 into operation in June 1994 and completing  construction on the project by the end of 1994. Construction on  the Yaly hydroelectric project got underway at the beginning of  November 1993. Electricity projects to support the 1994 dry  season in the south, which include the Ba Ria 100-mw gas turbine  group and the Ba Ria-Long Binh 220-kv landline, are being  constructed at a rapid pace. Three large projects to help  satisfy electricity needs during the period 1996-2000 and in the  future are the Phu My thermoelectric project (600 mw), the Pha  Lai II thermoelectric project (600 mw), and the Ham Thuan-Da Mi  hydroelectric group (472 mw). Efforts have been concentrated on  carrying out procedures in order to take ODA [Official  Development Assistance] loans from the Japanese Government.    The electricity network: Construction on the 500-kv  north-south electricity carrier system has been stepped up. The  technical plans have been completed, and an overall estimate has  been submitted to the premier. Contracts for importing materials  and equipment have been signed, and except for the electric  cable, which arrived late, almost all of the project materials  and equipment arrived on time. As for construction, in December  1993, the foundation was completed, and the pillars were erected  (including the reinforcements). Stretching the carrier lines and  lighting arrester lines was basically completed. Some of the  construction work on the four transformer stations, one  compensation station, and national electricity moderating center  has been completed, and some of the equipment has been  installed. Along with the rate of construction on the 500-kv  system, construction is urgently being carried on on the  connecting projects, landlines, and synchronized 110- and 220-kv  stations with the above sources in order to use the 500-kv  carrier system to supply electricity to southern and central  Vietnam and the Central Highlands. In 1993, many projects to  supply electricity to localities in northern, central, and  southern Vietnam were completed. This included many projects to  supply electricity to rural and mountainous areas.    The coal sector has invested using the loan mechanism in  order to remove overburden and dig shafts. Work has begun on the  Nam Cau Trang tipple and the Tay Khe Sim tunnel, preparations  have been made to build the La Hien cement plant and plants to  produce explosives and process coal, and a number of other  support projects have been built.    In the capital construction activities of the energy sector,  the sector has begun broadly implementing a bidding mechanism  and welcoming competition in supplying materials and equipment  in order to reduce costs, ensure quality, and maintain the rate  of construction on the projects.    4. On machine production:    The production of the machine installations has continued to  be shifted in the direction of manufacturing equipment to  support the projects to develop energy and vary the products  based on market needs, such as machining and electroplating  electric rods for the 500-kv and 110- and 220-kv carrier  projects, producing carrier lines, lightening arrester lines,  and insulated cable, machining pressure tubes for the  hydroelectric plants, manufacturing high-voltage circuit  breakers, spare parts, annexes, and so on to support the  production and construction activities of the electricity and  coal sectors.    5. Other spheres:    Finances: State budget receipts have been maintained, and as  mentioned above, an effort has been made to reduce the planned  deficit by hundreds of billions of dong.    Fighting corruption and opposing negative aspects:  Inspections have been conducted, and 18,698 cases of corruption  and other negative activities have been dealt with. Among these  were 8 cases of embezzlement, 293 cases of people intentionally  damaging state property, and 18,397 violations in supplying and  using electricity (most involved stealing electricity or helping  others steal electricity for personal interests). A total of  19.451 billion dong has been recovered for the public fund, and  635 people have been disciplined, 11 of whom were prosecuted by  judicial organizations. Those disciplined included 11 enterprise  directors and deputy directors, 3 corporation directors and  deputy directors, and 16 heads and deputy heads of corporation  and enterprise offices.    Management organization: the enterprises have been  reorganized and registered. In the entire sector, there are 20  state enterprises, with the electricity and coal sectors each  having 10 enterprises.    II. 1994 Guidelines and Tasks    In order to hit the targets and complete the tasks of the  1991-1995 five-year plan in the remaining 2 years and contribute  to successfully implementing the resolution of the seventh  congress, in 1994 the energy sector will strive to hit the  following targets and carry out the following main tasks:    1. Electricity production and supply:    The completion of the 500-kv north-south electricity carrier  system will create a unified national electricity system, and  electricity capacity will increase by almost 600 mw. The  electricity sector will be able to maintain the supply of  electricity based on the needs of the secondary carriers in the  north, eliminate ""electricity shortages"" in the south (after  phase 1 of the 500-kv carrier project is implemented at the  beginning of the 2d quarter of 1994) and in central Vietnam  (after the 500-kv carrier project is completed based on the  designs at the end of 1994).    The 1994 plan estimates production electricity at 11.535  billion kwh, an increase of 8.4 percent as compared with 1993  and commodity electricity at 8.598 billion kwh, an increase of  10.3 percent as compared with 1993.    Developing new secondary carriers will be encouraged, and  the  program to electrify the rural and mountainous areas in order to  support rural area economic and social development based on the  spirit of the resolution of the Fifth Plenum of the CPV Central  Committee will continue to be carried on. The results achieved  in 1993 will be maintained and exploited, the program to  eliminate the use of contract electricity will continue to be  promoted, and electrical power losses, with Hanoi being the key  point, will be reduced. The quality of operations control will  be improved, the electricity networks will be repaired in order  to reduce failure rates to the lowest level possible, and safety  and confidence in supplying electricity will be increased. Along  with the localities, the problems concerning rural electricity  prices will gradually be solved.    2. Coal production and supply:    Domestic coal consumption needs will be satisfied, and  emphasis will be placed on supplying coal to support the rural  and mountain areas. The traditional coal export markets will be  solidified, and new markets will be opened. The sale of coal in  a disorderly manner will be overcome, and the preparation of  base commodities will be maintained in order to stabilize the  content capacity of the export coal. The amount of overburden  removed and the number of shafts dug will be increased in  preparation for production based on the technical requirements.  Things will be coordinated with the localities in order to  regularly maintain order in coal mining. The main coal  production and supply norms for 1994 are: Washed coal for  distribution, 4,885,000 tons, including 1.5 million tons for  export; washed coal for production, 4,935,000 tons; overburden  removed, 16,696,000 cubic meters; and shafts dug in preparation  for production, 41,461 meters.    3. Capital construction:    Things will coordinated with the integrated state  organizations in order to overcome the difficulties concerning  capital and, in particular, the difficulties in switching to a  mechanism in which entities borrow investment capital on their  own. The main targets of the 1994 capital construction  investment plan are:    Electricity: As for the 500-kv north-south carrier project,  efforts will be made to complete phase 1 by the beginning of the  2d quarter of 1994 and complete phase 2 by the beginning of the  4th quarter. The Hoa Binh hydroelectric plant: Turbine No 8 will  go into operation in the 1st quarter, and construction will be  completed in 1994. The Thac Mo and Vinh Son hydroelectric plant:  Turbine No 1 will go into operation in the 2d quarter and  construction will be completed in 1994. The Yaly hydroelectric  plant: Construction will proceed as scheduled, and turbine No 1  will be put into operation in 1998. The program to restore the  Pha Lai, Uong Bi, and Ninh Binh thermoelectric plants will  continue, and work on converting the Thu Duc thermoelectric  plant to gas will be carried on. Work will get underway on the  Phu My thermoelectric plant, and preparations for building the  Ham Thuan-Da Mi hydroelectric plant and the Pha Lai  thermoelectric plant will continue. Connecting projects and  110-220 kv networks will be constructed in line with the rate of  construction on the 500-kv carrier system and other sources  mentioned above. Investments will be concentrated on developing  and expanding the electricity network in the rural and mountain  areas in accord with the program to implement the resolution of  the Fifth Plenum of the CPV Central Committee. Projects to  improve the electricity networks in Hanoi, Haiphong, Nam Dinh  and Ho Chi Minh City will be developed using loans from the  World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and SIDA [Swedish  International Development Agency].    Coal: Efforts will be concentrated on removing overburden  and  digging shafts in order to ready raw materials to satisfy needs  in the coming years. Construction on the Nam Cau Trang tipple  project, the Tay Khe Sim tunnel, the La Hien cement plant, and a  number of other support projects will be stepped up.    4. Other sectors:    Machine production: A program to manufacture equipment for  the 35-kv electricity network and equipment for 20-kv voltage  levels will be implemented. Quality will be improved, and  product production costs and machining and manufacturing costs  will be reduced.    Based on reviewing things and gaining experience,  anti-corruption activities will continue at all echelons and in  all management and work spheres in the sector.    The policies will be studied in detail, and plans to  organize  strong state enterprise groups that can operate independently  and effectively in a mechanism in which the ministry does not  manage the energy sector will be formulated.    The Energy Sector--Four Major Events in 1994    1. Phase 1 of the 500-kv north-south carrier system will be  completed at the beginning of the 2d quarter, and the entire  project will be completed by the 4th quarter.    2. The final turbine (turbine No 8) of the Hoa Binh  hydroelectric project will go into operation in the 1st quarter.  The plant has a planned capacity of 1,920 MW.    3. Turbine No 1 of the Vinh Son hydroelectric project (with  a  capacity of 66 MW) and the turbine of the Thac Mo hydroelectric  project (with a capacity of 150 MW) will be put into operation  at the end of the 2d quarter. Construction on these two projects  will be completed in 1994.    4. An effort will be made to block the Se San River at the  Yaly dam, Yaly hydroelectric project.     "

The windmill, listed grade II* and a scheduled ancient monument, was built in 1751 but was moved to its present site around 1820, when the mill house was built. The price is Pounds 135,000 from Hamptons in Bury (0284-767338) or Kevin Henry in Saffron Walden (0799-513632). At Tregurtha Downs near Marazion, Cornwall, you can buy a tall engine house once used for powering a tin mine. It was built in 1883 and mining continued until 1900. In 1903, the engine was taken out and moved to the South Crofty mine, where it worked until 1955. The engine house, looking like a Norman castle combined with a chapel, was turned into a home in 1987. Offers over Pounds 175,000 are invited by Miller in Truro (0872-74211). Equally unusual are plans for an earth-sheltered home for sale at Ashmead House in Fulbrook, near Burford in Oxfordshire. By building the house into the soil, there is an enormous saving of energy, while the building is intended to merge with its surroundings to make a harmonious whole. The agent, John D. Wood in Oxford (0865-311522), also points out that it will provide greater protection than usual against burglary. There is a choice between two plans, priced at Pounds 275,000 or Pounds 250,000 and designed by David Woods. Both allow plenty of natural light, through the roofs or conventional windows looking out on open areas. Mr and Mrs Kipling loved Rudyard Lake in Staffordshire so much that they named their son after it. Now, two boathouses are for sale there. The Lady of the Lake, set in the lake itself and approached by a jetty, costs Pounds 175,000. The Shieling is on dry land and costs Pounds 65,000. The agent is Jackson-Stops in Chester (0244-328361). The House Builders Federation, representing the builders of new homes, has been complaining that prices of development land have shot up and will threaten the recovery in the housing market. With the cost of a plot forming about a fifth of the sale price of a house, they say they cannot find enough land 'where people want to live'. But plenty of derelict industrial land is available in our cities. It would help society to develop such spaces, especially now there is an increasing tilt at the Department of the Environment against out-of-town, car-dependent shopping centres. A wonderful, red-brick Tudor house is for sale in Northamptonshire. Fawsley Hall (as in Lord St John of Fawsley) was derelict in 1972 when the present owners bought it. Listed grade I, its highlight is a splendid Great Hall. The house is set in a park (which it does not own) that was probably planned by Capability Brown. In the middle of it, all on its own, is the parish church. Savills in Banbury (0295-263535) is asking Pounds 1.25m.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT934-7500 ,"FT934-7500 _AN-DKSDHAEHFT 931119   FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: Zender's 'Don Quijote' - Opera in Stuttgart and New York      By ANDREW CLARK   'Happy New Ears'. The greeting comes from the 56-year old German conductor-composer Hans Zender, an increasingly vociferous member of his country's musical avant-garde. As the title of a book of recent essays, it represents not just his disillusionment with traditional forms of opera, but his desire to set music theatre on a radical new course. Zender's first opera - heavily influenced by his mentor Bernd Alois Zimmermann - was Stephen Climax (1986), in which two separate plots unfold simultaneously. Now comes Don Quijote de la Mancha, in which Zender isolates five components of opera - speech, song, instrumental music, action and scenery - and subjects them to the maximum number of permutations. The result is '31 theatrical adventures', premiered at the Wurttemberg State Theatre in Stuttgart and already scheduled for a second staging at the 1995 Salzburg Festival. This is deconstruction writ large. The 31 scenes unfold like revue sketches, each lasting three to six minutes - except the 16-minute finale to the first half, the only scene in which all five components come together. You have speech without song or action; sound without scenery; action without sound; scenery alone - and so on. Zender gives precise instructions on decor, gesture, timing and rhythm, but says the order and number of scenes can be changed. The only leitmotif is Cervantes' eccentric, flamboyant knight, who emerges as little more than a comic cartoon-strip character. As just one of five equal components, the music is marginalised. It is most effective at its most conventional, as in the flurry of staccato trumpet and horn calls accompanying the windmill scene. Elsewhere, Zender's serialism is unremittingly arid and cool. Voices - including three 'readers' - often swamp each other. To sustain interest, the piece relies on visual variety, requiring spans of concentration no longer than a pop video programme. But in contrast to today's pop videos, Don Quijote de la Mancha is all intellect and no feeling. Content is secondary to technique; unity and harmony are replaced by bloodless dissection; art is reduced to a mathematical formula. We have been up the same cul-de-sac before - with Cage's Europeras among others. Such experiments, aimed at shaping the future of opera on a super-rational basis rather than organically, serve only to trivialise the human and technical resources of a traditional opera house. Don Quijote might have more to say in a production showing less respect for theatrical norms. The Stuttgart producer and designer Axel Manthey made no attempt to break the barrier between stage and auditorium, relying instead on a few electronic sound-effects and a sequence of eye-catching stage pictures inspired by Pop Art. Some of the action had a Pythonesque touch, as when Don Quixote and Sancho Panza tried obsessively to duel with their shadows. David Pittman-Jennings and Dieter Bundschuh made a heroic leading pair, backed by 16 other singers and a small orchestra under Bernhard Kontarsky. None of their efforts could mask the work's blatant tedium.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.   Industries:-  P7922 Theatrical Producers and Services.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Opinions on the subject vary. Some people are satisfied:  This  year everything else is going up, but household-use electricity  prices are steady. The price of household electric power in the  Beijing region is 0.164 yuan per kilowatt-hour (including a  municipal public service fee of 0.14 yuan which goes into local  revenues). This was the price in 1958 and this was the price in  the first half of this year.    Some people complain that state-set electricity prices are  too low, and that there is an urgent need to raise them. Some  people are angry: ""Going up again? It's costing us about a yuan  per kilowatt-hour already. Is there any rhyme or reason to it?""    Some people sound a warning note: ""There's already a lot of  pressure to raise everything, so they shouldn't be in any hurry  to raise electricity prices.""    Some people are impatient: ""I'm not in the mood to talk  about  the price of electricity: what I'm concerned with is the power  shortage. The power's just on and off here. Why doesn't the  state put a little more effort into it?""    Everybody thinks that he is right. In the past few years,  the  reform of the price of electricity has made some progress and  has taken a few steps. The program for more thorough reform of  electricity prices that was issued this July resulted in a rise  in household electricity prices, which had been steady for  several decades. It, too, brought forth a chorus of differing  opinions. Just what are we to think about electricity prices?    If State Electricity Prices Are Not Adjusted, the Electric  Power Industry Will Lose Money Across the Board    The electric power industry relies on the extensive form of  expanded reproduction: the more power you want to generate, the  more equipment you need; and the more equipment you need, the  larger the investment that is required. Where does the  investment come from?    That the electric power industry should rely primarily on  the  funds that it accumulates itself and should engage in  self-supporting development is a basic principle of electric  power development throughout the world. In Japan, 80 percent of  the funding for the expanded reproduction of the 10 largest  companies is furnished by the companies themselves.    But countries differ greatly in their circumstances. China's  centrally subordinate power companies had a debt of fully 96.7  billion yuan at the end of 1992 and the amount is rising at a  rate of more than 10 billion yuan a year. This crushing burden  gives them no breathing space.    The principal cause of the problem is the price of  electricity.    Up to 1985, power industry construction in China was  supported primarily by the central authorities, and the  electricity price structure was uniform, with the prices set by  the state (i.e., directive pricing). When the prices of fuel and  transportation were raised, there was a corresponding rise in  the price charged for electric power; thus, state-specified  prices for electric power, which had not previously been  adjusted, rose somewhat.    Although the rise in the price of electric power compensated  most of the great increase in power production costs that was  brought about by increased fuel and transportation prices, the  contribution of materials and equipment to power production  costs had to be covered entirely by the enterprises themselves,  and, as a result, the full cost of power production was still  not adequately compensated by the price of electricity. In 1992,  the cost of producing a kilowatt-hour of electricity in the  centrally subordinate power companies was 2.5 times what it had  been in 1980, but the average price charged for electricity had  increased by a factor of only 1.3. As a consequence, the profit  on each unit sold had decreased by 50 percent. The profitability  rate of funds was 14.5 percent in 1985 but only 3.13 percent in  1992, far lower than the current Construction Bank interest rate  on loans for electric power construction (11.16 percent for  periods of five years or more). All of the earnings so arduously  accumulated by the centrally subordinate power companies were  inadequate to cover even the interest on the loans. Under last  year's conditions, they lost nearly 20 yuan on each 100 yuan of  expenditures. Since they were unable to accumulate funds, an  infusion of funds from outside was unlikely.    After the policy of replacing state allocations by loans was  instituted in 1980, it was long impossible to recover electric  power construction funds invested by the central authorities,  and it became increasingly difficult to increase investments in  electric power. In 1991, investments by the central authorities  had fallen to 45.6 percent of total national investments in  capital construction for electric power, compared with 81.6  percent in 1985.    Borrowing money from banks was even more difficult.  Recently,  new bank loans, even for state key electric power construction  projects, often required a great deal of coordinating work by  the relevant departments before the banks could be induced to  agree. It is not surprising that the banks were unwilling to  provide the money, because the power companies were not in a  position to repay it. By the end of 1991, the bank debt of the  electric power industry had reached 30.9 billion yuan.    In 1992, when the World Bank voted on the evaluation of the  Zou Xian (Shandong) power plant project, the U.S. representative  abstained; one of the chief reasons was that the price charged  for electric power was too low.    To compensate for the inadequate investment in capital  construction for the power industry, between 1988 and 1991 the  Ministry of Electric Power was authorized to issue more than 7  billion yuan in bonds of various types to the public; the  accumulated capital and interest on these bonds was more than 10  billion yuan. This year, with repayment at its peak, more than 6  billion yuan is required. Unless new prices for electricity are  instituted, where will this more than 6 billion yuan come from?  If the industry cannot pay off its old debts, how will it be  able to issue new bonds?    The time has come for adjustment of the seriously inadequate  directive prices for electricity.    The Climate Is Excellent for Raising Funds for Electric  Power; Prices Are the Key to Loan Repayment    In view of the threadbare state of the centrally subordinate  electric power companies, in 1985 the central authorities issued  a new policy encouraging more organizations to produce power and  instituted diversified electricity prices. As a result, the  Huaneng group went into the power business, localities invested  in power production, and joint power production bodies sprang up  vigorously, producing an excellent situation. The key to raising  funds for power production is ""loan-repayment"" power prices, or,  in other words, prices sufficiently high that the power  companies will be able to repay their loans and interest on  time: these are ""guided"" rather than directive prices. This  pricing system not only gave the investors access to electric  power, but assured them of profits when the loan and interest  were repaid. When the policy of diversified electricity prices  was instituted, there was an abundant influx of funds: the  diverse electricity prices policy not only made the Huaneng  Group, which used primarily foreign capital, essentially capable  of self-sustaining growth, but also brought about a burst of  enthusiasm for local power production. In 1992, generating sets  for which the investment funds came from the localities,  enterprises, and foreign capital accounted for two-thirds of all  newly commissioned sets nationwide.    Electricity is a unique commodity. It cannot be stored and  it  must be consumed as it is generated, and thus optimized power  grid layout and scheduling are needed in order to achieve the  maximum economic effect from the generation and circulation of  electric power. It must be admitted that the policy of allowing  fund raising for power production promoted the development of  the power industry, and revealed a new mechanism for power  generation, and has resulted in successful experience. But we  now know that before the new situation had taken shape,  uncoordinated efforts to raise funds and go into power  production also led to abuses. The investors called the tune and  tended to emphasize their own particular benefits, which in turn  sacrificed the overall interests of the power grid, so that it  was difficult to assure optimization of the power grid and  implementation of state energy policy.    But why should we not make this sovereign remedy of  loan-repayment pricing available to the centrally subordinate  power-industry departments, so that they too will have the clout  to raise funds for power production?    Experience Shows That the People Can Bear Electricity Price  Reforms    A rise in the centrally controlled power companies, which  account for 70 percent of the national total, will not be a  trivial matter. The power industry is a basic industry, and if  the prices charged by a basic industry are adjusted, price rises  throughout the economy may result, and the people's livelihood  may be affected. The state is taking a cautious approach to such  matters. At present, the prices of coal and of most other raw  materials, as well as the prices of grains and edible oils, have  been allowed to float, and electricity price reform is bringing  up the rear.    But just how great an effect will changes in electricity  prices produce?    It is calculated that, given the fluctuations in the prices  of coal and transportation, if loan-repayment prices were  instituted in one step, the national average price of electric  power would have to increase by only 34 percent above the 1992  price, or about 0.05 yuan.    Assuming that a family of three consumes 60 kWh of  electricity a month, an increase of 0.05 yuan per kWh would mean  an additional outlay of 3 yuan per month, equivalent to one  serving of ice cream per family member.    In the case of the enterprises, an adjustment of the price  of  electricity would have a large effect only on those with high  power consumption, but these represent only a small fraction of  all enterprises nationwide, and since their product prices have  already been allowed to float and to come into line with  international market prices, they are fairly well situated to  bear an adjustment of the price of electricity.    In certain economically developed regions with significant  power shortages, people are well acquainted with ""high  electricity prices."" To meet the needs of economic development,  these regions have made extensive use of small fossil-fired  power plants. The fuel consumption of these plants is an order  of magnitude higher than that of large fossil-fired plants, and  the prices that they charge for electricity are correspondingly  higher. Guangdong Province has 1 million kW of kerosene-fired  generating equipment, and the cost of the electricity produced  by these plants is as high as 1 yuan per kWh. Shenzhen  instituted new prices for electricity as early as 1989, and  users all stated that the price reform was necessary and that  they could tolerate it. Experience shows that the more highly  developed a region's economy, the greater the ability of the  users to tolerate increased electricity prices.    Adjust Electricity Pricing, But Rectify It Well    Electricity prices vary from place to place; this is  acceptable, because at present the distribution of primary  energy resources is not in balance (electricity produced by  fossil-fired power plants is a secondary energy resource that  has been converted from coal and other primary energy  resources). If loan-repayment electricity prices are instituted,  a rational average nationwide electricity price level would be  about 0.30 yuan per kWh; a price level of 0.5 to 0.6 yuan would  be very high. At this point, some readers may exclaim, ""Our  electricity prices are well above that!""    It is true: in many areas of the country, primarily rural  areas, the prices that users are actually paying for electricity  have long exceeded the loan-repayment price. It is reported that  rural electricity prices on Hainan Island were rectified,  lowering them from 1.35 yuan to about 0.8 yuan per kWh. The  highest prices on rural Hainan Island exceeded 4 yuan per kWh.  Excessive prices for electricity have forced the peasants in  certain areas to go back to oil lamps in place of electric  lights.    Why is it that these electricity prices are so much above  the  standard? While in some locations power generation costs are  indeed very high, the primary reason is that electricity price  management is chaotic, and, in particular, that guided  electricity prices are out of control in some localities.    There are more than 10 state-approved categorized guidance  prices for electricity. Many provinces and municipalities  implement an overall use surcharge to guidance prices, in which  the price excess above the directive prices is spread out over  the power use of the entire area. Because most of the income  from guidance prices for electricity is available for local  distribution, if local governments at various levels approve  guidance prices, the result may be the setting of high prices,  price increases at each level, and collection of increased fees  for electric power. Because electric power payments are easy to  collect under the rubric of fees, a great variety of local  policies involving ""piggyback"" fees have emerged: ""Surcharges  are a basket that you can put wherever you need it."" Some  localities even include birth control fees, highway construction  fees and entertainment fees in the price of electricity. There  are also cases when electricity fees for goodwill, influence,  and connections are imposed on users. Thus electricity fees have  become a catchall for a multitude of charges. In one city, the  combined price rise included fully 35 components. One fee  collector told a reporter: ""It used to be that when you  collected the electricity fee, you wrote out a bill; now you  write out a whole stack of them.""    The director of the Guomian No. 3 power plant in Jinan said  angrily, ""The enterprises are paying more money for electricity,  but is this money really being used to support power-industry  construction?""    The electric power departments also have their complaints.  Director Qi Xinpei [2058 2450 1014] of the Jinan Power Supply  Office stated: ""Some users are accusing us of disguised robbery,  but they don't realize that we are actually collecting the money  for others: we're just the scapegoats.""    It would appear that while adjusting electricity prices, we  should also rectify pricing and prescribe uniform electricity  price management standards. Otherwise, a plethora of  ""electricity tigers"" will open their jaws, and the situation  will become intolerable for everyone.    Electricity Prices Will Not Rise Sharply    A kilowatt-hour of electricity can be used to produce  several  yuan or even several dozen yuan of industrial output value, but  its price is only a few hundredths or tenths of a yuan. Those  who understand the situation consider that the time has come for  price adjustment.    There has been some psychological preparation for the  adjustment of electricity prices. Many plant directors have  stated that so long as they get enough electricity, they will  put up with any price in preference to power outages.    Many members of the public state that they would prefer air  conditioning to low electricity prices. But some comrades are  concerned that since the electric power industry is highly  monopolistic, if electricity prices are allowed to float, they  might rise precipitously. This concern is unwarranted, however.  Although the power industry must adapt to a market economy, it  is a public utility; all countries have strict electricity  pricing principles, and as public utilities, the power companies  are not permitted to earn high profits. What profit rate is  suitable for electric power enterprises? Experts believe that in  this country, an average profitability rate of funds in the  range of 12 to 15 percent would promote the self-supporting  development of the electric power industry. Head of the Ministry  of Electric Power's pricing office Huang Yongda [7806 3057 6671]  believes that, ""In the future, China should adopt a funds  profitability model when evaluating and adjusting electricity  prices.""    This July, the State Council approved a new electricity  price  reform program which raised the standards for price increases  based on the costs of coal and transportation; in addition the  central authorities took the initial steps toward loan-repayment  prices and approved the first increases in household electricity  prices. Furthermore, the accumulated price rises based on the  cost of coal and transportation will be combined in the list  price for electricity, providing an excellent basis for the  rationalization of electricity prices. We are told that in the  next few years, the Ministry of Electric Power plans to reform  the procedure for increasing prices on the basis of coal and  transportation costs, to implement loan-repayment pricing across  the board, to institute peak and off-peak electricity pricing,  and ultimately to arrive at rational pricing. Electricity  prices are the lifeline that will bring the power industry to a  beneficial cycle.    Aristotle stated, ""Give me a place to stand and I will move  the earth.""    A high official in the Ministry of Electric Power stated:  ""Give us the electricity price lever, and we will make the power  industry take off.""     "

The report says that the only large European country where prices have risen faster in the past six years is Italy. It adds that UK electricity prices have increased by about 42 per cent since privatisation of the electricity industry was mooted. It says electricity prices are 13 per cent to 18 per cent higher than average of prices in Germany, France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. Only German large users pay more for electricity than those in the UK. The association said energy-intensive companies were being damaged by uncompetitive electricity prices. Corrective action was needed toprevent erosion in the sector. The association said that the huge increases in prices could not be justified by a corresponding increase in costs. In six years the price of industrial fuels, accounting for half of the total cost of electricity, had fallen by 10 per cent. Claims by the UK electricity generators that Continental suppliers were subsidised were dismissed by the study. It concluded that there was little evidence of such subsidies. The association said one of the reasons for the large increases was that there had been little effective competition in generation. It called for an 18 per cent reduction in prices for large users by: A mechanism for trading outside the pool, the industry's wholesale trading market. A 20 per cent reduction in distribution costs through the regional electricity companies. The creation of dedicated generation. This would mean customers who accepted the risks of trading outside the pool with a fossil-fuel supplier would not have to subsidise nuclear energy. Meanwhile the pool's annual report yesterday said the average selling price of electricity traded through the pool was Pounds 26.61 per MWh in the year to April 1. This compared with an average price of Pounds 24.19 in the previous year. The report said that there had been a number of price jumps during the year because of occasional shortages of plant available to meet demand.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              WHAT BIG INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES ARE PAYING  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Belgium  France  Italy  Netherlands  Germany       UK                            (pence per kilowatt/hour)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25MWuser        2.98    2.94   3.28         2.57     4.21     3.62 80MWuser        2.79    2.67   2.99          2.5     3.99     3.52  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Chemical Industries Association  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Therefore, it is necessary to be extremely careful. He mentioned  a nuclear accident in Russia. He revealed that the electricity  produced at the power plant China will help built cost three  rupees per unit. The prices of another power plant is lower and  it can be built in shorter period. It will produce more  electricity and will cost only 50 paise per unit.    What the honored minister has said appears to be  unbelievable  since electricity produced in nuclear plants is considered to be  the cheapest in the world. At present the electricity provided  for domestic use in Pakistan costs less than one rupee per unit.  In the light of this information, how can we believe that the  nuclear power plant that our government is purchasing from the  Chinese government will produce electricity at three rupees per  unit. Who will buy electricity at this rate since there is a lot  of anger in the country over the present electricity rates. How  will the people react when there will be a 400 percent increase?  Who will be able to tolerate the change from 100 rupees to 400  rupees in the electricity bill?    The federal social welfare minister said that the  electricity  plant being built at Hab will produce electricity at 50 paise  per unit. If it is true then the question is why should not we  built similar electricity generating plants. Why should we buy a  power plant which will produce electricity at three rupees per  unit and whose safety is also suspect?    Dr. Sher Afghan grants that Madam Benazir Bhutto had made  the  deal for the Chashma nuclear power plant during her previous  administration. He also claims that during Mian Nawaz Sharif's  government the original deal was changed in such a way that it  is a losing deal for Pakistan now. He admits that this amended  agreement was approved by a group of Pakistani officials which  included some nuclear experts. This strange circumstance shows  that China did not warn Pakistan about the harmful aspects of  the amended agreement, although China is a kind of friend who  would never advise us to go into a losing deal.    It appears that Dr. Sher Afghan is trying to create bad  feeling about Pakistan's great friend China while Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto is there on her visit. Which power is it that our  minister is trying to please and does she not want our trusted  friendship with China to prosper?    Dr. Sher Afghan is the first minister from whom the law  portfolio was taken a few days ago and then the present position  was given to him. It appears that his political mind does not  agree with the PPP government. Suspicions are being expressed  that he receives instructions from a specific place, which is  especially dear to him. Anyway, the facts that he has revealed  about the Chinese nuclear power plant in his interview have  created a nuclear scandal. Now the people want to know all the  facts. If the Chinese nuclear electricity plant is unsafe and  the electricity produced here is going to be very expensive, the  prime minister should review this nuclear project during her  visit to China. On her return she should explain the details to  the nation so that the people know how much truth there is in  what one of her ministers has said.     "

0,FT931-4780 ,"FT931-4780 _AN-DCICJAB9FT 930309   FT  09 MAR 93 / Pits' power bills to rise      By MICHAEL SMITH   BRITISH COAL is to pay 5 per cent more for its electricity from next month at the same time as the coal it sells to electricity generators will fall significantly in price. British Coal's deals, concluded after negotiations with a variety of electricity companies, would lead to its annual electricity bill of about Pounds 100m rising by more than Pounds 5m if all its 50 pits stayed open. Some of the corporation's executives are angry about the price rises because they coincide with a 20 per cent reduction in the charges it makes to generators for some coal. Imported coal, used to generate electricity for large consumers, has also been falling in price recently. Disclosure of the deals will add to discontent over electricity tariffs which are traditionally changed on April 1. Many other big users are facing similar increases. In addition domestic and small industrial customers have been promised little, if any, reduction in electricity prices in spite of the reductions in the price of coal. Most of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales that have announced tariffs have said that they are either freezing prices or reducing them by 1 percentage point. Further reductions are likely to be delayed until after the government has published its white paper on coal, almost certainly after the Budget. British Coal's deals are with Northern Electric, which will supply the north-east pits, and PowerGen, which will supply other pits in England and Wales. PowerGen said yesterday that its contracts for next year were cheaper in real terms than its existing deals with British Coal. The company is, however, increasing its number of contracts with the corporation and its new contracts are replacing cheaper deals with other companies. Until now National Power, the other large generator in England and Wales, was British Coal's other main supplier. British Coal would not comment in detail yesterday on the electricity deals, which it said had been conducted in confidence. One executive said, however, it was diabolical that it had been forced to pay so much when it was having to cut up to 30,000 jobs. 'How are we expected to bring our prices down to world prices when one of our main costs is rising so steeply?' The price increases will take the electricity bill of an average pit to above the level paid before the privatisation of the electricity industry. In the year immediately following privatisation British Coal won significant reductions in prices, in common with many other large customers, as electricity companies competed with each other for custom. Since then electricity supply companies have sought to pull out of low-margin or loss-making deals and prices have risen.   Companies:-  Northern Electric.     PowerGen.     British Coal Corp.

The controls form the first part of a two-year review which will eventually cover the entire electricity supply and distribution business. The report is expected to give the regional electricity companies more flexibility in calculating the costs they can pass on to customers, for example by taking account of market features such as the size and distribution of the population.

Customers will be free to shop around for suppliers offering the lowest electricity prices in future, and power and other companies will be able to import and export electricity to neighbouring countries. Those companies which have a concession to operate power lines in certain areas will be forced to open their lines to other suppliers and users. In addition, the government said it was preparing legislation concerning competition in the electricity market, and promised that its competitiveness would be 'continually monitored'. The proposals were welcomed by the Confederation of Swedish Industry yesterday. Mr Lars Gunnar Larsson, head of the CSI's energy and environment division, said industry members had been eager to see more competition on electricity prices. The government has started to reform the electricity industry already. Vattenfall, the state-owned electricity company which supplies about half the country's electricity, is being prepared for wider ownership as part of the government's ambitious privatisation programme, although no date has been set yet. The remaining electricity suppliers are mainly owned by the local authorities or by private companies. One company - the big forestry group SCA - recently agreed to sell its power operations in view of the forthcoming changes in the electricity market. In the past, many of the electricity-intensive industries had their own power suppliers so that they could be independent of the regional power monopolies. The government said 'substantial gains stand to be made by making the electricity sector more efficient, and by facilitating increased trade in electricity across borders'.

All China's counties will get electricity supplies and over  95 percent of farmers' households are then expected to be  supplied with electricity, officials said at a meeting here  today of the Rural Electrification Working Conference, jointly  sponsored by the State Planning Commission, the State Economic  and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Electricity Industry.    At the meeting, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua urged departments of  electricity and local governments to cooperate with each other  in supplying electricity to the farmers through self-reliance  and by exploiting local resources in the poverty-stricken areas  so that the local farmers can become prosperous as soon as  possible.    China's rural electrification process achieved remarkable  progress since the 1960s, sources at the meeting said. By the  end of 1993, 97 percent of townships, 93 percent of villages and  89 percent of farmers' households had been able to use  electricity.    Per capita annual electricity consumption for the rural  population reached 48 kilowatt-hours in 1993, 7.9 times the  figure for 1978.    Many large power stations are supplying electricity to the  rural areas. Thousands of small thermal or hydro-electric power  stations have been built, while wind and solar energy are also  being used.    However, there are still 28 counties that have virtually no  electricity supply. And about 120 million farmers in a dozen  provinces and autonomous regions, mostly in western China, are  waiting to get electricity.    Officials said that these areas, often sparsely populated,  are the most difficult to be electrified because they are far  from the large regional electricity network, their local  economic growth is slow and local finance tight.    According to a blueprint on the electrification of China's  rural areas in the 1990s which was presented to the meeting by  the Ministry of Electricity, most of China's poor villages will  be able to use electricity in the coming few years.

The controls will apply to the electricity supply business, which accounts for as much as 20 per cent of the profits of the regional electricity companies. The controls form the first part of a two-year review which will eventually cover the entire electricity supply and distribution business. Today's 64-page report is expected to give the regional electricity companies more flexibility in calculating the costs they can pass on to customers, for example by taking account of market features such as the size and distribution of the population. But Prof Littlechild is also expected to introduce an 'X factor'. This would be subtracted from the inflation rate to give the amount by which electricity prices could rise in any year. In their recently announced results many electricity companies said they had launched a vigorous attack on costs in order to be in a better position to absorb the effect of tighter regulatory controls. Today's report will be a prelude to a much larger review of the distribution business lasting until next summer.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

I have met commercial users of electricity who, having secured lower prices through supply competition in Britain, wonder why their outlets in other parts of Europe are not allowed a similar choice between electricity suppliers. Competition between producers and the right to choose a supplier will drive down electricity prices and help to make Europe more competitive. Unfortunately, that prospect does not appeal to many of Europe's electricity monopolies, which are resisting liberalisation. There is no shortage of companies waiting to provide competition - many of them British - but it will not come about until more of Europe's electricity customers insist on choice.

Norway is the most advanced of any European country in liberalising its electricity market, allowing exports on a concession basis, but the NHO yesterday said the government must also allow free access to electricity imports, in order to stop dual pricing. 'What we are seeking to avoid is profits being made from expensive domestic contracts, while cheap export contracts covering surplus power are agreed,' said Mr Karl Glad, an NHO executive. He warned in a letter to Mr Finn Kristensen, industry and energy minister, of electricity price differentiation, price manipulation, dumping and monopolistic tendencies by Norway's big electricity producers. He said costs for new transmission cables between Norway and the rest of the continent were being subsidised by high domestic electricity prices. NHO is particularly sceptical of a recent supply contract agreed by Statkraft, the domestic power company, and Germany's PreussenElektra.

However, buying a cottage in the middle of nowhere is a different matter. There are agencies that handle such places - but it will be up to you to find them. A comparative newcomer to this field is French Country Lettings. Covering all of France would be a mammoth job so the agency draws a line from Dieppe down to the Languedoc and will take on rural properties anywhere west of that if they are up to standard. Nicky Cambrook, who learnt about property with a London estate agency, started FCL in August 1990. 'Our first season was fraught with war, high interest rates and recession,' she says. 'But now we are extremely busy.' She finds there is a demand for this type of agency and is building up a portfolio, from her present base in Somerset (0963-34066). Ideally FCL likes to hear about properties for letting by September, which leaves time for inspection before inclusion in the following year's brochure, which comes out in November, although there is a spring supplement for later entrants. The agency's first brochure has a variety of properties. There is a farmhouse with a 40 ft sitting room, in four acres, an hour from the coast in Brittany, a converted windmill with circular rooms. In the south, a village house in a hamlet in the Cevennes national park, north of Montpellier, is a conversion from a silkworm loft. It is on three floors and sleeps seven. This lets at Pounds 840 a week in high season, Pounds 500 in low season. At the other end of the scale a studio apartment in a modern block next to a marina on the Vendee coast, sleeping two, lets for Pounds 210 a week in high season, Pounds 115 low season. FCL will only recommend, not stipulate, a letting figure. It requires owners to contract a property to it for at least the season (April 1 to October 31). During this period an owner may reserve six weeks, of which two can be high season, for his own use. In addition a property can be offered, if an owner wishes, for out of season holidays. FCL finds there is also a small market for longer term letting (six months or more) while people house hunt or decide if they would like living in France. The agency charges a one-off registration fee of Pounds 50 plus VAT, to cover start-up expenses of featuring a property, such as photography and office administrative costs. Its commission rate is 20 per cent of the gross rental. This includes advising on rent and presentation, producing and distributing a lettings brochure, advertising, dealing with enquiries and bookings, collecting rent and sorting out any complaints. In a Weekend FT article on Malta on December 7/8 last year, the amount of stamp duty payable by foreigners purchasing property in that country was incorrect. This was due to a computer error. The correct amount of stamp duty payable is 13.55 per cent.  The Financial Times   London Page IX  "
0,FT931-14558 ,"FT931-14558 _AN-DARCMABOFT 930118   FT  18 JAN 93 / Why industry giants are angry      By PAUL ABRAHAMS, ANDREW BAXTER and ANDREW TAYLOR   LARGE industrial power users are angry that the government is considering a deal that would reduce Imperial Chemical Industries' electricity costs. Companies such as British Steel and Blue Circle Cement say they must also be offered cheaper electricity to allow them to compete effectively against Continental counterparts. The largest consumers are arguing that any special deal for ICI's chlor-alkali plant at Runcorn, Cheshire, should also be offered to them. Smaller users are concerned that the prices they pay would increase if the largest groups were allowed to opt out of the electricity spot market. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, is understood to be negotiating a deal for ICI, which has been campaigning for cheaper electricity for its Runcorn plant since the electricity industry was privatised and its power costs for chlorine production increased by 60 per cent. The group has threatened to stop production there, with the loss 7,000 jobs, unless cheap supplies can be secured. British Steel said it 'could not afford not to be included' if new arrangements were introduced for big industrial users of electricity. The company hopes to find out more this week when the Energy Intensive Users Group meets Mr Eggar. British Steel said: 'There is no doubt that we are very much at a disadvantage compared with our principal European competitors. We are paying 30 per cent more than steelmakers in France and the Benelux countries.' United Engineering Steels, the Rotherham-based specialist steels producer owned jointly by British Steel and GKN, reacted positively. Mr Graham Mackenzie, chief executive, said: 'First, we are delighted to see ICI making the breakthrough. Secondly, we want some of this too, please.' Mr Mackenzie said this was the first indication that the government was willing to look at the problems caused for big electricity users by privatisation of the electricity supply industry. But the continuation of the nuclear levy remained a cause for concern. UES said it was one of the UK's top six energy consumers, buying Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m of electricity a year. Mr Mackenzie said the company would talk to PowerGen, its supplier, and the Department of Trade and Industry to see whether a similar arrangement could be made for UES. One question, however, would be whether such an arrangement could cover the peaks and troughs of energy use in electric arc steelmaking, compared with the more steady energy loads in chlorine manufacture. Mr Ian McKenzie, chief executive of Blue Circle Cement, a subsidiary of Blue Circle Industries, said the company was pleased that the government had recognised that very large UK users of electricity were at a disadvantage to industrial competitors in continental Europe which paid substantially less for their electricity. He added that electricity prices paid by Blue Circle in 1987-88 were broadly comparable with those of its European competitors. The group's UK electricity costs had risen by 50 per cent since then while competitors' costs had stood still and had fallen in some cases. Pilkington, the glass manufacturer and middle-sized electricity user, said it was concerned that if concessions were made to very large users, in effect restoring the pre-privatisation subsidy, then middle to large users might pay more because the final cost structure in the industry would not have changed.

The meters, which can tell customers exactly how much electricity domestic appliances consume and give them an instant electricity bill, are being tested and promoted by Offer, the electricity industry watchdog. Yesterday it issued a paper urging electricity suppliers to install modern meters as soon as possible. Professor Stephen Littlechild, Offer's director-general, said sophisticated meters would be essential in 1998, when the electricity market would be fully deregulated, allowing customers to choose an electricity supplier rather than just buying from their local company. He said: 'I look forward to the day when customers can take out the Yellow Pages and pick an electricity supplier.' Because the new meters monitor exactly when electricity is used, any supplier could easily settle up with the customer's local company. Offer said the regional electricity companies would probably pay for most of the new metering system, which might cost Pounds 1bn nationwide. That would be taken into consideration when regulations governing how much they could charge customers were reviewed in 1994. The meters would also benefit the companies because they would improve cashflows and efficiency. Customer groups, electricity suppliers and other interested bodies have until July to respond to the report.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "
0,FT941-9840 ,"FT941-9840 _AN-EBMAKABLFT 940212   FT  12 FEB 94 / Industrial users to gain most from 7% reduction      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   All electricity consumers should benefit from yesterday's agreement, but big industrial users will see the greatest gains. For smaller companies and households, the difference will be small or negligible. The agreement will reduce average pool prices by 7 per cent, but this saving will go directly only to large companies, such as ICI and Blue Circle, that buy electricity straight from the wholesale market and have been badgering the government to force power prices down. There will also be savings for companies that have contracts with distributors whose price is based on the pool price. The saving will be diluted for the great majority of smaller industrial users, which buy their power from electricity distributors. In this market, the pool price only accounts for about half the final price because other distribution costs are added. However, from April 1995, smaller companies will be able to negotiate their own terms with electricity distributors, so they may be able to wrest some of this saving for themselves. For private households, the pool price accounts for less than a third of the quarterly bill, so a cut of 7 per cent would translate into a saving of about 2 per cent. However even this is unlikely because regional electricity distributors buy their power from the generators under long-term contracts whose prices have already been fixed. Britain's electricity prices are about average for Europe, according to the Electricity Association, the trade group, though its figures have often been challenged by user groups. And yesterday's agreement will not alter the ranking dramatically. With an average industrial electricity price of 5.3p per unit, the UK is well behind Germany with 7.6p but well above Denmark with 4.2p. Household electricity is below the EU average at 9.3p in a range extending from Belgium with 13p to Greece with 7.7p. Even so, electricity distributors are under mounting pressure both from politicians and from Prof Stephen Littlechild, their regulator, to reduce electricity bills. Last week the National Consumer Council accused the electricity industry of making 'unjustified' price increases of 13 per cent between 1990 and 1993. The Electricity Association's own figures show that while prices levelled out in the 1980s, they closely tracked the rising retail price index once privatisation was on the cards. While the distribution companies have not cut their prices, they have tried to woo customers with price freezes and rebates. On Monday, Eastern Electricity, the largest of them, announced Pounds 50m of rebates. Eastern claimed that its customers had seen a rise of 6.1 per cent, including rebates, since privatisation against an increase of 15.4 per cent in the RPI over the same period.

National Grid wants to set up a series of hedging contracts with the generators and regional electricity companies that would stabilise the 'uplift' payments made by Recs - and indirectly by customers - to ensure that electricity demands are met. Uplift charges are a mark-up added to the price of electricity to pay for the administration and running of the pool in which it is traded. They accounted for Pounds 475m, or 3 per cent of electricity prices, last year. Their unpredictability is one reason why bills to customers have been adjusted retrospectively in recent years. National Grid's proposals follow a report by Offer, the electricity industry regulator, which ordered a review of the way the grid pays for electricity from some power stations. Offer identified 14 power stations that made Pounds 200m in extra profits in the year to end March 1992, a 70 per cent increase on the previous year. In the electricity pool system, power stations bid a price and National Grid calls in the cheapest plants. To keep electricity flowing in certain areas at times of peak demand, other plants are occasionally required, even if they are not the cheapest available. Those plants often levy high charges, contributing to uplift. National Grid admits that it has no profit incentive to reduce uplift costs. It suggests that from April it should set up a service under which regional electricity companies would pay a fixed amount for expected uplift charges. In turn, it could sign a series of contracts with generators. There would be incentives for the generators to perform according to the grid's instructions, in place of the present looser arrangements. National Grid would make profits or losses on the service, although they would be capped in the contracts. It would thus have an incentive to reduce uplift, by, for instance, managing the load through contracts with large customers, or through improving the transmission system. Mr Tony White, National Grid head of transmission business development, said expensive plant would be used less, potentially reducing charges.   Companies:-  National Grid.

0,FT934-12808 ,"FT934-12808 _AN-DJYCQAC9FT 931025   FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: High prices are strangling energy-intensive UK manufacturing      From Mr I J BLAKEY   Sir, Both Michael Smith in his article 'Fears of more pit closures increase', and the Leader 'Cutting Coal' (both October 19) failed to make the important connection between the predicament of the coal industry and the unique and untested electricity market structure that the government imposed when electricity was privatised. As is well known, there is a growing surplus of coal-fired electricity generation capacity. The marginal cost of base-load electricity generation on this capacity is less than 1.5p/kwh, yet new generation capacity costing about 2.8p/kwh is being approved, built and prospering within the 'market'. How is this possible? By exercising their dominant market power within a highly artificial market structure National Power and PowerGen have been able to raise electricity prices far in excess of costs, thus creating headroom for the construction of electricity generation plant using natural gas - the cheapest form of new generation plant. As a consequence, the UK's asset of large efficient coal-fired power stations fuelled by increasingly competitive UK coal is now being squandered, and energy-intensive manufacturing industry is being strangulated by high electricity prices which have increased by up to 70 per cent since electricity was privatised. It is truly demoralising to see how slowly the government is acting to rectify these self-inflicted wounds - particularly at a time when economic recovery appears to be faltering and there are severe problems with the balance of trade and the public sector borrowing requirement. It has taken two years of intensive lobbying by large electricity consumers for the Department of Trade and Industry even to acknowledge that there is a problem; and it seems increasingly likely that the government will rely on Offer to refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as its agent in effecting a solution. If this were to happen, it is likely to be mid-1995 at the earliest before any material changes will emerge, by which time the manufacturing base will have been further debilitated, and few coal mines will be left in production. The government has the power to act now in the national interest to arrest the artificial decline in the use of coal for electricity generation, and to reform the electricity market so that the declining costs of coal in efficient base-load stations are reflected in internationally competitive prices to electricity-intensive manufacturing industry. In essence these were the recommendations of the trade and industry select committee in its report of January 1993, which was largely ignored by the government. Now that the adverse consequences for the coal industry and electricity consumers are clearer we can only hope that the government will listen and act.

The Energy Ministry said DEH, the state power monopoly, had been asked to submit detailed proposals for linking the Greek and Turkish grids in Thrace, in north-east Greece. Greece has turned down a Turkish offer to supply electricity to the eastern Aegean islands, claiming it would be unacceptable for its tourist industry to depend on Turkey. Two years ago, talks with the Turkish electricity authority on linking the grids were called off after details of the plan appeared in Greek newspapers. Athens now faces difficulties in boosting capacity at peak periods as its northern neighbours can no longer supply electricity on demand.

The decision, effective from yesterday, is the latest in a series of measures to liberalise the market with the eventual aim of forcing prices down. Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users' Council, said that the relaxation would not in itself result in a large reduction in prices but might encourage generators to pass on lower coal prices to customers. 'The generators can bring down prices,' he said. 'Whether they will remains to be seen. This is one further step towards the competitive market we have been looking for.' Mr Simon Williams, electricity analyst at Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, said the relaxation would bring pricing pressures to bear through greater competition. Under rules introduced during privatisation of the electricity industry three years ago, National Power and PowerGen, generators for England and Wales, could sell electricity directly to only a proportion of customers in each of the 12 electricity regions. Most of the direct sales market was restricted to the 12 regional electricity companies. Relaxations of the rules last year restricted the generators to 9 per cent, 15 per cent or 17.5 per cent of any regional company, depending on the industrial make-up of any region. Offer's latest ruling will end the limits altogether, enabling National Power and PowerGen to compete to supply the whole of the 'non-franchise' market. The non-franchise market is limited to about 5,000 customers who use more than one megawatt of electricity in any one half-hour period. From next year, in a further liberalisation of the market, the threshold will fall to 100 kilowatts, bringing in another 50,000 customers to the competitive market. In recent months PowerGen has been pitching for a larger share of the direct supplies market. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said yesterday that competition would benefit customers and relaxation of 'artificial limits' was a positive move. Yesterday's relaxation is likely to have more effect on sales to medium customers than large ones, many of whom have recently started to buy electricity from the pool wholesale market. However, in the relaxed regime, the generators will not be able to sell electricity directly to customers at a lower price they quote to regional power companies. National Power and PowerGen say they are already passing through the effects of lower coal prices.   Companies:-  National Power.     PowerGen.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Last year the go-ahead was given for a gas pipeline from Scotland to Ulster. Sir Patrick said: 'The European Commission will be contributing 35 per cent of the costs of the interconnector as it fits in very well with the policy of trans-European networks.' He said an interconnector would end the isolation of the Northern Ireland electricity system and increase security of supply. But he stressed the go-ahead was subject to planning permission. Mr William Ross, Ulster Unionist MP for Londonderry East, said it was vital that Northern Ireland's electricity industry was allowed to compete fairly via the interconnector in supplying power. Sir Patrick said it would be advantageous if there was competition introduced into the supply of electricity to Ulster. But Labour's Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) protested: 'It will bring expensive electricity from Scotland, rather than cheaper electricity generated in Northern Ireland from lignite, coal and gas.' Sir Patrick said the claims of lignite would be taken into account.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P1623 Water, Sewer and Utility Lines.

The Energy Intensive Users Group, which includes some of the largest companies in the UK, is to see Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, early next week. A spokesman for British Steel, which belongs to the group, said his company wanted to learn more of the government's plans. Members of the electricity pool, the regulated market through which all electricity has to be sold, have decided to write to the Department of Trade and Industry about the reports. Although the DTI stresses that no decisions have been taken, it is believed to be considering a plan to allow ICI to bypass the pool and buy power direct from a generator. This could save it up to 20 per cent on its electricity bills. ICI says that unless it can buy power more cheaply, it may have to shut down its chlorine plant at Runcorn, Merseyside, with the loss of 7,000 jobs. Mrs Margaret Thompson, the pool's chief executive who will be sending the letter, said yesterday that members felt the pool was 'a big and complicated issue', and they wanted to ensure that the DTI understood the implications of making an exemption. The pool's 30 members, representing generators and distributors, are worried that the government could create an unwelcome precedent. They are already under pressure from their customers to match any ICI deal. The pool was established in the late 1980s, before the privatisation of the electricity industry. Prices are set every half-hour throughout the day on the basis of bids placed by power stations. The price paid by the pool includes charges for running the electricity system and ensuring that enough capacity is available to meet peak demands. Power sold through the pool also incurs the nuclear levy, adding about 10 per cent to electricity bills.   Companies:-  Imperial Chemical Industries.     Energy Intensive Users Group (UK).

Mr Richard Caborn made the charge after the trade and industry secretary's decision to use a recent debate on manufacturing to comment on the committee's recent report on coal. Mr Caborn was supported by Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the House, who said she was 'delighted' at the committee's decision to raise the matter directly with Mr Heseltine. The criticism came as it emerged that the cabinet could get its first chance to discuss plans for saving coal pits next week, after what appears to be a concerted expectation-lowering exercise in Whitehall. Firm decisions seem unlikely until the week after at the earliest. However, indications are that the results of the government's energy review will not be delayed beyond this month. The government yesterday underlined its rejection of proposals which would curtail the amount of electricity supplied from France via the French interconnector. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, assured his French counterpart it was 'not legally possible' to prevent the import of French electricity via the link. But Mr Eggar said he made it clear to Mr Andre Billardon, the French energy minister, that Britain anticipated 'growing exports' of electricity to France. He said Mr Billardon had confirmed that access to the French electricity market was available to UK suppliers on a non-discriminatory basis. Further discussions on the non-leviable status for supplies of electricity from France would take place early next week. The Commons committee, among 39 proposals, recommended that electricity supplied from France would cease to be non-leviable and that Electricite de France's ability to negotiate contracts to supply baseload electricity from 1993 should be conditional on UK generators having non-discriminatory access to the French electricity market. Ministers and officials are emphasising the extremely narrow range of options available to Mr Heseltine, particularly as no contracts have been agreed yet with the electricity generating companies. There is hope in Whitehall that the threat of a strike by miners has tempered some of the sympathy among potentially rebellious Conservative backbenchers.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

On behalf of the State Council, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua told  the conference that there are three essential requirements in  bringing about rural electrification: policy implementation,  self-reliance, and vigorous utilization of rich local  resources. He said that the CPC Central Committee and State  Council have always been deeply concerned about agriculture,  rural areas, and farmers. They are also deeply concerned about  the process of rural electrification. He urged electricity and  other departments and sectors to cooperate with each other;  enlist the support of local governments and people; redouble  their efforts in implementing the project of using electricity  supplies to alleviate poverty; help the broad masses overcome  poverty and achieve prosperity; and make new, solid  contributions to a thriving rural economy.    It has been learned that China's rural electrification  process, which started in the 1960's, has achieved remarkable  progress since China started implementing the policy of reform  and opening up. By the end of 1993, electricity consumption at  the county and lower levels reached 249 billion kwh, or 35  percent of the nation's total; 97 percent of townships, 93  percent of villages, and 89 percent of farmers' households had  been provided with electricity, showing an increase of 5.2,  14.9, and 23.7 percent, respectively, over the 1980 levels. Per  capita annual electricity consumption for the rural population  reached 48 kwh in 1993, 7.9 times the figure for 1978.  Nationwide, 144 counties have accomplished rural electrification  while plans for rudimentary electrification through the  development of hydroelectric power stations are being carried  out smoothly in 200 counties. Power stations are being built in  the countryside nationwide at different levels and through  multiple channels. A structure of rural power sources that  include electricity supplies from the major power grids, small  hydroelectric and coal-fired power stations, and wind and solar  energy is beginning to take shape.    However, due to the restraints of a multitude of historical  and economic factors and natural conditions, there are still 28  counties, 1,269 towns, and 54,860 villages that have virtually  no electricity supply. About 120 million farmers in  poverty-stricken areas in a dozen provinces and autonomous  regions, mostly in central and western China, are waiting to get  electricity. These areas, often sparsely populated and  economically undeveloped, are the most difficult to electrify  because they are far from major power grids, and the local  finances are tight.    At the conference, the MPI put forward the ""Program for  Electrifying China's Countryside in the 1990's."" Among its  primary targets are supplying electricity to all counties by the  year 2000 so that most of the poverty-stricken villages and over  95 percent of farmers' households will have electricity. It  also calls for building 1,000 counties with electricity across  the country. These targets have been incorporated as key parts  of the State Council's plan for helping 80 million people  overcome poverty in the next seven years.    It has been learned that the MPI's ""project of alleviating  poverty and bringing about common prosperity through the supply  of electricity"" has received vigorous support from local  governments. The Shandong Provincial Power Bureau, for example,  has announced a six-point preferential policy. The Inner  Mongolian Autonomous Region worked out a plan of providing power  supplies to all villages. Shaanxi Province has announced a plan  of electrifying impoverished areas in three steps. The meeting  urged local governments and national departments in charge of  planning, economics, electricity, and poverty alleviation to  work as one and make contributions to providing electricity to  farmers' households across the nation.

An official said the company had been considering increasing output at ferro-chrome and ferro-silicon smelters. But it was now reviewing the plan and might have to reduce capacity even for aluminium. Elkem consumes about 8.5bn MW/hours of electricity annually for light-metals production but on an annual basis it buys just 10 per cent of its electricity needs in the spot market. The remainder is supplied under long-term, fixed-rate contracts and from its own generating plants. Norway's electricity market has been undergoing reform during the past couple of years and is considered one of Europe's most liberal. Because of this the government has refused to intervene to stem rising prices. Energy analysts say prices have risen because of the unusually cold weather and speculation that electricity suppliers have not secured large enough trading agreements with neighbouring Sweden and Denmark to cover a shortfall in domestic production. The government said that it would allow the ceilings for imports of electricity to be lifted so that suppliers could cover any shortfall in domestic production. It has also consulted Swedish and Danish authorities on the issue. Average prices for electricity so far this year have been NKr0.18 a KWh, according to government figures, but have shot up in the past two days to around NKr0.48 during the day and NKr0.35.5 in the evening.

Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, said yesterday some restrictions might be needed because companies would be able to offer full energy packages to households in 1996 and 1997. In those years, 5 per cent and 10 per cent respectively of the domestic gas market will be opened to competition. Gas companies, however, will not be able to offer electricity to their customers until 1998, when the gas and electricity markets are due to be fully opened to competition. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said there was 'no question of regional electricity companies being forbidden' from entering the gas market. But Ofgas had to ensure they did not have an unfair advantage by offering energy packages in which gas sales could be subsidised by electricity supply monopolies. She denied that companies might be banned from entering the gas market until 1998, saying she did 'not plan to do anything that draconian'. The 14 electricity distributors in mainland UK, which have invested heavily for the opening of the market, said yesterday they would fight any proposals to restrict their participation in the gas market. 'We see gas as a major business,' said Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive of Yorkshire Electricity. He denied electricity companies would have an unfair advantage. 'In terms of volume the percentages of the gas and electricity markets open to competition in 1996 will be similar.' Mr John Devaney, chief executive of Eastern Electricity, said he would be surprised if power companies were restricted in the gas market: 'It would seem foolish to restrict companies which are well equipped to take.' Offer, the electricity regulator, is already looking at speeding up the liberalisation of the power market as a result of the changes in the gas industry. Only consumers whose peak demand is 100kw or more have a choice from whom to buy supplies. This choice is due to be extended to all consumers in 1998 but Offer has asked companies for opinions on bringing forward competition in some instances to 1996.

0,FT941-16098 ,"FT941-16098 _AN-EALDDACMFT 940112   FT  12 JAN 94 / Power price cuts of up to 15% offered to companies      By MICHAEL SMITH   Companies are being offered cuts of up to 15 per cent in the price of electricity as power suppliers prepare for the introduction of more competition in the market for medium-sized to large consumers from April. The average cut, however, will be considerably less. Inenco, the energy consultancy, said most offers would lead to power costs falling by 4 per cent to 8 per cent. Some companies said they had been offered no reductions. This is partly because electricity companies are tending to demand more frequent payment of bills by companies which want to sign tailor-made contracts rather than remain on standard tariffs. Consultants are advising clients against signing contracts hastily. Mr Andrew Johns, director of the consultancy National Utility Services, said: 'Many regional electricity companies will not offer prices outside the areas where they supply until nearer April. Even then they may review and revise.' The April changes represent the second liberalisation of the electricity market. About 5,000 sites which use more than 1MW of electricity have been able to buy power from a range of suppliers since the industry's privatisation three years ago. Less intensive consumers have been required to buy power from their local regional electricity company. However, from April 1 the threshold of the competitive market will fall to 100 kilowatts, taking in another 45,000 consumers ranging from medium-sized businesses, including supermarkets, to schools and hospitals. The largest reductions on current tariffs are being offered to sites that are one of a series owned by large companies, and to those that require substantial amounts of electricity outside periods of peak demand. Mr Ken Green, power and water purchaser for Imperial Chemical Industries, said yesterday that at the 15 or so company sites which would become eligible to choose their electricity supplier from April, the largest reduction was about 15 per cent. That applied to only one or two sites, however. Some were being offered virtually no price advantage and the average was between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. Mr John Hardy, managing director of Fowler  Holden, a small engineering company in Grimsby, said he had rejected offers from two electricity suppliers which had required payment of bills every 10 to 12 days rather than monthly. Neither offer would have cut the company's electricity costs, he said. Mr Brian Acott, of Inenco, said most regional companies were demanding settlement periods of 10 days. Many customers had already signed deals which they might regret when further offers became available from other companies, he said. Offer, the electricity industry regulator, has criticised electricity companies over attempts to tie existing customers to long-term deals in the approach to April and has instructed them to offer contract escape clauses in some cases.

The Centre for the Study of Regulated Industries reports today that the average return on historical capital employed in the non-nuclear electricity industry was 23.4 per cent over the period. This compared with 15.2 per cent in telecommunications, 13.6 per cent in gas, 10.9 per cent for airports and 10.6 per cent for water. The report follows last week's agreement by the electricity generators to cap wholesale electricity prices after complaints about rising electricity charges. Since then electricity distributors have started to cut prices in their long-term contracts with industrial users. The report shows that Scottish Power earned the highest return on capital of the privatised utilities with 33.6 per cent, followed by the National Grid Company, which is jointly owned by the electricity distributors, with 28.9 per cent. The report also showed that the state-owned nuclear generators, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, have a long way to go before earning private-sector returns. Nuclear Electric's return on capital was 7.4 per cent, and Scottish Nuclear's was 4.7 per cent. A public inquiry has been ordered by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, into the application by Scottish Power to build a 40-mile line of pylons across Ayrshire as part of the planned interconnector to supply power to Northern Ireland, James Buxton writes. The application is opposed in Ayrshire. It would involve building more than 200 pylons from near Ayr to Ballantrae in south-west Ayrshire, which protestors say is one of the county's most beautiful areas. The interconnector, which is expected to cost Pounds 175m, also involves a cable across the Irish Sea. It will permit the transmission of 250MW of power to Northern Ireland Electricity, which is paying all but Pounds 20m of the scheme's cost. National Power, the electricity generator, was fined Pounds 7,500 and ordered to pay Pounds 13,250 costs for causing an oil spill in the river Thames.

0,FT941-2928 ,"FT941-2928 _AN-ECRDQADDFT 940318   FT  18 MAR 94 / Technology: Counting the cost - As electricity deregulation begins in the UK next month, David Lascelles looks at a new generation of meters      By DAVID LASCELLES   In a tastefully converted barn at Odiham in Hampshire, a computer screen shows the map of a residential area north of Bristol. At the touch of a button, the screen prints up real-time details of electricity consumption in any of 30 houses in the area - not just voltage, but wattage and whether the electricity being used is inductive or reactive. More than that, the computer can print out the consumption record for several days in 11-minute blocks, providing a detailed history of each household's life patterns (the exact identity of each household is not disclosed during demonstrations). The experiment is being conducted by a new company called Remote Metering Systems (RMS) in conjunction with SWEB, the Bristol utility, to test a new generation of metering and communications technology. Each house has a novel type of electronic meter with a communication device which sends messages along the electric wires. This technology is being developed in anticipation of the deregulation of the electricity market which starts this April and will be completed in 1998. By then, every household in the country will be able to buy its electricity wherever it wants. Metering is a key part of the revolution because it will provide the means to manage an electricity system with multiple suppliers to millions of households. The electricity will still be delivered to each household down the wires of the local regional electricity company (REC). But each supplier will need to know how much power to put into the system to meet customer needs. Electricity is already being sold in 30-minute lots to big industrial customers. Households will probably deal in four-hour lots, but the new meters will still have to measure their consumption by the half hour because that is how electricity is traded in the wholesale market. RMS was formed at the end of 1992 by six electricity companies headed by Scottish Hydro-Electric and a group of experts in high-speed mains signalling technology. 'All this has vast implications for the management of the electricity system, distribution costs and households,' says Nigel Brown, managing director. If the Bristol experiment is a success, RMS will install several thousand remote metering systems in a selected area of Scotland, and commercial production of the technology will begin. But it is not the only experiment going on. Southern Electric, based outside Maidenhead, in Berkshire, and Scottish Power, have teamed up with Itron, a US company, to adapt 500 meters in both southern England and Scotland so that they can be read remotely every 30 minutes. Instead of using the mains, these meters will transmit their signals via satellite and telephone links to computers at the two companies' headquarters. Although testing the technology is a key aim of the experiment, one of the main purposes, according to Stuart Broomfield, Southern's director of customer services, is to see whether it is commercially feasible. That points to the real issue: cost. New electronic meters cost more than Pounds 50 each. Although this cost would, in the first instance, be borne by the electricity company (household meters belong to the local distributor), it would ultimately be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher electricity prices. But why should an REC want to pay for everyone to have a new meter unless it saw benefits for itself, possibly in the form of automatic meter reading, or better load management? Alternatively, a householder might want to buy a new meter in order to be able to shop around for electricity. But would he spend, say, Pounds 70 in order to achieve a 5 per cent saving on a Pounds 300 bill? Traditional meters cost only Pounds 20 and last 60 years, so the motive to change has to be strong. Andrew Forrest, marketing manager for GEC Meters, says: 'Research bears out that the number of customers seriously interested in saving money is going to be less than 10 per cent.' GEC is trying to get round the cost problem by marketing an attachment which can read a standard meter and transmit the information back to base. This would cost about Pounds 30-Pounds 40, depending on whether it sent its messages by wire or radio. Schlumberger Industries, another meter manufacturer, is stressing the cost-saving aspects of new meters. 'We look at this very much as part of revenue-collection for suppliers and cost messages for consumers,' says Tom Mahoney, managing director. A further cost is the transmission of the data. RMS says its form of power line communication system costs about Pounds 12 to install, in addition to the meter. But Forrest is doubtful about power line technology: 'It works out more expensive than you'd expect, and it's fraught with technical difficulties.' He favours the telephone system. Brown agrees that his technology may be more expensive than, for example, radio, but he emphasises the value of a two-way communication system which can not only read the meter but also give it instructions. The electronic link could be used to provide alarm services, or enable electricity suppliers to offer interruptible supplies to consumers who were willing to have inessential equipment switched off at peak hours in exchange for lower tariffs. All forms of meters would also enable householders to have live meters on the kitchen wall showing exactly how much electricity they are using at any time. At the moment, though, the market is at a standstill because all potential purchasers of new meters are waiting to see the rules of the pricing game. These are being determined by Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, who is conducting a review of electricity distribution pricing which will be completed in the summer. In a discussion document on metering two years ago, he hinted that the review might produce changes in the electricity pricing formula to enable electricity companies to recoup the cost of installing new meters. Littlechild believes modern meters hold the key to a competitive market.   Companies:-  Remote Metering Systems.     South Western Electricity.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT922-60 ,"FT922-60 _AN-CF3ATAERFT 920630   FT  30 JUN 92 / Big names join ICI power attack      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   LARGE British companies including GKN and Blue Circle joined ICI yesterday in its attack on the government over the price of electricity. The Major Energy Users Council renewed its campaign for lower electricity prices for industry by meeting Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. The meeting follows a rare public statement by ICI, which yesterday said its important chlor-alkali business at Runcorn, Merseyside, could not survive without electricity price cuts. Both ICI and the Major Energy Users say electricity prices make British industry uncompetitive in Europe. Mr John Topliss, electricity group chairman of the users council, said Mr Eggar was sympathetic. He added: 'We are hopeful that he will settle the matter by the end of July or August.' ICI said the government must move very quickly to settle the electricity price row. Mr Bryan Bulloch, ICI's power services manager for the chlor-alkali business, said: 'We are losing business, it's an immediate problem.' The business, which uses as much electricity as the city of Liverpool, has seen its electricity bill - which is about 70 per cent of its variable costs  -rise 35 per cent since electricity privatisation two years ago. Before privatisation, ICI and other big electricity consumers paid a much lower bulk tariff. The Runcorn site buys power from ICI's own power purchasing subsidiary, Impkemix, a member of the electricity pool or wholesale market. ICI's move to set up Impkemix followed a suggestion from Mr John Wakeham, the former energy secretary, that large electricity users unhappy about prices should go and compete in the market. Impkemix must still buy from the pool, where prices are much higher than its pre-privatisation tariff. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the generator that supplies the bulk of electricity sold in the pool or wholesale market, said his company sympathised with ICI and had 'stood on its head' to try to help. 'Sadly, it can't be done without cross-subsidy and that's absolutely ruled out,' he said. It was no cheaper for a generator to supply a very large user than a small user.

0,FT931-10953 ,"FT931-10953 _AN-DBEBVADBFT 930205   FT  05 FEB 93 / Power groups are rebuked: Opposition from Littlechild      By MICHAEL SMITH   ELECTRICITY companies that have urged the government to delay liberalisation of the energy market were yesterday rebuked by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, as he expressed strong opposition to their view. A delay in the liberalisation was backed last week by a parliamentary select committee because it would give electricity companies more certainty about the size of future markets and thus enable them to put in long-term contracts for more coal. Hospitals, schools, supermarkets and other medium-to-large users would all suffer because they would fail to benefit from the price reductions they could expect from increased competition among electricity companies, said Prof Littlechild. Plans outlined by the government before the industry was privatised mean that from next year customers using more than 100kw of electricity during a half-hour period will be able to choose which company supplies their power. The current threshold of 1MW applies to just 5,000 large users. Liberalisation would take the figure to between 40,000 and 50,000. Prof Littlechild's opposition is bound to influence the government, although a delay would provide it with one of the simplest solutions to the coal market crisis. The regulator said yesterday a delay would be very regrettable and he was disappointed that some of the generators and regional electricity companies had associated themselves with that view. There were 20,000 electricity customers just below the 1MW limit and they needed the lowest possible costs for fuel to compete abroad and provide jobs in Britain, he said. Ten thousand of the new sites that would qualify for supplier choice would be schools and hospitals. 'There is always need for more resources there,' Prof Littlechild said. Liberalisation would also ensure that regional electricity companies purchased electricity efficiently, he added. The regulator also repeated calls for a reduction in - and more clarity about - the nuclear levy which is paid to Nuclear Electric to cover liabilities inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board when the industry was privatised. 'It really has been pretty much a black box. Where does it go? What is it for? The customer needs to know.' His remarks were delivered at the annual meeting of the Major Energy Users' Council, at which electricity companies were attacked by delegates for high profits since privatisation. Delegates also expressed discontent over the price rises that some large users had experienced. Mr Tom Lowes, representing Blue Circle, said the electricity companies' returns on capital were more than twice those in the rest of industry. He also attacked what he called the arrogance of the industry in responding to complaints. Other delegates called for the operation of the pool - the wholesale market for electricity - to be simplified. Prof Littlechild said he was not convinced that the running of the electricity pool needed to be as complex as it was. He said the record of the industry had been mixed since privatisation. Some large users were having to pay more, but for most, prices had been reduced by 10 to 15 per cent. Eastern Electricity, the largest of the regional electricity companies, yesterday signed a five-year contract with National Power, the generator, to meet 21 per cent of its needs over five years from March 31. The contract, similar to one already concluded between the company and PowerGen, the other main generator, depends on National Power negotiating a contract with British Coal for 40m tonnes next year and 30m in the following four.

He maintained that the country  will only be able to generate electricity at 60 percent of its  capacity by December.    Speaking on television to a panel of journalists, the  minister described the prolonged cuts as one of the gravest  problems facing the country.    There may be solutions but there can be no miracles, Portal  said. He added that there is currently no stable generation of  electricity due to a lack of spare parts [aseguramiento  material] for the thermoelectric plants.    The minister said that 66 percent of the electricity is  generated in plants from the former Soviet Union and former  Czechoslovakia, which disintegrated, and this led to an  interruption in the procurement of spare parts in the past three  years.    Portal also cited a lack of foreign currency, due to the  current economic crisis, among the factors that have worsened  the situation in this sector.    He reported that $3 million were allocated to the purchase  of  spare parts for the thermoelectric plants and $7 million to the  generation of electricity in 1994.    Two small plants will be operational by end of year, one in  eastern Cuban and the other near the capital, the minister added.    Portal said that limitations in this sector will not impede  further implementation of development plans promoted by Cuba to  overcome the serious economic problems currently facing it.    We have a new and powerful electricity system, he said,  after  pointing out that most Cuban plants were installed less than 25  years ago.    Portal thinks that the use of national petroleum, a heavy  crude with high sulfur content, is not the cause for breaks  [roturas] at the hydroelectric plants, because its use only  causes problems with the gas pipelines.    The use of national petroleum will save about $360 million  this year. This represents 30 percent of total electricity  consumption.     "
0,FT931-14991 ,"FT931-14991 _AN-DAOB4ABSFT 930115   FT  15 JAN 93 / ICI power talks trigger calls for cheaper deals      By DAVID LASCELLES and PAUL ABRAHAMS   THE UK POWER generators were inundated with inquiries from industrial users yesterday after news that the Department of Trade and Industry may allow a special licence for PowerGen to sell electricity cheaply to Imperial Chemical Industries. Sharp increases in electricity prices over the past two years have been criticised by big industrial users and they are eager to share in any opportunity to cut power costs. ICI says its power bills have gone up 60 per cent since April 1991. It now pays Pounds 31 a megawatt-hour compared with the Pounds 25 it believes its main German competitors are paying. It is unclear, however, how the government can grant one company - albeit a very large one - special access to cheaper electricity without making similar offers across industry. Power industry sources were warning yesterday that even if it did, exemptions would drive up costs for everyone else. It was not clear yesterday what stage the discussions with ICI had actually reached. Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users Council, said he was told before Christmas by Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, that the separate deal was in the process of being negotiated. The Office of Electricity Regulation, which would issue the licence, also confirmed that it was discussing the matter with the DTI. ICI said it was still talking to both the government and the generating companies after 18 months and that no agreement had been reached. The company reiterated that it was deeply concerned about the future of its chlorine and derivatives business, which needed a rapid cut in electricity costs if they were to survive against overseas competition. Industrial concern about power prices dates back three years to when the electricity industry was privatised. At that time, subsidies for large electricity users were phased out, leaving large companies with sharp price increases. Part of the difficulty lies in the way the UK electricity market works. The rules governing the newly privatised power industry include a requirement that power generators sell all their output through the pool, the wholesale market where prices are set every half hour throughout the day. Power sold through the pool, however, collects heavy charges to pay for running the UK electricity system. They can add from 5 per cent to 10 per cent to electricity bills. The solution apparently being considered by the DTI is to allow generators to sell a certain amount of power outside the pool, directly to large industrial customers. Those deals would bypass the pool charges. A further benefit might be that sales outside the pool would escape the nuclear levy. The levy helps to fund the nuclear power industry's clean-up costs and adds a further 10 per cent to electricity bills. Exemption from the pool might reduce the cost of electricity by up to 20 per cent. That happens to be about the size of the reduction that ICI says it needs to remain competitive. Appealing though that arrangement looks to industry, the majority of electricity users would be losers. The pool's costs would remain the same - and so would those of the nuclear power industry. The costs would only fall even more heavily on non-exempted electricity users. If a special dispensation were given to ICI it would also raise the issue of which other users should benefit from similar licences. The DTI said yesterday that it was talking to several companies in the Major Energy Users Council. One suggestion is that only those using more than 100MW on a single site should benefit, which would cover large operations such as British Steel, United Engineering Steel and Shotton Paper. Mr Rost said that if the ICI deal went ahead it would open the gates for other companies. 'It is unacceptable that one company can get a special advantage when others are equally hard-pressed,' he said. He argued that the government should restructure the electricity industry to create more opportunity for companies to shop around. Both the large power generators, PowerGen and National Power, emphasised yesterday that any deals under new licences would be done on strictly commercial terms. There was no question of price cutting. PowerGen said it had always expressed sympathy at the plight of intensive energy users after the removal of subsidies, but it was a matter for the government if it wanted to offer support for ICI. There would be other companies that believed their case for support was every bit as strong as that for ICI, it said.   Companies:-  PowerGen.     Imperial Chemical Industries.

The ongoing second phase of the scheme, which will supply  electricity to 90 per cent of households in 200 counties  nationwide, will get a big help from loans.    In 1991 the State began annually allocating 200 million yuan  ($23 million) from its fiscal budget to the project.    This year the loans will be increased, said Vice-Minister  Chen Yaobang of the State Planning Commission.    Chen made the statement at the opening meeting yesterday of  the national conference on rural electrification.    The loans from the China Agricultural Bank and other  domestic  banks will increase from last year's 1 billion yuan ($115  million) to 1.7 billion yuan ($181 million), said Zhang  Chunyuan, Vice-Minister of Water Resources.    China launched the project in 1991, aiming to develop  hydroelectric power.    Most of the counties covered by the programme are in the  South.    The State has targeted 200 counties in 24 provinces and  autonomous regions -- most on the government's list of  underdeveloped areas.    It is part of the national bid to lay a solid foundation for  rural social and economic development.    In the past three years, machinery capable of generating  3.77  million kilowatts of electricity has been installed. They can  now generate 594 million kilowatt-hours in electricity.    More than 18 million farmers from 5 million families in  programme-covered counties now have electricity as a result.    At the conference, which ends tomorrow, 14 counties were  awarded for meeting the programme's electricity target.    Under the scheme, the annual electricity consumption of  households in the counties is expected to be more than 200 kwh  -- the national average for rural areas.    And industry and agriculture in these areas will be assured  of electricity for at least 330 days a year.    Zhang said machinery capable of generating 15 million  kilowatts in electricity needs to be completed by 1995 to meet  the project's goals.    At the meeting Zhang said the programme will be extended to  another 300 counties for the Ninth Five-year Plan period  (1996-2000).     "

But your statements that 'coal is a dirty and expensive form of generating electricity', and that changing the energy market by, for example, restricting gas-fired stations, closing nuclear plants or halting imports of French electricity 'would impose higher electricity costs on British businesses and consumers' cannot go unchallenged. If new power stations are to be built, coal is at present a more expensive source of generation than gas. But why do we need new stations now when there is already surplus capacity? High-efficiency coal-fired power stations will be forced to operate at greatly reduced output and the consumer is having to pay a return on unnecessary investment. This may well be one of the reasons behind the surge in electricity pool prices this summer, which has so disturbed consumers and Offer, the electricity watchdog. As pointed out in the Commons trade and industry select committee report in January, the cost of electricity from existing power stations  - even allowing for the addition of flue gas desulphurisation when needed - is cheaper than that from many new gas-fired stations, and will become more so with the continuing decline in British Coal prices. The stimulus for much gas-fired generation has been provided by rivalry between regional electricity companies and generators, rather than by underlying economics. As to nuclear, it is hard for a coal business struggling for survival to see it implied that nuclear power, dependent for almost half its income in England and Wales on a levy on other forms of generation, is somehow driving out coal on cost grounds. The attraction of imported electricity depends on the classification of power imported over the link with France as 'non-leviable'. This means, in effect, that wholesale purchasers of that power in the UK can afford to pay more for the power because they are still collecting the levy on their sales, but do not need to pass it to the French. The select committee pointed out that 'far from providing cheap electricity, Electricite de France has provided some of the more expensive baseload supplies'. That the government decided not to make any fundamental changes in the electricity market as a result of the coal review is a matter of record. That to have done so would have led to higher costs to consumers is not.

0,FT942-10614 ,"FT942-10614 _AN-EEJC9ACQFT 940510   FT  10 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Legality of an obligation to buy - European Court   An exclusive purchasing obligation, forcing local electricity distributors to purchase all their electricity from a regional company, could be lawful provided such a restriction was necessary to allow the regional company to fulfil its public service obligations, the European Court of Justice ruled recently. Local electricity distributors in the Netherlands brought a case against their regional electricity company. Under Dutch law, electricity is distributed by regional companies to local distributors, which in turn ensure the supply of electricity to individual clients in their areas. However, certain end-users, notably those in rural areas, are directly supplied by the regional companies. Regional distributors have a non-exclusive statutory right to distribute electricity in their region. Between 1985 and 1988, the regional distributor concerned prohibited the local distributors from purchasing electricity from any other source. There was a corresponding obligation on the regional company to sell electricity only to the local distributor companies. These companies, in turn, imposed an obligation on the final consumer to purchase electricity only from them. The regional companies also had to purchase their electricity from the national generators. From January 1 1985, the regional company imposed a surcharge on the local companies in order to compensate for the difference between the higher cost of distributing electricity direct to rural consumers and the lower costs of distributing electricity to the local companies for use by urban consumers. The local companies made a complaint to the European Commission. The Commission ruled that the restriction imposed by the national generators on the regional distributors was unlawful under the Rome treaty. It also held that the restrictions on the end-users breached competition rules and could not be justified under Rome treaty rules on public service undertakings. The restrictions between the regional and local companies were not explicitly dealt with by the Commission. However, before complaining to the Commission, the local companies had started arbitration proceedings to decide the legality of the surcharge imposed by the regional companies. A tribunal found that the surcharge was lawful. The local companies appealed to a national court which sought a preliminary ruling from the ECJ on, among other things, whether a prohibition on the importation of electricity such as existed in the present case was contrary to Rome treaty rules covering state monopolies and competition. The ECJ first held that European state monopolies rules were not relevant to the present case, as the regional distribution company did not have an exclusive right to distribute electricity in the relevant territory. The ECJ then found that the import prohibition restricted competition and affected trade between member states, as it partitioned the Dutch market from other European Union markets. But the ECJ left it to the national court to determine whether a collective dominant position actually existed between all the regional companies in the Netherlands. The ECJ said if it did, the tying-in of electricity purchasers in the way described would constitute an abuse of that dominant position. The ECJ finally examined the Rome treaty provisions on public service undertakings which provide that restrictions on competition imposed by such companies are lawful to the extent which they are necessary for the performance of the relevant services of general economic interest carried out by those companies. The ECJ said it was for the national court to determine whether the import restriction was necessary for the regional company to distribute electricity in its territory. It stated that, in determining this question, the national court should take into account the costs borne by the company, in particular regulatory costs relating to the envi-ronment.

The company has attacked the pricing policies and profits of Britain's electricity producers and those of the regional electricity companies, warning that its chlorine plants required immediate price cuts if they were to survive against foreign competition. Energy represents about 70 per cent of chlorine raw materials costs. ICI's chlorine businesses are the second largest in Europe, employing 7,000 people in the UK and contributing Pounds 1.5bn to the balance of payments, according to the company. The warning follows campaigns by the Chemical Industries Association and the Major Energy Users Council about the high cost of electricity following privatisation. The users council has asked for the two large electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. ICI said it had had lengthy discussions with the electricity generators but had been unable to gain better prices. Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymers said: 'We have worked hard to keep all our other costs competitive and an immediate cut on electricity price is crucial if we are to maintain the jobs in the industry. Given the huge price increases suddenly imposed on us we were not surprised by the massive profit increases recently recorded by the electricity producers and the figures now being unveiled by the regional distribution companies.' In February, ICI said it might have to shut its chloralkali plant at Hillhouse, Lancashire, because of falling demand and rising electricity costs.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, is proposing that electricity distributors spend Pounds 1 on energy efficiency per customer each year  - or Pounds 100m over the four years that the controls will last. He also removed incentives which enable electricity companies to make profits just by selling more electricity rather than by being more efficient. The package of measures unveiled by Prof. Littlechild is part one of a two-year review of prices in the privatised regional electricity companies (RECs). Although this stage affects only the supply business, which accounts for 10 per cent of REC operating profits, it indicates that Prof. Littlechild intends to tighten steadily the squeeze on electricity prices. He has set a basic limit of Pounds 10m on the costs RECs can pass on to their customers, plus an allowance for the number of customers and units of electricity sold. He is also restricting price rises to the rate of inflation minus two percentage points a year. However, he will grant an extra allowance for RECs which have exceptional costs because of factors such as high customer turnover or bad debts. The company receiving the largest allowance is London Electricity with Pounds 6m. It was not clear whether the company saw this as enough. A spokesman said there would be no comment until the board had reviewed the proposals. Any REC can appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission against the regulator's actions. Other RECs said the package looked tough but manageable. Mr John Harris, chairman of East Midlands Electricity, said: 'It is challenging. But we're very supportive of his approach because he will be rewarding efficiency.' Householders will not notice any immediate change from the new controls, which do not take effect for a year, and the impact of the next stage of the review, of electricity distribution prices, will be much bigger. But Prof. Littlechild said yesterday's measures would produce a small cut in prices, and oblige RECs to be more cost-conscious. He also confirmed his intention to remove all price controls for customers using more than 100KW a year, starting next April, as part of a move towards total deregulation by 1998. On the stock market there was relief that the controls were less tough on the RECs than feared. But there was disappointment in the energy efficiency industry at the size of the savings.

The rate of increase in the number of new  enterprises in these two spheres is almost double that of 1992.  If the 288 joint enterprises and 2,208 private enterprises carry  on operations simultaneously, they will certainly consume a huge  amount of electricity. If Ho Chi Minh City's electricity  distribution network can't satisfy the needs, everyone knows  what will happen.    According to data disclosed by the Ho Chi Minh City Electric  Power Service, the carrier capacity of the city's existing power  net is approximately 420 megawatts, which is about 80 megawatts  below consumption needs. Thus, there is already an imbalance  between needs and carrier capacity. This is one of the things  that has led to a drop in pressure and unexpected power outages,  which has caused large losses for many production, business, and  service installations. The Ho Chi Minh City Electric Power  Service has calculated that electricity consumption in the city  will increase to 600 and 700 megawatts by the end of 1994 and  1995 respectively. Because of this, unless immediate action is  taken, Ho Chi Minh CIty will find itself in a situation in which  it ""doesn't know whether to laugh or cry."" Because on one hand,  the supply of electricity will have increased greatly, but on  the other hand, electricity needs will have increased but the  carrier capacity of the distribution network will not have the  capabilities to satisfy those needs. Managers are aware of this,  but it is beyond their power to do anything about it.  Fortunately, since 1993, financial capabilities have allowed Ho  Chi Minh City to begin implementing plans to make improvements  on a large scale. On 31 March 1993, the Ministry of Energy  finished examining the economic and technical arguments  concerning the project to improve and expand the municipal  electric power network, 1992-1995 phase. At the beginning of  September 1993, the city decided to spend 151 billion dong to  implement eight projects in the plan to improve and upgrade  things in order to increase the carrier capacity of the electric  power network to 700 megawatts. The project got underway during  the 4th quarter of 1993 and will be completed by the end of 1994.    Tran Minh Quy, the man in charge of implementing the  electric  power network improvement project of the Ho Chi Minh CIty  Electric Power Service, said that this is a major improvement  project. The electric power sector is urgently implementing  this. The things that must be done include:    Building thirty 15-kv lines from the intermediary stations,  which includes 4.7 km of underground cable and 61.5 km of  above-ground landlines.    Improving and upgrading 195 km of 15-kv landlines and laying  another 40 km of new landlines.    Upgrading the low voltage from 100 volts to 220 volts for  600  zones.    Replacing 60 breakers and installing 91 controllers and 70  relays in order to improve eleven 15-kv breaker stations.    Besides this, in order to improve electricity safety among  the people, the electricity sector will install an additional  5.9 km of 15-kv landlines and 48 km of low-voltage landlines,  improve the other 55 km of low-voltage landlines, and build 62  low-voltage, 9,885 kva, stations. As part of the project to  improve the electricity network, electrification will be carried  out in six villages in six rural districts: Xuan Thoi Thuong in  Hoc Mon District, Long Hoa in Can Gio District, Phuoc Kien in  Nha Be District, Trung An in Cu Chi District, Binh Hung Hoa in  Binh Chanh District, and Long Truong in Thu Duc District. In the  villages in Xuan Thoi Thuong and Long Truong districts,  construction got underway at the end of 1993.    As mentioned above, once the improvement project has been  completed, the capacity of the Ho Chi Minh City electricity  network will increase from 420 mw to 700 mw. But according to  Tran Minh Quy, with just 151 billion dong, only one of the five  problems now facing the city's electricity network can be  solved, that is, the problem concerning carrier and distribution  capabilities to satisfy electricity consumption needs and  receive power from the new sources of generation. Only minor  improvements will be made with respect to the other problems,  that is, the quality of the electric power supplied, the  confidence in the power supply, safety in electricity supply and  use, and losses. In order to solve the above problems and ensure  that consumption needs, which will reach 1,300 mw by the year  2000, are satisfied, the electricity sector has about 10 more  projects that must be built, which will require investment  capital of more than 2.4 trillion dong. The work to be done in  1995 will cost 470 billion dong.    The year 2000 is fast approaching, and the requirements  imposed on the electricity sector are rather great. Obtaining  capital to implement the plans is still a difficult problem. At  present, the electricity sector is looking only at supplemental  power funds and a small sum allocated from the municipal budget.  Recently, representatives from the World Bank came to Ho Chi  Minh City to survey things and study the capabilities for  financing the projects to improve the municipal electricity  network as part of the general financial program for the  Vietnamese energy sector. In December 1993, World Bank  representatives returned and issued a notice that the World Bank  will send specialists to study the plans for improving and  expanding the electricity network at a total cost of $44  million, of which the World Bank will finance $33 million. The  draft study phase will conclude in 1994, and preparations for  actually implementing things will get underway in 1995. With  this financial aid, when added to the efforts of the locality,  it is hoped that by the year 2000 Ho Chi Minh City will have the  desired electricity carrier and distribution network.

Yorkshire Electricity, one of the companies taking a tough stand in the negotiations between the generators and the distribution companies, said: 'We are determined to protect the interests of our shareholders and customers. Negotiations are complex and continuing.' It was willing to take its full share of the new electricity on offer, based on its share of the market, but it would not buy additional electricity if other companies were unable to take up their full amounts. Several of the 12 regional companies in England and Wales have contracted to buy electricity from independent power producers or Nuclear Electric, although the government is trying to get some of these contracts cancelled. The regional companies are also refusing to take the risk that Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, may disapprove of the new contracts. They are insisting on prior approval by Prof Littlechild or an opt-out clause. Because they have similar concerns, the regional companies have appointed central negotiators to speed up the talks. The team is headed by Mr Jim Keohane, who is in charge of power purchasing at East Midlands Electricity. The companies intend to reassure the competition authorities the arrangements are not intended to be anti-competitive. The contracts will cover electricity generated by the new five-year contracts agreed between the power generators and British Coal.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

He originally hoped to reach a decision in the middle of this month, and last week electricity stocks gained sharply in anticipation of a deal. But an announcement now seems unlikely before next month. Last week Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, asked Prof Littlechild to brief him on progress. The absence of a decision is one of the factors holding up the government's planned review of the nuclear power industry. The terms of reference for that, which were due in December, also face a delay until next month. The hold-up is due to the difficulty in hammering out an agreement with National Power and PowerGen, the two largest generators, over prices and commitments to offer for sale generating plant that is not needed. In December Prof Littlechild said he would have to settle these issues if a reference were to be avoided. Prof Littlechild also said in December that he wanted to discuss plans for reforming the electricity pool - the wholesale electricity market whose complex arrangements have been blamed in part for rising electricity prices. But apart from an exchange of letters last month, nothing has happened. The threat of a monopoly reference is one of the biggest uncertainties currently facing the electricity industry. However, analysts are increasingly confident that a deal can be reached, particularly now that large energy users have said they do not think a monopolies investigation would be useful.

Last month Mr Cuomo proposed to buy out Lilco's shareholders at Dollars 21.50 a share and take the the company into state ownership in an attempt to cut electricity bills. However, the plan looks unlikely to go ahead under New York's new Republican governor, Mr George Pataki. Mr Cuomo said Lilco's electricity rates, the highest in the US, would fall by 10 per cent if the company were nationalised because it would no longer have to pay federal taxes or shareholder dividends. Later this month Lilco's electricity rates are due to be reviewed, but the New York Public Service Commission, the state body that sets electricity rates, is not expected to permit any increase.

That is because electricity stocks have had such a good run in recent months, outperforming the market by nearly 25 per cent since May. Some investment houses have used the difference in yield to justify recommending their investors to switch from electricity to water. Some shareholders even seem to have heeded their brokers' advice. At the end of last week, the water sector was up 1.7 per cent on the previous Friday's close. The electricity sector was down 3.4 per cent. Such arguments only take into account present yields, not future growth. On that basis, the outlook for the regional electricity companies is better than that for their water counterparts. With ungeared balance sheets, the Recs are looking for ways to hand back their excess cash. There could be further share buy-back schemes or even one-off bumper dividends. The proceeds from next year's National Grid sale could also be redistributed to shareholders. Shares could be marked up in preparation for the end, early next year, of the moratorium on mergers and acquisitions in the sector. In the short term, as the Recs move into the closed period during which they cannot announce share buy-back schemes, their shares look set to underperform.

In an unusual step Mr Clarke publicised a letter he sent to Prof Littlechild highlighting what he described as 'serious shortcomings' in a report on electricity prices last month. By using 'a very selective and dubious example' Prof Littlechild had created the mistaken impression that coal was an expensive way of generating electricity. In his report Prof Littlechild examined electricity pricing to determine whether the regional electricity companies were purchasing power economically. He concluded that they were, but in the process indicated that coal-based electricity contracts were the most expensive, followed by nuclear power and gas. Although Prof Littlechild's report was only a prelude to a full study to be published at the end of this month it caused a furore because it coincided with the coal review being conducted by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. In his letter yesterday Mr Clarke said that Prof Littlechild failed to compare like with like and used 'arbitrary' assumptions about the role of various fuels in meeting electricity demand. He also complained that Prof Littlechild stressed the positive features of gas without examining those of coal, and that he portrayed coal as permanently high-cost in spite of steady improvements in British Coal's productivity. Mr Clarke said examination of Prof Littlechild's findings showed that coal was competitive with other fuel sources, including coal imports, and offered advantages. He stressed doubts expressed by Prof Littlechild about whether electricity generators were passing the full benefits of lower coal prices to their customers. Mr Clarke said the press seized on a key sentence in the press release on the report which said coal contracts were the most expensive. 'I fear that the misconception about the fundamental economics of generation from coal and gas, created by misreporting of your study, has served to confuse rather than inform those making vital decisions in the coal review (who will not in general read the detailed document).' A spokesman for Prof Littlechild said officials would discuss the points raised in the letter with British Coal and they would be taken into account in the final report. British Coal's operations should be licensed to the private sector rather than be privatised, according to Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director. He said yesterday mines would be publicly owned 'but the private sector would be able to show whether it could do better'. Work started yesterday on 23 workshops and offices, costing Pounds 850,000 and funded by British Coal, at Seaham Grange industrial estate in the East Durham coalfield.

The companies say they will not pay the element in their bills that goes towards the annual subsidy for the UK's nuclear generation sector. This subsidy represents 11 per cent of an industrial user's payment, amounting to some Pounds 350m for industry as a whole. At a recent meeting of large electricity users, companies expressed anger at the prospect of rises of 25 per cent to 30 per cent in their electricity bills this year. The Major Energy Users' Council will meet Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, on February 12 to discuss the issue and to express members' concern about rising electricity prices. Large users have complained for some time that rising prices in the electricity wholesale market - on which annual contracts are based - are affecting their ability to compete with continental rivals. 'In the UK, major users are paying the same prices as domestic customers,' said Mr Tom Lowes, chief energy buyer for Blue Circle. The users' group says regular customers using large amounts of electricity should get a discount. Mr Lowes said the UK cement industry needs electricity prices of 1.9p to 2p per kilowatt hour - or the equivalent of other fuels  - in order to compete with continental rivals. This year he expects to have to pay about 2.6p. 'There is no way to pass electricity price costs on to consumers in the current recession - if the price of cement is put up, the UK will just get more imports,' he said. Most industrial companies are squeezing their own suppliers to bring costs below the rate of inflation. 'I am buying some things where the price has gone down,' said one member of the energy users' council, 'and I am certainly not paying more than a 3 per cent increase for most supplies.' The UK's electricity suppliers have argued that prices in the wholesale market must rise to reflect the true cost of power.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

The Tocopilla sale is set to be the largest electricity privatisation in South America since Argentina completed its sell-off and competition between advisers was intense. Kleinwort emerged from a field of 17 investment banks and a shortlist of three that included its UK rival on electricity deals, NM Rothschild, and CS First Boston of the US. Codelco and Kleinwort have to decide on the stake to be offered to outside investors, expected to be a majority, and the method of sale. The management of the Chilean state company are understood to prefer an offer for sale but a trade sale to an international electricity company is also a possibility. Kleinwort said it expected to complete a review of options by early 1995 with a view to a transaction in the late spring or early summer. An international offering would have to be timed to avoid clashing with the sale of shares in the UK's national grid and generating companies, and several other electricity privatisations scheduled for next year. The valuation of Tocopilla depends heavily on the contract it strikes with Codelco, which consumes two thirds of its output. However the coal and oil fired power station's capacity of 570MW points to a worth of about Dollars 500m. The outcome of the Tocopilla 'beauty contest' between investment banks reinforces the dominance of the electricity sector by Kleinwort and NM Rothschild since they worked on UK electricity privatisation.

0,FT932-12 ,"FT932-12 _AN-DGABBAAJFT 930630   FT  30 JUN 93 / Deal close on electricity supply in east Germany      By JUDY DEMPSEY      BERLIN   A DECISION is close on a formula which would gradually introduce more competition in the eastern German electricity industry. Only one local council is holding out against a deal that would resolve the future of the region's electricity supply and pave the way for limited foreign involvement. The compromise, which involves eastern Germany's 164 local councils, the association of municipal utilities, the economics ministry, and west Germany's utility companies, would give councils access to power generation. It would also allow them to buy 30 per cent of their electricity needs locally, or from a foreign supplier, and to form partnerships with outsiders. The compromise, which would end the uncertainty about who had the right to generate power, also means that Vereinigte Enerkiwerke, or Veag, eastern Germany's main utility which operates the region's high voltage grid, could speed up its massive investment programme. The deal results from opposition by eastern Germany's local councils to the Stromvertrag, or electricity contract, signed in August 1990 between the two Germanies. Ostensibly it set out to modernise eastern Germany's power industry, but with little room for competition. Not only were the east's local councils denied the right to generate their own power, but the grid, sales, and distribution of energy were monopolised by western Germany's eight utility companies. RWE Energie, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, the country's three largest utilities, together obtained a 75 per cent stake in Veag. The rest was divided among the five other utility companies. These eight companies were also given majority stakes in eastern Germany's 15 regional distribution networks. In order to underwrite Veag's massive investment programme in eastern Germany, the Stromvertrag stated that only 49 per cent of eastern Germany's regional utilities could be owned by the local councils. The regional operators had to buy 70 per cent of their power from Veag for the next 20 years; and the local councils in turn had to buy 70 per cent of their electricity from the regional utilities. However, the local councils, which opposed the emergence of a monopoly, appealed to the constitutional court, arguing they had the right to claim 100 per cent of the regional utilities' assets because they had owned them until 1952 before they were expropriated by the Communist regime. The court upheld the Stromvertrag but suggested a compromise, accepted by all but one council. The councils will be allowed sell their 49 per cent stakes in the regional utilities. Local cities and regional utilities are likely to have priority over foreigners. At the same time, with the assets, the councils will be free to meet 30 per cent of their energy needs from whatever source they choose. However, they must still obtain 70 per cent of their electricity needs from the regional utilities, which in turn must obtain 70 per cent of their electricity from Veag.

The electricity industry watchdog, Offer, supported the MPs' view, saying that 'the lack of effective choice in the market this year is a most unsatisfactory feature of the present situation'. The call for reform came from the Commons energy committee in a report entitled The Consequences of Electricity Privatisation, which found that the competitive electricity market the government promised at privatisation has not yet materialised. An important reason for this was the dominant market position of the two generators created at privatisation, National Power and PowerGen, it said. The report argues that Offer 'should take steps as soon as possible to reduce the dominance of the two generators'. If more competition has not emerged by 1995, the report said, Offer should refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The two generators should also be compelled to offer for sale any power stations they planned to close. This would stop them from artificially tightening the electricity market by temporarily closing stations. The committee said there were few signs that competition in electricity generation was developing. Although many new gas-fired stations were being planned by independent generators entering the market, around half would not have to compete on price because they had secured long-term, fixed price contracts to sell their power to regional electricity suppliers who would sell on to captive consumers. Meanwhile, these new stations would force existing coal stations which produced cheaper electricity to close. It was not clear, the energy committee said, how Offer could compel regional electricity companies to refund customers if they had sold uncompetitive power in this way. But it recommended that Offer should immediately scrutinise all the deals between regional companies and independent power stations. The report also called for urgent reforms to the pool, or wholesale electricity market. It said that although the pool was supposed to set a competitive electricity price, most electricity was sold outside the pool in contracts, and the contracts market was neither transparent nor genuinely competitive. The MPs' report was broadly supported by Offer, which published its annual report yesterday. It said that although large electricity customers had enjoyed price cuts last April, this year they faced significant increases, and many were having difficulty obtaining contracts to buy electricity at all. Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, defended privatisation which he said had brought price cuts of 10 per cent to three quarters of industrial customers last year, while nearly a third had obtained reductions of over 20 per cent.

The law breaks the national monopoly on electricity generation and distribution held by the electricity utility, MVM, allows for independent utilities and establishes the basis for a division along British lines between power generators and distributors. Crucially, the legislation, on which the UK merchant bank Schroders has advised the Hungarian government, establishes a legal framework for setting prices. This gives foreign investors the pricing stability they need to bid confidently in the privatisation tender due this summer. The electricity industry as a whole has a book value of Ft570bn (Pounds 3.76bn), the government claims. Its partial sale will be of roughly the same order of magnitude as Hungary's telecommunications privatisation. Last December, Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US paid Dollars 875m for 30 per cent of national telecoms operator, Matav, in eastern Europe's largest single privatisation. But the crucial determinant of the size of the transaction is the detailed pricing regulation of the electricity sector, which will flesh out the act passed yesterday and is due in the coming weeks. Tariffs may have to nearly double if the industry is to cover its forecast capital costs, and advisers hope that price rises can close the gap in 3-5 years. In preparation for the electricity sale, the government has split MVM into eight generating companies and six regional distributors. West European utilities may be permitted to acquire majority stakes in six regional distribution companies. The authorities also intend to allow complete foreign ownership in four generating companies which rely largely on coal-fired power plants and require modernisation. The state plans, however, to retain a stake of 25 per cent in three larger conventional power complexes and to keep full control of the Paks nuclear power station. Hungary has taken a liberal approach to foreign investment in the utilities because of the pressing need to develop infrastructure neglected under communist rule. The industry ministry estimates that the electricity sector must invest Ft220bn-Ft250bn by the year 2000 to replace outmoded capacity with more efficient, cleaner stations.

Electricity companies have an incentive to sell as much electricity as possible because their profits are directly related to volume. In future volume will account for only half the 'revenue driver' which determines a company's profits. The other half will be based on the number of customers the company has. Prof Littlechild argues that this will reduce the volume incentive while encouraging companies to go out and seek new customers. He will also allow companies to keep more of the profits made from reducing power losses, which amount to 7 per cent of the electricity passing through the system. Prof Littlechild expects these measures to produce savings equivalent to the electricity used by a city the size of Nottingham. However, he decided against introducing fresh measures to curb demand for electricity. Last year he approved an allowance in the price controls that will raise Pounds 100m in four years for electricity companies to spend on energy efficiency projects. He said yesterday that he was unwilling to increase this because the full costs and benefits of demand side measures have not yet been established in the UK. He also believed that it was not the regulator's job to impose what was essentially a tax on consumers, even if it was for a worthy cause. This marks a further blow for the government-sponsored Energy Savings Trust, which is supposed to raise several hundred million pounds from gas and electricity users for domestic energy efficiency work. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, has already said that funding for the trust is a matter for parliament, not her. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the review because it 'reversed the regulator's position on the Energy savings Trust'. He also said that the reduction of the volume component of the revenue driver to 50 per cent was not enough to cut the profligacy of the electricity companies. 'It's 25 per cent in Northern Ireland and 10 per cent in the gas industry because that is what the real costs are,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Instead, Skinner will move into the top job at America's biggest power utility next month. By accelerating its plans, PGE aims to give its new chief executive a head start on what may be one of the most difficult periods in the history of the company as California moves to deregulate its electricity supply industry. Skinner, 56, will succeed Richard Clarke, 64, who will remain chairman of the board. 'The next few years will produce greater change than we have seen in the last 10 or 15 years combined,' says Clarke. A recent proposal by the independent California Public Utilities Commission aims to reduce electricity prices by creating a competitive market. The plan calls for all electricity users in the state, including residential customers, to be allowed to buy electricity from the supplier of their choice by the year 2002. It also establishes a streamlined, performance-based rate-setting system. PGE, which has long operated its electricity supply operations as a regulated monopoly in many parts of California, is about to go through the same kind of upheaval that has reshaped the US telecommunications industry over the past decade. Skinner will play a pioneering role in managing the transition to deregulation in the US electricity industry.

It is the first review into the cost of supplying electricity since the regional distribution companies of England and Wales were privatised nearly two years ago. It comes at a time when consumers have been complaining about rising electricity prices and what are seen as excessive profits made by the regional companies. The review will be 'searching and thorough', Prof Littlechild said. 'My main aims are to secure a good deal for customers and promote more effective competition, whilst ensuring that companies can finance their licensed activities and have an incentive to purchase electricity efficiently.' The review will lead to a new price regime to be introduced in April 1994. The regional companies will be able to challenge the new regime with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Supply costs account for about 5 per cent of electricity bills. There will be a later review of prices charged for distributing electricity, for implementation in April 1995. Those prices account for about 24 per cent electricity bills. Questions listed in a consultation paper include: should controls cover sales to all customers or only those who do not have the benefit of competition among their suppliers? Prof Littlechild is seeking comments by December. Electricity prices are governed at present by a formula that is intended to keep increases below the rate of inflation. The regional companies have come under fire over profit levels and one, Seeboard, has voluntarily given a rebate to customers. The Major Energy Users Council, which represents industrial electricity users, has also mounted a campaign for tighter price controls.  The Financial Times   London Page 14  "

Public utilities are being forced to produce power more cleanly and efficiently, and to clean up their commercial act by giving up their cosy monopoly status      By MICHAEL SMITH   EUROPE'S power companies are coming under increasing, and probably unstoppable, pressure to compete. They are also having to manage their businesses under unprecedented public scrutiny. Europe's growing population not only wants its utility companies to provide better services but also wants a bigger role in decisions affecting that provision. Later this year France will engage in a public debate on energy. Germany is already in search of a political consensus on nuclear power which, once attained, will have profound implications for the future of coal. The UK government, having hurriedly produced a coal review after a public outcry over mines closures, will launch a nuclear review later this year. In these debates, and others going on throughout Europe, environmental considerations will play a far larger role than they would have done in previous decades. The Rio de Janeiro earth summit last year set a series of targets which are forcing countries and their electricity companies to re-think the balance of fuels which go into the electricity market, with gas playing an increasing role and coal facing inexorable decline. To help cope with all these changes, electricity companies cannot rely on the large volume growth that has sustained them in previous decades. In east Europe demand is depressed by the closure of uneconomic industries and expected growth in consumer consumption will have to await economic recovery. Western Europe can look forward to only limited growth. According to the International Energy Agency, an arm of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, electricity growth in industrialised countries is likely to be around 2 to 2.6 per cent a year for the rest of the decade. Faced with stagnant markets in their own countries, companies are looking abroad. In Britain, where the most significant progress towards liberalisation has been achieved, electricity companies plan significant expansion outside their national boundaries. National Power plans to invest Pounds 1bn abroad by the end of the century. PowerGen is part of a consortium which is close to winning a contract to build a 400 megawatt power station in east Germany. In other examples of trans-European investment, RWE, the German utility, in May bought a 4 per cent stake in Endesa, the Spanish company which had previously bought 2 per cent of its shares. Last year Tractebel of Belgium bought a 3 per cent stake in Iberdrola, Spain's second largest electricity company. The aim is for joint ventures and pooling research resources, rather than mergers. Nonetheless such alliances are likely to grow as the European electricity market is opened up for greater competition and provides greater opportunities for investment. The pressure to liberalise comes from an alliance of politicians and large industrial companies who no longer see the production of electricity as a natural monopoly and who believe that more competition can result in lower prices. Although its more radical measures are fervently resisted in some countries, it is strongly backed by the European Commission. Trade in electricity between European countries already exists and indeed has grown to about 10 per cent of the total in recent years. But it is invariably between one state and another. Electricity companies which want to sell power to industrial companies in another country find it virtually impossible. Those pressing for liberalisation say the barriers are erected by monopolies, to protect their markets. The industry says it is a special case. Unlike virtually all other commodities, electricity cannot be stored. This, together with its strategic importance for each country, makes it unsuitable for the normal laws of the market which other industries have to face, say the producers. The main issue which divides the community is 'third party access', a means of giving companies a right to the use of another country's electricity network to sell to industrial companies. Opposition from utilities, backed by their governments, has forced the Commission to reconsider earlier plans. It is considering measures which would force companies to justify why they refuse another company access. Meanwhile, the debate appears to have softened the attitude of virtually all the players. France, whose Electricite de France is the most obvious monopoly, is likely to consider in its energy review this year whether liberalisation steps should be adopted. But liberalisation is by no means confined to the European Community. Norway three years ago introduced market reforms which allowed electricity consumers to buy directly from producers and which made it more difficult for municipalities to use their electricity interests to finance other activities. Prices have fallen since. In Finland, measures have been adopted to ensure that Ivo, a state-owned company which makes about 40 per cent of the country's electricity, does not cross-subsidise its generating and engineering businesses from the grid system which it owns. Ivo hopes to be privatised in the next few years, in part so that it will be able, with private capital behind it, to play a larger part in the European electricity market. Attempts to throw off state shackles are also being made in countries previously dominated by the Soviet Union. Russia is looking at allowing private sector, including foreign, funds to help build the electricity sector. The Czech Republic has already decided it needs foreign aid to develop its industry. CEZ, the dominant Czech producer which was partially privatised through the sale of 30 per cent of its capital last year, estimates it needs to invest Dollars 5.7bn in the next few years, and can only do so if foreign funds are tapped. Although investment in new plant accounts for much of the total, about Dollars 1.9bn is needed to pay for air pollution equipment demanded by stricter environmental laws. This highlights a problem for all electricity companies, particularly those with a high coal burn. Environmental problems are most acute in east Europe, where governments and companies are having to cope with years of neglect by their predecessors. Enormous question marks hang over the safety of nuclear power stations built with Soviet technology; and big bills are accruing on the mess caused by the failure to clean up after opencast mining, particularly of lignite coal. The cost of cleaning up after lignite mines in east Germany, for example, is about DM30bn. This consideration, together with problems over sulphur and carbon dioxide emissions, is behind a move away from coal in some European countries, notably the UK. In the UK the move is helped by plentiful supplies of gas. Other countries are less fortunate. States formerly in the political shadow of the Soviet Union are reluctant to commit themselves to gas imported from Russia, because they want to loosen their ties with that country and because of fears about its political instability. It was partly for that reason that the Czech Republic this year chose to go ahead with building a second nuclear plant in spite of public fears following the Chernobyl accident. Other countries, including Germany and Spain, will not even allow some of their already constructed nuclear plants to make electricity, let alone build new ones.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

The energy secretary said that if any of the regional companies were found to be buying electricity above market prices, they would be investigated by the electricity watchdog, Offer. The committee meeting, which was considering the consequences of electricity privatisation, asked Mr Wakeham whether the many new gas-fired power stations being built would really create more competition. Because the regional electricity companies have equity stakes in many of the new projects, suggested committee member Mr Peter Rost (C Erewash), they might take their power at above market prices and then pass the cost on to captive domestic consumers. Mr Wakeham said the regional companies could not do that without breaking their licences, which oblige them to buy power economically. British Coal, he pointed out, had told an earlier meeting of the committee that the new stations would produce power at 2.9p a unit, compared with the 2.2p cost of power from existing coal-fired stations. If that were true, Mr Wakeham said, then Offer would have to investigate the regional companies. However, several regional electricity companies yesterday rejected British Coal's figures, and the implication that their gas projects were uncompetitive. 'It's utter rubbish,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity, which has a stake in the big gas-fired station being built on Teesside. His company's power purchasing policy was not influenced by its investment in gas stations, he said. Those stations would be more likely to produce power at about 2.4p than 2.9p, while British Coal's 2.2p figure was unrecognisably low.  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "

Prof Littlechild raised these possibilities yesterday as he announced the results of a preliminary inquiry into why selling prices in the wholesale electricity pool have risen by 20 per cent this year. He indicated these could be alternatives to referring National Power and PowerGen to the Monopolies Commission if he found that they had increased the prices they charge to the electricity wholesale pool excessively. They would be preferable to profit controls, he said. Prof Littlechild said the many electricity customers who had complained about the pool price rises were right to be concerned. 'In a competitive market, customers' interests would be paramount. This is not yet the case in the electricity market.' The generators received average pool revenues which exceeded their avoidable costs. 'The need to cover avoidable costs does not justify any further price increases. Nor did it justify an increase as high as the recent one (since April). 'Customers assert that prices would be lower in a more competitive market. The generators could counter these assertions by competing more aggressively on the pool price.' Prof Littlechild said the electricity pool should base prices on both demand and supply. One suggestion is that demand side bidding be introduced, whereby consumers could be paid if they agreed to stop taking electricity when prices rose to a certain level. The regulator said that the pool should also look closely at rules under which generators are compensated if plant is constrained off the system by the National Grid, which operates it. Prof Littlechild is also asking the pool and the National Grid to consider a 'more appropriate division of responsibilities' for transmission and administration costs. Many of the costs were simply passed on to the customer. They could be met by the grid taking wider responsibility and recovering money through charges. Existing arrangements did not provide enough incentive to cut costs, he said. Alternatively some of the costs could be dealt with by the pool rather than the grid. Pool Price Statement, July 1993.

0,FT944-1301 ,"FT944-1301 _AN-ELUC8ABWFT 941221   FT  21 DEC 94 / Electricity from renewable sources to double      By HAIG SIMONIAN, Environment Correspondent   The government yesterday gave the go-ahead to the doubling of the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources of energy such as wind and waste. More than 500 candidates bid for funding in the third and biggest round of subsidies for renewable energy projects. The subsidies - the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation - in the form of a levy on electricity bills, are designed to encourage the development of renewable energy sources which are still more expensive than conventionally generated electricity. However, average prices in the latest round were lower than in the past, reflecting technological advances and growing experience. The average price for a unit of electricity from large wind farms dropped by more than half to 4.32p per kWh. Power is sold into the wholesale electricity 'pool' by PowerGen and National Power at the average price of about 2.5p per kWh. More than 140 bids to generate almost 630MW of electricity in England and Wales received final approval. In Scotland, 30 proposals to generate 76MW were approved - about double the government's original estimate. However, the proposals still require local planning consent. Assuming that not all bids succeed, the government estimated that the third round should increase the total amount of electricity generated by renewable sources in England and Wales by 300MW-400MW from 340MW. The government said it would announce a fourth round of subsidies next year as a further step to reach its aim of generating 1,500MW of electricity from renewables by 2000. The policy of encouraging renewable sources forms part of the UK's plan to meet its 1992 Rio Earth Summit commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. It is also designed to stimulate renewable energy industries. The government's announcement was welcomed by wind power generators, which had feared a backlash after recent adverse publicity about the damage to the landscape from wind installations. Similar anxieties had been voiced by waste power supporters after recent allegations that incinerators emitted toxic gases. In the event, bids from both technologies were highly successful, with approval for 31 wind projects and 20 waste schemes in England and Wales. Triodosbank, a Netherlands-based bank, announced it would next month launch a wind fund through Mercury Provident, its UK partner, to invest in the wind power industry. The fund, which is similar to a scheme already in existence in the Netherlands, hopes to raise Pounds 10m from investors.   Companies:-  Triodosbank.     Mercury Provident.

0,FT934-9071 ,"FT934-9071 _AN-DKLCNAB9FT 931112   FT  12 NOV 93 / Watchdog fails to bite: Electrical goods retailing falls outside his power      By DAVID LASCELLES   IF IT achieved nothing else, yesterday's report from Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, highlighted the huge size of the electricity companies' losses on their high-street retailing operations - a total of Pounds 105m over the last three years. But will it do anything to shake up the intensely competitive electrical and electronic goods market? Neither the electricity regulator nor the Office of Fair Trading - which also looked into Dixons' allegations - found any evidence to support its claim that the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales had engaged in unfair cross-subsidisation of their retail businesses, or in anti-competitive practices. Dixons had charged that regional electricity companies helped their electrical goods retailers in a variety of ways, for example, by bearing part of their advertising and marketing costs, providing cheap accommodation, providing capital at no charge, and joint billing services. This help enabled them to increase market share by 2 percentage points to around 13 per cent, Dixons said. Most of Prof Littlechild's recommendations for clearer and more consistent accounting treatment of retailing operations have already been adopted by several companies. And there is little more that he can do. These are non-core businesses outside his direct control. He can only ensure that these losses do not harm the regulated side of the business, which delivers electricity to people's homes, and that the companies comply with the law, for example by not using a householder's bill-paying record to make decisions on advancing credit on purchases from showrooms. But if yesterday's reports do not raise wider issues, they could have an impact by turning the spotlight on the companies difficulties in the high street. This might hasten the retreat many are already beating from the retailing market. For example, Prof Littlechild's report looks beyond the profit-and-loss account to comment that the companies' returns on capital employed have been, on average, negative, and in all cases low by the standards proposed by Dixons. But he also points out that the losses the companies are making in this business are at the expense of the shareholder, not the electricity consumer, who is protected by the official price tariff. 'Whether it is commercially sensible to incur such losses is a matter for shareholders,' he says. Only one company, Norweb, could be described as on a strongly expansionary course in retailing. London Electricity and Swalec in south Wales, have pulled out of the business, and others have decided to join forces rather than continue on their own. For example, Eastern, Southern and Midlands have formed ES Retail. A small number are still operating on their own, for example Seeboard, which has opted for building superstores. However, Mr John Weight, the director responsible for retailing, stressed yesterday that expansion was 'measured and controlled'. Some companies have also indicated that they are only prepared to remain in the business for a limited period because of the intensity of competition, and the difficulty of getting costs down. Mr Nick Pink, an analyst who follows the electricity companies at Warburg Securities, said yesterday: 'They've put the baby in the deep end to see if it can swim, and if it can't they'll have to let it drown.' Part of the difficulty the companies face in deciding what to do about lossmaking retail activities is that shutting down such a labour-intensive operation leads to a huge redundancy bill. When London Electricity sold out earlier this year, it took a Pounds 20m charge to cover this expense. Shareholders will also be able to make more informed judgments about the retailing activities because more of them will be publishing detailed results. This is not because of an agreement with the regulator, but because more of the companies now have these operations in separate subsidiaries or in jointly owned companies which produce their own sets of accounts. The presence of the electricity distributors in the retail market is a British phenomenon. French and German power companies, for example, do not have a high-street presence. But the UK regulatory framework gives electricity companies an incentive to sell as much electricity as possible, and they therefore see appliance sales as a useful way of boosting revenues.

Less than five years after the sell-off, the power generators and distributors have been so effective at improving their financial performance that their profits have turned into something of an embarrassment. The review of electricity prices which Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is now conducting provides the opportunity to strike a better balance in the way the benefits of privatisation are distributed. So far, these gains have accrued largely to shareholders (not to mention the industry's highly-paid senior executives). Unlike the gas industry, electricity has delivered price increases not cuts since privatisation. Prof Littlechild appears to share this view. His opening shot in the negotiations on the new price formula suggests that he intends to take a tough approach. He wants to tighten the price formula so that increases fall well below the rate of inflation, and he wants to put downward pressure on rates of return. Although the electricity companies will fight back, possibly even to the extent of referring the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Prof Littlechild should stick to his guns, for a number of reasons. One is that his own credibility as a regulator is at stake. He has been accused, with some justification, of taking a softer line on the industry than is required, preferring to go for elegant and sometimes opaque solutions to price regulation rather than the cruder shock therapy deployed by some other regulators. Another reason is that the electricity industry has seen this review coming for a long time - years, in fact - and has taken care to build up enough fat to endure a tougher price regime. Unlike the water industry, which faces huge investments to comply with EU water standards, the electricity distribution business does not have a heavy capital expenditure programme. Having said that, however, this review is not merely about squeezing overweight electricity companies. It raises important and difficult issues about the appropriate rates of return which a heavily capitalised industry should be allowed to earn on its assets. It will also address highly technical questions about how those assets should be valued so that investors obtain a fair return. Much of the debate during the coming weeks will therefore be rather arcane. But the aim of the review should be clear: to demonstrate in a well-argued fashion that regulation can provide an adequate substitute for market forces in a monopoly industry. If the decisions of regulators are to carry public support, it is essential that they be reached in a transparent fashion. At the end of the day, investors and consumers alike must feel that a fair bargain has been struck.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The study says that plant material, or biomass, 'may be on the threshold of a new breakthrough, as a fuel for advanced forms of electricity generation'. According to the US Department of Energy, biomass power will be the most important renewable energy option for the next 25 years. Projects cultivating crops for electricity and developing power plants are under way in Brazil, Scandinavia and parts of the European Union, as well as the US. The greatest potential will come from 'integrated' development of the fuel, using dedicated energy crops serving advanced-technology power stations, says the study. Financial and organisational support is emerging, 'but the potential of integrated advanced biomass power appears to warrant much more substantial promotional effort at the governmental and international level in the near future in both industrial and developing countries'. Fast-growing poplar, willow and conifer trees and miscanthus, or elephant grass, are considered promising for electricity production in northern Europe, while robinia, cynara and eucalyptus trees and sweet sorghum appear to have more potential in warmer southern Europe. Sugar cane, along with pine and eucalyptus, is suitable in the tropics and sub-tropics, although it needs heavy irrigation which sweet sorghum does not. Unlike coal, the energy from biomass makes no net contribution to the greenhouse effect and as such offers an attractive alternative, says the report, written by Mr Walt Patterson, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House institute. In the long run, biomass power will have the greatest impact in tropical and sub-tropical countries where it grows fastest and where electricity demand is increasing most rapidly. The World Energy Council has projected a doubling in world electricity use to 23,000 terawatt-hours in 2020 from 11,600TWh in 1990. But the study suggests that a more immediate boost to biomass power could come from growing crops for electricity in industrial countries on land set aside to cut overproduction. 'This use of cultivated land no longer required for food production would ease the pressure on the agricultural sectors of major producer countries, and make international agreement on food trade more readily achievable,' it argues. Estimates on the costs of biomass electricity compared with conventionally-produced power are encouraging, the report says. Demonstrating that it can be economically and environmentally sustainable in the industrial world will foster its acceptance worldwide.

The bank's loans to central government power projects remain unaffected. The southern Indian state of Karnataka, which suffers acute power shortages, will be worst affected by the World Bank's decision. Mr Veerappa Moily, the state's chief minister, failed to convince senior management of the bank in Washington that it should lend the state the Dollars 250m-Dollars 300m it had asked for. Mr Heinz Vergin, the World Bank's director in charge of India, said that they had 'every intention to restart a relationship with Karnataka', provided the state institution in charge of power generation and distribution became financially viable. Mr Vergin made his comments when announcing approval of Dollars 168m of World Bank loans to help India tackle pollution in key industries. World Bank officials have repeatedly expressed their concern about mismanagement in state electricity boards. Many of these boards have gone bankrupt because they have failed to collect dues, have provided electricity at prices lower than cost, and have ignored large-scale electricity thefts. The bank, in its annual country report released in May, urged the need for restructuring the power sector in the states. Several large power projects, like Enron US's 2015MW project in Dhabol, Maharashtra, have yet to reach the implementation stage because they have found it financially unviable to deal with crisis-ridden state electricity boards. The government, which liberalised the power sector two years ago, has received nearly 75 proposals, amounting to Rs20bn (Pounds 414m), for more than 32,000MW of generation capacity, half India's existing installed capacity. International investors have been asking the central government for counter-guarantees, which the government has so far been unable to provide, because the state governments are unwilling to take the hard political decisions needed to make their electricity boards viable. The World Bank has recommended the Indian government extend its reform process to the states. Mr NK Salve, India's power minister, said the bank's decision had not come as a surprise to the ministry, which now has a stronger case to urge that state electricity boards improve their finances. But he added that central government could not let down the states, and his ministry was aware of the responsibility to them, especially when most were facing a 'dangerously suicidal situation' on the power front.

The group said yesterday that the majority of its members, which include large industrial users of electricity, trade unions and coalfield communities, had decided to apply for a judicial review. This follows Prof Littlechild's rejection of charges by Coffer that he had failed to ensure that electricity distribution companies were fulfilling their obligation to buy the cheapest possible electricity. The decision was taken at a meeting last Friday. However the Major Energy Users Council, which represents some of the UK's largest industrial companies, was not present and will not decide whether to back the move until a meeting of its executive committee on October 13. The council said last night that no implications should be read into the delay. Coffer maintains that new gas-fired stations being built by the electricity companies to supply part of their needs do not produce the most economical electricity. Prof Littlechild told Coffer in a letter two weeks ago that he was already reviewing the economic purchasing obligations, but Coffer said yesterday that this reply was unsatisfactory. Mr Roger Lyons, chairman of the Trades Union Congress energy committee, said: 'The gas-fired power station programme will mean intolerable increases in electricity prices for all electricity consumers - domestic, small business and industry. What British industry really needs is the cheap energy that is already being provided by our large, efficient coal-fired plant using British deep-mined coal.' Offer, the electricity regulation office, said: 'Our position remains as it was in Prof Littlechild's letter.' UK electricity consumers received better service from their electricity companies last year, according to Offer. In its latest report on the reliability of electricity distribution, Offer gives figures for the number of supply interruptions and the time taken to correct them for each of the 12 distribution companies in England and Wales and the two power companies in Scotland. These show that London Electricity had the lowest number of interruptions per 100 customers, followed by Norweb. The poorest service was given by South Wales Electricity, but Offer notes that this company was engaged in major works which involved planned interruptions.

Mr Eggar, speaking during a visit to Rufford and Ollerton collieries in Nottinghamshire, said it was vital that consumers were given the benefit of any deal between the electricity producers and British Coal. He was confident British Coal would be able to produce coal at prices that would benefit electricity consumers. 'The challenge that faces this and other pits is to reduce their costs to produce coal competitively,' he added. 'It is a challenge I am convinced British Coal can meet.' Mr Eggar said it was important for British Coal to be privatised without delay. This meant that it must agree contracts to sell coal to the electricity industry as soon as possible. These contracts would determine how many British Coal pits would survive, Mr Eggar added. He would not confirm rumours that the government was about to negotiate an agreement between British Coal and the electricity industry. He saw a role for the government as a 'facilitator'. The government, British Gas, the regulatory body Ofgas and 11 of the regional electricity companies in England and Wales are to set up an independent Energy Savings Trust to promote the efficient use of energy, Andrew Slade writes. The initiative promised in the Conservatives' general election manifesto was announced yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary.

Mr Nigel Lucas, professor of Energy Policy at Imperial College in London, said on BBC Television: 'By buying gas-fired electricity from the independent power producers, the regional electricity companies are probably paying up to 50 per cent more than the price of electricity which might be available to them from existing coal-fired stations.' Mr Malcolm Faulkner, North West Electricity Board's marketing director, also speaking on BBC Television, accepted that coal was cheaper in the short term, but said: 'We are in fact not comparing like with like.

0,FT933-2955 ,"FT933-2955 _AN-DIPCOAC4FT 930916   FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (8): An exclusive club - Pressures on regional power suppliers      By SARA KNIGHT   THE RUHR region boasts the headquarters of two leading electricity utilities, RWE Energie in Essen and VEW in Dortmund. Both companies belong to an exclusive club for utilities owning the high voltage grid, the Deutsche Verbundgesellschaft. RWE Energie is the most powerful of the nine club members, with a high voltage grid four times the length of VEW's. RWE was founded in Essen in the heart of the Ruhr region in 1898 by Hugo Stinnes, the famous industrialist known to competitors as 'the black-bearded Assyrian,' who emerged after World War I as Germany's 'Business Kaiser,' controlling coal mines, steel mills, banks, newspapers, hotels, shipping lines - and electrical plants. RWE, partially communally-owned, steadily expanded and evolved over the decades to become Germany's largest electricity utility. In 1990, the company was restructured to form the RWE Holding in which utility RWE Energie constitutes just one of six sectors. The other big electricity utility in the Ruhr was set up in the 1920s: the Vereinigte Elektrizitaetswerke Westfalen (VEW), based in Dortmund. VEW was formed by the fusion of several communally owned regional supply companies. Shortly afterwards, VEW and RWE signed an 'electro-peace treaty' - a demarcation contract - agreeing not to trespass upon each others' territory. Such contracts, allowed as exceptions under German competition law, now exist between all nine 'Verbund' utilities. Today, VEW is west Germany's fourth largest utility in terms of electricity sales. It has rapidly expanding gas distribution and waste disposal sectors. Both RWE and VEW are partly publicly owned, with anachronistic multiple voting rights giving the communal shareholders an influence disproportionately large in view of their minority capital shares. With electricity sales falling - VEW sales were down 1.6 oer cent in 1992, RWE-Energie sales down by 3 per cent in 1992-93 - the utilities have a growth problem. Potential in east Germany and eastern Europe exists, but it is developing very slowly. Strong talk by the European Commission and the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) over the introduction of more competition in the electricity sector have added impetus to a trend in which smaller utilities seek to hitch themselves up with larger ones. The 'minnows' hope that if and when the free-for-all for electricity customers begins, this overlapping of interests will prevent the large utilities from snapping up all their lucrative customers. The pattern does not stop here - even the larger utilities are consolidating their positions. And the FCO in Berlin appears to have only limited power to stop this trend. A warning came from the chairman of RWE, Dr. Friedhelm Gieske this April: 'Competition within the energy sectors, bound by cable or pipeline transmission, will inevitably lead to concentration so that the large companies will become ever bigger. This would ultimately help us, but would be a political mistake and therefore is not something we want.' Recent developments in the Ruhr illustrate the creeping concentration in the electricity sector. The city of Dortmund has a concession contract, expiring in 1994, under which VEW is its exclusive electricity supplier. Initially, the Dortmund municipal Stadtwerke dreamed of taking over the city electricity supply. However, sobered by VEW's demands for a payment of around DM1bn for the Dortmund transmission grid, the Stadtwerke agreed to a compromise. VEW and the Stadtwerke will found a joint supply company, Dortmunder Energie und Wasserverorgung (DEW) for the electricity, gas, district heating and water supply to the city. The FCO has approved the deal but imposed two conditions. First, the contract is valid for only 20 years. Second, VEW is not allowed to use its minority voting rights to influence Stadtwerke Dortmund decisions over the source of DEW electricity supplies. In fact, the choice of supplier is very limited anyway. The only alternative to VEW is the regional utility Elektromark, in Hagen. And the Stadtwerke has already decided to continue taking electricity from VEW. The FCO's attempt to preserve an element of competition is weak. Observers wonder if Dortmund is likely to change suppliers after 20 years of co-operating with VEW - and if Elektromark still be around in 20 years, in any case. Elektromark's supervisory and executive boards have strongly recommended linking up with RWE Energie and VEW by selling each of them a 10 per cent block of shares. The link with RWE-Energie is designed to intensify co-operation in the electricity sector, the connection with VEW serving links in the waste disposal sector. Elektromark is also selling its 300MW share in the Emsland nuclear power station in equal shares to RWE-Energie and second largest German utility, Preussenelektra, to the discomfort of VEW which owns the other 75 per cent. Such manoeuvres are by no means limited to the Ruhr. Elsewhere in Germany the larger utilities are also consolidating their positions. The Bavarian Bayernwerk is moving rapidly closer to a merger with the Viag Group. IN Baden-Wuerttemberg, utilities Badenwerk and Energie-Versorgung Schwaben have been permitted by the FCO to merge on the grounds that there was no competition between the two anyway. Other smaller electricity companies want to join, too. They fear that if the electricity sector were liberalised there would otherwise be little to stop Badenwerk/EVS taking their best customers. Hannover has decided to sell 40 per cent of its municipal utility. Twenty per cent goes to German gas giant, Ruhrgas, also based in Essen. Thuega, a subsidiary of the giant Veba which also owns utility Preussenelektra, is taking the other 20 per cent. The link with Thuega could help stave off potential future threats from Preussenelektra to win the Hannover utility's big customers, such as Volkswagen and Continental. In the Ruhr, the FCO would undoubtedly fight hard to prevent a VEW merger with another utility. But as VEW slips down the pecking order of 'Verbund' companies and is sandwiched between the supply areas of RWE and Preussenelektra, observers wonder how long will it be before it, too, decides the electricity business is best carried out 'in co-operation' with a stronger partner.

0,FT931-10399 ,"FT931-10399 _AN-DBICOAC3FT 930209   FT  09 FEB 93 / Pits rescue may hinge on power deal: Government favours subsidising coal Go-ahead likely for electricity market reforms      By MICHAEL SMITH   THE GOVERNMENT is expected to reject proposals to delay reforms of the electricity industry as a way of expanding the market for coal in order to save threatened pits. Postponing plans for more electricity market competition from next year was proposed in a cross-party Commons committee report to rescue at least a dozen of the 31 pits facing closure. Instead, the government favours an alternative pit rescue plan. This would involve the two largest electricity generators for England and Wales buying larger amounts of British-produced coal at subsidised prices even though there would be no guaranteed market for it. In return for asking the generators to buy up to 60m tonnes of coal over five years, the government would offer subsidies of up to Pounds 10 a tonne. This would bridge the gap between cheaper imported coal and the domestic product. It could cost up to Pounds 150m in the first year but far less later. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, who have been reviewing the controversial pit closure plan, are keen not to slow the impetus of electricity privatisation. Although slowing the pace of liberalisation could return to the agenda, a deal on extra tonnage with the generators is thought likely. The generators are, however, believed to be balking at the possible amounts. On top of the 40m tonnes next year and 30m in the subsequent four years which the generators have already tentatively agreed to buy, the government is thought to be pressing for them to take an extra 60m tonnes over the five years. This would save about 10 of the 31 threatened pits, initially at least. Talks with the generators are unlikely to produce a deal to provide all the tonnage needed to persuade MPs to support a government plan. However, a successful outcome would make a delay in market liberalisation unnecessary. Under the liberalisation plans, regional electricity companies (Recs) would be forced to compete from April for the custom of about 50,000 of the largest customers in England and Wales. Competition is currently restricted to the 5,000 largest customers in the country who use 1 megawatt of electricity in any half-hour; under the liberalisation plans the threshold would be lowered to 100 kilowatts. Expanding the competitive market would, however, make the Recs less sure about future markets and this is one reason they have been reluctant to buy as much coal-fired power as in the past. Delaying liberalisation would be a way of expanding the coal market and saving some pits designated for closure. However, Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity regulator, has advised the government against adopting this course. A final decision on liberalisation will not be taken until the government succeeds or fails to negotiate a deal with the generators to buy extra coal. The white paper on coal is expected this month, possibly next week. Gas prices freeze, Page 18   Countries:-  UnZited Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

Portal held a news conference during which he referred to  the  causes for the abrupt increase in the number of power outages in  Havana, where electricity was available for only four hours in  most neighborhoods this Tuesday.    The situation is even worse in the countryside, especially  because the available electricity is used for harvesting sugar  cane (from December to April) on a priority basis. According to  Vice President Carlos Lage, this activity will continue until  May of this year.    Portal explained that a lack of foreign financing and  technological dependency on the former Socialist bloc -- most of  the country's electric plants came from the former Soviet Union  and Czechoslovakia -- have led to a serious delay in the  national electricity network's maintenance schedule.    As of 1989, the plants were able to generate power at  80-percent efficiency with the remaining 20 percent out of  service due to damage or for technical maintenance, which is  normal compared to international practices, the minister stated.    The minister added that the country used to work with  reserve  stations, but that option is no longer available to us.    Up to May 1993, the industry was able to maintain a certain  level of response to growing demand, Portal said, adding that  the mechanical condition of the plants deteriorated during July  and August.    On the positive side, Marcos Portal announced that 900,000  tons of the 2.6 million tons of oil required to generate  electricity the previous year was national crude oil, which  allowed the country to save its meager convertible foreign  exchange.    Due in part to greater availability of domestic crude oil  and  the foreign credits that have been obtained, Cuba will be able  to allocate resources for the repair of thermonuclear plants and  reach the second half of 1994 operating at 50 to 60 percent of  capacity, the basic industry minister stated.    This would allow us, Portal said, to significantly reduce  power outages during the day, but we would have to continue them  at night, when the most electricity is used.     "

Since electricity privatisation, virtually all electricity in England and Wales has had to be sold through a pool, or wholesale market, which then results in a higher price to cover administration and other 'uplift' costs. Until this decision on uplift charges by the pool executive committee, ICI would have been liable to pay Pounds 1.5m a year to the pool on top of what it will pay to the consortium that operates the power plant, which is on land owned by ICI. ICI said it was too early to say what the effects would be on talks to bypass the pool at its Runcorn chlorine plant. The situation there is different because the potential supplier, PowerGen, would be physically separate from the plant and electricity would have to be supplied through equipment owned by a regional electricity company. South Wales Electricity is to reduce tariffs for more than 900,000 customers for the second time in six months. Domestic customers paying quarterly will see a 1 percentage reduction in bills. Electricity prices for 3m Eastern Electricity customers are to be held at 1992 prices for a year from April.

Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, has also signalled that, as part of a shake-up of supply price controls, it will allow recs more flexibility in their dealings with large companies. Offer's latest thinking is outlined in a memorandum to the regional electricity companies as a review of electricity supply controls gets under way in readiness for change in April next year. It will be welcomed by most regional companies, which will argue that Offer's approach will enable them to tailor contracts more to customers' requirements - for example, by providing long-term contracts at higher prices to the benefit of some buyers. Large customers, some of which have faced steep price rises since privatisation of the electricity industry three years ago, will be concerned it could lead to further increases. In the memorandum to regional companies, Offer says it attaches great importance to putting pressure for efficient purchasing on them. It believes 'this can best be achieved by restricting the scope of price control to the franchise market'. The franchise market, where regional companies have a monopoly in the areas they distribute electricity, is restricted to customers who use less than 1MW of electricity in any half-hour period. From April 1994 the threshold will fall to 100kw. Offer says regional companies would be exposed to the 'full pressure of competition in the non-franchise market without the inevitable complications which price control brings'. For the franchise market, Offer proposes a yardstick approach under which a measure would be made of average costs of units supplied in England and Wales, excluding those covered by coal contracts signed in current negotiations. The franchise market yardstick would 'both provide a published source of information and act as a trigger for further inquiry on economic purchasing should an individual rec's (regional company) costs exceed the yardstick by a certain amount'. This suggests that contracts for gas between regional companies and the independent power projects, in which many have equity stakes, will be scrutinised further in spite of the regulator's recent endorsement of the 'dash for gas'. Nevertheless, the yardstick approach outlined by Offer is considerably less formal than other possibilities though to be under consideration. Under present rules, the price of electricity supplied to all customers can rise only by the level of inflation.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

At a meeting of the Major Energy Users Council (Meuc), which has lobbied fiercely for lower electricity prices, Mr Baker defended National Power's pricing, but said that he recognised the problems that large consumers faced. He put forward specific proposals for keeping prices down: Large consumers should refuse to subsidise coal through the electricity price, and should be vigilant about the nuclear levy, which typically added 11 per cent to bills. They should watch how much they were charged by regional electricity companies for using electricity wires, since rates of return in that business were far higher than anything generators earned. They should also press for cuts in metering charges, which form a big chunk of their bill. Mr Baker said it was important to deregulate the market as quickly as possible, and to axe existing limits on how much power generators could sell, so customers could shop around more, he said. Consumers should also press for a more open market in electricity contracts, he advised. Most electricity is sold on contract, but so far the pool or wholesale market has been the focus of attention. He said that customers should also think hard about why so many new gas-fired power stations were being built, forcing out cheaper coal-fired stations. Because these new stations have contracts which allow them to pass costs on to captive domestic consumers, he implied, they can force out coal stations, pushing up prices for larger consumers. Mr Baker pointed out that most industrialists complained that high UK electricity prices made them uncompetitive in Europe. If this was so, he said, they should challenge subsidised European prices in Brussels. 'But I detect a note of reluctance from many of you who are recipients of these prices in Europe,' he said.

Last week, the executive committee of the Public Electricity  Corporation [DEH] discussed the project to connect the  electricity grids of Greece and Turkey, and decided to initiate  procedures with a view to signing the relevant agreement with  Turkey. One of the government's main arguments for the necessity  of this connection is that it will create an energy axis linking  Turkey, Greece, and Italy, in which our country will occupy a  central position. The connection between Greece and Italy will  be accomplished by an underwater cable whose construction has  already begun.    Because Italy is in need of large supplies of electricity  and  Turkey has considerable quantities of it available for export,  such an energy axis could be of great advantage to Greece. For  obvious reasons, nevertheless, Turkey does not wish to let its  Western exports be dependent on an intervening Greek network,  and is therefore pursuing the construction of an alternative  route which will link Turkey with Italy by going through  Bulgaria, Skopje, and Albania. (The agreement about this  connection between Italy and Albania -- which is to be  accomplished by underwater cable between the two countries --  has already been signed.) By means of such a northern energy  route, designed to link Turkey to the West and to the Balkan  countries in-between, Greece is deprived of its advantage.    Connecting the electricity grid of Greece to that of Turkey,  however, will have yet another, graver, repercussion. Given the  fact that our country is now facing a shortage of electric  energy and that this shortage is expected to keep growing until  at least 1998, the Turkish hookup will make us dependent on our  neighbor for energy. That means that the exclusive function of  the hookup will be to export Turkish electricity to Greece for  Greek consumption only, under terms -- as indicated by talks  between DEH and TEK [the Turkish electric company] -- very  unfavorable for Greece. During a meeting of representatives of  the two electric companies which took place in Athens on  February 23-24, TEK asked DEH to pay 6.265 cents for each  kilowatt-hour of imported electricity. This is almost twice the  present cost of 3.46 cents per kwhr produced by the large  oil-fired generating unit that DEH is currently using. The cost  of energy produced by large-capacity lignite coal units is even  lower than that. Of course, DEH has not yet made known its final  decision regarding the asking price, as this is scheduled to be  discussed at the next meeting of the representatives of the two  companies next month.    In any case, the bargaining position of DEH does not inspire  one with confidence. It is currently within TEK's discretion to  offer our country electricity at high prices because, on the one  hand, Greece faces serious difficulties in being supplied by  either the Yugoslav or the Bulgarian network and, on the other,  it has been too slow to install new electric generating  facilities with which to meet its steadily rising electricity  needs. During their meeting with representatives of TEK last  February, the representatives of DEH negotiated imports of  electric energy from Turkey equivalent to the output of one  generating plant of 180 mw capacity, functioning continuously  with lowered rates at night.    Through the connection of the two networks, therefore,  Turkey  achieves two objectives: In the first place, it makes our  country, and more especially the nationally sensitive region of  Thrace, dependent on Turkey for electricity. It is an undisputed  fact that the supplies of electricity from Turkey will be  channelled to Thrace, first because this border region does not  possess even a single electricity-producing unit, and second,  because any attempt to circulate imported electricity through  the entire extent of the Greek network would be financially  ill-advised. Even now, all the electricity imported from  Bulgaria is used exclusively by Thrace.    In the second place, it coerces Greece to pay excessively  high prices before it can satisfy urgent and extensive  electricity needs. In the opinion of some energy experts, the  reason for which Turkey is exacting such prices from Greece is  that it hopes, by so doing, to finance its plan of rendering the  Balkans dependent on itself for energy. The high tariffs it is  proposing to Greece will allow it to depress the prices at which  it can sell electricity to the other Balkan countries (all of  whom are also in urgent need of electricity imports),  facilitating in this manner their economic and political  dependence on Turkey.    The Meetings    Turkey's coercive tactics toward Greece in regard to  electric  energy prices is evident in the way meetings between DEH and TEK  have evolved since 1990. In the first of these meetings  (Constantinople, 8-9 October 1990), there was no discussion of  prices but only of the theoretical rationale for the schedule of  rates, which were to be based on the cost of production per oil  unit (i.e., cost of oil plus operation and maintenance costs).  During the second meeting (Athens, 8-9 November 1990), the Turks  proposed a price of 2.93 cents per kwhr, while DEH countered  with 2.1 cents. At the third meeting (Smyrna, 19-20 December  1990), the two sides agreed on theoretical methods of  determining price, while postponing the practical and precise  determination of basic parameters until a later date. During the  same meeting, it was also mentioned for the first time that the  yearly quantities to be imported by Greece between 1991 and 1994  would be of the order of 1.2 to 1.4 billion kwhr. Two additional  meetings have taken place since: the first before the elections  on 24 September 1993 at Ankara, and the second on February 23-24  in Athens. At this last meeting, TEK representatives proposed  the markedly high price of 6.265 cents for each imported kwhr.    It must be noted that the price Turkey is asking is almost  double not only the production costs of DEH, but also those of  the cost of the notorious BOO facilities which the previous  government had negotiated with private interests. Analyses  conducted by DEH in regard to the offers made for the Lavrion  generating plants led to the conclusion that their production  cost would be between 3.5 and 4.0 cents per kwhr, inclusive of  the investment cost.

Senior officials of the Yunnan power utilities made the  proposal to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand  (EGAT) which rejected it out of hand because the Thai body views  the undertaking as not economically viable.    EGAT's rejection could restrict the southern Chinese  authorities' ambitious plan to develop hydroelectric plants  along the Manwan River (Lan Xan in Thai) which offers a massive  generating potential of 19,000 megawatts (MW).    Yunnan wants to establish Thailand as a major market for its  electricity exports, aside from supplying the power from the  proposed schemes to Canton [as published], the other  economically vibrant southern area. It initially offered to  supply 500 MW to EGAT.    It also aborted the effort by a group of Thai companies  which  had been seeking to play a key part in the investment and  development of those hydroelectric schemes to meet Thailand's  explosive growth in electricity demand, now growing at 10-12  percent a year.    Senior EGAT officials said their rejection was based on two  reasons. First, there was sufficient indigenous power supplies  in northern Thailand generated by EGAT's huge lignite-fired Mae  Moh power complex and therefore, supplies from China would be  redundant.    Secondly, importing and transmitting the Chinese electricity  to central Thailand would be limited by prohibitive costs. The  length of the transmission line involved would be some 1,000 km,  they said.    As far as the importation of electricity from neighbouring  countries is concerned, EGAT appears to give a higher priority  on importing power from Laos and much preparation is underway in  this direction.    Last June, the Thai government through EGAT had signed a  memorandum of understanding with the Lao government for  Vientiane to supply up to 1,500 MW of electricity to the Kingdom  by the turn of the century.    Laos has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with  an international consortium for it to develop a major  hydroelectric project in Laos as part of the June memorandum.    The consortium will invest US$1 billion to develop the Nam  Thuen T1 hydroelectric plant with a generating capacity of 600  MW to be entirely exported to Thailand under terms which have  vet to be agreed upon.

The Commission is backing a system of 'negotiated access' whereby electricity users have to negotiate the use of national networks, rather than having automatic access.

He was entitled to special pension payments under the electricity industry pension scheme and received the share options along with other Midlands executives under the company scheme. All the privatised electricity companies set up option schemes in January 1991 to provide incentives for senior executives. For tax reasons these could not be exercised until the beginning of this year. But since then, dozens of executives have taken advantage of the boom in electricity shares to cash in the options, which give the holder the right to buy shares at prices well below those in the market. Apart from Mr Young, five Midlands Electricity directors bought nearly 600,000 of shares at 258p at a time when the company's shares were trading between 634p and 732p, implying a collective profit on paper of around Pounds 2.5m. Directors at the neighbouring East Midlands Electricity took 770,000 options at prices which will have yielded them a paper profit of at least Pounds 2m. Earlier this year, the company's chairman, Mr John Harris, stepped down and the new management took a Pounds 130m write-off on new business ventures which did not succeed. Yesterday also brought details of options deals at Swalec, the South Wales utility, where Mr Wynford Evans, the chairman, exercised options on 111,510 shares, netting a paper profit of just under Pounds 500,000. Altogether, Swalec directors' paper profits amounted to Pounds 1.1m. A spokesman for Swalec, whose electricity prices are among the country's highest, said the company's good performance had helped boost the share price. But he also stressed that Swalec customers had benefited through price freezes and rebates of Pounds 25 each a year. At Southern Electricity, three directors including Mr Henry Casley, the chief executive, exercised options on 240,000 shares which gave them a paper profit of just over Pounds 1m. Directors usually acquire their share options by taking out a bank loan and selling enough shares to repay the loan.   Companies:-  Midlands Electricity.     Southern Electric.

0,FT934-10025 ,"FT934-10025 _AN-DKHDHAB6FT 931108   FT  08 NOV 93 / Management: The chance to strike it rich - Savings to be made in the second stage of the UK electricity market's deregulation      By MICHAEL SMITH   It is not often that companies get the chance to save thousands of pounds a year. Yet that is the opportunity which will shortly be on offer to managers of a wide range of UK organisations from schools, hospitals and nursing homes to ordinary, medium-sized businesses. On April 1 next year the second stage of the government's deregulation of the electricity market comes into operation. This will enable about 45,000 organisations to shop around between different power suppliers, rather than purchasing exclusively from their regional electricity distributer as they are required to do at the moment. Since electricity privatisation three years ago, the freedom to choose has only been available to managers of sites which use more than 1MW of electricity. There are about 5,000 of these intensive energy users in the country. Contracts already being offered to the others suggest that price cuts of up to 10 per cent are achievable. But at least some of them will suffer as they struggle to get to grips with the complexities of electricity trading. 'People are inevitably going to be bamboozled,' says Ken Green, commercial manager for electricity and water purchasing at Imperial Chemical Industries, who has gained wide experience in shopping around for resources. 'There is a complicated pricing regime in electricity and some people may end up paying more for their power than they need, or even more than they do now. It is worth management putting in extra time to make sure that savings are made and retained.' To qualify for participation in the deregulated market next April, a site's maximum demand must exceed 100kW, based on demand over a three-month period. Nobody knows exactly how many sites are eligible; 45,000 is only an estimate. According to the executive of the electricity wholesale pool (through which power is traded), any site with an annual bill exceeding Pounds 10,000 is likely to qualify. Established businesses should be able to find out if they are eligible from their regional electricity company, or they can hire a portable meter. New sites will be judged on energy consumption of similar premises, although they may have to drop out of the competitive market if their demands prove to be below the 100kW threshold. If a site is eligible its managers have three options. They can: Buy supplies directly from the wholesale market. The advantage of this is that it can save money by cutting out the middleman. In addition, buying from the pool enables a company to respond quickly to half-hourly changes in the pool price, perhaps by cutting demand when prices are high. But buying directly from the pool is inevitably risky. Pool prices are volatile; in April this year they rose more than 10 per cent on average. Stay with the local company, either on a contract negotiated to suit an organisation's needs or on existing tariffs. Among the 5,000 already in the deregulated market, only about a third have chosen suppliers other than their local company, according to a survey by Offer, the industry regulator. Nor does staying with the 'host company' necessarily suggest a lackadaisical approach. Companies can elect to have a pool-related, rather than fixed-price, contract and all the risks that go with that. Brian Acott of the Inenco consultancy group says some companies eligible to join the deregulated market in April have been offered contract terms which would lead to them paying more than their current annual bills based on existing tariffs. In some cases this is because regional electricity companies have yet to finalise their proposed contracts for medium to large customers. But contract terms - that is, non-tariff arrangements - are not necessarily suitable for all customers. Green says sites which need to buy all of their power at times of peak demand may be better off staying on existing tariffs. Purchase on contract from a power company other than the local monopoly distributer, again either at a fixed price or one that is related to those in the wholesale pool. Early negotiations for the 100kW to 1MW market indicate that bigger customers, particularly sites which are part of large, nationwide companies, have the widest choice of terms for contracts. In theory, the two generators in England and Wales, the two Scottish companies and all of the regional electricity companies are among suppliers eligible to offer contracts, but there is no uniform desire to do so. Offer's survey found that in the 1MW-plus market in England and Wales, Eastern, East Midlands, Northern, Seeboard, Southern and Yorkshire account for almost the entire trading by regional companies outside their areas. The remaining six have little or no involvement outside their areas. Big sites tend to favour the generators and are more likely to have pool-related contracts, according to Offer. The regional companies are more likely to be found at smaller sites. Unless a company is happy to stay on tariff terms with the local monopoly distributer, it will need to start planning soon for next April's changes. Participating in the deregulated market will necessitate the appointment of an approved operator to install a meter capable of measuring half-hourly electricity usage and recording it. This should be done by February 1. In addition, enough time must be left between now and next April to negotiate a deal with a new supplier and terminate existing agreements which often have three-month notice clauses. 'Organisations need to start preparing now if they are to get the most out of deregulation,' says Margaret McKinlay, pool chief executive. However, companies are being advised both by the pool and Offer to think carefully before they sign their agreements. Some power companies have been offering discounts on this year's power prices in exchange for long-term contracts. Offer says that such contracts may be anti-competitive. It has told offending supply companies to amend the contracts, but is warning consumers that it may not be able to help in other disputes once contracts are signed.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SEVEN STEPS TO CHEAPER POWER  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Find out whether you qualify for the competitive market. If so, start   negotiating as soon as possible.  -Don't underestimate the complexity of the electricity wholesale pool.  -Be persistent and don't just accept the first deal.  -Don't forget to include meter and connection charges in your   calculations.  -Appoint a meter operator by February 1.  -Sign a connection agreement to ensure a link with the local   electricity distributer's system regardless of the power's source.  -Take advice. Offer's regional offices (Tel: 021 456 2100) can   provide a list of suppliers, meter operators and manufacturers; the   pool chief executive (Tel: 071 831 4791) is running a one day course   on December 3 to explain how the pool works; the 100KW Project Team   (Tel: 071 775 3838) can help on metering and data collection.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT923-10977 ,"FT923-10977 _AN-CG1AVAA0FT 920728   FT  28 JUL 92 / Regulator to probe power prices      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   PROFESSOR Stephen Little-child, the electricity regulator, has written to National Power and PowerGen, the privatised electricity generators, asking them to explain why electricity prices have risen sharply since May. The move could lead to a full investigation of electricity prices, and might end with the two generators being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Prof Littlechild's move comes after large electricity consumers from the Major Energy Users Council, a lobbying group, complained in May that electricity prices were too high. Prices in the electricity pool, or wholesale market, rose from around 1.9p per unit in March to around 2.3p in May, June and July, large users complained. They alleged that the increase occured because the two generators were bidding the price up. 'The bid prices were going up when the coal price was dropping,' said Mr John Topliss, chairman of the council's electricity group. 'They bore no relation to the underlying costs. Our impression was they were winding the price up.' Prof Littlechild, who last investigated pool prices in September, will now give the generators time to explain the increase. If they do this successfully, the issue may go no further. But if the regulator is not satisfied, he will order a full inquiry into the pool, similar to the review he published last December. At that stage, he said it was too early to say if the pool price was too high or too low. But he is likely to make a clear decision this time, and if he decides it is too high, he would not rule out a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The council said it would welcome this outcome. 'We'd like them to be referred, then they would probably be split up and there would be more competition,' said Mr Topliss. Both generators acknowledged that they had received a letter from Prof Littlechild, but said they believed a full inquiry was unlikely. 'The market conditions are now supporting higher prices,' one generator said, explaining that pool prices were still much lower than contract prices  -which are around 2.6p per unit for a large customer and 3p for a domestic user. This was too low for them to recover their costs, the generators said. Some regional electricity companies said they were aware of the review, but had not yet been consulted.

However, the rationale for allowing the Phase I unit to avoid surrendering allowances if it designates a sulfur-free generator is that the Phase I unit is replacing the reduction in its own generation below its 198587 level with electricity from a source (i.e., a sulfur-free generator) that does not emit any sulfur dioxide when producing that electricity. To the extent the Phase I unit replaces its own reduced generation with electricity from units that emit sulfur dioxide in the process, allowances must be surrendered in order to account for the emissions consequences of the reduced utilization of the Phase I unit.

In light of these requirements, commenter's concern_that Phase I units lacking a common owner with a sulfur-free generator may claim to have acquired from the generator electricity that is actually sulfur-free generation retained by an owner of the generator_is misplaced. A sulfur-free generator can be designated only by those Phase I units that meet certain requirements. A Phase I unit whose dispatch system includes the generator may designate that generator.    12     If the generator is outside the dispatch system of a Phase I unit, the Phase I unit may designate the generator if the dispatch system has a contract specifically providing for the acquisition of electricity from the particular generator. A contact to purchase power from the dispatch system of an owner of the sulfur-free generator, where the sulfur-free generator is not specified as the source of the power, is not sufficient. If the dispatch system of the Phase I unit has a contract specifically to purchase power generated at the sulfur-free generator and the contract is with a third party that is not an owner of the generator, the designated representative must show that the third party in turn has an agreement with an owner of the generator specifically to purchase power from the generator. Further, 72.91(a) (5) and (6) require that the designated representative document the amount of power actually acquired from the sulfur-free generator and that the designated representatives of all Phase I units claiming generation from the same generator must agree on apportionment of the available generation. It is difficult to see how a Phase I unit could take credit for electricity legitimately claimed by an owner of the sulfur-free generator. Consequently, it is unnecessary to impose the additional requirements suggested by the commenter.               12     No contract to acquire power from the sulfur-free generator is required if the generator is in the Phase I unit's dispatch system. Since a given sulfur-free generator can be included in only one dispatch system, Phase I units in any other dispatch system must have such a contract in order to desigate the generator.          IV.

The electricity decision removes a requirement that companies generating electricity for their own use need a licence if they consume less than 51 per cent of the output themselves.

The Association of Independent Electricity Producers, which includes former state-owned generators National Power and PowerGen, urged the government to 'make every effort' to privatise the nuclear power industry. However, it said nuclear power should be given 'no special advantage over other privately owned generating businesses'. National Power and PowerGen have not published their submissions but it is understood they are sympathetic to privatisation. However they are thought to have said that privatisation of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear would only be acceptable if 'subsidies', including the fossil fuel levy, were phased out. The Pounds 1bn a year levy is scheduled to last until 1998. The producers' association said the government 'must make quite clear that investment in any new nuclear power stations should be on a full commercial basis with investors judging the need for capacity'. It pointed out that Nuclear Electric's own submission 'makes it quite clear that electricity from new nuclear stations would not be competitive in today's market'. It adds: 'Intervention in the electricity generation market to protect the interests of one technology may damage the interest of those who have to compete with that technology.' That could damage the interests of the electricity consumers. The association also questions the electricity industry's grid code which treats nuclear plants as inflexible. The code 'means that when it is necessary for stations to be turned off for grid management purposes, nuclear stations are turned off last'. Although the submission says this may have been appropriate before electricity privatisation, its justification in the new market place should be re-examined. The association argues that uncertainty about the bill for existing nuclear liabilities has made the nuclear debate more complicated than it should have been. It says the government should clarify what the fossil fuel levy was intended for.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

The utility is to lay a cable across Dover between the Pounds 7.25m plant which it is building with Arjo Wiggins, the paper maker, and the harbour. The plant is Hydro-Electric's first outside Scotland. Dover Harbour Board has signed a 10-year contract to take surplus electricity from the mill for the port's eastern docks. Hydro-Electric intends to sell any remaining power to Seeboard, the local electricity company. Mr David Sigsworth, head of energy trading, said he believed it would be the first time an electricity company operating outside its area had laid a cable from a CHP plant across a town, avoiding use of the local distribution network. He said another unusual feature of the plan was that Arjo would avoid paying the nuclear levy on its share of the electricity from the project. Usually a company is exempt only if it takes more than 51 per cent of the power from a combined heat and power plant. The exemption has been allowed because the 9MW plant has two installations, one owned by Hydro and the other by Arjo, so the 51 per cent rule applies to only half the plant. The plant is expected to become fully operational in April next year. It has been designed to increase efficiency, improve environmental impact and reduce costs at the paper mill and will enable Hydro to sell more power outside its core area.

The Coalition for Fair Electricity Regulation (Coffer) says Prof Littlechild is standing aside while new gas-fired power stations secure contracts that will push old coal-fired stations off the market, raising electricity prices and threatening hundreds of thousands of power station jobs. Coffer has written to him giving him three weeks to convince the users and unions that there is no reason for them to go to the High Court to seek judicial review of his decisions. Coffer is led by representatives of the Major Energy Users Council, a lobby group for lower electricity prices, and the Electrical Power Engineers Association, The group says electricity prices to large consumers have risen by up to 30 per cent since privatisation, and accuses Prof Littlechild of failing to stop the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales from signing long-term contracts to buy power from independent gas-fired power stations. Coffer says the contracts, which were also criticised by the Commons Energy Select Committee report on electricity privatisation in February, lock the regional companies into buying power that will be more expensive than power from existing coal-fired stations. It says that forces the price up because coal stations lose market share and raise prices and shed labour to cover their costs. Coffer says Offer should have intervened to stop the contracts. It can do so because a condition of the regional companies' licence is that they must buy the cheapest electricity available to them. Offer, which has begun a review of this 'economic purchasing' licence condition, said it was convinced it had a '100 per cent robust' case for not having intervened. Miss Penny Boys, Offer's deputy director-general, said: 'There is no apparent link between the contracts and the contracting procedure, and the existing market prices. 'There is only one gas-fired station up and running, which must have a fractional effect on prices.' She said other factors were more relevant to high prices. For instance the possibility that the two large electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, were influencing market prices. That is at present being investigated by Offer.

The Major Energy Users' Council said yesterday that there were proposals to lift the metering charge levied on customers in the competitive market - those using more than 100kw of electricity - from Pounds 200 this year to between Pounds 360 and Pounds 630 in 1995-96. The Electricity Pool, which helps to administer the metering payments system, described the council's figures as speculative. No decisions had yet been made on the charge. Nonetheless, some electricity companies were pushing for large rises, arguing that Pounds 200 did not cover costs. The large energy users' anger results mainly from severe shortcomings in the metering system - including data collection and computerised bill settlements - since about 45,000 mainly industrial and commercial sites joined the competitive market in April this year. The users' council said: 'The electricity companies who have been quick to enjoy the benefits of the privatised environment must now accept the consequences of failure and cover the costs of the mistakes themselves.'

He said this would be among the matters discussed by Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, in talks with the French government in Paris today. Underlining the difficulties in securing an expanded market for deep-mined coal, Mr Heseltine rejected some of the key proposals made by the Commons trade and industry committee designed to limit the pit closures originally proposed by the government. He ruled out government action to drastically curtail electricity supplied from France via the French interconnector, saying it would be contrary to the Treaty of Rome which established the EC. 'The proposal put forward by the select committee to reduce the amount of electricity coming across the interconnector from the present 6.5m tonnes of coal equivalent to zero or anywhere near this is not an option,' he said. Acknowledging that many MPs had been attracted by the idea of ending electricity imports from France, he stressed that adopting such a course would have put the government at 'considerable financial risk' in relation to indemnities given to the privatised electricity companies. Mr Heseltine also warned that the select committee's recommendation calling for the removal of Electricite de France's non-leviable status might well have the effect of it being allowed access to the same premium prices available to Nuclear Electric financed through the levy. Mr Heseltine cast doubt on the practicality of the committee's conclusion that it ought to be possible to find a market for an additional 16m tonnes or more of deep-mined coal in each of the next five years. He disputed the committee's estimate that a subsidy costing Pounds 500m would expand the market by 80m tonnes. While talks were continuing with the generators he could not agree that such a result could be achieved at a cost of no more than Pounds 5 per tonne. To Tory cheers, Mr Heseltine said the government would not be prepared to legislate - as the committee recommended - to require the electricity generators to take coal at a price and in a quantity that they judged to be against their commercial interests. A Labour motion condemning the government's failure to support manufacturing industry and deploring the return of mass unemployment was defeated by 39 votes (302-263).

He was speaking after a report by Ernst  Young, the accountants, commissioned as part of the government's coal inquiry, backed Nuclear Electric's analysis of potential savings from closure. The nuclear industry's critics say the savings would be considerably higher than Nuclear Electric has estimated. They have used this to back arguments that the Magnox stations should be closed earlier than planned to make way for more coal to be burned for the electricity market. Publication of the report in parliament came as leaders of 11 of the 12 regional electricity companies met in London to try to meet government demands on purchases of coal-fired electricity. The regional companies have agreed in principle to buy the electricity which the generators will produce from outline contracts with British Coal to buy 40m tonnes and 30m in the following four years. However, there is friction among them about how the electricity will be apportioned. Some are under pressure from the government to withdraw from contracts for nuclear-generated electricity so they can take up more coal-fired power. In separate talks the generators indicated they could not take more than 65m tonnes of extra coal over five years, even at subsidised prices unless the government cleared a significant amount of room in the market by cutting supplies of other fuels. The government is reluctant to do this.   Companies:-  Nuclear Electric.     British Coal Corp.   Countries:-  UnZited Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.     P12   Coal Mining.

Last May the Energy Savings Trust, which is central to the government's strategy to conserve energy and reduce harmful emissions, said it needed to raise nearly Pounds 2bn by the end of the decade to meet government targets. But according to Mr Eoin Lees, executive director, it is now 'just trying to keep the show on the road'. The trust is intended to subsidise household improvements which save energy, passing on the costs through gas and electricity bills. But the only substantial funding which it has secured so far has been approval from Offer for electricity saving schemes costing Pounds 25m a year to 1997, and funded by a Pounds 1-a-year levy on consumers. The trust is awaiting a decision from Ofgas on a proposal for a similar level of funding. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general, has opposed EST projects because, she says, they require the regulator to impose taxes on consumers. Earlier this month Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, decided against fresh measures to curb demand for energy. He softened the blow to environmentalists by announcing financial incentives for electricity companies to cut power losses, which amount to 7 per cent of the electricity passing through the system. The trust is unlikely to fare any better with Ofgas. Last month it asked Ofgas to approve a levy which would raise Pounds 25m a year for five gas conservation projects. The schemes, which the trust says are supported by British Gas, would run until 1997. Ms Spottiswoode is said to be 'giving serious consideration' to the proposals. But she has repeatedly opposed on principal schemes which require the regulator to tax consumers.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Michael Heseltine refused to restrict the growth of gas-fired power generation to increase the market for coal, although he has provided a subsidy for coal to compete with world prices. He confirmed the timetable for increasing competition into the electricity market from 1994 to achieve a fully open market by 1998. There will be no restriction on sales of electricity from France. Mr Heseltine did say he was considering allowing large energy users, such as British Steel and ICI, to bypass the electricity pool or wholesale market, striking direct contracts with generators and avoiding the fluctuations in pool prices. In addition, the pool authorities are considering whether to give large users a cost incentive to shift their electricity demands to off-peak periods. There was also relief for the Nuclear Industry. The government said it saw no reason to force Nuclear Electric to close its Magnox stations, but is bringing the nuclear review forward by a year. Gas-fired generators say gas can compete with subsidised coal. 'It's the best we could have expected, given that there is a need for transitional arrangements for coal,' said Mr David Lewis, director of Enron Europe, the UK arm of the large US gas company.

It said it hoped to complete negotiations for the Csepel power plant, an independent power producer, by the end of the year. The acquisition price has not been disclosed. However, PowerGen is believed to be considering investing up to Dollars 100m on top of the purchase price to upgrade the plant and construct a combined-cycle gas turbine generator at Csepel. The existing gas-fired plant, located on an island on the Danube on the outskirts of Budapest, has installed electricity capacity of 43MW and 400MW in thermal energy. It was built to service an industrial park and 12,000 households on the island. PowerGen said the plant's proximity to Budapest and its population of 2.5m electricity users made it an attractive acquisition. Under plans announced this week, Hungary aims to privatise a large part of MVM, its electricity monopoly, mainly through sales to western strategic investors over the next two years. Deregulation and increased competition in the sector will widen the scope for independent power producers, such as the Csepel plant. PowerGen, which began talks with the Hungarian privatisation authorities last February, is believed to have beaten competition from Germany, France and Belgium in the tender. It said it hoped that the Csepel acquisition would strengthen its position ahead of expected intense competition for stakes in MVM companies next year.

0,FT924-13369 ,"FT924-13369 _AN-CJOBTAEGFT 921015   FT  15 OCT 92 / Fuel switch defended by generators      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   ELECTRICITY companies responded sharply to allegations yesterday that they had contributed to the sweeping closures at British Coal by switching from coal to gas. East Midlands Electricity, which is building a gas plant at Corby, Northants, said: 'We wouldn't enter into developments unless they represent value for our customers and put downward pressure on prices.' The 'dash for gas' was typified only two weeks ago when Mr Ed Wallis, the chief executive of PowerGen, one of the UK's two large power generators, opened a 900MW gas-fired station at Killingholme, Humberside. On the same day, National Power, the other large generator, announced that it was closing 2,700MW of surplus power plant, most of it coal-fired. On the face of it, the position does indeed look absurd. The UK is shutting down long-established power stations using an important national resource which is plentiful and might last for hundreds of years. In their place it is investing billions of pounds in new stations using a fuel that might run out in 50 years. At present, 16 gas-fired power stations are either running or under construction with a total capacity of 11,000MW, equivalent to about a fifth of requirements in England and Wales. They will displace about 30m tonnes of coal a year. A factor driving the change was the lifting last year of an EC ban on the use of gas for power generation, opening up the North Sea's vast gas reserves to a new market. A second was the privatisation two years ago of the electricity industry, which gave the regional distribution companies greater freedom to choose where to buy their power. A third was the environment. At a time when the UK is committed to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and sulphur, natural gas provides a relatively clean source of power. The fourth is economics, although the picture here is murky. The companies investing in the new power stations claim that they make good commercial sense. Mr Malcolm Faulkner, marketing director at Norweb, which is involved in two gas projects, said yesterday that they enabled Norweb to spread its risks across a wider range of fuels and technologies. Others are less sure. The Coalfield Communities Campaign, which is fighting the pit closures, calculates that many gas plants will produce more expensive electricity than the coal-fired stations they are driving out of business. The economics of gas-fired stations are complicated by the fact that British Gas, which is supplying many of them, raised its prices for long-term contracts by 25 per cent last year as the full scale of the dash for gas became clear. That means that companies that signed up early have a much better deal than the late-comers. A further complication is that the cost of generating electricity from coal does not necessarily include the huge cost of installing emission control equipment. That can add as much a 1p to the typical cost of 2.4p a kWh. Under the present price regime, electricity distribution companies are allowed to pass on the costs of power generation to their customers. Large power consumers say that gives them no incentive to go for the cheaper fuels. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, is to examine the gas contracts in a review of the electricity companies' overall supplies. He said he would look for 'a control which provides sharper incentive to economic purchasing'. Top industrial consumers are to test the government's claim that electricity prices are falling. The Major Energy Users Council, which represents the largest organisations using electricity, is to conduct a survey among its members to ascertain how prices have been moving this year. The council said many of its members did not believe statistics which showed lower electricity costs. 'Many of them have faced steep increases,' it said.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                 COMPARATIVE POWER GENERATION COSTS                          (pence per kWh)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- under current contracts at Pounds 1.85 a gigajoule            2.4 Coal under new contracts at Pounds 1.50 a gigajoule           1.9 Gas                                                    2.4 to 3.2 Nuclear                                                4.0 to 8.5  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: McCloskey Coal Information  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

Southern's increase capped the 15.9 per cent set by Seeboard earlier this week, and virtually ensures the Berkshire-based utility first place when the six-week long electricity results season ends next Tuesday. In common with other electricity company chairmen, Southern's Mr Geoffrey Wilson, denied that a race existed. 'We are not looking over our shoulders and trying to be top of the pops,' he said yesterday. The increase was justified by Southern's strong financial performance, which included a rise of 12.6 per cent pre-tax profits to Pounds 187m on sales of Pounds 1.8bn (Pounds 1.75bn), and its success in bringing down costs. Although the increase to 19.6p caused a fall in Southern's dividend cover - earnings per share rose to 54.5p (47.8p) - Mr Wilson said that several other electricity utilities paid larger dividends. He also stressed that Southern's domestic customers were sharing in the benefits. Tariffs had fallen by at least 2.5 per cent this year, with a further rebate promised for next year. The casualties of Southern's success are its own staff. After shedding 600 jobs this year, the company warned that a further 1,000 jobs would have to go over the next three years, bringing annual savings of Pounds 20m. Mr Wilson said the redundancies would be achieved through early retirement and natural wastage. Southern, one of the 12 regional electricity distributors privatised two years ago, serves central southern England, and has been among the most aggressive in cutting costs inherited from the days of state ownership. Mr Wilson said yesterday it aimed to have the lowest costs of all the utilities. The biggest blot on yesterday's result was a Pounds 7.2m loss in the company's electrical appliance retailing subsidiary, ES, set up jointly with Eastern Electricity last year. But Mr Henry Casley, Southern's chief executive, said the losses would be eliminated as the company became more established. 'We are confident it was the right thing to do,' he said. A big influence on the electricity sector's results is the price review being conducted by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator. Regional companies have been anxious to cut costs in anticipation of a tightening of price controls. However, there has been some anxiety in the markets that the double-digit dividend increases announced by most electricity companies could encourage the regulator to take a tougher line.

While supply to customers accounts for only 6 per cent of the cost of electricity to domestic customers, the regulator's attitude to the more significant electricity distribution business might shine between the lines of the report. At first sight, the supply review suggests an easy ride for the regional electricity companies. Not only was the RPI-X price cap tightened less than expected, but the RECs have been granted a 20 per cent increase in their allowable costs. Yet there were hints that next year's distribution review would be tougher. Companies such as Eastern, which have got on with cost cutting, are likely to find more favour than those which are dragging their feet. More of the market has been opened to competition, and in this area Offer has decided to eliminate price controls immediately. This shows confidence that competition will develop and will give valuable experience of how newly-competitive markets behave ahead of the deregulation of the domestic market in 1998. The regulator is also developing a yardstick to monitor REC costs which, while not yet a formal benchmark, may become so if price regulation is still needed after the market is fully opened up. However, while life will doubtless become tougher for the RECs as competition increases and regulation tightens, their financial position means that they will still be able to generate strong dividend increases for the foreseeable future.

Yet it does re-focus attention on the financial strength of the regional electricity companies. The review of transmission prices over the next year will cut into the RECs margins. Average dividend cover is, however, around three times and strong cash flow continues to cut gearing. Since electricity prices will be falling from 1995, political pressure on the sector may be slight. None of the range of probable outcomes of the transmission review are likely to cut into Southern's ability to pay 8 per cent real dividend increases through the rest of the decade. That is in contrast to the water sector where gearing is rising sharply. Shares in the water sector have fallen, and there are fears that once the transmission review is under way, electricity may suffer too. Yet the sector's high yield relative to the market already discounts much of the risk. On a prospective basis, electricity shares yield almost as much as water, which is surely too cautious given their markedly different prospects. Southern and the other RECs which are getting on with cost cutting look sensible, since Offer is unlikely to be hoodwinked about the costs of companies which are merely lazy. Yet Southern's zeal in setting up new pay bargaining arrangements and 2.9 per cent award to staff sits oddly besides the directors' higher pay awards and continuing three-year rolling contracts.

The decision yesterday by the electricity pool executive will be welcomed by intensive energy users which say the trading system is understood by few and is open to abuse. In a three-pronged approach to reform, the executive, comprising representatives from the electricity generators and regional power companies, will also focus on 'demand-side participation' and transmission services. Supporters of demand-side participation argue that intensive users should be rewarded more for flexibility over when and how they take electricity. Examination of transmission services could include a look at whether pool participants should pay varying prices depending on where they are located. The reform of the pool was launched last year amid widespread complaints from intensive energy users that they were paying too much for their electricity following privatisation of the industry three years ago. The pool was set up during privatisation. In last month's white paper on coal, the government said it was considering whether to allow large users to bypass the pool. Some companies, including Imperial Chemical Industries, have been pressing to be allowed to buy electricity directly from generators. Other pool participants say the effect of this would be to put up prices for other consumers. The white paper also noted suggestions that demand-side participation should be introduced and said it would consult on whether this would be beneficial.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Yorkshire's decision follows announcements of price freezes at other companies, including Seeboard and Eastern Electricity, and a 1 per cent reduction at South Wales Electricity.

The changes are likely to lead to falls in prices of the electricity wholesale 'pool', where power in England and Wales is traded, of between at least 1.5 per cent and 3 per cent. The move could save some companies several millions of pounds annually. Imperial Chemical Industries' annual bill, for example, is more than Pounds 140m. There has been strong criticism and intense scrutiny of the industry after a 20 per cent rise in pool prices since April. The government and Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, have been under pressure from large companies to act on prices or persuade electricity companies to do so. Further reforms being examined by the pool's executive, made up mainly of electricity company managers, could also lead to reductions. Mrs Margaret Thompson, pool chief executive, said the changes were the first to come out of a long-term review and were a step in the right direction. However, they are unlikely to satisfy intensive energy users who have suffered significant price rises since electricity privatisation three years ago. In the first of two reforms agreed last week, the pool is to introduce a system, called demand side bidding, through which large customers can agree to reduce consumption if the price goes above a certain level. This is expected by the pool to lead to a 3 per cent cut in pool prices at times of peak demand and 1.5 per cent on average. A software system, called goalpost, blamed for sudden fluctuations in the pool price, will be abolished immediately. Price 'spikes', or surges, are particularly prominent early in the morning, causing difficulties for industries which work through the night. Goalpost's abolition has already had an effect. Weekend pool prices, the first since the change was agreed, were considerably less variable than they had been recently. Abolition will have an effect on overall prices, although the pool is unable to say how much. Most electricity consumers, including householders, will be affected by the changes only at the margins. Their power is traded through the pool, but they have been shielded from price changes by 'hedging' contracts between electricity companies. Future contracts will be affected by current pool prices. The pool changes have had a direct effect on an estimated 1,500 industrial customers, including ICI, who buy their power directly from it. Some were looking for a demand side bidding system which introduced more significant rewards for participants. The mechanism adopted by the pool will allow demand bidders to be paid on the same basis as generators which bid into the pool. But companies which agree to cut power demands will be given less of a share in the money created by subsequent pool price cuts than they wanted. Instead this will be divided between all electricity consumers in the form of price cuts. The extent of the cut in pool prices will depend on several factors, including the attitude of the generators whose bids into the pool are the most influential factor. Any change in their bidding behaviour will be watched closely by Prof Littlechild, who is already reviewing their costs and margins.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

However the justification for 'green' measures is increasingly questioned both by industrialists and politicians as the costs of further improvement keep rising. The debate about how much to clean up the energy sector has been fiercer than many other environmental battles because electricity generation produces some of the most troublesome kinds of air pollution. Burning fossil fuels - coal, gas and oil - yields sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, considered to be root causes of acid rain and urban smog and a factor in some respiratory diseases. In 1990, the EC's electricity production was responsible for 63 per cent of SO2 emissions and 22 per cent of nitrogen oxide emissions, according to the 1992 EC report on the state of the environment. Fossil fuels also produce carbon dioxide, which has been recognised in the past decade as a separate, worrying problem. Although not a pollutant in the conventional sense - it is present in the atmosphere - the rising concentrations are thought to bring the risk of global warming. EC figures say that in 1990 electricity production was responsible for 31 per cent of CO2 emissions to the air. There are considerable national and regional variations in these figures. In France, for example, electricity generation is responsible for less than a third of sulphur dioxide emissions as nuclear power - which emits none of these gases - is predominant. But nuclear power produces radioactive waste, and its long term storage brings further costs, environmental problems and political pressures. Attempts to tackle air pollution have resulted in layers of regulation. The World Health Organisation has guidelines on tolerable levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, many of which the EC has adopted within its environmental directives. The United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) - most of the countries in East and West Europe plus the US and Canada - has separate guidelines and protocols, and national governments have their own legislation. Many of the earliest regulations were directed at sulphur because of rising public concern in northern Europe about dying forests. The 1985 ECE protocol on Transboundary Pollution called for a 30 per cent reductio on 1980 emission levels by 1993. As a result, German power companies have fitted flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment to almost all power stations, and are embarking on cleaning up the East German stations. Britain has fitted FGD equipment, which costs some Pounds 200m per 1000MW of power generation, to only two stations so far, although the Department of the Environment argues that this will put the UK on course to meet commitments made at the electricity privatisation three years ago. However, the protocol is currently being tightened; following the UK's recent decision to extend the life of some coal pits, it is unclear whether its sulphur emissions will fall quickly enough to meet new standards. The most ambitious of the air pollution treaties affecting the electricity generating sector is last year's Rio Earth Summit convention to curb international emissions of carbon dioxide. But energy taxes - the most commonly proposed tool for curbing demand for energy and reaching the Rio targets - are running into political difficulty on many fronts. US President Bill Clinton has been forced by Congress to withdraw his first proposals for such a tax. The recent session of the European Commission's economic and finance committee failed to reach consensus on its plans for a tax weighted towards those fuels with the highest carbon content. Environmentalists argue that although the regulatory measures of the past decade are welcome, they do not go far enough. Many pressure groups, including the Europe-wide Friends of the Earth, argue for an expansion of the use of renewable energy - wave, wind and solar power - which at the moment makes up only a few per cent of EC energy use. However, the cost of most renewables is considerably higher than electricity produced using fossil fuels or even nuclear energy. A report for the UK government in November concluded that electricity from renewables cost two to three times as much as that from existing sources. It put the cost of electricity from coal, gas and nuclear at between 2.2p and 3.5p per kwh, although it these figures do not reflect all start-up and environmental costs. The report argued that expansion of renewable energy sources was possible but that it would take considerable government help and subsidies. On that basis, it said that renewables could 'plausibly' contribute between 5 per cent and 20 per cent of 1991 levels of electricity supply by the year 2025, saving around 6 per cent of current emissions of carbon dioxide. Industrialists, however, are increasingly concerned about the cost of environmental regulation and the effects on companies' international competitiveness. Mr John Cox, of the UK's Chemical Industries Association, says: 'we are particularly concened about the cost of electricity in the UK, which can be greater than that for Belgian or Italian companies. We support environmental protection if it is clearly going to improve the environment but anything which increases the cost of electricity puts UK companies at a greater disadvantage.' The proposed EC energy tax would be 'an ineffective gesture unless you get the measure adopted at the same time in the Third world'. As the European economies struggle to climb out of recession, they may pay closer attention to the costs of environmental regulation than in the past.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.

The previous government privatised the electricity industry in a way which creates a rigged market and permits the power generators to build gas-fired power stations to produce more expensive electricity than existing coal-fired stations and then pass on the extra costs to electricity consumers. At the same time nuclear power is subsidised by every electricity consumer having 11 per cent added to his bill. This government is forever preaching about subjecting the energy industry to market forces.

It is argued that 'future contract prices are likely to approximate the expected pool price'. This may be the case in competitive markets or where arbitrage is a possibility but not in the electricity industry where two generators have significant market power and where contracts tend to be specific and not widely traded. The generators may wish to limit the supply of such contracts (or make them expensive) and attempt to restrict the liquidity of the contract market. Indeed, it could be argued that the premium of the contract price over the spot (pool) price is precisely a measure of the lack of competition. At present this is bad news to many electricity consumers and in particular to the regional electricity companies which buy large amounts of electricity at the volatile pool price and sell at a price fixed by regulation. However, the contract market may also hold the key to increasing the competitiveness of the industry. What is required is a standardised, transparent contract market which can be regulated attentively. If generators truly competed in a liquid contract market pool problems would be reduced significantly. It is a high contract price, representing the long-term price of electricity, which would attract entrants to the industry.

He also asked the National Grid, which runs the electricity distribution system in England and Wales, to explain price 'spikes' - sharp rises over short periods of time - and an increase in the 'uplift' charges levied to cover administrative costs of running the wholesale electricity market. The regulator's intervention comes as the market, known as the pool, moves into the final stage of a review of its operations. This was prompted by concern about the complexities of its operations but has been given added impetus by the price rises. In April the average pool purchase price was about 10 per cent higher than in March and 20 per cent higher than during April the previous year. Volatility has also increased. PowerGen, the smaller of the two main generators, said the prices that it bids into the pool reflected the cost of production. It pointed out that Prof Littlechild had recently concluded that pool prices were artificially low in the first two years of its operation following privatisation. Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said price spikes may have occurred in part because of inadequacies in pool software. National Power, the other main generator, said that even at the higher pool prices 38 per cent of plant was not recovering its cash costs. Pool prices were also below those agreed with regional companies in recent contracts for coal-fired electricity, it said. The pool price rises will have only a marginal effect on domestic and smaller commercial customers. They buy electricity directly from their regional electricity company at price levels outside the pool. Larger companies that pay pool prices are suffering. For some of them price increases since privatisation have been sharp. April's price rises followed the end of contracts concluded at electricity privatisation between the two main generators and regional power companies. Far fewer of the new contracts are covered by hedging agreements, and the generators say this means they are bidding in nearer to the true costs of generation. Prof Littlechild, speaking at a conference on the reform of the pool, indicated support for the idea of demand-side bidding under which large users could be paid for shedding load.

The move, announced yesterday by Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply, is intended to sharpen competition among suppliers and help ease recessionary pressures on industry. It is part of Prof Littlechild's longer-term plans to reduce regulatory barriers in the power market. The move comes only days after some of the UK's largest companies threatened to withhold payment of the Fossil Fuel Levy in protest at recent electricity price rises. The levy, which is added to bills, goes to subsidise the nuclear industry in England and Wales. Prof Littlechild said yesterday: 'There is no doubt that the present recession, combined with the recent and prospective increases in electricity prices, have hit many large customers very hard indeed. The need to purchase electricity on the most competitive terms possible is more important than ever.' At present there are limits on how much electricity the generators can sell direct. In most of the 12 regions in England and Wales this is 7 per cent of the electricity sold, though in some industrial areas it is up to 12.5 per cent. Prof Littlechild said yesterday that he was raising the limit to 9 per cent in most areas, and up to 17.5 per cent in the industrial areas, from April 1. The limits will be removed from April next year. Initially the new limits apply only to National Power, which represents 40 per cent of the generating market, but they are expected to be extended soon to PowerGen, which accounts for a further 30 per cent. The rule allowing generators to sell electricity only to companies whose maximum demand is more than 1MW will remain. Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users Council and Conservative MP for Erewash, welcomed the move but said many of his members were still worried that this year's electricity supply contracts would contain large price increases. Some of them might go ahead with the boycott of the Fossil Fuel Levy. National Power also welcomed the change. It said an outbreak of aggressive selling was unlikely because negotiations on many of this year's contracts were already nearly complete. But the company was up against its limits in many of the regions, and the change would 'ease the position', it said.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "
0,FT943-9254 ,"FT943-9254 _AN-EHLDRAB8FT 940812   FT  12 AUG 94 / Fear of job losses is part of mixed reaction      By MICHAEL SMITH and JAMES BUXTON   Fears of widespread job losses in the electricity industry were voiced yesterday as industry, consumer groups and politicians gave a mixed reaction to Prof Littlechild's review. The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, which has 40,000 members in the industry, warned that there could be a further 14,000 job cuts because 'every price review seemed to be followed by redundancies'. It would fight enforced redundancies. Mr Sol Mead, deputy head of Unison's 30,000 electricity members, said: 'Companies will be under great pressure to maintain dividends to shareholders and provide the same rate of golden handshakes for bosses.' A more positive response was given by the Major Energy Users' Council. The group, which represents many of Britain's biggest companies, said the price reductions were a step in the right direction. The recognition that the regional companies' capital spending must be financed by a balanced approach and not just consumer exploitation was welcome news, it added. However, Mr Ken Green, electricity purchasing manager for Imperial Chemical Industries, said: 'Once again Offer has failed to deliver a solution which fully embraces customer interest.' He said the price control would not present power companies with big enough incentives to improve efficiency. The National Consumer Council said the reductions were not good enough and customers had been overcharged since privatisation. The chairmen of the Regional Electricity Consumers' Committees, which represent the interests of electricity consumers, said they welcomed the announcement but were disappointed that the cuts did not go further. 'However, having met him to discuss his proposals, we understand his difficulties in reconciling quite different approaches,' they said. Yorkshire Electricity said yesterday that the controls were tough and challenging. Customers were already reaping the benefits of privatisation through lower charges. Mr Malcolm Bruce MP, the Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, yesterday called on Prof Littlechild to introduce an immediate cut in electricity tariffs in Scotland. He said Scottish electricity customers had been 'ripped off too much for too long'. Prof Littlechild is thought likely to announce the outcome of his review of Scottish distribution and supply charges towards the end of next month. Unlike regional electricity companies in England and Wales, Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric are vertically integrated, generating as well as distributing electricity. The Scottish companies were both given negative X-factors (the percentage by which their charges are permitted to increase in relation to the retail prices index) at privatisation whereas the others received positive X-factors. Hydro-Electric and Scottish Power yesterday dismissed Mr Bruce's remarks. Scottish Power pointed out that its tariffs had fallen by 4.8 per cent in real terms since privatisation in 1991. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, said the companies were both 'guilty of the same profiteering as Offer is trying to curb'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The 'dash for gas', he warned, would push up electricity prices and result in a huge excess of generating capacity. Plans for gas-fired power stations already announced would squeeze 30m tonnes of coal a year out of the market. 'A sizeable portion of the electricity generation market has been shut off for coal,' Mr Clarke said. He stressed that the new gas stations would produce electricity more expensively than coal stations they were driving out of business. The dash for gas was prompted by the discovery of huge natural gas supplies under the North Sea. The first of a new generation of gas-fired power stations was opened earlier this month. By some estimates, gas might account for 20 per cent of the market by the middle of the decade. The attraction of gas is that power stations are quick and cheap to build. Gas is easy to transport, and is environmentally friendly. Many of the stations are being built by electricity distribution companies keen to escape the duopoly run by National Power and PowerGen in England and Wales. Because they are allowed to pass through all generation costs to the consumer, they have been criticised for failing to ensure the cost of the gas is economic. A group of coal community interests and electricity consumers has challenged Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to investigate gas contracts and rule them uneconomic. He has declined to take specific action and is to be challenged in court. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday: 'The investment in gas is taking place as a result of decisions by people to invest money in economically viable enterprises.'

Currently British Gas faces loss of market share by a thousand cuts while the Recs can sit secure in their monopoly franchise markets until 1998. On top of that, the franchise market in electricity covers users ten times larger than that for gas. It is hard to argue that the Recs should be able to use their databases to pick off British Gas's customers while remaining in a cosy monopoly market - particularly when that is supplied by long term coal contracts and gas stations in which the Recs have an equity interest. So the chances are that even if the Recs object, the electricity market will be liberalised early. Losing some of the marketing supply business should not have much direct impact on profits. Most of the Recs' money is made in the natural monopoly business of distributing the electricity through their wires. It may however, have knock-on effects. The distribution review currently under way will see excess profits made in that part of the business cut back. That, combined with a squeeze on marketing, will force the Recs to make cost savings which they have so far avoided. If it also depresses market sentiment and share prices, predators may emerge. The Recs have the kind of cast iron balance sheets, cash generation and stable UK earnings which any company with an advance corporation tax problem must dream of.

0,FT933-16950 ,"FT933-16950 _AN-DGACVAC2FT 930701   FT  01 JUL 93 / Technology: Telecoms gets in on high-wire act      By DELLA BRADSHAW   A radio-controlled robot, looping along the power cables between electricity pylons, is helping the UK's power distribution company, National Grid, to build a nationwide telephone network in record time. Energis, the telecommunications arm of the National Grid, expects to offer a long-distance phone service to 70 per cent of the population of England and Wales by April next year, only 11 months after being awarded a telecommunications licence. Energis does not have to dig up the roads to lay the cable, nor get planning permission for telephone poles or ducts. Instead, it is exploiting its investment in the electricity pylons - or 'towers' as they are known in the trade - which span the country. Fibre-optic cables, which will form the backbone of the new network, are being wound around the earth cable - also known as the ground wire  - which is the cable looped from the top of the pylons. Heath Robinson-like machines which lash the fibres around the cables move at the rate of one metre per second, providing swiftest installation. Focas, part of the Cookson Group, which is the major supplier of the wrap-around fibre, is supplying similar systems to electricity generating companies as far afield as Scotland and Hong Kong, the US and Scandinavia. They are being used by the electricity companies either to carry their own internal communications or for services to sell on to customers. Focas managing director Ray Grimwood believes it is the regulatory environment and the culture, not the technology, that is preventing other electricity suppliers from following suit. As well as providing rapid competition to monopoly phone companies, such systems could also provide phone services to any rural area with a power supply. Eastern European countries and China, for example, could be big beneficiaries. Electricity suppliers have three technical options in choosing a phone network to link in with their electricity supply. The first is to wrap the fibre round the earth cable, which is a swift and relatively cheap option if the earth wire is new and will remain in place for several years. If the earth wire is old and due to be replaced, power companies often prefer the second option: replacing the earth cable with one which incorporates the power wire and the phone wire in the same plastic sheath. Such systems are also useful if the electricity company is extending its power network or in countries which lack both electricity and phone services. The third option is to drape the optical fibre cables between the pylons. The simplicity of this scheme brings its own problems, despite years of work on the technology by optical fibre companies. Energis, for example, rejected the self-supporting draped cable because it believed that the cable would be physically damaged if used in close conjunction with its high-capacity transmission lines. Developing the wound cable was not easy either. Looped round the earth wire, the cable has to withstand ultra-violet radiation and snow. The earth wire is also designed to take lightning strikes, when the temperature can rise in a flash to 200'C or 300'C. So Focas had to develop a specially cured cross-linked polyethylene jacket to ensure that the weather does not affect services. Today each fibre installed by Focas can carry 565Mbit/s of information - enough to allow, say, 8,000 simultaneous voice conversations, 8,000 pages of text a second and 10 colour video signals to be sent on a single pair of cables.

Speaking on publication of the annual report of Offer, the regulation authority he heads, Prof Littlechild and his officials said they would take steps to ensure there were fewer leaks from confidential memoranda sent to power companies about a review of distribution prices. Prof Littlechild said it was regrettable that details of a letter he sent last month to electricity companies about the distribution review had leaked into the market. Offer would try to limit leaks by making clear who in the companies should have copies of letters and access to information in them. Prof Littlechild said he hoped to conclude the distribution review around the end of July. On market liberalisation possibilities, Prof Littlechild has already asked the 14 power distribution companies for their views of allowing more consumers the right of choice in 1996. Only about 50,000 industrial and commercial companies which use more than 100kw of electricity - the so called 'non-franchise' customers - are now able to choose. Government plans issued at privatisation four years ago were that the choice should be extended to other consumers only in 1998. Prof Littlechild said that there would be advantages in opening up the franchise earlier. It would, however, not be possible to allow domestic customers choice without compromising contracts made between power companies on electricity generated from coal. This suggests that the 100kw limit may be reduced to 70kw or 80kw, drawing in more industrial and commercial consumers, although he would not be drawn on a figure. The speeding of liberalisation measures has been prompted by changes in the gas market due in 1996 which will allow household consumers a choice in gas suppliers. Gas companies say power groups, which also sell gas, would have an unfair advantage unless similar measures were introduced in the electricity market. The power companies argue that they have bought coal-fired electricity on five-year contracts in the belief that they had guaranteed markets for users above 100kw in their distribution areas.

0,FT944-869 ,"FT944-869 _AN-ELWCWACFFT 941223   FT  23 DEC 94 / Controversy fails to curb the power of wind and waste: The latest contest for renewable energy subsidies has revived arguments over their cost      By HAIG SIMONIAN   Wind power and other renewable sources generate only a fraction of the electricity needs of England and Wales, but few aspects of environmental policy power such controversy. This week's announcement of funding for the third round of the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) - the subsidy for renewables paid for by a levy on electricity bills - is no exception. The arguments this time have been more strident than in the past, partly because the contracts are much bigger than in previous rounds. The government approved more than 500 bids to generate almost 630MW in England and Wales. In Scotland, bids for almost 80MW passed muster - twice the government's original estimate. Local planning objections, financial difficulties and - in the case of waste power - problems with supplies are likely to put paid to some schemes. The government estimates the latest round will add 300MW to 400MW of capacity in England and Wales. It will roughly double the 340MW currently generated from renewables - about 1.5 per cent of electricity needs. The new contracts have brought a further fall in costs. The highest price for wind-generated electricity dropped to 4.8p per kWh from a peak of 11p. The average prices for electricity from landfill gas (3.76p/kWh), municipal and industrial waste (3.84p) and wind (4.32p) remain well above the average price of 2.5p/kWh for electricity sold to the wholesale electricity 'pool' by PowerGen and National Power. But the gap has closed steadily for various reasons. Technology has advanced across the board and renewables have also gained operating experience, bringing productivity improvements. Also, lenders' growing confidence in the industry has triggered a fall in the risk premium operators pay for finance. Longer payback periods have also helped. Bidders in the third round of NFFO have been able to base their calculations on a 19-year period for subsidies  -more than twice as long as in previous rounds. In spite of controversy, wind and waste projects have been the main beneficiaries this time. In England and Wales the government approved 55 wind schemes totalling almost 166MW and 20 gas projects entailing 242MW. Supporters of both technologies had feared they would suffer from negative publicity. Wind schemes have been criticised as being 'blots on the landscape' and some successful bidders may yet stumble at the local planning stage. Country Guardian, a pressure group, has questioned the economic feasibility of the latest wind power bids. Others have asked whether the lower prices include allowances for dismantling wind farms which prove to be uneconomic. Waste-fuelled generators have suffered from accusations that incineration leads to emissions of toxic gas and that recycling is preferable to combustion. More innovative schemes to generate power from crops and forestry were the main losers, although three agricultural schemes were passed, in spite of costs about double that of electricity from other renewables. The Department of Trade and Industry, which runs the NFFO, said it had tried to stimulate diversity in awarding contracts. The wrangling illustrates the difficulties facing the DTI in trying to promote renewable energy sources while they remain more expensive than conventionally generated electricity. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, had urged the government to concentrate on landfill gas, waste combustion and wind, requiring a total subsidy of Pounds 400m over 15 to 20 years. That would be the most economic way, he argued, of meeting the government's target of replacing 1,500MW of electricity generated by traditional methods by the year 2000. More exotic renewables, such as wave and geothermal power have already been discarded as their costs are too high. Yet the DTI says it retains a watching brief on technologies which have so far been excluded, in spite of Prof Littlechild's arguments. The DTI said: 'We want to get new technologies on a learning curve.' Any scheme will be considered if it appears feasible and economically competitive.

The Energy Intensive Users Group said the report by Brunel University showed the Pounds 1bn-plus annual distribution profits of the regional electricity companies in England and Wales were twice the level that could be justified in a risk-free monopoly business. The group is asking Offer, the electricity regulator, to rein back the 'profits bonanza' in its forthcoming review of distribution price controls. Brunel's report concluded that rates of return of 6.6 per cent on new assets and 4.4 per cent on existing assets were appropriate for the power distribution businesses. The Chemical Industries Association, which commissioned the report, said the actual rate of return in 1992-3 was 9.2 per cent, resulting in profits of Pounds 1.04bn, against the Pounds 497m which could be expected from a 4.4 per cent return. Mr Doug Rodger, the association's executive director for business, said that if the 4.4 per cent return rate were applied, electricity prices would fall about 3 per cent. Brunel's report recommends significant changes to use-of-system charges, including more consistency and openness in the regional distributors' charging mechanisms. It says use-of-system charges should be more cost-reflective. As currently constituted, the charges penalise customers who use the distribution networks more efficiently. Mr Ian Blakey, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said the post electricity privatisation price rises for large users contrasted with developments in continental Europe where prices had remained static. Mr Rodger said reductions of 25 per cent to 30 per cent were needed for large users to bring prices into line with the continent.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

His criticism has intensified the pre-election row over electricity prices, and follows a strongly worded statement from Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, that consumers are not benefiting from electricity privatisation. Mr Edwards said: 'The generators now have a perfectly legitimate way of fixing the market.' They were pushing up the price of coal-fired power and keeping the profit. If they would admit that coal could provide competitive electricity, British Coal would be saved from the likelihood of having to close all but a dozen pits, he said. Mr Edwards said the old coal-fired power stations of England and Wales could produce electricity at between 1.8p and 2.2p a unit. This meant that the two electricity generators could easily offer the regional electricity companies, which supply consumers, power at 2.5p a unit, 'and make a perfectly reasonable profit'. Instead, he suggested, they were offering power at closer to 3p a unit, and keeping the difference. He admitted that coal stations could not sell at 2.5p if they used British Coal's coal at an average present price to the generators of 185p a gigajoule, or unit of energy from coal. But British Coal would only need to cut the price to 'a perfectly respectable' 160p to make coal-fired electricity at 2.5p feasible. At 160p, Mr Edwards said, British Coal would not be forced to close many pits. Mr Edwards said he believed the generators could be deliberately keeping electricity prices high, because they were committed to building new gas-fired power stations, which he estimated would produce power at closer to 3p. They would then close the old coal stations. The generators hit back at Mr Edwards, saying they could not sell power more cheaply and survive. National Power said: 'We are not closing anything that is cheaper than the new stations, only the older, smaller stations.' The company said it would not invest in new gas stations that would produce power at 2.8p or above, and suggested that electricity from its stations would be closer to the 2.62p price charged by Nuclear Electric, whose auction of electricity contracts broadly sets the market price. Some large customers could get prices of closer to 2.2p, if they avoided peak-demand periods, the company added. It pointed out that it had to cover the cost of fitting scrubbing equipment to old power stations to comply with environmental legislation and the cost of plant it had to keep in reserve to ensure customers' lights did not go off. 'Our results show we have not been profiteering,' the company said. PowerGen said that present British Coal prices translated into electricity at 2p a unit, before the cost of labour, capital, maintenance and other services. The company said: 'When investors in this company purchased it for Pounds 1.8bn, it was not on the assumption that it was going to convert British Coal into electricity and nothing else.' It added, however, that some independent gas-fired projects which had purchased gas expensively would probably not be able to produce electricity much below 3p.

It will also contribute to an annual energy report which will provide relevant business information on the now largely privatised energy industries. The government also gave some hope to large energy users when it said it was considering allowing them to bypass the electricity pool - the wholesale market for electricity. This would allow the users to sign direct contracts with the generators and avoid the fluctuations in pool prices. This would lead to a reduction in their electricity costs. The pool authorities are also considering whether to give large users a cost incentive to shift their electricity demands to off-peak periods. Mr Heseltine refused to restrict the growth of gas-fired power generation to increase the market for coal, although he has provided a subsidy for coal so that the industry can compete with world prices. He confirmed the timetable for increasing competition in the electricity market from 1994 - designed to achieve an open market by 1998. There will be no restriction on sales of electricity from France. There was also relief for the nuclear industry. The government said it saw no reason to force Nuclear Electric to close its Magnox stations, but it is bringing the nuclear review forward by a year. Gas-fired generators say gas will be able to compete with subsidised coal. 'It's the best we could have expected, given that there is a need for transitional arrangements for coal,' said Mr David Lewis, director of Enron Europe, the UK arm of the large US gas company.

His second and final report on the controversial issue will be seen as in effect quashing the argument that the growth of cheap gas-fired power stations should be reined back to help boost demand for coal and save a substantial number of the 31 pits threatened with closure. Prof Littlechild's counterblast follows sustained criticism from the electricity generators and British Coal that his initial report on the subject, issued last December, was deeply flawed. Although the government was already sceptical that it could stem the dash for gas, Prof Littlechild's conclusions make it even less likely that it will use legislation to prevent more gas-fired power stations being built. The growth in gas-fired power is largely responsible for a sharp fall in the demand for coal. Prof Littlechild's review comes as the government struggles to complete a politically sensitive review into the future of coal prompted by uproar over the decision on October 13 to close 31 pits. A white paper, originally promised this month, is unlikely before the second week in March. Some electricity market analysts believe that unless the government tackles either gas or nuclear power, it may not be able to save enough pits to satisfy Tory backbenchers. Prof Littlechild's report concentrates on whether 11 of the 12 regional electricity companies (Recs), which distribute power in England and Wales, made the best decision on behalf of consumers when they signed long-term contracts to buy gas from stations in which they have a stake. Prof Littlechild serves notice on National Power and PowerGen, the two largest electricity generators in England and Wales, that he wants to study their coal contracts. This follows allegations, denied by the companies, that they are failing to pass coal price cuts fully on to customers. Prof Littlechild says he wants to address concern that electricity provided by coal-fired plants may be overpriced. He asks for further details about the generators' costs and says: 'I shall be examining the costs and margins of their licensed business generally . . . I shall monitor the situation particularly carefully.' However Prof Littlechild says in his report that the Recs have used stakes in the stations to 'provide protection against the market power of the generators, rather than to profit from higher prices in contracts'. He says his information suggests that, in signing the gas contracts, none of the Recs violated licence requirements to pur-chase electricity economically. Prof Littlechild also clears the companies to sign five-year contracts with the generators to buy coal. He says he will not apply yardstick controls - affecting the ability of the Recs to pass through costs to the consumer - to the coal contracts. In response to allegations that he was using unrealistically high coal prices in his December analysis, Prof Littlechild says: 'I have re-run the main scenario using lower prices implied by British Coal.

A rational pricing system will be set up in the next three  years, said Shi Dazhen, Minister of Power Industry.    Letting electricity prices reflect market demand is regarded  as the best way to attract overseas and domestic investment, he  said.    And turning all State power firms into shareholding firms  will generate investment, he added. Under the system,  management and ownership are separate and the legal rights of  investors and managers are protected.    In the next seven years, the industry needs $25 billion to  import generating units with a capacity of 45 million kilowatts,  he said. Foreign loans and investment are being encouraged to  fund the construction of power plants.    Investors stand to make a healthy profit, Shi said, adding  that loans to the energy sector are a very safe investment.    China has been plagued by a power shortage since 1970.  Electricity production consistently falls short of demand by 20  percent.    Despite the fact that China's installed power capacity ranks  fourth in the world, per capita production is only 644  kilowatt-hours, two-fifths of the world average and 80th among  all countries in the world.    Since the 1970s, factories, government offices and  residential quarters in many cities have had to live with  frequent power cuts. The shortage has grown even more acute  since 1979, when the country embarked on its market-oriented  economic reform.    All areas have had power problems except the Ningxia Hui  Autonomous Region.    Beijing, for example, has had an electricity shortage since  the early 1970s. In 1991, power was short by 400,000 kilowatt  hours, in l992, 493,000 kilowatt hours and last year, 683,000  kilowatt hours.    The East China Power Grid, the largest in the country,  generated 9.87 percent more electricity in the first half of  last year than over the same period in 1992. But due to  increasing demand, it had to cut power in Jiangsu and Zhejiang  provinces 12,480 times in the first five months of last year,  4.9 times the figure in 1992.    This year all eastern provinces except Anhui are expected to  suffer severe power problems.    The crisis is worse in the South. In Guangdong Province,  demand has exceeded supply by 30 percent over the past l5 years.  Since l979, it has had to purchase electricity from  neighbouring Hong Kong. Today, it spends 10 times as much money  to buy Hong Kong electricity as it did in 1979.    The Northeast China Power Grid, which had met the region's  needs until three years ago, fell short of demand by 900 million  kilowatt- hours last year. And that figure is likely to reach 3  billion kilowatt-hours this year.    Industry has been the top victim of the energy crisis.  Frequently, local plants cut electricity first to factories.    Each year, according to the Ministry of Power Industry  (MPI),  about one-third of production capacity at factories is lost due  to power cuts. For example, many factories in Guangdong have to  stop operation three days a week, reducing production by 30  percent.    The power industry itself has also been a victim.    Normally, 25 percent of generating units in power grids are  supposed to be idle so they can be maintained and held in  reserve in case of breakdowns.    But the energy crisis has forced all units into operation.  As a result, generators that should be overhauled are still in  operation.    According to international standards, generating units  should  be in operation less than 5,000 hours a year. But since 1970,  China's have been exceeding 6,000 hours annually.    Worse, obsolete equipment continues to be used. In many  cities, distribution networks 25 years old are still in  operation.    In Shanghai's busiest commercial centre, equipment from the  1920s and 1930s is still around. Four cities in Northeast China  -- Dalian, Fushun, Shenyang and Changchun -- are still using  machines left behind by the Japanese in World War II.    MPI officials blame the problem on inadequate investment.    To evaluate a country's power industry, experts use an  internationally recognized yardstick -- the ""power elastic co-  efficient.""    The co-efficient compares the power industry's growth rate  to  that of the industrial and agricultural output value. If the  co- efficient is 1, the two growth rates are equal. If it is  greater than 1, the power industry has grown more quickly;  otherwise, there is an energy shortage.    During the past two decades, China's power elastic  co-efficient has ranged between 0.7 and 0.75, according to MPI.    To remedy the problem, the World Bank has suggested that  developing countries invest more than 2 percent of their gross  national product (GNP) in the power industry. But between l980  and l992, China put only 1.24 percent of its GNP into energy.    Enterprises in the power industry still live under the  planned economy. They have not become independent commodity  producers and are not accountable for losses. The State demands  they hand in more than 90 percent of their revenue in taxes and  profit turnover. This leaves them less than 5 percent of their  revenue to upgrade equipment and improve operations.    By contrast, many overseas counterparts spend half their  earnings on development projects. In some countries this figure  is as high as 90 percent.    China's electricity prices have also been kept artificially  low under the planned system, Shi said.    The prices were set in 1958 and, although adjusted for the  first time last year, are extremely low. Meanwhile the cost of  fuel, raw material and generators has risen sharply with  inflation.    From 1968 to early last year, one kilowatt-hour of  electricity cost only 0.16 yuan ($0.018).    Early last year, the MPI raised the price to 0.20 yuan  ($0.023), still a far cry from the actual price.    For every 100 yuan ($11.5) the power industry invests, it  loses 20 yuan ($2.3).    Shi said the artificially low price leads to a waste of  electricity, affects fund-raising and severely hinders  development.    Many Chinese waste energy because electricity rates are so  low. The MPI is formulating a publicity scheme to impress upon  the public the need to save electricity, Shi said.    In 1992, when experts from the World Bank voted to decide  whether to invest in the Zouxian Power Plant in Shandong  Province, an American expert abstained because electricity  prices failed to reflect market demand, the PEOPLE'S DAILY  reported.    To keep pace with growth, the power industry plans to  increase the generating capacity of large and medium-sized  generating units by more than 15 million kilowatts a year  between 1995 and 1997. From 1998-2000, 20 million kilowatts are  to be added annually.    If this is done, the country's total installed electricity  capacity will be 310 million kilowatts by the turn of the  century.    Shi said this will ease the country's energy crisis and  bring  electricity to 95 percent of rural households.    But to meet this goal, the power industry must break free  from the planned economy, he said.    He stressed the need for establishing modern power  enterprises that operate free of government interference, have  independent decision-making power and assume responsibility for  their profits and losses. Their property rights and other  obligations should also be clearly defined, he said.     "

The earlier-than-expected introduction of competition in the power market for small and medium businesses would almost certainly lead to lower prices. Larger power customers have seen prices fall considerably after moves to allow them to choose from a variety of suppliers. In a private letter to regional electricity companies, Prof Stephen Littlechild, director general of electricity supply, says 'there would seem to be scope' for extending competition to some consumers in two years. Competition for all users is already planned for 1988. His consultations, prompted by liberalisation of the gas market, will cause concern at some electricity companies. They have bought power supplies from generators until 1998 in the belief that their markets were secure. There are also doubts on whether metering technology can meet a 1996 target. Under existing market liberalisation arrangements, only about 5,000 customers requiring peak demand of more than 1 megawatt, can choose their supplier. From next month, that will extend to another 45,000 whose peak demand exceeds 100kW. All other consumers are scheduled to remain in the 'franchise', or non-competitive, market until 1998. In a two-page letter to the 14 regional electricity distributors in England, Wales and Scotland, Prof Littlechild accepts that full competition is not possible by 1996 but suggests the study of an 'interim franchise reduction'. Prof Littlechild's office said yesterday that he had no conclusions on whether the introduction of competition should be speeded up, but he wanted to explore the possibilities. Prof Littlechild referred to the government's decision to introduce competition to 5 per cent of the domestic gas market in each of 1996 and 1997 before British Gas's monopoly on domestic sales is abolished fully in 1998. He noted that even after the electricity franchise threshold falls next month, it will be 10 times as high as the energy demand level at which gas users can shop around. Separately, a report today in Power UK, a Financial Times newsletter, says lower metering costs than expected will make the evolution of a competitive market after 1998 much more likely. That, it says, will challenge the security of the companies' investment in generation tied to long-term contracts. See Lex   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

If most of the basic equipment, materials,  fuels and know-how are obtained at world-market prices, then  production (electric energy) is being sold below world market  prices, judging by the talk about the overall poverty of the  population.    Consumption of electricity is bound to go up in Estonia, as  general economic development continues. It is possible to  sustain this consumption with production from two big power  plants. The currently operating power plants Eesti Elektrijaam  [Estonian Electric Plant] and Balti Elektrijaam [Baltic Electric  Plant] are hopelessly outdated. This has been confirmed by  management team members of these plants, and proven by the study  titled 'Analysis and Directions for the Development of Estonia's  Energy Sector' conducted by the Development Bureau for  Energetics. It is high time to start thinking about renovating  or replacing these power plants, if our planning calls for  meeting all of Estonia's energy needs domestically.    Colossal Sums Necessary for Renovation    Amounts required for renovation, not to mention those  required for replacement, run into billions of kroons. Anatoli  Paal, director of the Baltic Power Plant has said (see T.  Ojala's article 'Baltic Power Plant Is Fit For a Museum' in  ÆaRIPÆaEV, November 22, 1993) that bringing the  capacity  to generate one-kilowatt up to contemporary standards would cost  $700. The projected capacity of the Baltic Power Plant, at which  the equipment would work at its most economical level, is 1,435  MW. Thus, the amount required for a complete overhaul at this  plant is $1,005.5 million or 14 billion kroons at the current  exchange rates.    If overhaul is not started over the next few years, we will  be faced with a situation at the turn of the century where  electricity would have to be imported from the neighboring  countries. Can Estonia come up with the amount required for  overhauling the Baltic Power Plant.    The study mentioned recommends that electric energy  production based on oil-shale be continued as long as possible,  because that will enable us to put off investing in in new  generating capacities.    Electricity From Coal or Oil Shale?    Producing electricity out of oil shale has its drawbacks.  The  energy content of oil shale is three times smaller than that of  coal. Consequently, for purposes of energy production, the price  of one tonne of oil shale should also be three times lower than  the corresponding price of coal on the world market. However,  from the mining point of view, this difference is not  three-fold. In fact, there is no difference.    Should Estonia still plan to produce its electricity largely  out of oil shale 10 years from now, it could do so only if oil  shale miners did not demand the same wage as coal miners, or if  tax payers picked up the wage difference in the form of state  subsidies.    Low Cost of Electricity Makes Consumer Smug    It is the job of the state to set down the rules of the  game,  and that also applies to the area of energy. It seems strange  however that, in setting down the rules, the state should  deliberately put the enterprise it owns in a difficult  situation. If, in the world of commerce, those buying in  quantities get their merchandise cheaper than retail customers  then, in energy sales, for some unknown reason, things work the  other way around.    This could not be explained by government attempts to help  those struggling because, ultimately, the higher cost of  electricity to industrial enterprises is paid for by the  consumer.    The low price of electricity is conducive to consumer  smugness and to taking advantage of the situation.    The most curious example comes from the small islands, where  electricity is produced by diesel generators. The production of  energy in the islands is significantly more costly than it is on  mainland. In accordance with government resolutions, however,  users on these islands pay the same rates as people on mainland.  If some mainlander should decide to use electricity for heat,  because it is cheaper and more convenient to use than other  sources of heat, the state's interests are not significantly  harmed, whereas the same behavior by someone on a small island  would the same damage tens of times over.

Within the past 10 years the number of CHP, otherwise called co-generation, plants in the UK has increased more than fivefold to about 600, with about half of the growth coming in the last five years. About 2 to 3 per cent of electricity is generated through CHP plants. If government targets are reached, the 2000 megawatts of electricity generated will more than double to 5000MW by the year 2000. The appeal of CHPs is that unlike ordinary generators, they recapture the waste heat released during combustion, and use it to raise steam, hot water, heating, or more electricity. They can thus produce heat and electricity at once and are much more energy efficient than ordinary systems. Whereas conventional power stations have an efficiency of about 35 per cent, CHP plants are up to 90 per cent efficient. Their attraction is that they can reduce companies' electricity bills and contribute to improving the environment. According to the Combined Heat and Power Association each 1,000MW of cogeneration electricity displaces other forms of power generation and heat supply to save 1.25m tonnes of carbon emissions. It will also save on nitrogen emissions. Cogeneration's growth in the past decade owes a lot to the development of technology, much of it in the UK, which makes it affordable to relatively small electricity consumers. The cheapest units can be installed for less than Pounds 40,000. Most sites where CHP was installed in recent years use less than 1MW of electricity. There are about 400 schemes in this category, including hotel chains, leisure centres and hospitals. Expansion among larger industrial customers has been less impressive. The economics of CHP schemes make them less attractive for large industrial concerns. Larger schemes have more difficulty in finding a use for the heat, typically three times the amount of electricity in megawatts, and are subject to more red tape. There are about 150 industrial and commercial applications for CHPs in the 3MW to 50MW category in the UK as well as four urban schemes developed in conjunction with community heating. Industries which require large amounts of heat, such as paper and chemicals, are suitable participants. Thus Hydro-Electric, the Scottish utility which is among the most active of the electricity companies in cogeneration, recently concluded a deal with Dover Harbour Board and Arjo Wiggins, the paper maker, for a Pounds 7.25m plant in Dover. One of PowerGen's first forays into CHP was for the supply of 80MW of electricity and 200MW of steam to three paper factories in Kent. PowerGen has recently formed a CHP subsidiary to co-ordinate such projects and is committed to investing Pounds 60m in cogeneration. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, says that if it did not enter CHP projects others would and 'we would lose share in the generation market'. He says his company is interested in about 40 per cent of what it expects to be a much enlarged CHP market at the end of the century, almost all of it among large industrial companies. Hydro-Electric, meanwhile, sees cogeneration as a way of earning non-regulated income in England and Wales and has already set up three schemes and identified more than 20 other potential sites. While companies such as PowerGen, National Power, Scottish-Hydro and BP Energy are all competing in the market for relatively large industrial users, the regional power companies in England and Wales tend to specialise in smaller scale projects. Three of them, London Electricity, Norweb and Northern Electric, are involved in joint ventures with Combined Power Systems, a company which was involved in developing the technology which made the economics of cogeneration work for smaller sites. Most of the CHP operators, whether operating in large or small projects, operate schemes whereby they install and maintain the units. While all of this activity will in itself generate CHP growth, much of the proposed expansion will depend on factors outside the cogeneration industry's control. Future developments will be strongly influenced by the relationship between the price of electricity and gas. Many proposed CHP plants are awaiting the government's review of the gas industry. Most CHPs plants are gas-fired. Until industry can assess the likely effects of the gas industry changes on prices it will be reluctant to go ahead with proposed schemes. Ministers can also influence CHP growth through easing red tape and other restrictions surrounding their operation. 'Generating power is technically quite simple but to set one up you need an extraordinary amount of documentation,' says David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power Association. 'The government's drive to reduce red tape through industry as a whole should help,' he says. Mr Michael Heseltine, industry secretary, showed readiness to oblige last month when he abolished restrictions on companies which generate their own electricity but consume less than 51 per cent of it. Previously they had to hold electricity supply licences which meant their sales were subject to the nuclear levy. From April 1 they will no longer have to. The House of Commons environment committee welcomed such initiatives when it reported last month on energy efficiency in buildings, but it suggested far more could and should be done. For example it wants the government to target 'easy pickings' such as hospitals, prisons and military bases for potential CHP sites, and set a target for CHP in government use. The committee suggested that ministers should be more ambitious about what could be achieved after the year 2000, noting that the government itself had identified an ultimate potential of 20,000MW of CHP, four times the present target for the end of the century.

An out-of-court settlement between the two sides means that the utilities, headed by RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, will be guaranteed 70 per cent of the electricity market in east Germany for the next 20 years. The local authorities have agreed to generate from their own power stations no more than 30 per cent of the total requirement. In return, the suppliers have agreed to protect jobs in the east German brown-coal industry, which still employs some 80,000, and embark on new investments valued at up to DM30bn (Pounds 12.3bn). The local authorities will be allowed to choose whether to take over full ownership and control of electricity and district heating supply and distribution facilities on their territory, or cede the right in exchange for up to 49 per cent of the shares in their regional electricity supply organisation. The deal could fall foul of EC competition rules. It is likely to mean foreign electricity suppliers will be effectively excluded from access to the east German market for the next 20 years, industry analysts say. Foreign suppliers have shown an interest in the east German market, including Electricite de France, Britain's PowerGen, National Power, and Scottish Power. The German utilities have been attacked by German industry as among Europe's most costly power suppliers.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

This emerged from the financial results of the regional electricity companies and the two power generators which have been announced over the past six weeks. All the companies have given cost-cutting top priority. The biggest job losses occurred at the two large power generating companies, National Power and PowerGen, which are rationalising their power station networks to cut out excess capacity, and shifting to more efficient forms of power generation such as gas. National Power shed 4,000 workers, bringing its workforce down to 7,400 compared with about 16,000 at privatisation just over two years ago. The company warned that more than 1,000 jobs will have to go over the next two or three years. PowerGen cut 1,100 jobs last year, reducing its workforce to 4,900, barely half its size at privatisation. Among the 12 regional distribution companies some of the most severe cuts came at Southern Electric, based outside Maidenhead, Berkshire. It cut 600 from its 7,800 workforce last year, and said 1,000 more employees would have to go over the next three years. The cuts were part of a six-month-old deal agreed with staff and unions to introduce more flexible staffing. As with most electricity companies, the job cuts enabled Southern to report a strong gain in profits and recommend a double-digit rise in the dividend. Big job losses also came at Seeboard, serving south-east England. Nearly 400 jobs went last year from a workforce of 6,000, and 500 to 600 will go this year, mainly through an exercise to reduce headquarters staff. As well as job cuts, staff at some regional companies faced reductions in wages, particularly those engaged in contracting work where wages had outstripped private-sector levels under the Central Electricity Generating Board's management. Although the regional companies are all striving to achieve efficiency gains, their cost-cutting comes ahead of a possible tightening of price controls by the electricity regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild. He is engaged in a two-part review of prices and is due to announce the results of the first part in within a week. These could include a decision to oblige electricity companies to absorb more costs rather than passing them straight on to customers.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

China is  planning to build a second nuclear power plant in Guangdong and  to carry out the second phase in the construction of the Qinshan  Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang. China's nuclear power  departments are also planning to build several nuclear power  plants in Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, and other coastal  areas.    During an interview with a MING PAO reporter yesterday, a  person in charge of a certain design institute in China's  nuclear industry said that his institute will help design a  third nuclear power plant in Guangdong. (It has been reported  that Lingao in the vicinity of Daya Bay has been selected as the  plant site.)    The nuclear specialist said that the second nuclear power  plant in Guangdong will use large generating units. There are  currently two different plans and views regarding the installed  capacity of Guangdong's third nuclear power plant (that is, the  Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant). Some specialists want to  install four 900,000 kw generating units, while others think  that it is advisable to first install four 600,000 kw generating  units. The specific plan for the Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant  has not yet been determined.    He also said that the second phase of the construction of  China's Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant includes the construction of  two 600,000 kw generating units. Most of the equipment will be  made in China, but some of it may be imported. Since it  officially started generating electricity and sending  electricity to the power grids many years ago, the 300,000 kw  generating unit of the first phase construction of the Qinshan  Nuclear Power Plant has been operating smoothly. The entire  plant was designed by Chinese specialists.    He continued to say that, at present, the electricity  supplied by thermal power plants accounts for more than 80  percent of the total amount of electricity generated.  Hydropower ranks second. The amount of electricity supplied by  nuclear power plants accounts for only a very small portion. If  the two 900,000 kw generating units of the Daya Bay Nuclear  Power Plant -- which will begin operating in June -- are  included, China's total installed capacity of nuclear power  plants is only 2.1 million kw.    Most of China's coal mines are distributed in areas north of  the Huang He, and hydropower resources in the southwest and  northwest. The eastern coastal areas, which account for more  than two-thirds of the output value of China's national economy,  have been suffering electricity shortages for quite some time.  Transporting coal from the north to the south and transmitting  electricity (hydropower) from the west to the east can only  solve part of the problem. Therefore, the development of nuclear  power is the best option; it is the most economical and causes  less pollution.    An official from the State Nuclear Accident Emergency Office  told MING PAO that stringent checks are carried out in the  selection of the plant site and on the design when building a  nuclear plant. He said that, since the first phase of the  project of the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant was put into operation,  the Hong Kong Royal Observatory and China's astronomical  departments have not observed anything abnormal in their tests.    He said that, as compared with the successful experience of  the west, China is at present one of several countries which  have mastered nuclear technology. China has many talented  people and it is only natural for it to develop nuclear power.     "
0,FT921-16212 ,"FT921-16212 _AN-CAEAAAEXFT 920104   FT  04 JAN 92 / Labour plans radical scheme to regain control of National Grid      By DAVID OWEN and DEBORAH HARGREAVES   THE LABOUR party plans sweeping changes to the government's remaining electricity holdings in order to regain control of the National Grid without increasing public spending. In a policy initiative in the run-up to this year's general election, the party said it was prepared to give up part, or all, of the government's 40 per cent stake in the UK's two non-nuclear electricity generating companies. The proposals emerged as Labour renewed its attack on electricity privatisation, claiming that it was 'a legalised racket'. Despite huge profits, customers had been overcharged and executives were being overpaid. There was also an absence of real competition, the party said. Labour is considering giving part or all of the government's remaining holding in PowerGen and National Power, the electricity generators, to the 12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales in return for their shares in the National Grid. The combined market capitalisation of the two generators is just over Pounds 4.5bn. The deal would enable Labour to meet one of its main energy policy objectives without exposing it to Tory accusations of extravagant spending pledges. Labour has promised to renationalise the National Grid 'in order that government can play the necessary strategic role in the industry'. Labour is committed to paying a 'fair market price' for any equity or other ownership rights it might wish to acquire 'in the public interest' in any of the privatised utilities. The deal would also forge a financial link between the electricity distributors and the generators. The party argues that such vertical integration would promote energy conservation. Under the current structure, distributors are building power plants to compete with the generators. The proposed swap is one of a number of options under consideration. Another would be to exchange some of the Pounds 2.8bn debt owed to the government by the regional electricity companies for sufficient equity in the National Grid to reassert state control. The proposals were greeted with incredulity by many in the electricity industry. 'I don't want shares in the generators: I want to see them broken up,' said one chairman of a regional electricity company. Labour's initiative is also tied to its commitments to the coal industry. The generators must renegotiate their contracts with British Coal by 1993 and Labour is keen to secure a market for domestic coal which costs more than imports. If elected, the party has said that it would immediately designate all major utilities as 'public interest companies' and establish a regulatory commission for each industry, with more powers than the current regulatory bodies. Meanwhile, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, yesterday projected that the combined annual profits of the 16 electricity companies - including the two generators, the National Grid and Nuclear Electric - would total more than Pounds 3.4bn in the current financial year. The 12 regional electricity companies were 'coining it' at the expense of captive customers, he said, noting that poorer parts of the country tended to have the highest unit charges. Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, said the Labour attack was 'invalid'. He said prices were controlled by a regulator and higher profits were due to increased efficiency. 'Domestic electricity prices - after adjusting for inflation - have remained about the same over the last five years and have fallen by 2 per cent over the last seven,' he said.

0,FT932-1874 ,"FT932-1874 _AN-DFVCUACSFT 930622   FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (2): Compromise and persuasion - Europe adopts a slower approach towards a single electricity market      By MICHAEL SMITH   FOR THE first months of 1993, the opening up of the European Community electricity market seemed to have ground to a halt, in the face of opposition by national utilities and their governments. Now the new energy and competition commissioners, appointed in January, seem fully committed to reform. It will, however, be a process of gradual change rather than the revolution which had been threatened by their predecessors. Compromises are being sought by commissioners, particularly Mr Abel Matutes, at energy, and the electricity companies say they are ready to listen. The utilities can take comfort from the case of another EC initiative which many believe would harm their interests. Finance ministers last month damaged the prospects for an EC-wide energy tax to fight global warming by refusing to endorse it after rows over how the levy should be apportioned. With the UK government and most utility companies opposed to a levy, some EC officials believe it may take years to implement an energy tax. Implementation of the energy market will similarly be difficult but the process is back on track in a diluted form which at least tackles the thorny issue of allowing utility companies to sell directly to customers in other countries. Third party access (TPA), as this form of liberalisation is called, has long been backed by commissioners who argue that a free market in all goods can only be achieved if the primary industrial source of electricity is subjected to the same treatment. Allowing full trade between electricity companies and consumers would tackle monopolies and force a cut in power prices, they say. The first move to liberalisation was the Transit Directive, in force since July 1991, which forced utility companies to extend high voltage networks beyond their areas. Another directive sought transparency of pricing by obliging companies to publish prices. As the next stage, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, Mr Matutes's predecessor, had planned to break up the monopolies using the EC's special powers, but he was forced to desist. Instead, he sought to attack the monopolies by demolishing exclusive rights to generate electricity and obliging them to unbundle their accounts so that the various segments (generation, distribution, contracting etc.) operate more autonomously. This would make it easier for outsiders to gauge the market and compete. He also proposed that large consumers - for example, steel, chemicals and fertiliser companies - should be granted access to energy networks by the beginning of this year. If successful, the right to buy electricity from anywhere in Europe would have been extended to smaller consumers from January 1, 1996. It was not. Only Britain was wholly in favour of the proposals. Other states expressed cautious approval for accounts transparency and ending monopolies over electricity production. But Spain, Italy, France, Greece and Luxembourg are still strongly opposed to the principle of TPA. Part of the problem is that, apart from Britain, most countries see electricity as a natural monopoly. National policy decides price, with different internal constraints leading to different price structures. Even Spain, which is liberalising its internal electricity supply, is against third party access. 'Security of supply is the responsibility of each member country, not the Commission,' says Mr Ramon Perez Simarro, secretary general of energy in the industry ministry. 'We want as much competition as possible. But the critical issue is security of supply and that depends on primary energy diversification. We cannot delegate that to the market as in the UK.' In outlining his company's opposition to TPA, Mr Jean Bergougnoux, chief executive of Electricite de France, the French utility, says it would be economically inefficient. It would restrict companies' ability to apply equality of treatment conditions in their areas and would reduce interconnections through which energy is traded between countries. 'It is not easy or cheap to build new lines,' he says. 'Companies would not be motivated if competitors would be able to use lines in their place.' In Germany the utility companies are strongly against TPA, arguing that they would be placed at a strong disadvantage to France which sells its largely nuclear-generated electricity at prices that they cannot match, largely because of their requirement to buy expensive German coal. To achieve a truly free market, they say, all subsidies would have to be removed, whether in Germany, Britain, France or Spain, but that is not in sight and there is no pressure from them to bring it about immediately. Outside the utilities the liberalisation argument in Germany appears to be turning, with some sections of the government favouring it as a means of reducing prices and helping the country out of recession. How can the Commission circumvent this opposition? Mr Matutes favours amending the existing legislation so that member states will no longer be obliged to grant free access to the electricity and gas networks. Instead, users which wanted to buy energy across EC borders would negotiate access to other networks, signing individual contracts. Member states and operators would have to justify any decision to refuse a request - for example, on the grounds that there was insufficient capacity, the negotiated price was too low, or there was a risk that domestic energy companies would be unable to meet their obligations to existing clients. Supporters of full liberalisation need convincing. Dissident states may find ways of circumventing any directive and there is a strong danger of unequal implementation. Much therefore will depend on the drafting, expected to take place later this year after the European parliament discusses the issue.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Professor Colin Robinson, writing in the Economic Affairs magazine yesterday, says the government has taken virtually no steps to privatise coal since the idea was first mooted in the mid-1980s. The article comes amid growing concern that attempts by British Coal to license off mines it no longer wants are unlikely to result in more than a handful of pits being operated by private-sector companies. Prof Robinson argues that any sensible form of privatisation has been made difficult by the government privatising electricity supply first and establishing just two generation companies out of the old Central Electricity Generating Board. The paper says the government's objectives should be to create competitive coal and electricity markets. It adds: 'Such steps are the key to coal privatisation and the survival of an efficient coal industry in Britain. They will almost certainly happen one day, for the protection of electricity consumers. But will they be taken in time to save the British coal industry?'   Companies:-  British Coal Corp.

Fears that the recent 35 per cent increase in British Gas prices for new contracts to supply power stations would crush the independent stations planned in the UK were unfounded, Mr Wakeham told an Economist conference on electricity in London. The increase was a short-term matter, he said, and longer-term gas reserves in the North Sea were plentiful. Competition in gas supply was emerging and no fundamental change in the gas industry's regulatory regime was necessary. Although British Gas had challenged an order freezing the 35 per cent price increase, issued by gas industry regulator Mr James McKinnon, Mr Wakeham said that the challenge had been agreed with the regulator and was intended by British Gas to allow further talks with power companies. Four power station projects had struck deals with other gas producers, and more were likely. Regulation was promoting competition in both the gas and the electricity industries, Mr Wakeham said. For example, domestic electricity customers had important new rights, such as compensation for power failures, and domestic gas customers had seen prices fall since the privatisation of gas in 1986. Regulation should, he believed, ultimately wither away. 'Enough progress has already been made in this area to throw into considerable doubt the contention that privatisation has simply swapped state ownership for state regulation,' he said. Speaking at the same conference, Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the regulatory body, said the new electricity market was working well but some changes were still needed. He said he would review charges imposed by the National Grid Company on suppliers and users of electricity. Those ignore the fact that it is more costly to transmit electricity across the country, and do not use prices to indicate to generators and users at which locations it would be most economic for them to join the grid. He also said that more sophisticated meters would be necessary if small customers were to have the opportunity to take electricity from outside their area. The General Electric Company of the UK is to build a Pounds 90m combined heat and power station to provide steam and electricity for British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site in Cumbria. THE GOVERNMENT was criticised yesterday for relaxing standards to be applied to pollution from power stations under the new Environmental Protection Act, writes John Hunt. The latest guidance on emissions of nitrogen oxides specifies a ceiling of 650mg per cubic meters from solid fuels at power stations - a relaxation from the 400mg proposed earlier. The DoE emphasised that these levels are kept under review and could be raised later as abatement technology improves. Friends of the Earth, the environmental organisation, complained that the relaxation had been allowed in order to help the newly privatised electricity supply industry. It threatened a court challenge to the Pollution Inspectorate's interpretation of the act.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

But the drive to replace coal- or oil-fired electricity stations with new environmentally-friendly gas plants remains a potent force in continental Europe - it is just not happening as fast as in the UK. The EC's large combustion plant directive which forces governments to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by 60 per cent by 2003 is prompting a move towards gas-fired power on the continent. However, in the past two years, prices for heavy fuel oil - which is burned in some power stations - with low sulphur content have dropped considerably. In addition, in many countries electricity demand has declined with the recession, delaying the need for new capacity. The Netherlands, Germany and Italy are the three other European countries to burn a significant amount of gas in power stations, apart from the UK. The three continental countries use between 8bn and 11bn cubic metres of gas a year for gas-fired electricity generation. The UK will reach usage of around 8bn cubic metres by the end of next year. 'There is a general widespread assumption that there is large demand for gas on the continent driven by the conception that gas is the fuel of choice for power stations, but when you go through the countries one by one you realise that there are not that many projects,' said one industry consultant. However, views vary considerably about whether the rest of Europe will jump on the gas bandwagon. Arthur D. Little, the management consultants group, estimates that gas demand in Europe will rise by 55 per cent over the next 20 years from 300bn cubic metres to 450bn cubic metres with much of the new demand coming from power stations. 'The dash for gas is not just a British phenomenon. We see the power generation market as being the fastest growing sector of gas demand across Europe,' said Mr John Wood-Collins, managing director of Arthur D. Little. According to Caminus Energy, the energy consultancy group, the EC Commission is expecting the use of gas to double in the power sector across the EC. But this means gas will still only meet 16 per cent of electricity supplies by 2000. This compares with up to 25 per cent in the UK by 1998 - up from nil in 1990. Italy has been planning a significant increase in gas-fired plant for some time with Enel, the state electricity generator, predicting a big switch from heavy fuel oil into gas. Plans have been scaled back as fuel oil prices have declined, but Italy still plans to convert to 25 per cent gas-fired power by 2000 compared with 18 per cent in 1990. Germany is currently building one gas-fired station in Dresden and another in Stada on the north coast. But Ruhrgas, the country's major gas supplier, has said recently that most of Germany's new power demand will be met by coal-fired generation. The International Energy Agency, the west's energy monitoring body, expects gas to meet 14 per cent of Germany's electricity supply needs by 2000, an increase from 7 per cent in 1991. Two plants are planned in the Netherlands with start-up due in 1996 and Belgium is building two gas-fired stations. This compares with plans for 20 plants in the UK - and even this has been scaled back from earlier projections. Elsewhere in Europe, the biggest gas turbine equipment in the world has just been completed outside Paris, but the plant will burn gas at peak times only which could be as little as 20 hours a year. France remains committed to its nuclear programme, and appears more interested in clean coal technology than additional gas plant. Spain is looking at augmenting its electricity capacity with gas-fired stations which will use Algerian gas from the new Maghreb pipeline which is expected to start running by 1996. Algerian gas will double Spain's gas capacity and the country's electricity industry is looking at constructing gas plant. Portugal is currently building a large coal-fired power station in the north and has no immediate plans for gas. Eastern European countries are looking to replace some of their highly-polluting, coal-fired stations with gas capacity, but few concrete projects are under consideration. In Scandinavia, Sweden has committed itself to phase out nuclear power stations by 2010 - nuclear currently provides around half of the country's power needs - and some of it could be replaced by gas. The dash for gas in the UK was prompted initially by the privatisation of the electricity industry and the resulting industry structure, but cheap gas prices also created huge demand. The creation of the duopoly of National Power and PowerGen as England's and Wales's (not Scotland's) only non-nuclear generators left many of the regional electricity companies eager to escape the yoke of the generators and build their own power stations once they were privatised. By March 1991 the dash for gas was turning into a stampede, forcing British Gas to ratchet up its prices in an effort to cut off demand. By the end of April 1992, the National Grid was predicting 60 per cent surplus capacity in the market if all 28 stations which had applied for grid connections were built by 1997 as planned. However, since then some companies have dropped out: National Grid says eight stations have either been cancelled or deferred, putting the surplus capacity at between 24 per cent and 37 per cent by 1995 to 1996. Three of the remaining 20 stations have already been opened: Lakeland Power's Roosecote plant in Barrow-in-Furness, Enron's Teesside station which is one of the largest CHP plants in the world at Teesside and was opened in April, and PowerGen's Killingholme plant on Humberside. The Teesside plant which has four regional electricity companies as partners provides graphic evidence of the attractions of gas-fired generation. The station is fully computerised and employs just 65 people compared with 650 workers at a coal plant of similar size. In addition, Teesside emits half the carbon dioxide of a coal plant, its sulphur emissions are negligible and it produces one-ninth of the nitrous oxide waste of a coal plant. The environmental benefits of gas-fired electricity generation are overwhelming. But gas must compete on price with other sources of fuel and it is not as easy to transport as oil and coal. The use of gas in power stations is on the increase in Europe, but a fully-fledged dash for gas on the continent is still some way off.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The National Power Company of Iceland has commissioned Pirelli Cables, the UK subsidiary of the Italian cables and tyres group, to look into the possibility of laying an undersea power link to Britain. The 1,000 kilometre cable would be almost five times longer than any existing underwater power link. Lying at depths of up to 1,000 metres, it would pose a new technological challenge to the cable-laying industry, including working in some of the world's coldest and most dangerous waters. Moreover, transmitting electricity over such a distance would also involve huge energy losses, making the scheme potentially uneconomic. 'That is one of the things we will have to study', a Pirelli official said yesterday. The scheme may have been given a boost by the end of the Cold war. The waters north of Scotland are plied by the submarine fleets of Nato and the former Soviet Union. The seabed in the region is believed to contain many sophisticated listening devices, which could be disturbed by the proximity of heavy electric transmissions. Iceland has immense capacity to generate power through hydroelectricity. However, its potential has so far been largely untapped as a result of its small population and limited industrialisation. Current consumption of electricity from hydroelectric sources is just 6bn kilowatt hours a year, against an estimated capacity five times as high. The UK, which already imports some electricity from France through cables beneath the Channel, is expected to have a surplus by next century. And by the end of 1994, Scotland will be able to export twice as much power to England and Wales. But the UK could represent just the beach-head for a series of further cables taking Icelandic electricity to continental Europe. With growing concern about nuclear power and the environmental damage of many coal-burning power stations, hydroelectric energy generated from Iceland's prodigious mountains and streams could find a ready market in an increasingly 'green' Europe.

0,FT931-12014 ,"FT931-12014 _AN-DA4ASADAFT 930130   FT  30 JAN 93 / MPs criticise Treasury and electricity watchdog: Subsidy urged for generators      By MICHAEL SMITH   THE BENEFITS of expanding the market for coal far outweigh the costs, Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, said yesterday. The report is harshly critical of the Treasury and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, and includes recommendations which, if implemented by the government, would significantly affect the nuclear, gas, coal and electricity industries in the UK and overseas. The MPs' main conclusions are in the following areas: Coal: a subsidy should be provided to the electricity generators to burn up to 16m tonnes of extra coal a year for the next five years on top of existing contracts. It would be equal to the difference between the price of overseas and British coal. In addition, the government should consider financial assistance for 3m tonnes to be sold elsewhere and require the generators to buy 4m tonnes for one year only in 1984-85. There would also be subsidies for clean-coal technology. The committee believes the total subsidy needed over five years would be less than Pounds 500m. The money should come either from the fossil fuel levy 'which raises more money than is needed for its main purpose' or from the taxpayer, but not from the electricity consumer. More worrying for British Coal is the committee's suggestion that opencast output be reduced gradually through stricter planning guidelines from its present 18m tonnes a year to about 10m. The corporation welcomes the committee's suggestion that a high priority be placed on reforming working practices, particularly the reform of working hours. The unions will welcome the committee's proposal that any colliery proposed for closure should be put into the Modified Colliery Review Procedure, a move opening the possibility that no pits be closed within the next nine months. Nuclear power: Nuclear Electric will be relieved the committee rejects calls from some environmentalists for early closure of the Magnox stations and against commissioning Sizewell B next year. It also welcomes a committee proposal, unlikely to be adopted by the government, that Nuclear Electric ceases to receive income from the fossil fuel levy and ceases to be responsible for discharging inherited nuclear liabilities. The report suggests diverting Pounds 380m a year of the levy towards coal. The committee recommends that the nuclear review scheduled for 1994 be brought forward by a year. Major energy users, who have since privatisation complained of high electricity prices, are backed. The committee says major users should not be disadvantaged by high electricity prices relative to overseas competitors. It suggests a cross-subsidy from small consumers by tapering the fossil fuel levy so large users pay a small percentage. Electricity: Perhaps the most significant means of increasing the market for coal would be achieved through the committee's recommendation that the liberalisation of the electricity market be delayed by four years from 1994. Under its proposal, the boundary non-franchise market - where there is competition between regional electricity companies - would remain at 1MW. Some regional companies have suggested this would enable them collectively to buy 15m tonnes more a year of coal-fired electricity because they would be certain they could sell it to customers. The committee of MPs says retention of the existing franchise boundary would be conditional on the regional companies agreeing to larger coal contracts. It also says the prices of the generators and regional companies would have to be tightly regulated. Under present licences the generators are not directly regulated and some regional companies say this enables them to hold on to some of the money resulting from falling coal prices. The committee also advises the government to require the generators to hold total stocks of not less than 20m tonnes of coal a year. The committee wants Prof Littlechild to review regional companies' distribution charges immediately so he can introduce tighter controls on charges and pass the benefits of privatisation on to consumers. The MPs are dissatisfied with the way Prof Littlechild has discharged his duties. They criticise him for 'over-reliance' on competition and an apparent lack of urgency in resolving problems. The report says his duties should be amended to make protection of consumers one of his primary duties. He should be required to consider long-term interest of indigenous fuel producers. The Department of Trade and Industry is asked to review the power of energy regulators, with the aim of acquiring more parliamentary and govern-ment control over their work. Operation of the pool wholesale market for electricity is strongly challenged because of the way the bidding system appears to disadvantage coal. A review is suggested. The report suggests controversially that electricity supplied from France be subject to the nuclear levy and that Electricite de France's ability to negotiate long-term contracts to supply power be made conditional on UK generators having access to the French system. The committee believes this would create room for 6.5m tonnes of coal. Gas: Rapid expansion in the market share of combined-cycle turbine gas generators are accepted as inevitable - the committee estimates 30m tonnes of coal-equivalent in 1997 against 1m this year. The committee says the independent power projects involving CCGT have a protected market through long-term contracts and 'we do not necessarily rule out draconian ways of reducing their impact on the market for coal'. The report asks the government to look at the possibility of some CCGTs being used as mid-merit or peak instead of baseload capacity. Environment: Oil plants which burn orimulsion, the South American fuel which is an emulsion of bitumen and water, should fit flue gas desulphurisation units, which the committee believes would make them prohibitively expensive. The committee says the government should resist the introduction of a carbon tax unless it is essential to achieve commitments on carbon dioxide emissions and is more cost-effective than other measures. Government: The Treasury is criticised for its role in the pit closures programme. The MPs say: 'We find it disappointing that the Treasury apparently failed to conduct any comparison between the costs of closing the 31 pits and the costs of a temporary subsidy to enable British Coal to enlarge its markets.' The report says this could have suggested phased closures at least. 'We also consider it reprehensible both that negotiations with the Treasury over the redundancies were so protracted and that the Treasury then required all the redundancies to take effect within the remainder of the financial year.'

0,FT943-9224 ,"FT943-9224 _AN-EHLDRAC2FT 940812   FT  12 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Littlechild underpowered   The privatisation of the power industry four years ago has, in many respects, proved a great success. Electricity companies are running a leaner system which is much more responsive to consumers' needs and delivering cuts in real prices. But this impressive performance has been marred by the excessive rewards which have gone to two groups of people: managers and shareholders. Professor Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, has no remit to tackle the extravagant remuneration packages awarded to executives, almost regardless of performance. He can and yesterday did, take action to improve the price regime, which has allowed shareholders to earn far larger returns from the monopoly businesses than thought possible four years ago. The review was never going to be an easy task, because the balance of reward between shareholders and customers had slipped so far in favour of the former. Dividends have greatly exceeded the City's predictions, and share prices have, in some cases, risen by as much as three times in value. Although domestic customers have seen electricity bills fall recently, this owes more to the decline in generation costs than to price regulation. The electricity companies have passed virtually all of the benefits of their improved efficiency through to shareholders, thanks to price formulae which were devised by a government more concerned with obtaining good privatisation proceeds than with protecting the interests of consumers. Partial success With the initial balance so far out of kilter, it is not surprising that Prof Littlechild's success yesterday was only partial. On the face of it, he has been quite tough. He is proposing to force the companies to make a once-and-for-all cut of between 11 and 17 per cent in their distribution charges (which account for about a quarter of electricity bills), and then limit future increases to 2 per cent below the rate of inflation for a further four years. Together, these actions should produce steady real declines in household electricity bills up to the end of this century. Yet stock analysts were calculating yesterday that the companies will still have sufficient earnings and borrowing capacity to sustain real dividend increases of at least 6 per cent a year for the foreseeable future. If that turns out to be the case, it will raise questions about the effectiveness of Prof Littlechild's new regime. Efficiency gains One reason why excesses may continue is that the potential efficiency gains in the electricity industry remain far greater than was ever imagined at privatisation. Even though companies have shed thousands of jobs and reduced their operating costs by impressive amounts, they are still only part-way through the cost-cutting process. Indeed, in the cat-and-mouse game that is inevitably being played between regulated companies and their regulator, there is an incentive for management to underplay the scope for rationalisation in order to secure softer price targets. There are other factors as well. Most electricity companies have paid off their debts, which means that there is considerable capacity for gearing up. The companies are also about to sell off their prize asset, the National Grid Company, which will enrich their coffers still further. And if the much-predicted shake-out of the industry materialises, there will be efficiency gains from mergers and takeovers too. Prof Littlechild has to ensure, of course, that his price regime does not damage the electricity industry's ability to deliver a vital service and maintain improvements. But all these factors indicate that there is little danger of this: indeed they constitute a case for setting more demanding targets than he did yesterday. Now that the deed is done, however, it would be a mistake to add a threat to reopen the price review, within the designated five-year period, if the electricity industry were once again to offend public opinion with the size of its earnings and salaries. That would only create inhibiting uncertainty. Ultimately, the country's interest lies in having the most efficient electricity industry possible, and that can best be achieved by allowing managements to exceed their targets if they can, rather than threatening to confiscate any excess gains. The pity, though, is that the targets are not tougher.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9631 Regulation, Administration of Utilities.     P4911 Electric Services.

0,FT941-3481 ,"FT941-3481 _AN-ECQAKACUFT 940316   FT  16 MAR 94 / Management: The power to choose - How companies can now control electricity costs      By MICHAEL SMITH   Keith Smith, buyer of utilities at the McDonald's fast food chain, is beaming at a chart of one restaurant's electricity consumption. He likes the power it gives the company's restaurant managers. 'Look at that,' he says. 'They've done all the right things there. The consumption falls when it should; the store workers have switched off the cookers and lights when they do not need them. It's a perfect example to show to other stores.' The chart comes courtesy of Eastern Electricity which, from next month, is to supply power and associated services, including diagrams showing past consumption, to 500 McDonald's stores in England and Wales. Eastern's willingness to supply power and other facilities as part of the service, yet still undercut offers from rival power companies, was one reason why it won the business. In the past few months throughout Britain big companies like McDonald's have been evaluating for the first time a range of offers for power supplies as they and the suppliers gear up for the next phase in the liberalisation of the market. From April 1 any electricity consumer using more than 100 kilowatt hours at the peak of its demand will be able to buy its supplies from any registered supplier including the 14 mainland UK distributors and the two England and Wales generators. Until now they have had to buy power from their local distributor. The previous limit of 1 megawatt, 10 times the new threshold, encompassed only about 5,000 consumers. From April about 50,000, including businesses, schools, hospitals and leisure centres, will be able to shop around and many are taking advantage. More than 7,000 in the 100kW to 1MW market, a fifth of those eligible, have already made arrangements to take their supplies from a company other than their regional electricity supplier. The industry expects the figure to reach about 15,000 within the next year. Price cuts have reached 20 per cent for a handful but the majority which have switched are estimated to be making annual savings on their electricity bills of between 4 and 10 per cent. Many of those which have stayed with their regional distributor have also gained financially. But the benefits of the liberalised market are not just in the price. Companies, or at any rate the large ones, are finding they are in strong position to demand a tailor-made service which can improve their energy management. As a large company, with all the advantages which that brings for bulk buying, McDonald's was better placed than most prospective buyers - yet it received offers for the whole country from just four suppliers of the 14 approached. Smith was impressed by only one company other than Eastern. 'It was apparent that several suppliers were poorly prepared. There was not the expertise to deal with the market. One company, for example, had a very good salesman but poor back-up. 'Several of the offers we received had hidden costs,' says Smith. Some were able to offer charts showing consumption in each store by the half hour but they wanted to charge extra, on top of the prices they had quoted, and that was already more than Eastern's quote. Smith says McDonald's has become much more conscious of energy costs in the past two years and now sees the half-hourly breakdown of consumption as an essential management tool. 'It gives the manager of a store a picture of what has been happening in the store even at times when he is not there.' McDonald's estimates that it will save Pounds 1.4m on its energy bill each year as a result of the deal with Eastern, which is worth about Pounds 18m. A separate deal in Scotland for the company's 20 stores there is leading to savings of more than 30 per cent. Another company taking advantage of the newly competitive UK electricity market is Stakis, the hotels and casinos group. Stakis will make significant savings on its electricity bill after a deal with Scottish Hydro-Electric involving the 25 of its 52 hotels and six casinos which are big enough to be able to shop around for supplies. It expects its Pounds 2.3m-a-year electricity bill for the 31 units in the Hydro deal to fall by about Pounds 250,000. Like McDonald's, Stakis was not spoiled for choice. Bill Gunn, in charge of utilities purchasing for the group, says only the two Scottish power distribution companies were prepared to make an offer covering hotels throughout the UK. Stakis's main requirement was simplicity. 'Electricity bills seem to us to be far too complicated with different charges for maximum demand, for supply and for different times of the day. We wanted a uniform price for each unit of electricity which is the same for all hotels and for that price to include everything. 'We have limited resources and a single price makes billing far easier to double check. It is also useful for comparison purposes. If one hotel is using far more units than another with similar occupancy rates we will know there is something wrong. Perhaps they leave everything on in the kitchen overnight.' Both Hydro-Electric and Scottish Power were able to meet Stakis's request for uniform prices but Hydro's tender was lower. Not all companies, however, have found it easy to shop around. At Fowler  Holden, John Hardy, managing director, badgered electricity suppliers for several months before he received an offer he considered may be acceptable. 'At first I could not get suppliers to compete,' he says. 'They seemed only interested in making decent offers to large companies. But large companies are my competitors and if they are getting big cuts in their electricity bills I want them too.' The first six offers made to Fowler would have resulted in its power bill remaining at about Pounds 26,000 a year. It was only this week when one company, Powerline, the Midlands Electricity subsidiary, revised an earlier proposed deal to produce annual savings of about Pounds 2,000. The lateness of the proposed offer means Fowler will be unable to change supplier until after April 1, since the electricity authorities need 20 working days' notice. Hardy says the delay has been worthwhile. 'Unless we had been prepared to wait, the introduction of competition would have meant virtually nothing to us.'   Companies:-  Eastern Electricity.

It is thus ScottishPower's misfortune to have been the government's third attempt to price correctly the UK electricity industry. The Treasury has managed to truss the business so that it has neither the slack RPI caps of the regional electricity companies, nor the generous dividend cover of the generators. Small wonder, then, that the shares have underperformed the FT-A electricity sector since privatisation. Yesterday's figures give some support to those who argue that ScottishPower can start to make back some ground. Underlying profits growth was 18 per cent, and the expansion of the interconnector between Scotland and England will provide a growing stream of unregulated earnings. The company's management is also making strides to throw off the cosy pre-privatisation culture. Yet there are worries - most notably the failure to achieve the rate of return on the electricity transmission business projected at the time of flotation. Turnover growth is also likely to be sluggish unless some fierce Scottish winters spark demand. Despite the interconnector, there is little reason to suppose that the shares can yet move to a below-market yield.   Companies:-  ScottishPower.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

These percentages   represent the amounts by which the potential energy savings from standards are   reduced.     There is, however, an argument that the usage elasticities/rebound   effects for at least some household uses of energy may be substantial. Within   a household, the price elasticity of demand will be an average of the   elasticities of demand for each end use, e.g. appliance. For example, suppose   the price elasticity of demand at the household level is .3. If some levels   of appliance usage (say refrigerators) are insensitive to price changes, i.e.,   zero elasticity, then at least one other use must have an elasticity in excess   of .3.     If the usage elasticity for a product is identical to the price   elasticity of demand for the energy the product uses, then it follows that the   weighted average of the usage elasticities of all household uses must equal   the household price elasticity of demand. Since the appliances subject to   energy efficiency standards account for more than 80 percent of household   consumption, it would be unlikely that all appliances would have usage   elasticities less that the overall household price elasticity of demand.     According to the Energy Information Administration, the household price   elasticity of demand for electricity is about .15 in the short run and upward   of .7 in the long run. Thus usage elasticities, should, on average   approximate these estimates. The Department seeks comments on this argument.         Marginal Electricity Rates          American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Natural Resources   Defense Council, and Washington Gas Light all urged the Department to use   marginal electricity rates rather than average ones. (American Council for an   Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 6; Natural Resources Defense Council, No.   13 at 18; and Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 3). American Council for an   Energy Efficient Economy and Natural Resources Defense Council both stated   that since room air conditioners are run disproportionately during periods of   peak utility load (when rates are the highest), the use of average electricity   rates will undervalue the electricity savings from improved efficiency.     The Department agrees that use of average electricity prices can produce   inaccuracies and does attempt to use energy prices specific to each end use.   In the past, electricity rates have been assumed higher for air conditioning   than for other end uses, based on survey data of consumer expenditures,   disaggregated according to equipment ownership. The consumer analysis for   this proposed rule continues to distinguish energy prices by end use, based on   such survey results.     Washington Gas Light added that in addition to using marginal   electricity prices, the Department should use the All-Ratepayers Test when   measuring the cost effectiveness of a standard level. This test was developed   by the California Public Utilities Commission, and it measures the impact of   an action on all ratepayers, including non-participants in the conservation   activity. (Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 13).     In this program the Department examines the effect of energy conserved   by each purchaser of a more efficient appliance, but does not examine the   effects that the aggregate conservation effects would impose on the rates   charged within a given utility. The impacts on any system's rates from   increased energy standards would depend on the participation rates of its   customers in the conservation activity and the particular financial position   of the utility.     Several comments discussed the impact of energy conservation standards   on low-income people. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2;   Southern Union Gas Company, No. 46 at 1; Laclede, No. 55 at 5; Oklahoma   Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 5; and Public Service Company of North   Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 5). While the Rocky Mountain Institute stated that   with improved energy efficiency, the prices of used appliances could be   expected to decline in the short run, the other comments all stated that the   higher prices that would be caused by improved efficiency standards on new   units would have price-increasing effects on used appliances and, therefore,   be harmful for lower-income and elderly consumers on fixed incomes.

(American Council for an   Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 6; Natural Resources Defense Council, No.   13 at 18; and Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 3). American Council for an   Energy Efficient Economy and Natural Resources Defense Council both stated   that since room air conditioners are run disproportionately during periods of   peak utility load (when rates are the highest), the use of average electricity   rates will undervalue the electricity savings from improved efficiency.     The Department agrees that use of average electricity prices can produce   inaccuracies and does attempt to use energy prices specific to each end use.   In the past, electricity rates have been assumed higher for air conditioning   than for other end uses, based on survey data of consumer expenditures,   disaggregated according to equipment ownership. The consumer analysis for   this proposed rule continues to distinguish energy prices by end use, based on   such survey results.     Washington Gas Light added that in addition to using marginal   electricity prices, the Department should use the All-Ratepayers Test when   measuring the cost effectiveness of a standard level. This test was developed   by the California Public Utilities Commission, and it measures the impact of   an action on all ratepayers, including non-participants in the conservation   activity. (Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 13).     In this program the Department examines the effect of energy conserved   by each purchaser of a more efficient appliance, but does not examine the   effects that the aggregate conservation effects would impose on the rates   charged within a given utility. The impacts on any system's rates from   increased energy standards would depend on the participation rates of its   customers in the conservation activity and the particular financial position   of the utility.     Several comments discussed the impact of energy conservation standards   on low-income people. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2;   Southern Union Gas Company, No. 46 at 1; Laclede, No. 55 at 5; Oklahoma   Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 5; and Public Service Company of North   Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 5). While the Rocky Mountain Institute stated that   with improved energy efficiency, the prices of used appliances could be   expected to decline in the short run, the other comments all stated that the   higher prices that would be caused by improved efficiency standards on new   units would have price-increasing effects on used appliances and, therefore,   be harmful for lower-income and elderly consumers on fixed incomes.

Most shares reached their highest level since privatisation. Norweb finished the day up 13p at 539p, against a previous high of 530p. Shares in British Gas, whose customers will also see price rises because of the VAT decision, fell yesterday. Analysts said this reflected institutional sales for technical reasons rather than concern about the tax. The electricity shares' buoyancy reflects a belief in the City that sale volumes are unlikely to suffer significantly when VAT of 8 per cent is levied in April next year and 17.5 per cent VAT comes in 12 months later. This is because most people see fuel as a basic necessity. There is a disadvantage for the companies though, because their bad debt problems are likely to grow. Yorkshire Electricity expects the proportion of its 2m customers that experience difficulties in paying bills to rise from its present 15 per cent. The company spends an average Pounds 130 a year on chasing each of the most regular payment defaulters. This is sometimes more than the value of electricity the defaulters have used. On the positive side the regional electricity companies will see cashflow benefits resulting from VAT receipts. In some cases those receipts will be kept for three months before they are paid to the government. The Budget also benefited utility companies' shares because of changes to the tax credit system. From next month tax credits attached to dividends will be reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. Mr Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett, said pension funds would be concerned about the resulting shortfalls in incomes from investments. Some would be trying to increase their holding of gilts and of high yielding shares such as utilities, he said. Other analysts said electricity shares also benefited yesterday from disclosures that the industry regulator was planning less rigid controls on supply prices than some had feared.

An Israeli company, with a staff of six, is now winning orders from UK water companies for a computerised control system to cut those bills. Welsh Water, the first to have the system running, says it is saving up to 15 per cent of its electricity bill at its biggest treatment works, Court Farm, supplying Cardiff and Newport. This should mean an annual saving of more than Pounds 100,000. The system, called WaterExpert and designed by Intellect Expert Systems, is also being developed at two of its other plants. The impetus for WaterExpert was the electricity price pool - the complex wholesale market set up when the electricity industry was privatised - and the need to match water demand with the optimum tariff. Michael Harrington, divisional operations manager for Welsh Water, says: 'With the electricity price changing 48 times a day, the only way to control that is with some form of expert system. It is a very difficult job to do it manually or mentally.' Fed into WaterExpert, which uses a PC with software tailored to each plant, are factors such as reservoir levels, river abstraction rates, water quality, weather forecast and likely demand. It then produces a 24-hour operation schedule, either on-line or off-line, to initiate the opening and shutting of pumps and valves. The plan is modified automatically to take account of changes in demand or a mechanical failure, but it can also be adjusted by the operator. Intellect Expert Systems says WaterExpert should pay for itself within a year and the company has orders from three other UK water companies. John Roberts, works controller at Court Farm, says: 'The system is very user friendly. It does save electricity costs and management time - there is not so much time spent with paper and pencil.'

A site in Cumbria close to Sellafield has been identified for an underground repository for mostly intermediate-level waste over 50 years. The repository is expected to be ready in 2010. FRANCE Some 78 per cent of electricity was produced by 58 reactors last year. Two sites are expected to be short-listed next year for an underground repository for long-lived waste. GERMANY Some 34 per cent of electricity is produced by 19 nuclear plants. Two sites are being considered for repositories - a former iron ore mine at Konrad and a site at Gorleben, both in Lower Saxony. An abandoned salt mine at Bartensleben in the former east German republic has been used since 1981 for low and intermediate-level waste. SWEDEN In 1980 it was decided all nuclear power stations - which currently produce about half of the country's electricity - would be to phased out by 2010. The exact timetable is still to be established. Low and intermediate-level waste is stored underground near the Forsmark nuclear plant, 50 metres below the bed of the Baltic Sea. Investigations are continuing to identify a site for high-level waste. BELGIUM Nuclear power produces 59 per cent of electricity. A potential site for the disposal of high-level and long-lived radioactive waste was identified in 1974 at Mol-Dessel in northern Belgium, where an underground laboratory has been working on feasibility studies since 1983.

While some electricity companies in the US have always been publicly owned, this is believed to be the first time a state has proposed buying out the shareholders of a private-sector company and bringing it into public ownership. Mr Mario Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York state, says the object of the takeover is to reduce electricity prices for Long Island consumers and businesses. At present, the rates charged by the Long Island Lighting Company - known to its few friends as Lilco - are the highest in the US, if not the world. The bid is likely to prove highly popular with the voters of Long Island. Significantly, it also happens to have been launched at a time when Mr Cuomo is locked in a fierce battle for re-election. Lilco's electricity prices are high because the company is burdened with Dollars 5.3bn of debt, the legacy of spending Dollars 5.5bn between 1973 and 1984 building a nuclear power station at Shoreham on Long Island, which was dismantled because of public concerns about safety. At present, Lilco's electricity rates are 16.1 cents per kWh for residential customers and 12.35 cents for industrial customers, roughly double the US average. Mr Cuomo says a takeover by the state will result in an immediate 10 per cent cut in those rates, plus another 10-15 per cent cut later. The financial logic of the bid is beguiling. Mr Cuomo says that, under public ownership, Lilco will no longer need to pay federal taxes or shareholder dividends, resulting in immediate savings of Dollars 250m a year. Later, its debt will be refinanced with cheaper public sector debt. The bid itself will be financed through an issue of tax-exempt revenue bonds. Yet if public ownership makes sense for Lilco, some argue, why not nationalise all the other private-sector utilities? Or for that matter, the rest of US industry? Mr James McFadden, a utilities analyst at the securities house Bear Stearns, says: 'The question is whether you want more utilities owned by the government sector or not. Most folks in this country would say you want smaller government, not bigger government, and this runs at cross-purposes with that.' On Friday Lilco said it was 'seriously evaluating' the proposal, but its shares were trading only Dollars 1 1/8 up at Dollars 17 5/8 , far short of the Dollars 21.50 a share proposed by New York state. At that price, the market is betting either that the Federal government will intervene to block the bid - or that Mr Cuomo will not be re-elected to pursue it.

Yesterday ScottishPower said it intended to begin by providing leased circuits for business customers, but would eventually offer telecommunications services to residential users. It has applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for a licence. It emerged yesterday that Scottish Hydro-Electric, which operates in northern Scotland, made an application a few weeks ago. No other electricity utility appears on the latest register of companies applying for telecommunications licences maintained by Oftel, the industry regulator, but others are expected to apply. Last year the government opened the UK telecommunications market to competition, encouraging utilities and other companies to apply for licences. ScottishPower, like other electricity companies, already has a large telecommunications network using packet switching and digital-data transmission between power stations and control rooms. It also has access to customers' premises through its electricity supply cables. The ducts through which these cables run can carry optical-fibre telecommunications cables without suffering electrical interference. ScottishPower intends to expand its telecommunications network and connect it to the premises of companies which wish to use its service. It will initially offer companies leased circuits for internal communications between sites. Mr Hugh Wilson, ScottishPower's telecommunications business manager who recently joined the company from BT, said it hoped to expand across the UK and overseas through links with other utilities. He said ScottishPower had already had discussions with other regional electricity companies. He would not say how much ScottishPower intended to invest in its telecommunications venture, but acknowledged that it would take hundreds of millions of pounds over a long period to make an impact. Hydro-Electric said it had applied for a licence within the last month but did not wish to comment further. For either company to offer a comprehensive service in Scotland would require them to co-operate and use the telecommunications links which already exist between them. PowerGen said it was not applying for a licence because, unlike the regional electricity companies and integrated utilities, it did not have connections to customers' premises. So far seven telecommunications companies have been granted licences by the DTI to operate services.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

The move follows last week's agreement between the two large power generators and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to restrain prices in the pool, the wholesale market for electricity. Seeboard's cut will apply to consumers of more than 100 kwh a year who have signed long-term supply contracts. Seeboard will also be offering the lower price to other potential customers in that bracket, all of whom will be free to shop around for electricity from April 1. Mr Stephen Gutteridge, the company's managing director of supply, said last night that Seeboard was the first company to make this cut. He said Seeboard wanted to demonstrate its loyalty to existing customers and sharpen its ability to compete for the large segment of the market that had not yet signed up for supply contracts. Last week's agreement, which includes a commitment by National Power and PowerGen to sell off several power stations, is supposed to reduce pool prices by up to 7 per cent. Mr Gutteridge said this was expected to lead to an average cut of 0.1p per kwh, and that Seeboard was passing on the full price reduction.

It is essential that the review takes full account of the interests of electricity customers and not just the interests of the supply industries. The needs of large industrial customers carried little weight in the decisions that were made on the restructuring and privatisation of the electricity industry, and price increases they have since suffered are making it difficult for them to justify reinvestment in Britain. Electricity prices to large users in this association have increased on average by a third over the past two years, with much higher increases in specific cases. The 'pool' price, which sets the level for industrial contracts, increased by 20 per cent last year, and is expected to rise again by 20 per cent this year, against a background of static or falling basic fuel prices. The prospect for next year, when the new coal deal comes into effect, is a further substantial increase and this expectation is based on estimates by the electricity supply industry. This is an aspect of energy policy that must be taken into account in the review that has been promised by the government.

He announced yesterday he would appoint an independent assessor to examine recent decisions by National Power and PowerGen, the two large electricity generators in England and Wales, to shut several coal-fired power stations. Prof Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply, will also bring forward his own review of the way electricity distribution companies buy their power supplies. The growing practice among distributors of building their own gas-fired power stations has triggered suggestions of 'sweetheart' deals which may be squeezing coal out. Prof Littlechild promised to report publicly on both issues by December, meaning that his findings can be fed into the full review of energy policy which has been promised by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in January. The two big generators announced on September 30 that they were closing 12 power stations. Although these represented less than 5 per cent of generating capacity in England and Wales, most of them were coal-burning. Under new licence conditions, Prof Littlechild has the power to investigate plant closures to ensure that they will not drive up electricity prices. If he thinks they will, he can recommend an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Prof Littlechild was reviewing power purchasing practices to ensure that they were economic before the coal crisis. He said last week he would accelerate the review because of concern about the gas deals, but yesterday's announcement was the first indication that he would try to fit in with Mr Heseltine's timetable. If the gas deals turn out to be uneconomic, the regulator can penalise the companies by disallowing their costs, but he cannot force them to stop using gas. As an independent regulator, the director-general of electricity supply can only be asked by Mr Heseltine to carry out certain tasks. But Prof Littlechild said last night: 'This was a decision I made myself. I think it is important to have an impartial and objective review. 'The most useful contribution I can make is to ensure that the electricity industry is operating efficiently.' PowerGen said the review was 'not unexpected. We fully understand the pressures currently facing Prof Littlechild'. Dr Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear utility, yesterday denied suggestions that nuclear power stations should be closed to make way for coal. He said this would be a 'quick fix' that would overlook the long-term benefits of nuclear power. Nuclear stations could generate electricity at a competitive price and without emitting gases into the air, he said. Although Nuclear Electric would receive Pounds 1.2bn in subsidy this year, it aimed to be profitable by 1995.

It already has a marketing deal with East Midlands Electricity. Manweb Gas will sell gas within and outside the Manweb region and will provide energy packages of electricity and gas to industrial and commercial customers of all sizes. It aims to compete with British Gas on price, and hopes to provide 'added-value' services similar to those it offers electricity customers, such as price forecasting to allow users to plan consumption. Mr Colin Leonard, director of power marketing, said Manweb would consider supply-ing household customers if the tariff market was de-regulated. He said: 'If competition moves downward in terms of size of user, then if it is profitable we would be interested in moving down with it.' The announcement brings to seven the regional electricity companies that have links with gas suppliers - evidence of a growing trend to combined gas and electricity marketing.

Northern's 30 per cent dividend rise demonstrates the benefits of buying back 10 per cent of its shares: the underlying increase was only 16 per cent. Eastern's pay-out is up 25 per cent, a tribute to its thorough cost cutting. Both regional electricity companies profited from moves away from distribution. This core business will suffer earnings decline when tougher price caps are implemented next year. Northern's focus on deregulated sales to customers buying more than 100kw of electricity was vindicated by a sharpincrease in profits from such sales. Eastern also saw profit from deregulated sales jump while power generation and gas supply made contributions too. Eastern says that in two years more than a quarter of profits should come from businesses other than distribution. Both companies are committed to reducing dividend cover to two times. Together with growth in unregulated income, this leaves scope for further dividend growth, despite next year's lower distribution profits. Politics has hurt electricity shares - Northern is the exception, due to bid speculation - but any windfall profits tax from a future Labour government remains relatively distant.

The votes of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs and three Democratic Unionist MPs could be crucial to win Commons approval for the proposals to be set out by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The two unionist parties made clear yesterday that they are anxious to help Northern Ireland's electricity users. MPs from the parties have already met Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. 'We will be looking at the impact of the government's energy review on the whole of the UK,' said one Ulster Unionist MP. Northern Ireland MPs complain that large electricity users in the province face charges up to 25 per cent higher than on the mainland. When MPs voted on the proposed pit closures in October, the DUP voted with Labour and the Ulster Unionist abstained - but only after a government assurance that its energy review would include Northern Ireland. The MPs could demand financial support for the proposed electricity inter-connector with Scotland, although the government is already backing an application for a European Community subsidy for the project. Unionists also want to boost the local lignite industry, perhaps by being awarded contracts for electricity generation.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

This will provide more grist for the mills of critics of electricity privatisation, who have attacked the 41 per cent increase announced on Monday by East Midlands Electricity, the first regional company to report. The result follows a warning on Monday from Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, that the privatised industry would not be allowed to make excessive profits. But Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, said the company was being fair to customers. 'Our tariff increase of only 1 per cent this year was one of the lowest in the industry,' he said. The company also pointed out that the underlying increase in profits was a more modest 20 per cent, close to the 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds 514m announced yesterday by National Power, Britain's largest electricity generator. Norweb's big increase last year was partly because - like all 12 regional electricity companies - it raised prices sharply in April 1991. This was to compensate for the previous year, when the companies undercharged customers. In addition, profits in the previous year were depressed by exceptional costs, particularly bad debts in the company's retail business. If both these factors were stripped out, Norweb said, underlying profit would have increased 20 per cent. National Power was the focus of attention yesterday when it came to job losses. It cut a further 2,400 jobs, while Norweb cut 280 jobs. National Power, which cut 3,000 jobs in the year to March, said this was part of a programme announced after privatisation, when it had around 17,000 staff. But it acknowledged it had revised proposed job cuts up from 5,000 to 8,000 last year. Both companies said lower electricity prices depended on the negotiations with British Coal, an important fuel supplier. 'Good progress has been made towards the sort of deal that will lead to real term reductions in the electricity price,' said Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power. And Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, said: 'We expect to keep our prices below inflation next year. How far below depends on the coal deal.'

0,FT933-11226 ,"FT933-11226 _AN-DG3CDAD3FT 930730   FT  30 JUL 93 / Critics cause a ripple in the pool: Pressures to reform the pricing policies of England and Wales's electricity market      By MICHAEL SMITH   The arcane and complex operation of England and Wales's electricity pool, the wholesale market through which power is traded, is not a subject on which much light is regularly thrown. The complex trading system leaves most observers in the dark. But when Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, publishes a review of prices today, its role and future strategy will be under the spotlight in a bout of public scrutiny. At issue is the future shape of the pool and, potentially, the survival in their present form of National Power and PowerGen, two of the UK's largest companies which help to run it. Prof Littlechild has warned that, if not satisfied with explanations from the two big generators about rises of up to 20 per cent in pool prices this year, he may refer them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Though a referral is unlikely for some months, today's report is likely to criticise the generators and strengthen Prof Littlechild's belief that reforms to the system are needed. He is not alone in this. Prompted by the lobbying of industrial energy users, which are the main victims of the price rises, the government is considering plans to enable some of them to bypass the pool and buy directly from 'dedicated' generators. This would have significant implications for most domestic electricity consumers who may see prices rise because they would have to pay a larger share of administration costs. Pool managers and the electricity companies have already set up their own review of operations to take the heat out of the debate. They are looking at how the system can be simplified, and whether changes should be made in transmission services and the bidding system which sets prices. Initial findings are expected in the autumn. The focus of attention is the trading system set up when the government privatised the electricity industry three years ago. The pool is run by executives appointed by the electricity companies. It is not a physical stock of electricity. Instead, it is a mechanism for setting electricity prices. After weighing up supply, which is made available at varying prices by generating companies, and demand, it sets the price of electricity for each half-hour period of the next day. Without it, or something like it, there would be too much or too little electricity at any one time. On a practical level, the pool has worked well. Electricity has been dispatched to where it is needed. As Prof Littlechild observes: 'The lights have stayed on.' Ministers note that most small industrial and household customers have benefited from lower prices since introduction of the pool. This is because their electricity needs have been covered by fixed-price 'hedging' contracts between generators and regional electricity companies, set several years ahead. Short-term changes in the pool price do not affect most consumers. But for large users buying directly from the pool, the latest price increases follow the end of a scheme which, until privatisation, provided them with cheap electricity generated from cut-price coal. The effect of the scheme's demise and pool price rises is demonstrated at Imperial Chemical Industries' chlorine plant at Runcorn, Merseyside, where power costs have risen by 70 per cent in the past two years. Plant managers believe they need to fall 40 per cent to bring costs into line with international competitors. Otherwise, they say, the long-term future of the site is in danger. Such large users are particularly irked because the pool increases come when fuel costs are falling as a result of British Coal price cuts. PowerGen and National Power argue that some of the price rise has been beyond their control, resulting from difficulties with the computer software which calculates prices, and disruptions to the grid caused by smaller generating companies being connected to it. National Power agrees that the prices it demands from the pool have risen since April, because contracts fixed at privatisation, which kept pool prices artificially low, ended in March. 'Today's bid prices reflect more realistically the cost of electricity production,' says Mr John Baker, chief executive. The complexity of the pool's operation makes argument against the generators an arduous task. 'It is difficult for an outsider to assess how the bid of a particular plant will affect the pool price,' according to one large electricity buyer. 'The generators, on the other hand, with a wealth of experience of the system, can design bids to achieve their particular aims.' The suggestion is that the generators have used their muscle in the market to push up pool prices. But they deny they abuse the system. While Prof Littlechild's report will help resolve the matter, some large industrial users believe a more effective way of reducing prices would be to persuade ministers to allow them to bypass the pool and buy direct from the generators. With pool-associated costs, including administration, amounting to 20 per cent of the final cost of a typical large user's power bill, the savings could be considerable. Intensive energy users justify their case by saying the costs of running the system are mainly associated with fluctuating demand, for which they blame mainly domestic users. Heavy, continuous process industries, such as pharmaceuticals, tend to want constant amounts of electricity each hour of each day of the year. 'Why should we pay for services, including expensive reserves, which are needed because others have less predictable demand?' asks Dr Richard Wills, an economist at the Major Energy Users' Council, representing large consumers. 'The innocent are paying for the actions of the guilty.' However, Mrs Margaret Thompson, pool chief executive, says that, if bypassing the pool means paying no pool-associated charges, 'then it isn't on. The domestic customer would pay. We can try to charge on a fairer basis but the pool cannot be used to provide subsidies.' She says she hopes the pool's internal review will make bypassing irrelevant. In it, the aims of participants vary, but they appear to agree the system should be made simpler and more transparent. The case for change is summarised by Prof Littlechild: 'The more transparency you have the more effective and competitive a market you have. If participants believe a market is open and simple they are more likely to find it satisfactory.' One way to simplify the market would be to abolish the system whereby generators provide five different prices for each individual generating unit of each power station. 'There ought to be a simpler way,' says Mrs Thompson. 'The engineers say it is important that the information is there. The question is whether the information needs to feed into how the prices are set.' Most intensive energy users are more interested in another proposal being considered by the pool: whether it is prepared to accept 'demand-side bidding' proposals. These would provide payments for electricity users who agree to reduce their consumption when the load on the system is high. Among the advantages of such bidding are greater predictability of demand and a cost reduction. Pool executive members are concerned this would be a back-door method of cutting prices for large users. 'I'm not sure that agreeing not to take electricity, in effect doing nothing, is a service which demands payment,' said one. 'However it might be a more perfect market if demand-side bidding was introduced.' The third area under review by the pool involves transmission services, including whether the National Grid, which runs the electricity system, can be provided with new incentives to cut costs. Under existing arrangements, the grid passes on all the costs of administering the pool to customers. It has suggested a complicated reform, backed by hedging contracts with electricity companies, under which it would increase its exposure to risk but would expect to make a profit from doing so. Interesting though the idea may be, the calculations on which is it based do not have the quality of simplicity. That is the problem for most of the options under consideration by the pool. 'The fact is that people are talking at cross purposes,' says an insider. 'It is highly unlikely that you can introduce new rules and expect simplification at the same time.' Given the complexities and the need for consensus, the pool is likely to take several months to implement any reforms. In the meantime, prices show no signs of falling. Pressure for action by the pool or the government is not likely to ease; nor is speculation about the generators' bidding behaviour and a potential monopolies reference.

The plans, which are likely to be approved by the European Commission on Wednesday, have been watered down since last summer, partly to win the support of some sceptical commissioners and member states. However, they will be fiercely opposed by the gas and electricity industries. If approved, the draft directives will enable users of more than 100 GW/hours of electricity a year, or more than 25m cubic metres of gas annually, to buy their energy from suppliers anywhere in the Community from January 1, 1993, subject to capacity being available. The threshold should apply to heavy users of gas, such as fertiliser and chemical plants, and electricity consumers ranging from the largest aluminium and steel factories down to glass-making. In theory, larger energy distributors would also be able to pick suppliers outside their home country, thus passing on the benefits of competition to smaller consumers. The plans would also allow competing companies to generate electricity and build power lines and gas pipelines, and would insist on separating the management and accounting of integrated production, transmission and distribution operations. Regulation would largely be left to each state. The first stage of energy liberalisation has already been introduced, in the form of two directives forcing utilities to allow the transport of gas and electricity across EC borders. Brussels officials hope this second stage will prompt industrial users not covered by the new directives to press for further opening of access to energy networks. Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, EC energy commissioner, decided to adopt a phased approach last autumn, dropping more aggressive plans to use special legal powers to break energy monopolies. He has now discussed the new ideas with all 12 EC energy ministers. 'It was much easier to sell the idea in this form; and in three or four countries we were surprised to receive a favourable reception when beforehand it was more difficult,' he said last week. But some member states - most notably the Netherlands and Germany which are protective of their gas producers - and the industries themselves will fight attempts to push for increased third party access to networks.

The National Grid, which runs the electricity transmission system in England and Wales, also asked large industrial users to consider signing up to be cut off at short notice in return for savings on their annual bills of about 10 per cent. The proposals mark the latest move to increase the flexibility of the electricity supply system where power generation is in the hands of the National Power and PowerGen duopoly. National Grid pays Pounds 310m a year to the two generators for a series of back-up services required to run a safe, and economic electricity supply. These costs are, in turn, passed on to consumers. If large users, and eventually, domestic customers, agree to be cut off during peak periods, the National Grid will not require certain back-up services such as plant held in reserve (by the generators) to meet surges in demand. 'By securing an alternative supply for these vital services, we are expanding competition into this area,' Mr Charles Davis, National Grid's commercial manager, said at a seminar for 100 representatives of the UK's largest electricity-using businesses.

Imperial Chemical Industries was prompted by the profits announcement to re-emphasise its call for lower prices at a meeting with Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator. The subsidy or levy, which adds 11 per cent to electricity bills, has long been a sore point with large users. 'We think the size and concept of the levy should be reconsidered in the light of the profitability of Nuclear Electric,' said Mr Chris Hampson, director of ICI. The company's electricity bill was substantially higher than last year, making it hard to compete with other European companies, he said. The Major Energy Users Council, a lobby group representing large electricity consumers, called for a cut in the subsidy. 'When I think that our group is subsidising Nuclear Electric to the tune of Pounds 5m it makes me very annoyed,' said Mr John Topliss, chairman of the council's electricity group. The council is waiting for Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, to reply to a written appeal. Mr Doug Rodger, who heads the Chemical Industries Association, also called for the levy to be ended. 'I think the government should take another look in the light of this improved performance and see if there is scope to give large users a break,' he said. Offer said yesterday the levy had always been designed to lapse in 1998, and it looked forward to that date. But Prof Littlechild, is understood to be considering ending the levy earlier. Yesterday's results for the year to March 1992 show that Nuclear Electric would not have made a profit without the subsidy. Its turnover would have more than halved to Pounds 1.17bn, giving an operating loss of Pounds 783m, rather than a profit of Pounds 482m. That would have turned its bottom line profit of Pounds 62m, after provisions for waste disposal and redundancies, into a loss. Mr John Collier, Nuclear Electric's chairman, who attacked critics of the levy, confirmed that the company intended to be profitable without it by 1995. Nuclear Electric will have to demonstrate it is economically viable when the government reviews the future of the nuclear industry in 1994. Mr Collier said the main force behind improving profitability would be increased output. Nuclear Electric's power stations generated 7.5 per cent more electricity last year, giving it an 18.5 per cent share of the electricity market, compared with 17.4 per cent the previous year. Profits would also be improved through job cuts and savings in goods, materials and services, Mr Collier said. The company confirmed it planned to cut 3,500 jobs by 1995. Operating costs per unit had already fallen in real terms, the company said, from 4.2p in the year to March 1991, to 3.9p this year.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "

South Asia faces a threat from  India, not Pakistan, which wants to meet its power shortfall by  utilizing nuclear energy. Pakistan has no other option but to  build its own nuclear reactor to meet its energy requirements.  He made these observations while addressing the 23d graduation  and awards ceremony at the Center for Nuclear Studies.    Pakistan is faced with the problem of increasing its power  output. The existing resources cannot produce an adequate  amount of electricity to meet the requirements of the  industrial, agricultural, and trade sectors as well as domestic  consumers. That is why the country has to cut power  distribution every year, thereby affecting industrial and  agricultural production and disrupting people's normal lives.  Increasing electricity production is essential for Pakistan's  all-around development. The country's existing thermal and  hydroelectric power stations are generating electricity at full  capacity; to produce additional power, Pakistan will have to  utilize nuclear energy.    France is an example for everyone. That country meets most  of its energy requirements with its nuclear power stations.  Pakistan can also become self-sufficient in electricity  production. The nuclear power plant in Karachi has been running  successfully for the past 20 to 22 years, and the expertise  gained with this plant can be utilized to operate other nuclear  power stations. The country can rely on the expertise of  Pakistani scientists and technical experts to build nuclear  reactors to generate electricity.     "
0,FT944-2953 ,"FT944-2953 _AN-ELOCSAFDFT 941215   FT  15 DEC 94 / Trafalgar House Stalks Northern Electric: Trafalgar action puts industry on defensive - A hostile bid for an electricity utility has political ramifications as well as stirring up an already agitated sector      By MICHAEL SMITH   Until yesterday the received wisdom among executives of the English and Welsh regional electricity companies was that they were safe from hostile predators. 'There are not enough costs left to be cut out to make it worthwhile for an aggressor to pay a hostile bid premium,' said one chief executive yesterday morning. Trafalgar House, the engineering and construction group, is not convinced, as its afternoon statement confirmed. And if it goes ahead with the takeover bid it has been considering for Northern Electric, it will be upsetting more than just the sector executives' sense of security about remaining independent. The repercussions of a bid will be felt far beyond the north-east of England, which is the electricity company's base, and far beyond the sector. A bid would have significant political implications, with power privatisation a growing focus of political debate. Yesterday, shares of all 12 regional electricity companies rose strongly as analysts and investors digested the implications of the first moves towards a contested takeover in the sector since it was privatised four years ago. Other companies considered vulnerable to takeovers included South Wales Electricity, South Western Electricity, Seeboard, based in the south-east, and Cheshire-based Manweb. With one prospective hostile bidder already having shown its hand, others are more likely to emerge, either to enter the fray for Northern, or to focus on another target before it is swallowed up. Potential bidders could include US utilities seeking a stream of earnings outside their own tightly regulated areas or UK conglomerates such as Hanson. The 12 companies may feel forced into each other's arms. Most industry executives would prefer to get together with another regional electricity company rather than face the risk of a non-sector company taking them over. The urge to merge may become overwhelming for some. But a second line of defence will be to accelerate the process of passing out any 'hidden value' in the companies to shareholders before a hostile predator promises to do it for them. That makes an intensification of cost-cutting and job shedding inevitable. It also increases the likelihood, already strong, that the National Grid will be floated next year. Many analysts believe that the Grid's value is not yet fully reflected in the 12 companies' share prices and will not become so until it is fully demerged from their ownership. All these developments will take place in the full public glare. The Labour Party has sensed that it can win votes through its attacks on electricity privatisation and has been on the attack this week over job losses and the National Grid flotation, which it says will benefit rec shareholders greatly but customers and the taxpayer far less. The government's inclination will be to intervene in electricity as little as possible and to let the market decide the industry's future. However, its ownership of a golden share in each of the recs and the National Grid until April 1 means that it has the power to intervene, and Labour may challenge it to do so. Even after the golden share ends, the government may have to confront wider competition issues if merger mania leads to widespread consolidation. By some estimates, today's 12 companies could shake down into four or five super-utilities, possibly owning regional water and gas companies as well. The role of Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, will also come under close public scrutiny. In the eyes of the Labour Party he is one of the villains of the piece, since it is under his regulation that the companies have been able to become so profitable and therefore so attractive to predators. There are likely to be calls on Prof Littlechild to ensure that consumers are protected, for example by ring-fencing cash piles accrued by the companies so that bidders cannot use them for non-electricity purposes. But like the government, Prof Littlechild is a strong believer in the market and is unlikely to want to intervene simply to preserve the industry structure introduced at privatisation in 1990. The structure was inherited from pre-privatisation days. The government considered various options, but in the end decided to privatise the regional electricity structure as it was. The 12 area boards thus became 12 regional companies. 'The whole industry was being changed,' said one former government adviser yesterday. 'We were breaking up the Central Electricity Generation Board but the area distribution structure seemed not unreasonable because it had been developed over a number of years.' If the government's decision against reforming the regional electricity structure has proved uncontroversial, the same cannot be said of the price regulation it put in place. Even the executives of the companies acknowledge, in retrospect, that the targets for cutting prices in the distribution businesses which provide their main income have proved to be extremely lax. The companies have been able to cut costs by far more than they expected, largely through implementing reductions in workforces of more than 25 per cent on average. Distribution prices have meanwhile been able to rise. The result is that the companies have become considerably more profitable than they were intended to be and have been able to accrue large cash piles. The sector's shares have performed better than any other in the past four years. Nor is the share price growth expected to end there. Prof Littlechild is widely viewed to have missed the opportunity to rein in the companies' profitability in the regulatory review he announced in August, and which is to be implemented next April. Stockbrokers' analysts believe that virtually all companies will be able to increase their dividends by about 8 per cent a year in real terms for the next four years at least. In the current results season, rises of more than 20 per cent have been the norm. In utility stocks dividend growth is one of the key assessment criteria. All of this means that even following recent share price rises, many stockbroking analysts have been advising their clients to buy at least some of the companies in the sector. Whichever predators move in, they will have to reckon with a steadily toughening competitive climate. Prof Littlechild is liberalising the electricity market so that by 1998, all the regional barriers will be gone and each distributor will be able to sell wherever he likes. No country in the world will have such an open electricity market, and the uncertainties will be considerable.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NORTHERN ELECTRIC: ITS SIZE AND PERFORMANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Share price                            Market              Customers                    % rise Dec 1     capitalisation                  to Dec 14 1994      (Pounds bn)           (million)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London                11.2             1.61                 1.94 Seeboard             20.92             1.16                 1.94 Southern             11.02             2.14                 2.53 South Western        21.29             1.04                 1.27 South Wales           8.53             0.84                 0.93 Manweb                9.78             0.99                 1.32 Eastern              13.19             1.97                 3.09 East Midlands         4.11             1.48                 2.20 Midlands             11.67             1.70                 2.16 NORWEB                5.82             1.38                 2.13 Yorkshire             9.94             1.55                 2.00 Northern             39.89             1.25                 1.42  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Trafalgar House.

National Grid, the privatised UK electricity distributor, is taking part in the study scheme along with Eastern Electric, the largest of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales. Kvaerner A/S, one of Scandinavia's largest industrial groups and a leading member of the consortium, said the 456-mile link between Lista, in Norway and Walpole, eastern England, could cost pounds 380m. Other partners in the study include Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss power engineering group; Siemens of Germany; and Alcatel Cable of France. National Grid said that it joined the study-team following an invitation from the Norwegian-led consortium. But it warned that it would be several months before initial studies are completed. The proposed link, which could be operational by the late 1990s, would have just under half the capacity of the existing cross-Channel Anglo-French electricity inter-connector. Although a National Grid spokesman said that the planned cable 'would have a capacity for a two-way flow', Norwegian power officials regard its main importance as an export line. National Grid said a decision on whether to proceed with a full-scale feasibility appraisal will be taken 'once we have fully assessed the present study'. The threat of future supplies of Norwegian hydro-power will put further pressure on domestic deep-mined coal as a viable means of electricity generation.   Companies:-  National Grid.

The bizarre prospect is raised in a report, published today, that calls for a fundamental review of the regulation of the electricity industry and its impact on investment. The report says that the rush of new entrants into the generating business since privatisation might be damaging. Most new projects have to run all the time to be economic and are on fuel supply contracts that oblige them to take fuel whether they need it or not. The result might be a situation in which generators are forced to bid zero or even negative prices to sell into the pool where electricity is traded. Low pool prices will encourage large users to purchase short-term, which will further undermine the development of an orderly contract market. The study blames booming capacity on the failure of the pool to provide the right price signals, and lack of clarity from the electricity regulator. It also warns that consumers will eventually have to pay more for electricity because of the high cost of the new gas-turbine generators which are driving out old coal-fired stations. The report concludes: 'There is a real danger of volatile swings in investment, detrimental to electricity customers'. Generation in the 1990s: Electricity capacity and new power projects.

The company, which owns and operates the electricity grid in England and Wales, said yesterday it would set up a subsidiary called Telecom Electric to develop this business. National Grid is the latest company to apply for a telecommunications licence, following the government's decision last year to open the market to competition. Until then BT, the UK's largest telecommunications group, and Mercury Communications, its smaller rival, had exclusive rights to provide basic telephone services. Telecom Electric would lay telecommunication cables alongside its existing electricity cables, but does not have any plans to supply domestic consumers. 'We are only looking at a particular sector of the market,' National Grid stressed. 'We would supply major organisations that already have their own networks, for example between their different sites.' The company said the project was quite distinct from its earlier plans, in conjunction with the regional electricity companies of England and Wales, to invest about Pounds 400m in a complete telecommunications network. 'That was a year ago; this is much smaller,' the company said. Last month the two Scottish electricity companies became the first in the sector to apply for telecommunications licences. Earlier this month Yorkshire Electric, a supply company, took a minority stake in Ionica, a private group which has been awarded a licence to provide a telecommunications service using radio links. Two other utilities, British Rail and British Waterways, have also applied for licences.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

0,FT922-9902 ,"FT922-9902 _AN-CEEBIADYFT 920505   FT  05 MAY 92 / Power chief sees threat to coal sell-off      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   PLANS TO privatise British Coal could founder if the electricity market is not urgently reformed, according to Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the generator. He called on Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to intervene, and said the electricity pool, or wholesale market, could collapse because of the many gas-fired power stations being built. His warning, which comes as National Power and its rival generator PowerGen prepare to meet Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, is a sign that National Power is seeking to ensure a future for its coal-fired power stations, which must compete with the independent gas stations. Mr Eggar is expected to press for an agreement on the amount and price of coal sold by British Coal to the generators. British Coal cannot be privatised until it signs contracts with the generators because it relies on them for most of its revenue. Mr Baker said the generators could not agree to buy coal unless they could sell the coal-fired power on to regional electricity companies. This now looks increasingly unlikely because National Grid, which owns and operates the electricity network, has warned that England and Wales will have 60 per cent too much electricity by 1997. The prospect of that surplus is forcing generators to jostle for long-term contracts to sell their power to customers. But Mr Baker said the market was not 'an even playing field'. Many of the new gas stations had equity links with regional electricity companies which had also signed contracts to take their output. That could leave National Power and PowerGen short of contracts, even if their stations produced cheaper power. They would have to sell their power into the pool, where the surplus could force prices close to zero. The gas stations could make 45m tonnes of British Coal's output redundant by the end of the decade, Mr Baker said. 'Why aren't the regional companies talking to us?' he asked. 'Why have all 12 signed long-term contracts without testing the market?' Mr Baker said the regulator should act quickly to check whether the regional companies were breaking the rule that compels them to buy the most economic power for their customers. 'I would like to see the regulator make a decision before we sign the contracts with British Coal  - if only a statement of intent,' he said. 'If the regulator said the regional companies could do exactly as they liked, then by definition we would have less confidence about signing long-term coal contracts.' He said the regional companies should be required to invite tenders from generators. But several regional electricity companies said they had had no offers of long-term contracts to buy coal-fired electricity from National Power. 'We would take a good coal offer,' one said, 'but that offer has not been made.' The regional companies also pointed out that the rules allowed them to meet only up to 15 per cent of their demand from the new gas-fired stations, and most had not even signed up that much power. But the chief executive of one regional company said there were legitimate fears that some companies had agreed to buy uncompetitive power from the new stations. And they might pass this higher cost on to consumers unless Offer, the electricity watchdog, decided to penalise regional companies for uneconomic purchasing. Offer shows no signs of responding quickly. It said it would start work on reviewing the issue later this year.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

0,FT943-9256 ,"FT943-9256 _AN-EHLDRAB6FT 940812   FT  12 AUG 94 / Littlechild bids 3% in power poker game: Electricity review aims to cut costs; Investment plans reduced; Dividend growth predicted      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   The new electricity price controls announced yesterday emerged after what can only be described as a high-stakes game of poker between the electricity industry and its regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild. The aim of the review was to bring down electricity bills by forcing electricity companies to become more efficient and cut costs. But the consultations between Prof Littlechild and company managements inevitably focused on where and how cost savings could be achieved. It was in the companies' interests to exaggerate their costs and to convince the regulator that it would be difficult to bring them down. It was up to the regulator to call their bluff, then set targets which were demanding but fair. After more than a year of consultation and bargaining his key conclusion is that companies should be able to cut their costs by 3 per cent a year on average - slightly less in sparsely populated areas to allow for unavoidable costs such as the extra expense of distributing electricity. He originally proposed 4 per cent, but was persuaded that this was unrealistic. The 3 per cent level, which some companies still think is too high, compares with the 2 per cent annual cost saving target recently set for the water industry, which is generally judged to be more bloated than electricity. Prof Littlechild also decided to cut the companies' investment plans. These showed large increases over past budgets, and, with a total Pounds 6.2bn for the five years up to 2000, seemed to be more than was required to maintain and expand the system. So he trimmed them by 10 per cent to Pounds 5.6bn overall, with some companies suffering cuts of 25 per cent. He also put the companies' cost of capital at 7 per cent. Although Prof Littlechild says that he used evidence from a variety of sources to determine this statistic, he does not say how he actually reached it, other than to note that it is in the middle of the 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent range which has been proposed for British Gas. The level set for water was 5 per cent to 6 per cent. In setting the price controls Prof Littlechild decided that some electricity companies had already reaped greater rewards than others from efficiency improvements. So he divided them into three categories with progressively tougher targets. But companies and analysts complained yesterday that it was not clear how he had selected the 'winners and losers'. Mr Nick Pink, analyst at SG Warburg, said: 'The result is a fudge'. The last stage in the process was to decide whether to introduce price cuts all at once or over a number of years. The outcome - big cuts of 11 per cent to 17 per cent in the first year followed by a succession of small 2 per cent cuts - is essentially a compromise, although it also suits the electricity companies because they can afford to take a big hit now, and will then have easier targets in the more uncertain future. Many factors complicated the process. One is the National Grid Company, which the electricity companies own jointly but intend to sell next year. The value of this company, estimated at up to Pounds 4bn, and the effect of disposal on the companies' balance sheets had to be taken into account. So did the fact that full competition will be permitted in the electricity market in 1998, after which price regulation should have less meaning. However, Prof Littlechild has decided to extend the new regime up to 2000 because he believes it needs that long to have its full effect. A further factor is the strong possibility that electricity companies will merge or be taken over now that the uncertainty of the review is out of the way. Prof Littlechild seemed unclear yesterday about how this might affect the controls on companies involved. Although the regulator's main aim was to trim prices which he believed had reached unacceptable levels, he also had to bear in mind the return for shareholders. He thinks there is enough leeway in the new controls to allow companies to continue to pay adequate dividends. This was certainly the view of the stock market, where analysts were predicting strong real growth in payments to shareholders. The one issue on which Prof Littlechild was powerless to take direct action was the most inflammatory of all - chairmen's salaries. By unfortunate timing his announcement coincided with newspaper headlines on the Pounds 1m pay-off for Mr Bryan Weston, the two-days-a-week chairman of Manweb. Executive salaries 'were a matter for the companies, not the regulator,' he said. But he stressed that his new controls assumed that companies would have to cut wage bills, and any extravagant pay deals would have to be at the shareholder's rather than the consumer's expense.

0,FT941-9838 ,"FT941-9838 _AN-EBMAKABNFT 940212   FT  12 FEB 94 / Power deal disappoints suppliers      By MICHAEL SMITH   Several electricity distributors were disappointed with Professor Stephen Littlechild's settlement with National Power and PowerGen - but the Major Energy Users' Association was full of praise for it. The council said the agreement reached by the electricity industry regulator delivered 'exactly' what they needed and was welcome news for heavy industry as it struggled to recover from recession. It said power-plant sales by the two generators would speed the transition to a proper competitive market and the regulator had been right to insist on a price cap. The regulator has agreed not to refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission but complainants, including consumers' associations, pointed out that the settlement would be of limited benefit to householders. Losers include Nuclear Electric, the third big generator in England and Wales, and, in the short term, other independent power companies. Prof Littlechild's oft-stated intention is to bring as much competition to the market as possible. It is ironic that the loudest complainants about yesterday's settlement were from the very companies that he is trying to encourage to improve the market. 'We do not understand why he thinks that artificially depressing prices will encourage competition,' said Mr David Porter, representing the Association of Independent Electricity Producers. The association argues that the lower the rewards that generators can make from electricity the less likely they are to want to build new plants. Some of the regional electricity companies also felt aggrieved. They say they were not consulted or warned about the changes in prospective pool prices. The changes will have a considerable impact on contracts they have been negotiating with users of 100kWh and above who from April will be able to choose who supplies them with power. Yorkshire Electricity was one of several companies inundated with calls from 100kWh customers who wanted to know the implications. Several regionals fear pressure to renegotiate contracts. Yesterday's settlement will have only a marginal effect on regional power companies' profitability since most of the power they buy from the generators is on long-term contracts backed by hedging agreements. Some may even benefit because prices of electricity not covered by hedging contracts will fall. All of the regional companies were relieved that Prof Littlechild avoided a reference to the commission which would have disrupted the whole market. But perhaps the biggest sighs of relief yesterday were from the electricity generators, the companies whose price-bidding behaviour sparked the inquiry, the results of which were published yesterday. They had the most to lose. Prof Littlechild's investigation found no evidence of abuse by either company of their market position. More importantly, the settlement will be less punitive than some analysts had feared and will leave both companies with considerable market clout and profits at the end of the two years that the deal lasts. The two main elements of the agreement are a cap on prices that the generators charge, and therefore the price in the electricity pool, and an agreement that the generators 'use all reasonable endeavours' to sell up to 6,000MW of their generating plant. The impact of the cap could be to reduce potential prices in the pool by about 7 per cent but some analysts were suggesting yesterday that this assumes that prices had continued at the high levels of the first half of this financial year. Prices have fallen since then. The companies were stressing that the cap was on prices rather than on profits; National Power talked about a 'modest adverse impact' on its future profitability. Analysts were downgrading their profits forecast for the next two years, when the cap will be in force, but not by amounts that would upset their expectations on dividend growth, one of the main criteria by which electricity companies are judged by the market. SG Warburg Securities thought the settlement would cost National Power Pounds 40m a year in profits over the next two years and PowerGen Pounds 20m. It expects National Power to make pre-tax profits next year of Pounds 650m, down on this year's expected Pounds 670m, and PowerGen to make Pounds 470m, about level with this year's forecast. But the cap is temporary, a makeshift arrangement while competition develops more fully. The success of the settlement will depend on how the generators dispose of their plants in the future. The regulator was yesterday putting a different gloss on the plant disposals agreement than the generators. While he warned that he may renew his threat to refer the generators at the end of next year if they had not made satisfactory progress on the sales, PowerGen was warning that it was not going to be rushed into a fire sale. There could yet be significant arguments over the sale price of the plant. The likelihood is that the generators will make at least some of the disposals. But even if they do there is no guarantee that this will lead to lower prices. This is because prices in the wholesale electricity pool are determined by the most expensive plant needed to run the system. The most expensive plants may still be in the hands of National Power and PowerGen because anything they sell is likely to be offered at low prices by the new owner to make the purchase economically viable. If that were the case the generators would find it easier to lift their prices again when the cap ends. Prof Littlechild's work is far from from over.   Companies:-  National Power.     PowerGen.

0,FT933-7140 ,"FT933-7140 _AN-DHXDHABLFT 930824   FT  24 AUG 93 / Welsh wind farm project unveiled      By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent   PROPOSALS for a wind farm in Wales will be set out today, as increasing tensions emerge among environmentalists about whether to support wind power. Trigen Windpower, a venture by British, Japanese and Californian renewable energy specialists, is seeking planning permission from Port Talbot council for the Pounds 4m project. It wants to erect 66 170ft-high turbines on forestry land near Hirwaun, Mid-Glamorgan. Earlier this month Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, approved a wind farm in Cornwall, overturning the local authority. Two more wind projects have been referred to Mr Gummer, and a further six are on appeal after having been refused by councils. Some environmental groups, such as Greenpeace, want more electricity generated by wind power to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the gases implicated in global warming. But others, such as the Council for the Protection of Rural England, say the turbines disfigure the countryside, while local residents have complained about noise. There are also concerns about the cost: electricity generated from wind power costs up to 12p for a kilowatt hour compared with the 2.5p-3p that electricity fetches on the wholesale market, and the 8p that households pay for it. Trigen said its 20MW farm would provide enough electricity for 17,000 homes and would have a minimal impact on the landscape and local residents. It would be fed into Port Talbot's power supply. Trigen said: 'A coal-fired power station, producing the same amount of electricity, would also produce over 1m tonnes of carbon dioxide as well as other damaging pollutants.'

0,FT934-3774 ,"FT934-3774 _AN-DLGD5AGUFT 931207   FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (11): Conservation must replace reactors - Christopher Brown-Humes on Sweden's dilemmas      By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES   Long cold winters, energy-intensive industries such as forestry, and a general emphasis on the environment provide Sweden with plenty of incentives to save energy. However, the more immediate stimulus to the country's energy-saving drive has come from a 1980 parliamentary decision to phase out nuclear power completely by the year 2010. It is ambitious because Sweden's 12 reactors supply nearly half of its electricity needs. If it is to be met, conservation and enhanced efficiency will have a significant role to play, as will alternative, environmentally-friendly sources of power. The country's record on energy efficiency is relatively encouraging. Since 1970 total consumption has fallen from 375 terawatt hours (twh) to 368 twh last year, thanks to lower usage by industry and households. Dependency on imported oil has been sharply reduced. However, electricity consumption has risen steadily over the period, as the country has become more dependent on hydroelectric and nuclear power to compensate for the reduced oil burn. Electricity use has risen by an average of 3.6 per cent a year since 1970 to reach 138 twh last year. In the last few years there has been a slowing in the rate at which electricity demand has grown, thanks partly to the three-year long recession, but estimates still suggest it will rise by around 1.5 per cent a year between now and the year 2000. This trend is worrying, given the ambition to phase out nuclear power. Hence a target to cut electricity consumption by at least 10 twh by the year 2000 featured as one of the major components in the government's 1991 energy bill. The bill also placed significant emphasis on promoting alternative fuel sources such as biomass (for combined heat and power plants), wind and solar power. The bill included a SKr3.7bn allocation for the promotion of energy efficiency through a programme which was initially designed to run for five years but which has now been extended to mid-1998. One of the biggest slices of the cake - SKr1bn - is intended to support conservation, particularly through the procurement of more energy-efficient technology. Much of the work in this area has been carried out by Nutek, a government body within the Department of Industry and Commerce. Its task has been to bring producers and consumers together to find ways of producing equipment and materials which use less electricity and prevent heat loss. This covers everything from fridges and freezers to windows and high-frequency lights. The programme claims considerable success in the sense that some fridge/freezer models have been developed which are 40 per cent more efficient, while windows have been produced which are 50 per cent more effective in preventing heat loss. The problem has been that the recession and a massive slump in building activity have delayed the rate at which the new technology might otherwise have been installed. The programmes have had a relatively modest impact so far, and results in most cases have yet to be quantified. But even assuming the conservation drive is successful, the question of how the country is going to compensate for the loss of nuclear power, which last year supplied 43 per cent of its electricity needs, remains largely unanswered. This is the most important question in the whole debate: will nuclear power be phased out as planned? Many observers expect the 2010 deadline to slip. They believe that with memories of Chernobyl fading, and the good safety record of Sweden's own reactors, there is less pressure for a complete phase-out. Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, has called the deadline 'artificial'. The 1991 government bill itself is vague on the subject saying only that 'the juncture at which the phase-out ..can begin and the rate at which it can proceed will hinge on the results of electricity conservation measures, the supply of electricity from environmentally friendly power production and the possibilities of maintaining internationally-competitive prices.' One of the difficulties is that parliament has effectively limited Sweden's ability to expand hydro-electric power generation, the country's most important source of electricity, by saying it will not harness the four remaining undammed rivers in the north. Electricity from combined heat and power plants might be able to take up part of the strain, although only 3.4 twh of electricity from this source was generated in 1991. The government has set aside SKr1bn of its SKr3.7bn allocation for energy efficiency support specifically to promote CHP production based on bio-fuels, such as wood chips. This includes grants both for new CHP facilities and the conversion of old ones. The answer to the electricity crunch could also see greater co-operation with Nordic neighbours in the more deregulated energy market now beginning to emerge in the region. But it is too early to quantify the extent of such collaboration. Whatever happens, there are those who fear that the best Sweden's energy efficiency programmes can hope to achieve is a delay in the need to build new power plants. Current forecasts suggest there will, in any case, be no need for new power capacity until around the year 2000. Critics say that Sweden's energy conservation drive is being undermined by low prices and a tax structure designed to keep export-dependent industry internationally competitive. There should be no surprise about pricing, given that supply has exceeded demand during the current recession. Taxes, though, do seem to have been kept relatively low to favour industry. For example, an energy tax on fuel and electricity consumption was scrapped for industry as from the start of this year. Households are still required to pay this tax, and the rate at which they pay tax on carbon dioxide emissions is four times higher than that paid by industry. Some worry that low energy costs are conserving Sweden's old industrial culture based around forestry, mining and steel when the country should be doing more to promote the development of high-technology businesses.

Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, announced yesterday that the levy on bills would be cut from 11 per cent to 10 per cent. Offer, the office of electricity regulation, estimates that the cut should reduce the typical household electricity bill by Pounds 2.42 a year. The levy, introduced in 1990, compensates electricity companies for having to buy a portion of their power from more expensive sources such as nuclear and renewables. In 1992-93 the levy will raise about Pounds 1.3bn, virtually all of which goes to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear power generator. The levy is due to be phased out by 1998. Prof Littlechild said the cut represented a downward trend in support for the nuclear power industry. He also said that in future a larger proportion of the levy would be paid to renewables such as wind power. A new public inquiry into British Nuclear Fuels' reprocessing plant at Sellafield could cost BNF Pounds 100m, Mr John Guinness, BNF chairman, said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes. He said the extra cost would be borne by the taxpayer because BNF was government-owned. He added that each week's delay in starting BNF's Thorp reprocessing plant was costing Pounds 2m in related costs and lost profit. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental groups, said that part of Thorp's funding was illegal because the government had broken EC rules by failing to notify the European Commission of Pounds 2.5bn given to BNF.

0,FT922-8306 ,"FT922-8306 _AN-CENCNAAVFT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (11): House calls may end - Meter men become an endangered species      By CLIVE COOKSON   ELECTRONIC meters combined with modern communications technology could transform the relationship between electricity suppliers and their customers. Two-way communications enable the supplier to read the meter remotely whenever it wants, without needing to visit the premises. And more significantly, they enable the consumer automatically to buy electricity from competing suppliers at the most advantageous price. The UK electricity industry and meter manufacturers have been experimenting with remote meter reading on a relatively small scale for more than 10 years. But there was no impetus to introduce the technology nationwide - until last January when Offer, the Office of Electricity Regulation, published a consultation paper on electronic metering. It says the industry should have 'a framework of modern metering and communications' in place by 1998, the date by which the UK's 22m households will be free to choose between alternative suppliers. Prof Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of electricity supply, has become an enthusiastic advocate of modern metering, in the face of widespread doubt and scepticism inside the industry. The electricity companies are frightened by the cost of giving every home an electronic meter and communications links, estimated at well over Pounds 1bn. They doubt whether many domestic consumers actually want such sophisticated service. And they fear confusion if incompatible systems are set up, using different methods of communication. However the companies know that in the face of the regulator's enthusiasm, they have to respond positively to the Offer paper. The Electricity Association is expected to submit a response on behalf of the industry next month. Three alternative ways of communicating between electronic meter and electricity supplier have been developed: Radio signalling is already used on a large scale in the UK as a one-way communication system to households on the Economy 7 tariff. The electricity companies send coded messages via BBC long-wave broadcasts to small receivers fitted beside the meters. The signals (which are inaudible on an ordinary radio set) activate switches to alter the tariff on a multi-rate meter or turn selected appliances such as electric heaters on and off. This system cannot be used for remote meter reading or two-way communications. However mobile radio systems have been developed in the US to read meters: vans equipped with short-range transmitters and receivers tour the streets, sending signals to nearby houses; the signals activate a transmitter in the meter, which sends its reading in code back to the van. Telephone is the simplest technology for communicating between consumer and supplier. Equipment is available to connect an electronic meter to the household phone line. The electricity supplier can then interrogate the meter automatically to receive a reading or change the tariff. But disagreements between telephone companies and the electricity utilities over pricing and technical arrangements have delayed the introduction of telephone-based meter communications in the US and UK. Mains-borne signalling sends messages down the electricity mains themselves. Its supreme advantage from the industry's point of view is that it uses its own infrastructure and does not depend on telephone companies or broadcasters. The problem is that the flow of electricity creates such a lot of interference, particularly at peak periods, that the signals may fail to get through. However Thorn EMI in the UK and General Electric in the US have committed considerable technical resources to make mains-borne signalling more reliable. As the Offer paper on metering points out, 'it is unlikely to be economic for one customer to choose a mains-borne signalling system and a neighbouring customer a radio teleswitch system'. In practice, the regional electricity companies will have to choose the technology for each area. But that does not mean the whole country need choose the same system, Offer says. 'One system may be more suited to more or less densely populated areas and in the longer term some comparison between systems will be helpful.'  The Financial Times   London Page VIII  "

The Department of Trade and Industry has announced that inquiries will start in March into two route diversions proposed by the National Grid Company after previous options were rejected by the DTI in May. The company says its proposed Pounds 200m upgrading of transmission lines through 50 miles of Cleveland and North Yorkshire is necessary to permit transmission of more, cheaply generated, electricity from gas, hydro and nuclear stations. Objectors to the proposals, first submitted in 1991 and already the subject of a six-month 1992 public inquiry, say that the upgrading is unnecessary and will despoil the countryside. This week at North Yorkshire wayleave hearings at which the Grid is fighting landowners who have refused consent for installation of new pylons and lines, the company said that in 1993-94 the electricity market had to pay Pounds 67m in compensation to northern generators because of transmission constraints. Yesterday it confirmed that Nuclear Electric's Hartlepool station and the new gas-fired Pounds 850m Teesside Power station were among the recipients. The company said that the compensation charge arose because competitively priced electricity offered by the generators could not be fully handled by the present transmission system. Similar compensation costs seem likely in the current year. In May the government gave approval in principle for 80 per cent of the route but the company still faces opposition from landowners refusing wayleave.   Companies:-  National Grid.

Following a Treuhand board meeting, the agency said the planned sale of Veag, east Germany's electricity network, and Laubag, the giant lignite fields, might be completed 'next week.' The Treuhand did not explain the delay. Veag is to be sold to a west German utility consortium led by RWE Energie. Laubag, which will supply Veag with its brown coal, will be acquired by a consortium led by Rheinbraun, the 100 per cent brown coal subsidiary of RWE. The delay in completing the deal, despite pressure from Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is thought to arise from the buyers' anxiety about prospects for energy consumption in eastern Germany. The two consortiums are increasingly concerned about a shift by east German domestic and industrial customers to gas, and about the pressure on electricity to compete with gas prices. For the moment, gas prices are significantly lower than electricity prices. These factors have repeatedly affected the complex privatisation negotiations for Veag and Laubag because their sales are tied to a comprehensive investment programme of DM41bn (Pounds 16.6bn) over 10 years. But any return on those investments depends on a stable customer base. Part of the investment timetable entails the construction of two 800MW power stations at Lippendorf in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. Energy analysts yesterday suggested, however, that part of the investment programme might be cancelled, which would reduce brown coal sales to Veag and thus affect the sale price of Veag.

They said it was the first new private sector electricity generating project to secure full financial support. GVK Industries, a diversified chemicals and property company, said that construction would start in June on the 235MW project at Jegurupadu in Andhra Pradesh. The company is developing the scheme in partnership with ABB, the European engineering combine, CMS Group, a US energy utilities company, and the Andhra Pradesh state electricity board. The Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, are also taking equity stakes. The project follows two years of Indian government efforts to attract private investment, including foreign capital, into the chronically underfinanced electricity supply industry. The government hopes the scheme will encourage the promoters of others. The power ministry has received expressions of interest from 75 groups, including 35 foreign companies, of which 22 were from the US, mainly from generating companies. However, only a handful have signed power purchase agreements - essential pacts between the would-be generator and the customer, usually the state electricity board.

Imported coal at current prices and exchange rates does indeed put pressure on British Coal prices (but not necessarily on electricity prices; British Coal Corporation's 30 per cent real price reduction over the last six years has hardly been reflected in electricity prices). However, the introduction of gas-based generation on a large scale will not bring the same price pressure for the simple reason that it will be more expensive than the coal alternative. This was one of the points taken up by the Energy Select Committee in its recent report. The 'dash for gas' may result in further price pressure on British Coal as the section of the fuelling market in which we compete is reduced in size. This will not, I fear, necessarily lead to lower prices for electricity consumers.

Excerpts follow:    When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the  mainland had an installed electricity capacity of only 1.86  million kilowatts, and it could generate just 4.3 billion  kilowatt hours a year.    By the end of this year, China's installed capacity is  expected to have passed 180 million kilowatts, with an annual  supply of more than 800 billion kilowatt hours. The amount of  electricity China generates in two days now is equal to the  total for the whole of 1949.    But as industries expand and people use more electricity,  the  shortage of power in most parts of the country gets worse. The  industry has developed most in areas with higher economic  growth, but these places are also the hardest hit by the power  shortage.    It is unfair to say that the State has overlooked the  problem  and achievements made in reforming the power industry's  management should never be underestimated.    But most reform measures and policies in this sector were  drawn up within the framework of the traditional planned economy  and it is inevitable they bear the stamp of the old system.    Investment    Conventionally, enterprises in the power industry are  subsidiaries of administrative organs. They tend to be  controlled by arbitrary orders, which can mean poor investment.    The World Bank suggests developing countries invest more  than  2 percent of the gross national product (GNP) in the power  industry. But from 1980 to 1992, China put in an average of only  1.24 percent of GNP.    Energy-saving policies and measures are also inadequate and  the public lacks a strong sense of energy conservation. The huge  shortage of electricity thus co-exists with massive waste.    For a long time, the State has demanded enterprises in the  power industry hand in more than 90 percent of their revenue in  taxes and profit turnover. This leaves them little cash to keep  going and the enterprises can afford no more than 5 percent of  their revenue to invest in development.    By contrast, their foreign counterparts raise about half the  cash they invest themselves and in some countries the figure is  up to 90 percent.    Because enterprises in China's power industry are not  independent commodity producers and managers, they do not feel  the pressure of competition. Most have long had more workers  than they need.    In the old system, electricity prices were unreasonably low  which has caused unequal competition between enterprises in the  power industry and those in other sectors.    This leads to waste which affects fundraising and the  introduction of foreign investment.    China's power industry is, however, trying to keep pace with  and even overtake the growth of the national economy.    From 1995 to 1997, the government plans to increase the  generating capacity of large and medium-sized power stations by  more than 15 million kilowatts a year. The figure for 1998-2000  is 20 million kilowatts.    If these goals are met, China's total installed electric  capacity will hit around 310 million kilowatts by the turn of  the century. This will ease the shortage nationwide and put  electricity within the reach of every county and 95 percent of  rural households.    To fulfill the goal, the power industry must break with  conventional practices.    Modern power enterprises should be set up. They should be  free from government interference, be given decision-making  powers and assume sole responsibility for profits and losses.  Their property rights, and rights and obligations should be  clearly defined.    The package also includes efforts to drum into the public  the  need to save electricity. Enterprises in the power industry  should also be allowed to compete on an equal footing with  enterprises in other sectors.    Shareholding    The power industry would further be helped by the  introduction of the shareholding system. This sophisticated form  of fundraising can separate managerial power from ownership and  help protect the legal rights of both investors and managers.    In the next seven years, the power industry will need $25  billion to import electricity generating units with a capacity  of 45 million kilowatts.    Besides foreign loans, foreign investment is welcome and  overseas investors are encouraged to build solely-funded or  co-funded power plants.    As investors, they can draw dividends according to their  investment. As loan lenders, they will recoup both the loan and  interest.     "

In a report on the sale of the 12 regional electricity companies the government spending watchdog says the Department of Energy considered introducing a provision for profit clawbacks over several years but decided against it because this could have affected the payment of dividends by the companies and cut the proceeds. The Audit Office says it would have been 'appropriate' for the department to explore whether higher proceeds could have been obtained by clawing back at least a portion of the profits that exceeded the companies' forecasts. The office also says that with hindsight the government could have earned more from the sale by retaining a portion of the shares to take advantage of the rise in the share price during the offer period. It recommends the government retains a substantial minority in future privatisations for this purpose. The sale of the twelve regional electricity companies. National Audit Office. Pounds 7.10.

The reasons for this sudden change of sentiment are hard to pinpoint; full year results and dividends at the top end of expectations, combined with thin trading activity, are the most likely explanations. But there is no new reason for optimism about the forthcoming regulatory review of electricity distribution. One-off price cuts averaging perhaps 20 per cent and annual reductions of 3 to 4 per cent below the rate of inflation still look likely. In April this prospect was enough to send the sector into a spin. True, the latest set of strong results has allowed dividend cover to be increased by rather more than expected. If the same can be achieved this year, the electricity companies will have more freedom for manoeuvre on dividends once the tougher regulatory regime starts to bite. The companies also used the results season to foster optimism about their ability to deliver cost savings. Shareholders will feel the benefit if efficiencies beyond those demanded by the regulator can be delivered. Even taking these factors together it is difficult to argue that the outlook for dividend growth has been transformed. But the bulls and bears of the sector are separated by shades of optimism about whether the electricity companies can build enough dividend cover and cut costs fast enough to offset the coming regulatory squeeze. The pendulum of opinion could just as easily swing back the other way.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9631 Regulation, Administration of Utilities.

0,FT941-8019 ,"FT941-8019 _AN-EBVDKAE3FT 940222   FT  22 FEB 94 / Electricity bills face rise from nuclear levy      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   Electricity bills, which already face the imposition of value added tax, could also be hit by a rise in the nuclear levy to offset the recent price-capping agreement in the power generation industry. The levy, now 11 per cent, provides more than Pounds 1bn a year of the money needed by Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear utility, to cover the cost of decommissioning ageing plant. A small proportion of it also goes to finance renewable forms of energy such as wind farms. The price-capping agreement by National Power and PowerGen will reduce electricity bills and also, therefore, the yield from the levy. This means that it will have to be raised if it is to reach its target of Pounds 8.5bn by 1998, when it is due to be phased out. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator who arranged the price-capping agreement and sets the levy, recently announced that it would fall from 11 per cent to 10 per cent next April. He was thought to be responding to government pressure to offset the introduction of VAT on home heating. But the levy is already several hundred million pounds below target, and the combination of the cut and price-capping means it will almost certainly have to be raised quite sharply to get it back on course. Dr Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, yesterday accused Prof Littlechild of granting the generators 'a licence to collude' by sanctioning the price-capping arrangement, which Offer, the electricity regulator, says could lead to a 7 per cent cut in wholesale electricity prices. Nuclear Electric stands to lose more than Pounds 200m a year from the agreement because it sells most of its output in the wholesale market. This is on top of whatever it loses from the reduction in the levy. Dr Hawley said that National Power and PowerGen agreed to price-capping only because their profits were protected by long-term contracts to sell electricity to the retail market. Delay in reaching the price-capping agreement - originally due by the end of last year - has also forced the government to reconsider the timing of its sale of the residual 40 per cent shareholding in National Power and PowerGen. Originally set for next autumn, the Pounds 4bn sale is now likely to be postponed to February 1995. However, provided the government can complete the sale by the end of March 1995, the revenues will still enable it to achieve its target of Pounds 5.5bn privatisation receipts in the next financial year.

It made the announcement as it disclosed an operating profit for 1992-93 of Pounds 661m. The staff reduction, the biggest annual employment fall proportionally since the company was formed three years ago, is being implemented as the company prepares for a government review of nuclear power which Nuclear Electric hopes will lead to privatisation. Mr John Collier, chairman, said any privatisation decision rested with the government. However, he said, the company's commercial success would soon mean that a move out of the state sector would be seen as feasible and desirable. Environmental groups said the results for last year were misleading. Mr Clive Bates of Greenpeace said that without Pounds 1.3bn from the nuclear levy paid by electricity consumers Nuclear Electric would have made a loss of Pounds 619m. Nuclear Electric, which operates the nuclear power stations in England and Wales, said the levy is to cover problems inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board, from which it was formed three years ago. However, Mr Bates insisted that part of the subsidy was being used to prop up the on-going business. Nuclear Electric plans to reduce staff to between 9,300 and 9,500 by next March, compared to 11,377 at the start of the financial year four months ago, and 14,164 when the company was formed in 1990. A staff reduction of 1,300 in the year to March 31 helped the company improve operating profits by 37 per cent from last year's Pounds 482m. Also influential was the radical improvement in the performance of advanced gas-cooled reactor stations which Nuclear Electric - and the CEGB before it  -have struggled for years to make perform at full efficiency. The company said yesterday all such stations were 100 per cent available for large parts of the winter. This enabled it to increase its share of the electricity market by 14 per cent to 55 terawatt (55m MW) hours and win 21.6 per cent of the electricity market in England and Wales, an improvement of 3 percentage points. Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said he expected his company to overtake PowerGen in 1996 as the second-largest generator. This would become possible after the Sizewell B power station starts producing electricity next year.   Companies:-  Nuclear Electric.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The review comes amid mounting concern about the 'duopoly' exercised by National Power and PowerGen, which together have more than 70 per cent of the market. Prof Littlechild has the power only to regulate prices charged by the regional electricity companies, since they are considered local monopolies and regulation is required to keep prices down. But because the generators are supposed to compete to sell their electricity, they were exempted from regulation. Prof Littlechild has frequently criticised the market dominance of the generators, most recently last week when, in a report on electricity prices, he called for greater competition. He has threatened the generating companies with a monopolies reference, although an alternative would be to subject them to price regulation. Prof Littlechild indicated last week that he was considering that option. The generating companies have been accused of damaging the prospects for the coal industry by failing to pass on all the benefits of falling coal prices. National Power and PowerGen have denied that and will soon be discussing pricing with Prof Littlechild. Lex, Page 14  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Heads of ministries  and departments and regional administrators were also involved.    Akayev described as hard the situation emerging in the fuel  and energy complex saying that nothing was being done to start  preparations for the coming winter. He said the country ""will  find itself in a position worse than last year"" unless drastic  measures were taken soon.    Akayev called to step up coal production and work out a  strategy for the development of the sector including marketing  opportunities at home and in Central Asia. He backed up a  proposal to allocate DM 10 million for a coal briquetting  project expressing confidence about the development prospects of  the coal industry.    However, many speakers called for a 40 million soms worth of  fuel subsidies arguing that most of the ordinary consumers would  not be able to buy fuel because of high coal prices and  transport costs. The president instructed the government to  allocate 14 million soms to this end, with the remainder to be  raised by local administrators. IF Note: Kyrgyzstan is  expected to produce 1.5 million tonnes of coal this year, one  million tonnes less than it needs. Kazakhstan has now agreed to  deliver the required amount and agreement was reached on imports  of one billion cu meters of gas from neighboring Uzbekistan.    As a matter of urgency, Akayev called for the national  economy to be transferred to electricity proposing that the  government raise 27 million soms to complete two large  hydro-electric stations at Shamaldy-Sai and Tash-Kumyr. The  cabinet was also instructed to raise funds for imports of large  capacity transformer equipment. Akayev approved a recent deal  with Switzerland which will provide a $10 million credit to put  up three high capacity transformer substations in the country. (  Kyrgyzstan whose annual electricity needs run at 10 billion kWh  produces 12 billion kWh. Talks are in progress to export extra  electricity to Kazakhstan -- IF).    Akayev said everything must be done to implement the  energy-saving program which can help the republic save up to one  third of the total electricity produced. He also called for a  review of the country's energy development concept taking into  account the energy situation in neighboring states.    Akayev proposed that an integrated research must be  conducted  into the sources of power generation with costly fossil fuels to  be replaced by unconventional sources for electricity generation.

It also points out that virtually all of the new capacity is gas-fired. The excess capacity is indeed high by the standards of the former state-controlled industry, but electricity users should welcome the willingness of new privately owned companies to compete with the ex-CEGB generators. Britain should enjoy the benefit of diversity in power generation and that includes a role for coal, but the electricity industry cannot sustain itself by pricing its product on the output of fully depreciated coal-fired power stations. Gas-fired generation, using 'combined cycle' technology, is being chosen for sound commercial reasons. It is also cleaner and no doubt eventually it will get credit for that. One of our leading members bought and converted an ex-CEGB power station. With manning at only one-third of the previous level, it now achieves much higher fuel efficiency and double the previous power output - with a massive reduction in emissions.

The result, for the year ending March 1992, was due to dramatic improvements in productivity and cost cuts, which boosted the operating profit by 51 per cent. The company also paid nearly 35 per cent less in interest on debt. Fifteen pits closed during the year with the loss of about 16,000 jobs, leaving a workforce of 53,000, of which about 41,000 are miners. The result was sharply higher than last year's figure of Pounds 78m, British Coal's first profit in 13 years which followed the restructuring of the company by the government and the beginning of a more efficient regime. It was overshadowed, however, by fears that British Coal, which is due to be privatised in the next few years, will never again be able to sell as much coal at such a high price. Mr Ken Moses, the company's joint deputy chairman, warned that British Coal's sales to the electricity industry could shrink to only 20m tonnes in the year to March 1994 compared with 65m tonnes today. This would happen if British Coal was unable to secure new contracts with the electricity industry. Its contracts, which give British Coal a favourable price, expire in March 1993. Without them, competing fuels could take a bigger share of the electricity market. British Coal said this was hard to accept when in many cases gas had been chosen by the electricity industry although it was more expensive to burn than coal. The outlook for the year to 1993 was for a smaller profit, Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman said. Although the company will still earn the revenue from its electricity industry contracts, it expects to have to close pits during the second half. That is because the new contracts are expected to require only about 40m tonnes of coal in the first year, and less thereafter. The new contracts would be for smaller volumes and at a lower price, since the now-privatised electricity industry is forcing British Coal to compete with other fuel suppliers. Because the new contracts would determine the size and shape of British Coal, and its value for privatisation, Mr Clarke said, the company had to keep cutting costs and improving productivity. In the year to March 1992, productivity rose by 13.1 per cent, and has risen another 14.6 per cent since then.

Semenyuk, Minister of Power Engineering  and Electrification, Ukraine, by L. Brovchenko: ""Paradoxical  Situation: Industry Must Struggle to Reduce Its Income""]    [Text] Everyone is concerned about the energy situation,  and everyone feels the energy crunch. Even television broadcasts  had to be curtailed, resulting in a dearth of information in  addition to low building temperatures and other forms of  distress. These facts formed the topic of our conversation with  V. Semenyuk, Minister of Energy and Electrification of Ukraine.    [Semenyuk] The situation is very complicated. Our current  receipts of fuel--coal, heavy oil, and gas--are running 20  percent below last year's. In other words, we are short 40  billion kilowatt-hours (bKw-h) because of inadequate fuel  supplies. Problems with heavy oil and gas--which we get from  abroad--are particularly grave. Coal deliveries by the Ukrainian  coal miners are more-or-less normal at 100-115 thousand tons a  day, but we burn 150-160 thousand tons every day. The difference  comes from our reserves, which in better years amounted to ten  to 11 million tons. Last year we managed to save eight million  tons of coal. At this rate of consumption our reserves of coal  will last for another month or so.    [Brovchenko] But the winter will last longer than that ...    [Semenyuk] There's more! Some power stations have already  run  out of coal or have only one or two day's supply. Stations that  produce heat in addition to electricity have first claim on  coal. In short, if the coal industry will produce at the present  level, then we can last until February. As far as coal goes, we  are optimistic since its used to produced 27-28 percent of our  electricity. Since one third of the electricity comes from  nuclear power plants, it helps that the parliament lifted the  moratorium on the Chernobyl plant which supplies 1.2 to 1.3  bKw-h per month. So far this winter it has produced 8 bKw-h of  electricity, which otherwise would have required four million  tons of coal.    In addition, gas deliveries fell by six billion cubic meters  this year. The year before last by December we had consumed  80-82 million cubic meters, and a year ago 56-56.5 million cubic  meters.    But the worst scenario pertains to heavy oil deliveries  which  are 15-20 percent below normal. We have only emergency reserves  left, leaving unused some 40 percent of the equipment at thermal  power stations. The situation is particularly bad at the  Burshtyn, Ladyzhan, Trypillya, and Vuhlehirsk plants, followed  by Prydniprovsk and Kryvyy Rih stations.    [Brovchenko] People are using electric heaters and gas  stoves  at home and at work for heat, which defeats the entire purpose  of conserving our energy resources. What's to be done?    [Semenyuk] True. As a result of the overload some one  thousand transformer substations have been damaged in November.  We haven't been able to repair them yet because of electricity  is so cheap--cheaper than energy derived from coal and gas.  Everywhere else household electricity costs 1.5 to twice as much  as that made available for industrial use and people are less  inclined to waste it. Currently, we have established a rate of  90 karbovantsi (krb) for 75 KW-h of electricity for household  use. Using any more will cost you 180 krb at cost-recovery  rates. With 16 million households, it is impossible to monitor  everybody's use, and everything depends on a sense of  responsibility and integrity of the consumers.    [Brovchenko] That's somewhat utopian. We just got through  building a communist society which was to be based on a high  sense of responsibility of the citizens and found out that it  doesn't work.    [Semenyuk] True. We should provide assistance for the poorer  segments of the population and charge the wealthier elements a  higher rate in order to control energy use. However, a proposal  in this vein was not supported by the Council of Ministers.    [Brovchenko] So, your industry is short about 20 percent of  the fuel it needs to meet the demand for electricity. Will some  limits be placed on the use of electricity by consumers?    [Semenyuk] We will try to avoid this. We will also try to  exclude the fuel industry, community and agricultural  facilities, as well as processing, baking, meat and the dairy  industries.    Machine engineering, chemical and metallurgical industries  may be cut back by 40-50 percent.    [Brovchenko] What will altering the work schedules give you?    [Semenyuk] Reduce peak demands for electricity, although  overall consumption will remain the same.    [Brovchenko] And what about television stations?    [Semenyuk] Curtailing their use saves 3.6 million Kw-h per  day, or almost 80 million Kw-h per month, which is equivalent to  40 thousand tons of coal a month. If had enough fuel  broadcasting hours would not have been curtailed.    [Brovchenko] Its a paradoxical situation. Your profits  increase with increased usage of electricity and yet you have to  advocate less consumption.    [Semenyuk] Unfortunately, that's the case. We cannot  stockpile what we produce and production and consumption have to  balance. That's why we count so much on a sense of  responsibility of the population because of our problems with  fuel supplies.    We could buy fuel from commercial suppliers, but that  requires money. Our consumers owe us three billion karbovantsi.    [Brovchenko] How much electricity is produced by hydropower  stations?    [Semenyuk] The output of Ukrainian hydropower stations is  4.7  million kW-h per year; gas-powered stations produce 4-5 percent  of our electricity.

That is what Mr John Wakeham, former energy secretary, has said and what industry leaders such as Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, believe. The message to consumers is - wait and see. Give the new electricity market a chance to work, and prices will begin to fall. Not everyone is so sanguine. 'The competitive market which was promised has not yet materialised,' was the damning verdict delivered by the Commons energy select committee in February. Offer, the electricity industry watchdog - itself the focus of much criticism from large consumers who say it is not tough enough - echoed this in its annual report. 'The lack of effective choice in the market this year is a most unsatisfactory feature of the present situation,' it said. These two reports came two years after Mr Wakeham launched the privatisation of electricity with the words: 'From now on, there will be unprecedented levels of competition in electricity supply. The price of electricity will begin to be driven by market forces.' He added: 'I believe that electricity privatisation is going to be good news for all the industry's customers, and good news for its employees.' Employees, especially those who have bought shares, may well agree. Customers are a different matter. Over the last few months the complaints of large electricity consumers about how privatisation has pushed up their electricity bills have filled the press. 'Angry and frustrated electricity users' assembled on April 7 to complain against 'unacceptable and unreasonable price increases,' said the Major Energy Users Council (MEUC). New contracts had been forced on users faced with little evidence of the promised 'competition' or opportunities to shop around, it added. The MEUC has long argued that its larger members - steel, paper and chemical companies - face increases in the basic cost of their electricity of up to 30 per cent this year. Privatisation, it says, has failed large electricity users, and made them uncompetitive in Europe. Mr Neil Tribick, vice chairman of the electricity group of the MEUC and group energy buyer for Rank Hovis MacDougall, says the company will have to pay around Pounds 18m more for its electricity this year. The National Health service, with 130 sites around the country, is expected to face increases of between 14 and 28 per cent, according to the MEUC. One paper company has written to Mr Wakeham saying it faces increases of 20-25 per cent. But the government and generators argue that these companies are not typical. Very large electricity users face especially high increases, because they formerly received government subsidies removed at privatisation. Moreover, the government adds, the place for large consumers to complain about their bills is Brussels. Prices are lower in Europe because governments subsidise their electricity bills by charging domestic consumers more, while the UK government has ruled out cross subsidies of this kind. But what electricity costs the average industrial consumer is hard to measure. Mr John Topliss, chairman of the MEUC electricity group, says most companies are paying around 10 per cent more than before privatisation, while National Power says they are paying just marginally more. Surveys from consumer groups such as the MEUC and the Energy Intensive Users Association suggest that prices to average industrial users fell by between 10 and 20 per cent after privatisation - in the year from April 1990. They then rose by 5 to 6 per cent in the year from April 1991. This year (from April 1992) increases are expected of 10 to 20 per cent. The Department of Energy's publication Energy Trends shows large electricity consumers paying 3.55p per unit at the end of 1991, compared with 3.51p at the end of 1989. But although some customers are paying more than before privatisation, some are clearly paying around the same, or even less. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, says customers must just be patient, because prices are starting to fall and will fall further. 'There are prospects for real long-term reductions, partly from the working through of lower fuel prices - provided our plans for cheaper fuel aren't frustrated - and partly from the impact of competitive pressures on our costs.' 'Before privatisation it was said the old area boards used to treat large customers like chattels. If they do that now, the customers can walk elsewhere.' So far, the generators' profits do not suggest they are overcharging. It is equally hard to counter their argument that last year's lower prices were an unsustainable phenomenon due to lower oil prices, high coal stocks and post-flotation jostling for market share. Domestic consumers, meanwhile, are not doing so badly. Their bills will go up by around 2.5 per cent this April, compared with increases of an average 11.3 per cent last April, and around 4.6 per cent in April 1990. But Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, argues that this year's modest increase is no proof of privatisation's virtue. 'In the run up to privatisation, prices were artificially high, as part of the fattening up process.' Domestic prices, he calculates, have increased by around 40 per cent since 1986, the year privatisation was announced. There has, however, been other good news for all consumers. Not only have the regional electricity companies improved their service, but the government no longer subsidises heavy industry at the expense of householders. Consumers also know far more about the costs of nuclear power, previously hidden in the CEGB. And investment in new environmentally-friendly technologies has moved ahead.

The chairmen of the 12 regional consumers' committees have decided to press distribution companies to share more of their rising profits with consumers. 'With lower coal prices, lower interest rates and boasts of large reductions in employee numbers and operating costs, the benefits of privatisation for the ordinary, non-investing customers have been totally inadequate,' they said. Although many electricity companies have given rebates to their customers, these have not matched the growth in profits.

Utilities say they are widening customers' choice but they also have other priorities      By MICHAEL SMITH   Viewed from the lofty heights of the European Commission, electricity must seem one of the slowest, most obdurate industries imaginable. But the companies which make up the European power industry regard themselves as part of a fast moving world in which some will struggle to keep pace. Both sides have a point. The Brussels view reflects the Commissioners' severe difficulties in deregulating the electricity and gas sectors. While they have successfully pushed through the liberalisation of telecommunications and aviation, energy has successfully resisted serious reform. Most power companies fear the consequences both for themselves and their customers, and some are backed by their governments. But change is on the way. A small but growing number of European countries, both in and outside the EU, are opening up their electricity markets. The deregulation process in many cases has been prompted by privatisation of public utilities. Countries that have already privatised or intend to privatise parts of their power networks include the UK, Italy, Portugal, Hungary and the Czech Republic. However, even in countries which have not introduced privatisation, electricity companies face a series of tough challenges. These challenges will be under review at this week's triennial conference in Birmingham of the Union of Electricity Producers and Distributors (Unipede). The 1,000 delegates, mainly European, will also be only too aware of the contrasting growth prospects of eastern and western European countries and the attendant problems of environmental pollution. The industry faces five main issues: eastern Europe. The former Soviet-bloc countries, having broken with command economy principles, need western allies to invest in new plants as they embark on far-reaching modernisation programmes. The Czech Republic, for example, is likely to invite foreign companies to take shares of 15 per cent in its regional distribution companies later this year or next. internationalisation: this trend is growing as western companies find their own markets saturated and seek opportunities in other countries, east and west. Share swaps are possible and the trend should help the idea of a pan-European inter-connected grid. costs: public concern about pollution and nuclear safety, especially in central and eastern Europe, is raising costs at a time when consumers demand greater price transparency and the lowest possible tariffs. Western countries and companies are helping through means such as the European Energy charter, agreed by 49 states and the European Union in 1991. The charter provides a framework for western investment in central and eastern europe and for exchanges of technology. health scares: there have been widespread fears about a possible link between cancer and electric and magnetic fields (EMF) associated with high-voltage grid lines. Industry-sponsored research has found that there is no link between EMF and cancer but a growing number of cases are coming to court. deregulation: important though all of these factors are for the future of the sector, the issue which will cause most controversy and potentially make the largest impact is deregulation within the European Union. Until recently, virtually every European power company operated as a monopoly, and most were restricted from expanding outside their core business. The UK Conservative government broke this mould when it split up the mammoth Central Electricity Generating Board as a prelude to privatisation of the whole industry. The cause of reform was taken up in earnest by the Commission in the early 1990s. It has no view on whether privatisation is a good or bad thing but it argues that a single European market only makes sense if competition can be applied to electricity and gas. 'It is clearly unfair for industries in energy-intensive sectors like chemicals or metals to be obliged to compete without having access to energy on similar conditions,' Mr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, director-general in the competition directorate, told a recent conference. 'It is the competitiveness of the whole European industry which is at stake.' The Commission is pushing for a system called negotiated third party access (TPA) which would cajole monopoly suppliers to open up their grid networks to enable trade between large industrial power consumers and another power supplier. The system's many opponents, including most companies, most countries and most MEPs, argue that such a market would be unable to discharge public service obligations such as guarantees of supplies and uniform prices. Electricite de France, the French state utility, fears that long term planning would be made more difficult, endangering plans to build nuclear power plants. Electrabel, one of Belgium's electricity companies, agrees that TPA would make planning difficult and that the Commission is going too quickly. It says an essential precondition for deregulation should be the harmonisation of environmental and fiscal conditions in the countries, claiming that otherwise some countries would have an unfair advantage over others. The Commission and TPA opponents may reach a compromise later this year around a so-called single purchaser system, through which one body independent of the host generator would be responsible for selling electricity. TPA opponents say this would maintain the integrity of the system. TPA supporters, however, say that it would have little impact since it would not enable consumers to deal directly with companies other than the host supplier. The original draft directive has already been considerbly diluted after intervention from the European Parliament. The Commission had originally proposed that companies should have an automatic right to a network, rather than a negotiated right. Some feel it would be better to wait for reform to gather pace. At the last meeting of EU energy ministers in May, the Italians, Spanish and Irish representatives hinted they were considering ways to liberalise their markets, although they did not say how. Another change is the growing number of countries setting up independent grid networks. An essential pre-requisite of a competitive system is to run the grid system separately from the power producers, either through separate accounting or through splitting up the electricity companies. Whereas five years ago there were no separate grid companies there are now five. The pressure for change will be boosted by the expected integration of the union of the Nordic countries with the continental network. Norway, Sweden and Finland either have liberal regimes for electricity or plan to introduce them. Further ahead, some central European states might prove to be allies for the liberalisers. Poland, for example, has already separated the three arms of its electricity system. In the near future, however, much will depend on the German government which assumes presidency of the European Union next month. In recent months, parts of the Bonn administration have been pushing for third party access in Germany as a means of bringing down power prices. That, however, would cause significant political problems with France which has much cheaper electricity prices for industrial consumers. One German electricity executive says: 'We are fighting with all our might against liberalisation of the European power industry. But at the same time we have no choice but to prepare for it.'

Urging a new regulatory framework, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, said pre-tax profits of the 17 companies in England, Scotland and Wales totalled Pounds 3.1bn, a 43 per cent increase over the previous year's total of Pounds 2.2bn. 'In 1987-88, the last year before the electricity industry accounts started to be 'adjusted' in preparation for privatisation, the total profits of the industry were Pounds 1.2bn,' Mr Dobson said. 'Compared with that year, the new total of Pounds 3.1bn represents an increase of no less than 150 per cent. Over the same period inflation was only 31 per cent. 'If electricity profits had risen at the same rate, last year's profits would have totalled Pounds 1.6bn, a shortfall of Pounds 1.5bn on what happened. 'These excess profits of Pounds 1.5bn are equal to Pounds 60 per electricity customer just in the last year alone.' Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman and chief executive of Midlands Electricity, received a near-22 per cent increase last year. His salary went up from Pounds 181,790 to Pounds 221,399.

The registration figure, similar to that achieved at this stage of the much larger flotation of the English and Welsh regional electricity companies, was disclosed yesterday, with details of incentives for people who buy shares. The breakdown of those registering from England, as opposed to Scotland, is not being announced. The May 30 flotation of Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric is expected to raise between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn if, as expected, the government sells 100 per cent of the companies. Incentives and conditions for Scottish electricity customers who buy shares in their electricity companies are similar to those offered to the regional company customers. For a minimum investment of Pounds 250 with a first instalment of Pounds 100, customers can have Pounds 18 of vouchers to set against electricity bills, or one free bonus share for every 10 shares allocated, provided they hold the shares until June 1994. The first vouchers will be issued before Christmas, well before the second of the three instalments is payable in May 1992. The third instalment is due in April 1993. Non-customers will have to apply for a package of shares in the two companies and make a Pounds 750 minimum investment with a first instalment of Pounds 300. They will be offered a loyalty bonus of one share for every 20 shares, up to a maximum of 150 bonus shares, to be held until June 1994. The two companies are being floated simultaneously at the same offer price. Applicants for the package will be allocated shares in each on what is expected to be a ratio of about 2 1/2 shares in Scottish Pow-er to one in Hydro-Electric. Customers who apply for the package must make a Pounds 750 minimum investment with a first instalment of Pounds 300, and will be offered Pounds 18 worth of electricity vouchers for every 100 shares in their own company or a loyalty bonus of one share for 10. In the other company they are entitled to a one-for-20 loyalty bonus.

The draft directives, which Brussels agreed on yesterday, aim to open up the gas and electricity networks to greater competition from the beginning of next year. They would enable the largest energy users - steel and aluminium plants, large construction sites, chemical, glass and fertiliser factories - to buy their gas and electricity from suppliers anywhere in the Community from January 1, 1993. At the same time, energy distributors would be able to club together to gain access to the whole network, passing on the savings to smaller consumers. Assuming the legislation is successful, the same principles will be extended to smaller users from January 1, 1996, but before then these directives will have to overcome fierce opposition from most EC gas and energy producers and a number of member states. Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, EC energy commissioner, said yesterday that in some cases the infrastructure needed for the cross-border transport of energy was not in place, but the directives would allow new companies to build gas and electricity lines. Access to the network would be available to some 400-500 large industrial users of electricity, each of which consumes more than 100GW hours of electricity annually, and to consumers of more than 25m cubic metres of gas a year. Distributors which account for 3 per cent or more of electricity, or 1 per cent of gas consumption in an individual member state, would also be entitled to shop around for better prices. Last October, Mr Cardoso e Cunha dropped more aggressive plans to break up energy monopolies using the Commission's special legal powers, when it became clear that some member states - in particular the Netherlands, Germany and France - would block such an approach. The Commission has not abandoned those powers, but Mr Cardoso e Cunha hopes the gradual approach will prove more acceptable to member states.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said the increase was due to cost cutting, price rises and a 50 per cent increase in direct sales to industrial users. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, warned PowerGen not to force too hard a bargain out of British Coal in the current negotiations over long-term coal supply to the electricity generators. He said: 'Remember when you are negotiating these contracts that you are determining the future availability of a national resource for which you have longer-term need.' PowerGen's results were condemned by Mr Frank Dobson MP, Labour's shadow energy minister: 'The profits show that electricity privatisation has become a legalised racket with huge profits for the shareholders and massive pay and perks for the bosses.' Labour is expected to keep up its attack as National Power, the other generator, and the 12 regional companies report profit increases of up to 40 per cent, helped by one-off price factors. PowerGen increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 272m to Pounds 359m in the year to March 29. Turnover increased 14 per cent from Pounds 2.65bn to Pounds 3.01bn, helped by average price rises of 9 per cent. The company cut its workforce by more than 2,000 people to just over 6,000 during the year. Exceptional provisions of Pounds 94m were made to cover future redundancies and closure of power stations. However, there were exceptional profits of Pounds 88m from two power stations closed in March. Mr Wallis said there was less uncertainty about the March 1993 deadline for renegotiation of contracts with British Coal and the regional companies. The company's shares fell 4p to 249p on profit-taking after a strong run. Earnings per share increased 35 per cent from 23p to 31p. The company is recommending a final dividend of 6.2p to make a total of 9.25p.

Nuclear Electric is to apply today to Offer, the power industry regulator, to become a 'second-tier supplier', which would enable it to enter into contracts with large consumers. At present, the utility is restricted to selling into the pool, the wholesale market for electricity. Although Offer will review the application, Mr Michael Hesel-tine, trade and industry secretary, will have the final say. Nuclear Electric's move, however, will be welcome to the government because it should sharpen competition in a market where there have been loud complaints from industrial users about rising prices. Large companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries, Blue Circle Industries and British Steel have been demanding government action to adjust electricity costs in line with those of continental competitors. If allowed, Nuclear Electric intends to offer 15-year fixed-price contracts to industrial users with steady 24-hour demand. Its systems are designed to provide base-load electricity and its costs are not linked to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Dr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Power's chief executive, said he would not be surprised if National Power and PowerGen, the other big generators, objected to the application. 'But it has clearly been a real anomaly when we, as a major generator, have been unable to supply customers directly while in other cases licences have been issued to companies who have no generating capacity at all.' PowerGen said: 'We see this as a logical step in the evolution of the competitive market.' A significant point of concern for the other generators is that Nuclear Electric should not be allowed to use the Pounds 1.2bn nuclear levy which it receives from domestic electricity consumers to subsidise its prices in the industrial market. They are likely to demand that that should be a condition of the licence. Nuclear Electric already commands 22 per cent of the electricity market in England and Wales, but it is keen to establish itself as a leading generator, in anticipation of the government review of the nuclear power industry starting at the end of this year. Its capacity will increase substantially next year with the start-up of Sizewell B power station. Next year also sees regulatory changes that will enlarge the market where the generators can sell direct. Nuclear Electric hopes to obtain its licence by December 1.

The National Consumer Council and the Consumers' Association urged Offer, the electricity industry regulator, to claw back 'excess returns' and cut prices. The two groups said domestic price rises of 13 per cent in the first three years after privatisation had failed to deliver better service. Their report is the latest in a series criticising power distributors over price rises and profits, and accusing them of favouring shareholders over customers. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said the report showed the need for the government to put pressure on companies to give back money to consumers. 'Consumers were promised lower bills with privatisation,' he said. 'Instead the main beneficiary has been the City.' The issue is increasingly sensitive as the government prepares to impose value added tax of 8 per cent on electricity bills in April. Protests about recent high profit rises suggest that controls which the industry might regard as draconian would be seen as inadequate by consumers and political opponents of privatisation. One of Offer's problems is that the review covers only power distribution businesses, which account for about 25 per cent of final power bills. Tight controls would have limited impact on final prices. Offer and the power distributors frequently say prices have fallen in real terms since privatisation, particularly since last April, which is not covered by yesterday's report. They also point to improved service standards. But yesterday's report, a response to an Offer consultation document, demonstrates the cynicism with which the industry's claims are regarded. Analysts say a case can be made for real rises and falls, with the outcome depending on the start and end dates and on assumptions for inflation. The Consumers' Association said electricity companies could have made a more than adequate profit without increased prices. Dr John Belshon, its chief executive, said: 'Offer has got to get its act together urgently. It has been sitting on its hands for too long.' The National Consumer Council said the regional companies' rate of return for the distribution businesses reached 9.2 per cent in 1992-93, compared with 6 per cent at British Gas and targets in the water industry of between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.

0,FT923-1903 ,"FT923-1903 _AN-CIUDDABIFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Carbon tax raises power sales hope      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   THE UK electricity industry would suffer less than other sectors of the energy industry from the European Community's proposed carbon tax, according to a confidential report prepared for the Electricity Association, the industry's trade group. The tax might even result in electricity increasing its market share. The report, by Cambridge Econometrics, the research group, suggests that the tax would reduce total energy demand in the UK by 7 per cent between 1990 and 2000. Even so, electricity demand would fall only 5 per cent because large segments of industry would switch to electricity from other power sources. The big loser would be coal, where consumption is forecast to fall 19 per cent by 2000 and 42 per cent by 2005. Gas consumption would also decline because cuts by domestic and industrial users would more than offset increased use of gas by power generators. The EC is proposing a tax equivalent to Dollars 3 a barrel of oil, rising by Dollars 1 annual stages to Dollars 10. The tax would be based partly on the carbon content of fuel and partly on the energy content. The Cambridge report was commissioned by the Electricity Association to help it to prepare a submission to the government. Comments were due by the end of last week. On the sensitive question of how the tax would affect profits, the report says that about Pounds 400m is in the balance. If the electricity industry absorbed all the increased cost of the tax, total profits would be reduced by that amount. It was therefore a question of how much of the cost the industry would be able to pass on to the consumer. Last year the electricity companies as a whole made pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2bn. The tax would reduce UK carbon emissions by about 9 per cent by 2000, the report says, helped by an easing of demand and a switch to cleaner fuels. Most of the reduction would come from the power generation industry. Transport, the other principal source of pollution, would barely reduce emissions at all because of the lack of alternatives to petrol. The report says that the measure would yield enough revenue to allow the government to cut value added tax from 17.5 per cent to 16 per cent. It concludes that the macroeconomic effect of the tax would be small provided that the revenues are fully recycled. Although the Cambridge report provides some encouragement to the electricity industry, it is unlikely to sway its general opposition to the tax. National Power, the largest power generator, has told the government that the tax might be damaging to economic growth.  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "

That, however, is precisely what the State of New York intends to do with its planned Dollars 2.5bn acquisition of the Long Island Lighting Company, a private sector electricity company known to its customers as Lilco. Thumbing its nose at the world-wide trend towards privatisation, New York state has asked the company to enter immediate negotiations on its proposed cash offer of Dollars 21.50 a share. Lilco's board says it is 'seriously evaluating' the offer: but it seems quite possible the company and its shareholders will accept. Why do it? Lilco, which generates and distributes power in the counties of Nassau, Suffolk and a portion of Queens, is not in imminent danger of collapse. But it is extremely unpopular with its customers because it charges the highest electricity prices in the US - 16.1 cents per kWh for residential customers, almost double the national average of 8.7 cents. Mr Mario Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York state, says that taking Lilco into public ownership would cut electricity bills by an immediate 10 per cent because the company would no longer have to pay tax or shareholders' dividends. The result would be a lot of happy voters when Mr Cuomo is fighting a tough re-election battle. Mr James McFadden, a utilities analyst at Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house, believes the financial case stacks up. The arithmetic goes like this. At present, US electricity companies need to deliver an annual rate of return of 11 per cent on equity to attract investors. For Lilco, the cost in shareholder dividends works at about Dollars 250m after tax. That means it has to earn Dollars 400m before tax to deliver a satisfactory rate of remuneration. Now contrast the case if the company were taken into public ownership. The takeover would be financed through a Dollars 2.5bn issue of tax-exempt revenue bonds. Holders of these would require an interest rate only 7 per cent because they would not have to pay tax on the income, so the after-tax cost of servicing the debt would be only Dollars 175m. And because a government-owned Lilco would not be liable for taxation, the figure would be Dollars 175m before tax, too. The saving to Lilco would therefore be the difference between Dollars 400m and Dollars 175m: that is, Dollars 225m. Based on Lilco's present annual revenues of Dollars 2.35bn, that would allow for an immediate cut in electricity prices of just under 10 per cent. The logic is seductive. But if valid, could not the same case be made for nationalising every other private sector utility in the US? Mr Irwin Stelzer, director of regulatory policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market think-tank, points out there are flaws in the argument. One is that a public sector company is unlikely to be better managed than a private sector one. Another is that Lilco's tax-exempt status will simply transfer costs from its customers to federal taxpayers. A third is that the bond issue will further extend New York state's indebtedness, leaving it less room to borrow for other purposes. A better way of reducing electricity bills, according to Mr Stelzer, would be to allow other power companies to supply cheap electricity to Lilco's customers through Lilco's wires. 'The solution to high-cost power is competition, not state monopolies,' Mr Stelzer says. In fact, some of Lilco's most pressing problems relate to the threat of competition. Between 1973 and 1984, the company spent Dollars 5.5bn on constructing a nuclear power station which was never used. Now it has to charge high prices to service the debt it incurred - but it can only do so because it enjoys a monopoly. That could change. The regulatory environment for electricity companies is shifting, and Lilco is under increasing pressure to let its customers shop around for power. Once that starts to happen, Lilco will need to charge even higher prices to maintain revenues from a smaller customer base, leading to a spiral of decline. Such fears have done little for Lilco's share price: it has generally been heading downwards for more than a year. From that point of view, a takeover by New York state might come as a relief. But the market yesterday looked reluctant to gamble that Mr Cuomo would be re-elected to pursue it. Lilco's shares closed down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 17 3/8, well below the Dollars 21.50 offer price.   Companies:-  Long Island Lighting Co Inc.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

He told a House of Commons inquiry: 'My job is to protect the electricity consumer. Responsibility for the coal closures lies with the secretary of state for trade and industry and British Coal.' In the face of repeated questioning by backbench MPs on the trade and industry select committee, Prof Littlechild said that neither the Electricity Act nor his understanding of the role of a regulator permitted him to prescribe what the UK's energy mix should be, or to dictate what power stations should be built. Contrary to the perception that he could intervene in electricity industry decisions, his job was to remove obstacles in the market so that competition could determine which types of fuel were best. His stand infuriated MPs. Mr Cranley Onslow, Tory MP for Woking, described it as 'a cop-out'. Others referred to his 'blind faith in the market'. They also professed amazement when Prof Littlechild said he had not yet met Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, although he had had frequent discussions with Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister. Prof Littlechild would not be drawn on whether gas was unfairly taking market share from coal. He said that, although many people claimed gas was more expensive than coal, there was also evidence to the contrary and the situation was not clear-cut. There was no such thing as 'a single price' for electricity. The regulator is currently conducting an inquiry on whether electricity distributors are living up to their licence requirement to purchase electricity economically. He will report his initial findings next month. MPs accused Prof Littlechild of dragging his feet and preparing of producing a report that would be 'too late'. He replied that he wanted to take as broad a view as possible of the electricity companies' purchasing practices, and not just respond to particular concerns. He said: 'I want to make clear that my review is of the economic purchasing obligation, not a general review of the case for gas against coal.'  The Financial Times   London Page 11  "
0,FT911-1014 ,"FT911-1014 _AN-BEIBNAATFT 910509   FT  09 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Austria fights Czechs' nuclear push - Prague is determined to sell electricity to the west      By LESLIE COLITT   CZECHOSLOVAKIA, despite intense opposition to its nuclear power stations by neighbouring Austria, aims to become an important supplier of nuclear-generated electricity to the west. Prague is determined to press on with an ambitious nuclear power programme while plans to expand atomic energy are being scrapped throughout eastern Europe. In so doing, it is relying on the widespread acceptance of nuclear energy among Czechoslovaks who face some of the worst air pollution in Europe. Mr Jan Jicha, deputy economics minister for fuel and energy, was recently put in charge of exporting electricity to the west. He noted that an agreement to sell nuclear-generated power to a German utility could serve as a model for the urgently needed modernisation of Czechoslovakia's existing nuclear power stations. A contract for the sale of 1,400MW of electricity from the Mochovce nuclear station, being built in western Slovakia, was signed with Bayernwerk in Munich. The electricity is to be delivered over four years, beginning in 1994. The revenue earned by selling electricity from Mochovce will be used to repay the costs of installing instrumentation and control systems supplied by Siemens which will bring the station up to western safety standards. This is a pattern to be repeated in the planned expansion of Czechoslovak nuclear power. But Austria is equally determined to see that Prague's nuclear energy plans are scrapped. Anti-nuclear groups in Austria and Germany charge Czechoslovakia with being the 'new utopia' of the German nuclear power lobby and say it is on its way to becoming Eastern Europe's leading nuclear energy producer. In eastern Germany, two Soviet-designed nuclear stations have been shut down, and resistance is strong to plans by German electricity companies to build new nuclear stations in the region. Austrian opposition to nuclear stations is so strong that Vienna offered Czechoslovakia DM500m (Pounds 170m) in free electricity if it shut down the two oldest and most troublesome Soviet-designed 440MW reactors at the Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear station in Slovakia. They are the same type of reactor as in east Germany's Greifswald atomic power station which was closed down last year after public protests. Austria would like to see two later-model reactors shut down as four reactors at the Dukovany nuclear power station in Moravia. But Mr Jicha said it was doubtful whether Austria could compensate for the loss of the nuclear power which makes up 27 per cent of total electricity generated in Czechoslovakia. He wanted to see this boosted to 40 per cent which compared with Sweden (50 per cent), Germany (38 per cent) and France (75 per cent). Ironically, the Czechoslovak government under Prime Minister Marian Calfa was originally opposed to nuclear energy. But it quickly changed its mind when the alternatives became clear. The northern Bohemia region of Czechoslovakia suffers from some of the worst pollution in Europe, because of its lignite-fuelled power stations. The cost of installing modern anti-pollution equipment would be far greater than phasing out the worst offenders and expanding nuclear power capacity, the government argued. The devastation wrought by the lignite-fired power stations in northern Bohemia explains why most Czechoslovaks, even those with reservations about nuclear energy, prefer it to generating electricity from soft coal. The two reactors under construction at Temelin in southern Bohemia are also to be brought up to international safety standards with the help of western companies. In addition, two reactors are to be installed at Mochovce and two 1,000MW reactors built at Temelin or at a site in Slovakia. Siemens or Westinghouse are expected to win the contracts, Czechoslovak officials said, and would form a partnership with Skoda Plzen, the only manufacturer outside the Soviet Union which produced reactors under a Soviet licence. Siemens is also negotiating with Skoda and the city of Plzen to build a 200MW high-temperature reactor for the supply of district heat to Plzen. The sale of nuclear-generated electricity to western Europe is regarded by Mr Jicha as indispensable if the nuclear programme is to be realised. In addition to Bayernwerk, PreussenElektra in east Germany would be a likely customer, as well as Italian and French utilities. Electricite de France (EdF), itself a major exporter of nuclear-generated power, had expressed interest in buying a stake in the Czechoslovak electricity company, but Mr Jicha said he believed it would be more advantageous for Prague to sell electricity on its own.

A draft law allowing access to the energy supply grids will be presented to the cabinet before Easter, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, said yesterday. The move would allow domestic and foreign competitors to take on the main energy utilities including RWE, Veba's Preussen-Elektra and Bayernwerk, as well as Ruhrgas, the country's leading gas importer and distributor. It is likely to be fiercely resisted by the big utilities, the local authorities which are their leading shareholders, and trade unions and opposition Social Democrats because of worries about job security and quality of services. Mr Rexrodt insisted the change had the backing of the ruling coalition in Bonn, and he was determined to make it law before the next election. It is part of the government's programme to create jobs and stimulate growth. 'I know this is stirring up a hornet's nest,' he said. 'But we have the consumers supporting us, for whom electricity and gas in Germany have been too expensive for far too long.' The new law will bar agreements between the utilities which set demarcation lines between their operations, with each supplying all energy demand in their own areas. Instead, it will give transmission rights to other gas and electricity suppliers. Mr Johann Eekhoff, state secretary for economics, said the aim was to open competition in the German market before the European Union allowed cross-border energy supplies from 1998. Germany would allow cross-border supplies once neighbouring countries did the same. The German market was opened to foreign competitors for the first time last year, when an Anglo-US consortium, including Britain's PowerGen, bought the Mibrag brown coal field in east Germany.

The Rostov Teploelektroproyekt has been named  general designer of the new solar electric power plant, and the  Power Engineering Institute imeni G.M. Krzhizhanovskiy has been  put in charge of creating it. The planned 1.5-MW-capacity  modular solar electric power plant will be used to partially  cover the electricity and heat demand of users in the plant's  vicinity. The plant will consist of two independent parts: The  first will convert solar radiation into electricity by using  solar batteries based on silicon single crystals and  polycrystals, and the second part (the thermodynamic part) will  use Stirling motor-generators (i.e., electrical generators  connected to a Stirling motor that is excited by solar  radiation) as converters. The new solar electric power plant  includes the following components: four fields of solar  photoeletric modules; two fields of solar modules with Stirling  motor-generators; a field of solar water-heating modules; three  inverter substations; and control, regulation, protection, and  automation systems. The station's circuit includes three  independent solar power units that are connected through  transformers to a common system of station generator buses.  Together, the solar modules' design peak capacity is 1,907 kWe.  The new solar electric power plant's basic technical-economic  indicators are as follows: peak intensity of solar radiation  flux, 0.9 kW/m[.sup]2[/]; number of hours of sunshine  annually, 2,147; total yearly solar radiation, 1,345  kWh/m[.sup]2[/]; peak electrical capacity, 1.6 MWh; peak  thermal capacity, 10.5 MW; yearly output of power to consumers,  1,560 MWh of electricity and 46,000 GJ of heat; average thermal  efficiency of the solar modules, 57 percent; total area occupied  by the fields of solar modules, 10.7 hectares; area of the solar  modules' active receiving surface, 35,280 m[.sup]2[/];  specific capital investments per unit power, 6,770 rubles/kW for  electricity and 5,000 for heat; cost of producing electricity,  34.8 kopecks/kWh; cost of producing heat, 76.5 rubles/GJ; and  number of servicing personnel required, 64. The new solar  electric power plant has a design service life of 30 years, and  the electricity and heat produced by it should reduce wastes  released into the environment by the following amounts: 7,000  tons of ash; 18,000 tons of carbon oxides; 1,400 tons of  nitrogen; and 3,800 tons of sulfur. The new solar electric power  plant should also reduce heat emissions by 7 x 10[.sup]8[/] J  and should conserve the 12,000 tons of atmospheric oxygen  conventionally required to burn fossil fuel in boiler furnaces.  The new Kislovodsk solar electric power plant is slated to be  completed in 1996. Figure 1, table 1; references 8: 2 Russian, 6  Western.      "

Philip Daubeney, 55, who has spent 32 years climbing the ICI management ladder, is to take over as chief executive from Roger Farrance who retires, at 60, in November. A history graduate of Balliol, Oxford, Daubeney has come up on the commercial side of ICI and is currently regional chief executive of the African and Eastern region. The Electricity Association is one of Britain's youngest trade associations, having been born out of the rump of the old Electricity Council which used to oversee the nationalised industry. Only three years old, it has had some difficulty adjusting from being master of the industry to being its servant. Although it has a mere 20 members and four associates, it employs around 200 people. In addition to providing the traditional services of a trade body, the association also continues to supply common services to the industry. The decision to recruit the association's next chief executive from outside the electricity industry is another sign of the radical changes that have taken place since the demise of the old Electricity Council. Daubeney says that there are some similarities between the industry he is leaving and the one he is joining. They are both capital intensive and he believes that the electricity industry may soon have to confront exactly those environmental issues with which the chemical industry has already been grappling.

In a hard-hitting speech Mr Winston Churchill (C Davyhulme) attacked the government for not providing any evidence that it had the will or determination to widen the market for coal. Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (C Batley and Spen), Mr Richard Alexander (C Newark), Mr William Cash (C Stafford), Mrs Ann Winterton (C Congleton) and Mr Nicholas Winterton (C Macclesfield) also voted against the government. Several Conservative MPs abstained. The Labour motion, which claimed that the government had encouraged the belief that 12 pits facing early closure would be reprieved, was defeated by 308 votes to 286. A government amendment backing the introduction of legislation to privatise British Coal was carried by a majority of 22 (307-285). In closing a boisterous debate Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, sought to placate the Tory critics by stressing that the government would support the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in organising employee-management buyouts. He said the government would provide 50 per cent - up to a maximum of Pounds 200,000 - of the costs incurred by each employee-management team in engaging consultants and advisers to enable them to compete with other bidders. Mr Eggar claimed jeers by Labour MPs sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers showed that they were not interested in Nottingham miners having a chance to buy the pits in which they worked. He told those Tory MPs who were critical of the electricity generators for refusing to sell unwanted coal-fired stations at a price below the cost of new gas fired installations that the director-general of electricity regulation was reviewing the matter. Responding to demands that the government should increase the demand for coal by requiring the electricity generators to limit the rundown of their stockpile of 33m tons Mr Eggar warned that whatever decision was reached it would be unlikely to make a significant impact for at least the next few months. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, insisted that government had not given any guarantee that the 12 pits could be saved. Shadow trade secretary Mr Robin Cook argued that with the market 'rigged' against it British Coal could not be blamed because, even with the new subsidy offered by the government, it had so far failed to secure additional orders from the electricity generators.

Generators which produce electricity cleanly, efficiently and at a true commercial price might expect to be competitive in the new electricity industry. Instead, if they are not beneficiaries of the new coal deal, they may well be forced out of the market. That is hardly what they expected when the government announced the electricity privatisation in its White Paper of February 1988.

That argument has been advanced repeatedly during meetings of the Commons energy committee this month. It contradicts the view of Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, that the new stations springing up since electricity privatisation are a sign of competition. In December Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said the new gas-fired power stations were of second-rate design and wasted energy. The Coalfield Communities Campaign has said the stations were unnecessary because there was surplus generating plant. They would force competitive coal stations out of the market. British Coal told the energy committee that existing coal stations, fitted with scrubbers to meet environmental standards, could produce electricity as cheaply as 2.2p a unit. The new gas-fired power stations would produce at 2.9p a unit, British Coal estimated. MPs took those arguments seriously and asked Mr Wakeham whether electricity consumers would end up paying for the new stations. They believed that might happen because many of the 12 regional electricity companies had signed long-term contracts with the new stations. That would mean that even if the stations could not compete in the electricity pool - wholesale market - the regional companies would be bound to buy their power and would then pass the cost to the customer. If so, Mr Wakeham said, the regional companies would be breaching their licences, which oblige them to buy electricity for consumers 'economically'. His remarks did little to settle the row over whether the stations are economic. So far, 11 projects have signed gas deals and look likely to go ahead, and a further four are optimistic that they will do so. Others are embryonic or are temporarily frozen by planning constraints or a shortage of gas at the right price. The regional electricity companies fiercely defend the competitiveness of the power they will buy from the new stations, and argue that British Coal's figures make no sense. Mr Gregory Fenby-Taylor, power purchasing manager for Norweb, which signed a deal with Lakeland Power, which in November became the first independent project to come on stream, says: 'If anyone offered me a 2.2p contract I'd take it - but believe me, there's no such beast.' Mr Richard Stubbs, a director of Lakeland Power, says: 'I don't think you'd get a regional company to sign a deal at 2.9p.' The regional companies say that prices from the new stations are more likely to be close to 2.75p a unit, the price at which Nuclear Electric sold power contracts recently. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, told the energy committee last week that Killingholme, south Humberside, his new gas-fired station, would produce electricity at 2.5p a unit, compared with 4.5p for the old coal-fired plant it would replace. Critics say that power stations that signed gas deals after British Gas increased its prices, on the so-called LTI 3 pricing schedule, will have to sell their electricity for more if they are to make decent returns. Some say they may produce electricity at more than 3p a unit. A consultant to several new gas station projects says: 'I would say at LTI 3 you are getting to an electricity price level of close to 3p, as high as anyone expects the pool price to be.' He and others point out that other factors, such as the site of the project, and the efficiency of the plant, can also influence its economics. Since no one can predict what the pool price will be in 15 years, it is hard to tell exactly which of the new stations will be competitive. That question will only begin to be answered in mid-century, when several should be running and bidding into the electricity pool. Meanwhile, Mr Wakeham faces two more difficult questions. The first, from those who believe gas is a good idea, is why the government is dragging its feet over allowing imported gas into the UK - it has insisted on tying imports to exports. The second question, from the coal and environmental lobbies, is whether he believes the electricity market is making the right investment decisions. They argue that not only is the market's half-hourly price system an inadequate way of deciding what kind of fuel and plant Britain will need in the long term, but the new gas-fired stations are indifferent even to that system because they have signed long-term contracts.

His task is fraught with practical difficulties. Nearly 50m tonnes of coal is lying idle in stocks, and the electricity industry has made clear that its appetite is sharply reduced. In order to sustain more than a few additional pits, the trade and industry secretary would have to find a home for several million tonnes of extra coal. Technically, the government has the power to influence energy producers and consumers - and even to force the buying of coal. Nevertheless, Mr Heseltine's announcement of the pits reprieve had barely left his lips before the energy industry had sprung to the defence of its patch. The most direct route open to Mr Heseltine is to use the government's 40 per cent stake in National Power and PowerGen, the two leading generators, as a lever to persuade them to burn more coal. The next set of long-term contracts between British Coal and the power industry is still being negotiated. But sources in the electricity industry yesterday made clear that they would resist any attempts to make them increase their purchases of coal-based power. Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity, said the distribution companies were determined not to be forced to sign excessive long-term contracts only two years before regulations were due to be changed to allow more competition. 'We'd be faced with stranded contracts,' he said. One option before Mr Heseltine is to delay the next stage of electricity deregulation. In 1994 the level of protection in the regional distribution markets is due to be reduced - which is why regional distributors such as Midlands Electricity expect their franchise markets to shrink. Mr Heseltine might also try to limit coal imports. Again, he would risk angering the generators that have sunk large sums of money in port handling facilities. Such action would aggravate strained trade relations with the US, one of the UK's largest coal suppliers. Any curb on electricity imports from France via the cross-Channel cable would be highly questionable given the move to an EC single market - although the government might argue that French electricity is state-subsidised. In announcing his reprieve, Mr Heseltine said he would consult Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, who is looking into the effect that the power generators' switch to gas is having on electricity prices. Prof Littlechild has the power to penalise electricity companies that are not buying the cheapest electricity available. He has agreed to speed up his inquiry if necessary, but he is unlikely to have formed any conclusions before early next year. Norweb, the Manchester-based electricity distributor, which is investing in gas-fired stations, said yesterday it was confident that its gas deals would stand up to regulatory scrutiny. Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords and a former energy secretary, last night told peers that Mr Heseltine's review would discuss with the generators and distribution companies whether the market prospects for coal had been 'correctly assessed'. It would also look at each pit to see whether the case for closure had been made and consider whether some pits should be mothballed or released to private operators. A further sector over which Mr Heseltine will undoubtedly be casting his eye is the state-owned nuclear power industry, which contributes about 20 per cent of the electricity in England and Wales. Nuclear Electric reacted sharply to suggestions that he could bring forward from 1996 the phased shutdown of ageing Magnox reactors to make room for more coal stations. The stations are not due to be phased out until 1996. Any shutdown would, however, entail heavy decommissioning costs, and would remove the only power source that does not produce harmful emissions at a time when the UK is trying to clean up its air. Whichever route Mr Heseltine chooses involves a cost - to subsidise extra coal production, to compensate companies that have to buy more expensive electricity, or, with nuclear, to decommission power stations. In some cases, such as subsidising coal, the cost will fall on the taxpayer. In others, such as postponing electricity deregulation, it will be the consumer who ends up paying the bill. As one electricity industry representative put it: 'Whichever way they move, they come up against new difficulties.'  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT944-4571 ,"FT944-4571 _AN-ELHD0AAMFT 941208   FT  08 DEC 94 / German coal levy is ruled illegal      By JUDY DEMPSEY      BONN   Germany's heavily subsidised coal industry was thrown into turmoil yesterday after the country's constitutional court ruled that a controversial levy paid by industrial and private electricity consumers to support domestic coal production was unconstitutional. The decision was immediately welcomed by Mr Erwin Teufel, prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg, who said the Kohlepfennig, the special levy to protect domestic coal production against imports, was 'unjust and against the principles of the free market economy'. But Germany's powerful miners' trade union, IG Bergbau, called the findings 'hugely disappointing'. 'It is now up to the government to act as quickly as possible to find a way to subsidise our coal after 1995,' said Mr Christoph Meer, a union spokesman. The constitutional court's decision comes eight years after the case was first sent to it by the district court in Moers, near Dusseldorf, acting on behalf on an individual who refused to pay the Kohlepfennig. The court said yesterday the government would have to phase out the levy by the end of next year. That would coincide with the termination of another coal subsidy, the Jahrhundertvertrag, which obliges German electricity utilities to buy domestic coal. 'We respect the decision of the court,' said Mr Friedrich Bohl, chancellery minister, adding that the government 'would scrutinise the ruling carefully'. The Kohlepfennig, which amounts to a 7.5 per cent levy on industrial and consumer electricity prices, was introduced in 1976 as a means of protecting domestic coal production against cheap coal imports. A tonne of west German coal costs DM280-DM290 (Pounds 114-Pounds 118) against imports costing an average DM83-DM90. At the same time, under the terms of the Jahrhundertvertrag, Germany's electricity companies are commited to buying about 40m tonnes of domestic coal a year to protect the industry. In all, through the Kohlepfennig, the government has been subsidising the coal sector to the tune of about DM8bn a year. But German industry, which is saddled with some of the highest electricity prices in the European Union - tarrifs are 30 per cent more expensive than neighbouring France - has repeatedly demanded a reform of the subsidies, claiming they have hindered competitiveness, and competition. In response, the government decided in November 1993 to extend the entire system only until the end of 1996, to impose a 4.5 per cent Kohlepfennig on east Germany even though the region neither produces nor consumes hard coal, and to reduce subsidies to DM7bn between 1997 and 2000. No decision has yet been made about how to finance the subsidies after 1996. Yesterday's court ruling means the matter can no longer be postponed.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

Mr Dobson's paper followed Wednesday's Commons committee report on energy efficiency, which attacked the government for failing to introduce measures to conserve energy. The industry's privatisation had been 'an environmental disaster', Mr Dobson said. It had failed to introduce any measures to clean up electricity generation, develop renewable energy sources such as wind power, or encourage energy efficiency. The government had cut spending on scrubbing equipment for power stations from the Pounds 2bn it promised in 1989 to Pounds 1.2bn, Mr Dobson said. A Labour government would install more scrubbing equipment and would invest in new technologies for burning coal more cleanly and efficiently. It would set up an agency to promote renewable energy. The report did not specify the cost of the proposed measures, but said that the Labour party would introduce a 'cleaner energy levy' to replace the nuclear levy, which raises more than Pounds 1.15bn every year. The government had restructured the industry on the principle of maximising electricity sales without considering the issue of investment in energy conservation, Mr Dobson said. Labour would require the regional electricity companies to spend their own money on energy-efficiency measures.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

By MICHAEL SMITH   NATIONAL Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, sug-gested yesterday that the bulk of the UK electricity market should be reserved for coal-based power as a way of sustaining the UK coal industry. This would involve clearing gas-fired and oil-fired power stations from the 'franchise' market in England and Wales, where regional electricity companies have a monopoly to sell to households and small businesses. This market accounts for 70 per cent of all power demand, but prices have been fixed artificially high to help coal. The company said clearing the franchise market would enable British Coal to increase sales to National Power and PowerGen, its two main clients, from an expected 30m tonnes a year for the four years from 1994, to up to 50m tonnes. In evidence to the Commons' trade and industry select committee, which is inquiring into the economics of the coal industry, National Power said the solution would have the advantage of subjecting the economies of combined cycle gas turbines to the test of the market. CCGTs would be restricted to the non-franchise market, which supplies large customers and in which British Coal is unable to compete effectively. Gas-fired power stations are a significant contributor to the decline of coal demand, but their cost is the subject of considerable debate. Regional electricity companies are able to pass on their costs to customers whether or not they are economic. Mr John Baker, National Power chief executive, said it was possible that uneconomic CCGTs could displace 5m to 10m tonnes of coal a year. 'The regional electricity companies cannot have it both ways. Either the CCGTs are economic and they should fight in the fully contested part of the market, or they are not economic, in which case they should not go ahead.' In a six-page submission to the committee, National Power said it would support a larger market for British Coal, above the 40m tonnes tentatively agreed for next year and 30m thereafter. It believed there was room in the market as a whole to accommodate 40m tonnes a year of British produced coal on long term contracts. National Power was also willing for transitional assistance to be given to British produced coal providing it became competitive with world coal at the end of the transition. The government, it suggested, had three courses. It could either leave the market to determine British coal's future, subsidise coal so that it is offered for sale at world market prices, or require electricity consumers in the franchise market to buy British Coal output. In the last case these consumers would bear the additional costs, in effect continuing to pay a coal levy through electricity bills as in recent years.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "
0,FT942-11675 ,"FT942-11675 _AN-EEDEHAGXFT 940504   FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (15): Smoke gets in their eyes - Fuel and power are a marketing nightmare      By JUDY DEMPSEY   The restructuring and privatisation of eastern Germany's electricity and brown coal sector was arguably one of the greatest challenges facing the Treuhand and the federal government. Brown coal, or lignite, exists in large quantities in Germany and is reclaimed by open cast mining mainly for use in power stations. Faced with the agonising choice of opening the sector to the market or protecting jobs, the compromise agreed in August 1990, between the former east German government, the Treuhand privatisation agency, and west Germany's utility companies ensured that eastern Germany's energy sector would not be exposed to the full rigours of real competition. The Treuhand had inherited two huge and notoriously inefficient fields - Laubag in the states of Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, and Mibrag, in Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony. Employing more than 110,000 people before unification, productivity at the two fields was at least 50 per cent below west German levels, even though east Germany's per capita energy consumption was among the highest in the world, exceeding west Germany's by more than 25 per cent. The potential for waste was enormous. Furthermore, the former east German communists had made brown coal mining a top priority, but failed to allow for the effects on the environment by working out a coherent strip mining plan. By 1989, brown coal accounted for 70 per cent of the region's primary energy consumption. A third of east German railway capacity was engaged in serving this single industry. The Treuhand also inherited the chain of filthy, polluting power stations which ran on brown coal. The plants, run by Veag, east Germany's main electricity company, is due to be privatised later this year. The Treuhand's scope for privatising the electricity sector was restricted from the beginning by the Stromvertrag, or Electricity Contract between the former west and east German governments. Signed in August 1990, it authorised west German utilities to own 51 per cent of east Germany's 15 utilities groups (all under Veag), with the remaining 49 per cent held by east Germany's municipalities. In return, the west German utilities, which include RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, would undertake a large investment programme for Veag. To underwrite investments of about DM46bn in east Germany's electricity network, the Stromvertrag stipulated that east Germany's regional utilities must, over the next 20 years, buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag. Meanwhile, Rheinbraun, RWE's brown coal subsidiary, began assembling a west German consortium to buy east Germany's Laubag brown coal fields as the fuel source for Veag. Laubag will fuel Veag. As for the Mibrag fields, it had been sold last December to an Anglo-American consortium comprising Britain's PowerGen, NRG of Minneapolis, and Morrison-Knudsen of Idaho. Dozens of east Germany's local councils had challenged the Stromvertrag at Germany's Constitutional Court on the grounds that they had the right to 100 per cent of the assets, and not just the 49 per cent stake bequeathed to them in the Stromvertrag. They were overruled. Veag's ownership structure remains intact. In the restructuring of the electricity and brown coal sector, the Treuhand had to establish one criterion: that the value of Laubag and Veag - both interdependent in the sense that Veag relies on Laubag's coal, and both have the same buyers - could not be played off against each other. Since electricity prices in Germany are among the highest in the European Union, there were fears that the bidders for Laubag would beat down the Treuhand with the aim of concentrating on extracting large profits from Veag's electricity sales once the privatisation deal had been closed. After endless negotiations, the settlement for the sale of Laubag and Veag is nearly complete. Last February, RWE, and the other utilities agreed in principle to buy Veag for DM8bn, while Rheinbraun will make a down payment of DM2.1bn for Laubag, with a commitment of a further investment of DM6bn over the next 20 years. In all, Laubag's current work force, down from more than 60,000 to just under 12,000, will be further reduced to 7,000 by the year 2000. Veag, which before unification had a work force of around 29,000, now employs 14,500, and the numbers will continue to fall. Treuhand officials argue that, given the constraints of the Stromvertrag, they attained their twin goal of securing jobs and privatising the industry. Nevertheless, once Veag and Laubag is finally privatised, it will give west Germany's utilities a virtual monopoly over the generation and distribution of electricity throughout east Germany. Mr Jurgen Stotz, a member of Veag's board, staunchly defends the Stromvertrag and says that even if he could start again to restructure Laubag and Veag, he would not radically change what had already been done. 'We were faced with a political and social problem,' he explains. 'We had to find a way of securing a future for brown coal, a DM40bn investment programme to upgrade, or build a total of 12,300 megawatt capacity (most of it reliant on brown coal) and at the same time have a programme to introduce a massive recultivation policy.' Mr Stotz added that when the restructuring is complete, the east's energy sector, including the brown coal fields, will not be subsidised, unlike west Germany's hard coal, each tonne of which is subsidised by about DM180 to keep coal imports down - 'what we have done in eastern Germany will have been worth it,' he said. Nevertheless, some energy experts still ask whether it would have been possible for Bonn to revise the Stromvertrag in a way which would open Veag and Laubag to international competition, thus giving the east German consumer cheaper electricity as well as making eastern Germany the catalyst for opening up the country's energy sector to competition.

0,FT932-10994 ,"FT932-10994 _AN-DEFCSAEAFT 930506   FT  06 MAY 93 / Personal View: Fossil fuel levy fails efficiency test      By DAVID NEWBERY   The long-awaited Department of Trade and Industry white paper on coal reaffirms 'the government's aim of a market-based policy for energy', with a preference for taxes and subsidies rather than directives and prohibitions. Given that national security has already been achieved by the current diversity of fuel supply, generators should be free to buy in the cheapest market. British coal must compete with imports, and will need a transitional subsidy until the industry is privatised. The government's stated objective of bringing efficiency in energy policy makes sense, but there is one area in which it has failed by its own standard. Efficiency requires sensible taxes as well as competitive markets, and the fossil fuel levy (FFL) fails that test. A report by the Trade and Industry select committee calculated that the FFL would eventually collect Pounds 9.1bn, primarily to meet the inherited liabilities of Nuclear Electric (including reprocessing, radioactive waste management and decommissioning), estimated at Pounds 9.3bn. It recommended that both the liabilities and the FFL income be transferred from Nuclear Electric's accounts. Both the coal review and the select committee agreed that existing nuclear power stations should continue to operate, so the FFL will in effect pay for past mistakes, not current operations. If the FFL is needed only to pay for past mistakes, how should the revenue be collected? A good tax would fall on final consumers, as taxes on producers involve additional costs, because consumer prices are not only raised (as with any tax), but the tax also distorts production decisions, which further raises costs. If ICI was forced to close its chlorine plant because the FFL increases electricity prices, that would be an additional cost that could have been avoided if the tax had fallen only on final consumers, as value-added tax would. The obvious solution is to replace the FFL with VAT on electricity. The FFL currently raises about Pounds 1.3bn a year, while the value of domestic electricity consumption is roughly Pounds 7.6bn. VAT on electricity would raise Pounds 1.33bn, almost the same as the FFL. Replacing the FFL (10 per cent) by VAT (17 1/2 per cent) would raise the domestic electricity price by about 6 per cent, but this would be returned in the form of lower prices or higher profits from goods produced with electricity. VAT could be extended to other domestic fuels to avoid a bias against electricity, giving the government about Pounds 1bn extra revenue. In the Budget, the Treasury accepted the logic of VAT on electricity, but made it additional to the FFL, rather than replacing it. Holly Sutherland of Cambridge University's Department of Applied Economics has shown that increases in domestic electricity prices have very adverse effects on the poor. Double taxation of VAT and FFL is particularly harmful. There would be two immediate benefits from changing to VAT, correcting two shortcomings of the white paper. First, Electricite de France (EdF) exports 'non-leviable' electricity to Britain through the cross-Channel link, meaning that the levy collected is paid to EdF. These payments were Pounds 95m in 1991-92. The select committee wished to stop them, but the government believes that may be illegal. It makes no sense to pay France Pounds 95m a year just to finance past British mistakes. If it is illegal to remove the non-leviable status, the problem can be avoided by abolishing the FFL, and moving Nuclear Electric's liabilities to the Treasury. Second, the select committee suggested that larger users pay a lower and decreasing percentage of the FFL. The government accepts that certain large UK electricity users may be at a competitive disadvantage compared with their foreign counterparts, but responded with the fallacious argument that it would not be right to oblige smaller consumers to subsidise large users. The FFL is not a cost, only a device to recover revenue. It is good practice to exempt all producers, not just large producers, from such taxes. VAT automatically does that, and goes some way to removing an avoidable distortion in the electricity market. Doubtless other distortions remain, of which the most important is that created by the market power of the two large generators. The high costs of the pool and the misallocation of the costs of security of grid supply to large users make matters worse. These at least are subject to review, while the design of the tax system is completely under government control, and should be addressed urgently.

However, at the same conference on utility regulation in London, water and electricity companies had few complaints about how the regulatory regime - set up when they were privatised - was working. Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas's director-general, hit back at criticism that he had been too tough on British Gas and interfered arbitrarily in its business. 'British Gas has blamed Ofgas for the decline in its profitability. I suggest it should start looking into the mirror,' he said. But Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas's chief executive, called for the power of utility regulators to be diluted by the appointment of non-executive directors to their boards, and for regulators to be required to give reasons for their decisions. The dispute between Ofgas and British Gas has become particularly bitter since the company was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission last year. The commission is due to report to the government by the end of next month. Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator, and Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water regulator, also dismissed criticism that the regulatory system was not working. Prof Littlechild acknowledged that customers were concerned about utilities' prices and profits but said that he was dealing with such concerns by reviews of the regional electricity companies and the main electricity generators. Mr Byatt emphasised the importance of regulators explaining their judgments but rejected the idea of more detailed rules to constrain their discretion. The regulators received support from Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive of Yorkshire Electric. He said: 'UK regulation is less costly, less combative and more efficient than US regulation.'

The cable - with a proposed capacity of 600 megawatts - would connect the Irish grid to the rest of Europe for the first time. It could also provide a much-needed export opportunity for the UK's coal-fired power stations in the future. If the interconnector ran full-time at full capacity from Wales to Ireland, it would consume power approximately equal to the coal produced by one mine. In real operation, it is likely to account for about half the output of one pit. National Grid and ESB have just completed an economic appraisal and engineering study of two possible routes. Surveys of the sea bed show the cable could run from Dublin to Anglesey in north Wales or from Wexford to Pembrokeshire in south Wales. The next stage will be to arrange financing. According to the provisional timetable, the project could be approved within a year; construction would then start in 1995 and electricity would flow in 1998. The two parties expect the EC to make substantial funds available, in keeping with its policy of encouraging a Europe-wide transmission network. Earlier this month the EC agreed to contribute Pounds 61m towards the cost of a smaller 250MW link between Scotland and Northern Ireland. The electricity systems of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic have been isolated since the 1970s when the cross-border interconnector was taken out of commission after repeated attacks by the IRA. It is unlikely to be reopened unless the overall security situation improves. ESB is keen to end its isolation because Ireland's electricity consumption is still growing steadily and an international link is a much cheaper and more flexible way of meeting peak demand than building power stations. The proposed connection with Wales would expand Ireland's present generating capacity of 4,000MW by 15 per cent. The link would be able to send power in either direction, depending on the relative price and demand for electricity in the UK and Ireland. But Mr Steve Drummond, head of interconnections at National Grid said: 'We are predicting that it will be used mainly to export to Ireland. There will be an opportunity for coal to provide an extra 600MW of electricity in the late 1990s.' Whichever route is chosen for the link, National Grid faces heavy expenditure to minimise the impact on the Welsh landscape. Rather than build an obtrusive line of pylons, the company is likely to bury the cable underground from the point where it comes ashore to the substation where it joins the grid.

0,FT943-8523 ,"FT943-8523 _AN-EHQE6ABDFT 940817   FT  17 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Putting the spark under reforms - A look at attempts by the Indian government to attract foreign investment into building a power sector necessary for the country's economic modernisation      By STEFAN WAGSTYL and SHIRAZ SIDHVA   Free electricity is one of life's few blessings for slum dwellers in Shahdara, east Delhi. It is easily obtained by scrambling up an electricity pole and attaching a wire to the overhead mains. Occasionally, someone gets electrocuted in the process, but not often. Electricity board officials turn a blind eye to such pilfering, which happens all over India. The effort of collecting payment from slums is not worth the revenues. Also, decades of socialist thinking have encouraged many Indians to regard the mostly state-owned electricity distribution boards as welfare agencies. Farmers in Karnataka state, south India, pay just 5 per cent of cost for their current. In neighbouring Tamil Nadu they pay nothing. The result is chronic losses for the industry and frequent power cuts for consumers thanks to electricity shortages. However, the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the reform-minded prime minister, is now committed to overhauling the industry, recognising that without improved electricity supplies, the economic modernisation programme launched in 1991 will grind to a halt. After years of relying on state-owned industry, Mr Rao is calling on private companies - including foreign groups - to build and operate 100 per cent privately-owned power plants. But business has so far been slow to respond. Mr P V Rangayya Naidu, minister of state for power, yesterday told parliament that 75 investors, including 35 from overseas had submitted proposals to the government to invest Rs1,041.52bn (Dollars 33.6bn) to build and operate power stations with a total capacity of more than 20,000MW. But only four small-scale plants with a combined capacity of 1,300MW are under construction, all by Indian-owned companies; four large projects totalling 8,000MW and involving foreign capital, have been approved by the government, but none is yet under way. Businessmen have responded cautiously to the proposals, partly because of the huge scale of the investments and partly because of doubts about the government's ability to overhaul the industry's anti-commercial practices. Even though ministers in Delhi are committed to reform, many local politicians, who use cheap electricity to buy farmers' votes, are not. Mr S V Joshi, director of power distribution at the Indian affiliate of Siemens, the German engineering group, says: 'It took the US 10 years to switch from public to private sector power generation. India can't do it in two or three.' The government's 1992-97 economic plan calls for the addition of 31,000MW of public sector generating capacity to the existing total of 78,000MW (which includes 9,000MW from private plants). The public sector does not have the funds to fulfil the plan. With a large power station costing Dollars 1bn or more, the only viable way for private companies to fund such projects is to split the cost between different equity partners and lenders, including multilateral institutions such as the World Bank. Enron, the US energy group, is planning a Dollars 2bn plant for Maharashtra state to supply Bombay - perhaps the furthest advanced of the schemes involving foreign capital. Enron is considering asking lenders for about 80 per cent of the funds, with the remaining 20 per cent equity split between three partners - Enron, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and General Electric, the US engineering group which would supply much of the equipment. Mr Tom White, chairman of Enron Power, Enron's power generation subsidiary, says raising the money is 'quite a challenge'. The World Bank, the multilateral lending agency which has funded much of India's existing power capacity, has said it will support schemes involving private companies. Officials believe public sector boards are generally poor managers - Indian power plants run at an average of 60 per cent of full capacity and 23 per cent of output is lost during transmission. The Indian government has proposed contracts which would allow generating companies to pass on increases in fuel costs (the main variable cost) and earn a minimum net annual profit of 16 per cent. But most foreign companies say this is not enough. They are asking for central government guarantees that they will be paid by the state-level electricity boards, which are the main distributors. The companies are worried because the electricity boards are controlled by local state governments, which use electricity supply as a political tool. The boards make huge losses because they are unable to charge market rates since politicians manipulate rate increases to protect their constituents, especially farmers. The central government had ruled out guarantees, saying the answer lay in water-tight legally enforceable contracts, but last month, a visiting US delegation headed by Ms Hazel O'Leary, US secretary of energy, convinced the government that few foreign investors would be willing to enter the Indian power sector without counter-guarantees. The government agreed to reconsider its earlier decision, and announced on Friday that the Enron project would be the first to receive a guarantee agreement, valid for the 12 years that the company is servicing its loan obligations. Enron had sought a 25-year guarantee period. The government's decision has, nonetheless, paved the way for guarantee facilities for six other power projects with foreign investment, in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The cabinet also approved guidelines to enable more of the state electricity boards to qualify for government guarantees. The boards and the states in which the power plants are being built will need to prove that they are financially healthy, and the project's financial plans will be closely monitored by the government's Power Finance Corporation. The ministry is considering further incentives to tempt foreign companies. Officials also point to the success of the four Indian private companies in the industry - the Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Company, the Calcutta Electric Supply Company, Ahmedabad Electricity and Tata Electric Companies. All are profitable and most are expanding capacity. As Mr Joshi of Siemens says: 'This proves India can do it.'   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

Reporter Jill Stewart's article ""Utilities Shun Energy Savings, Critics Assert""  (Part I, Jan. 15) ignores several important facts about Edison's extensive  conservation programs.    Edison has the most successful electric utility conservation operation in the  country, encompassing over 50 programs for customers ranging from low-income to  agricultural to large industrial users. We have more than 300 employees working  on conservation and over the years have helped our customers save more than 25  billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.    In 1988 alone we assisted over 75,000 residential customers to conserve their  in-home energy use, more than in any past year. Our conservation  accomplishments have been widely recognized, including more than 15 awards for  excellence in the past two years, and both U.S. and foreign utilities come to  us for advice.    In just the three years 1985-1987, Edison spent nearly $200 million on energy  conservation programs that saved our customers 3.5 billion kilowatt-hours of  electricity.

Reporter Jill Stewart's article ""Utilities Shun Energy Savings, Critics Assert""  (Part I, Jan. 15) ignores several important facts about Edison's extensive  conservation programs.    Edison has the most successful electric utility conservation operation in the  country, encompassing over 50 programs for customers ranging from low-income to  agricultural to large industrial users. We have more than 300 employees working  on conservation and over the years have helped our customers save more than 25  billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.    In 1988 alone we assisted over 75,000 residential customers to conserve their  in-home energy use, more than in any past year. Our conservation  accomplishments have been widely recognized, including more than 15 awards for  excellence in the past two years, and both U.S. and foreign utilities come to  us for advice.    In just the three years 1985-1987, Edison spent nearly $200 million on energy  conservation programs that saved our customers 3.5 billion kilowatt-hours of  electricity. This is the equivalent of conserving almost 6 million barrels of  fuel oil per year. Our efforts have already enabled us to eliminate the need to  construct two major power plants.

By last night, the UK's 15 suppliers of electricity to households had received more than 240,000 payments and British Gas had taken in 66,000. Numbers paying in advance of April 1, when VAT is imposed, have more than doubled in the past week and by last night total receipts had reached Pounds 150m. That figure is expected to be dwarfed by next Friday - the day by which most companies say they need to receive cheques in order to clear them in time. The VAT rate on domestic fuel will be 8 per cent for the first year, before rising to 17.5 per cent in April 1995. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, will next week ask Offer and Ofgas, the electricity and gas industry watchdogs, what they intend to do about the 'windfall cash' being built up by domestic fuel suppliers. The companies, many of which are cash-rich after a better than expected performance since privatisation, will earn considerable amounts of interest on the pre-payments. They say they have not encouraged pre-payment and that they have had to spend money to cover costs of customers paying in advance. Eastern Electricity, based in Ipswich, says it will need to take in between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m to generate enough interest to cover extra staffing, telephone and computer costs. It has already received close to that amount. Most power and gas consumers, who have elected to pay in advance, have forwarded the equivalent of between one and two years' bills. But Manweb, based in Chester, says one customer has paid the equivalent of 21 years' bills and Seeboard, in Hove, says another has paid a sum equal to 18 years' usage. East Midlands says it has received a cheque for Pounds 7,500, although it does not specify how long this may cover. The average annual household electricity power bill is about Pounds 300. The gas bill of an average three-bedroomed house with gas central heating is about Pounds 380. British Gas has seen a north-south divide. In the North Thames region, which takes in central London, 14,000 customers have made some form of pre-payment. This compares with just over 3,500 customers pre-paying in British Gas's north west region, its largest, which encompasses Manchester and Liverpool. Among individual electricity companies with high receipts are Bristol-based Sweb with 40,000 paying Pounds 18m and Manweb, where 38,000 have paid Pounds 14.5m.

In a boisterous Commons debate he faced a barrage of interruptions from Labour critics, and anxious questions from some Tory backbenchers, as he insisted that the government had not given any guarantee that 12 pits could be saved. Mr Hunt also angered Labour MPs by contending that privatisation would help to ensure a continuing role for Britain's coal industry. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, maintained that in spite of the cautious words used by ministers in public the press had been 'heavily briefed' that 12 pits would be saved. He said two of the pits were already doomed as a result of ballots in which the miners were offered an extra Pounds 10,000 on top of their redundancy payments if they voted for closure, and the other 10 were still at risk. Mr Cook argued that with the market 'rigged' against it British Coal could not be blamed because, even with the new subsidy offered by the government, it had so far failed to secure additional orders from the electricity generators. Even though coal was being offered at 40 per cent below the base contract price the electricity generators were not prepared to place additional orders because they had retained large stocks and preferred to enter into 'sweetheart deals' for new gas-fired power stations. Mr Cook said the nuclear subsidy provided by the government was being used by the electricity generators to import electricity from France at a higher price than coal available from the British pits which are facing closure through lack of orders. He protested that the government had offered the generators a subsidy without implementing a recommendation by the Commons trade and industry committee requiring them to enter into contracts for an additional 21m tons of coal. Mr Richard Caborn (Lab Sheffield Central), chairman of the committee, warned that without a package of measures similar to that it had recommended, the remainder of the 12 pits would close at the rate of one a month. Mr Hunt said the industry had to come to terms with a substantial change in the energy market, and while it had a future it could not rely on an 'open-ended' subsidy designed to keep alive uneconomic pits. He said the generators held stocks of 30m tons, and this obviously had an effect on the market.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P1222 Bituminous Coal-Underground.

Mr Laszlo Pal, industry minister, said electricity prices for households would rise by 65 per cent and for gas by 53 per cent from January. Details of price rises for industry were not given, but Mr Pal said they would be significantly lower than those for domestic users. To soften the blow, the government, which faces nationwide local elections on Sunday, will allocate Ft9bn (Pounds 52m) from the state budget to compensate those most hit by the increases. The price rises increase the value of the state electricity and gas companies which the government plans to privatise next year, but analysts estimate household energy prices, which are controlled by the state, need to rise by 100 per cent to bring them to world levels and cover production and modernisation costs.

They said the EC's executive complained to the European  Court  of Justice that France, Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Italy and the  Netherlands were retaining the monopolies in contravention of  the EC's principles of free competition.    The move is an attempt to pressure the six countries into  accepting a directive from the Commission that they should make  their state-owned utility networks available to power companies  from other countries.    The directive has been blocked for nearly two years. The  Commission is targeting France for its electricity and gas  monopolies, Denmark for gas, and Spain, Italy, Ireland and the  Netherlands for their electricity monopolies.

The losses, to be made 'at all levels' next year, represent 10 per cent of the company's staff in its core electricity business and follow a similar percentage cut over the past two years. The privatised utility has 1.2m business and domestic customers in Avon, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. Mr Derek Lickorish, customer service and marketing manager, said yesterday that Sweb was responding to the electricity supply review by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator. He added that the cost-cutting was 'part of an ongoing commitment to contribute to price stability. We want to maintain Sweb's competitiveness'. He added: 'We hope to achieve the job losses through natural wastage, redeployment and voluntary redundancy.' Other measures will include internal restructuring, retraining and a consolidation of office locations. Other regional electricity companies have been shedding jobs to improve efficiency. Several thousand jobs have been lost in the past year alone and, with the companies under pressure from Prof Littlechild to contain costs, many more redundancies are expected. Southern Electric has already announced that 1,000 jobs will go over the next three years. Which? said that Sweb was the equal worst of the regional electricity companies at keeping appointments and worst at connecting new customers quickly. But it said the company had won a government charter mark for improvements in service. Mr Lickorish defended Sweb's service record. He said: 'We do not believe we have poor standards but that does not mean we are complacent.' Mr John Seed, chief executive, said Sweb had responded effectively to the changing demands on it.

Mr Eggar said he would press for the quick introduction of a free energy market when he meets European Community energy ministers in Brussels tomorrow. He was speaking at a conference in London organised by the Confederation of British Industry and the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry. His comments suggested that energy liberalisation might be a theme when the UK takes over the EC presidency in July. The UK leads the way in deregulation of electricity and gas industries, but may face strong opposition in pushing for greater liberalisation from countries such as France and the Netherlands. Mr Eggar said industry and 350m consumers across Europe would have 'everything to gain' from cheaper gas and electricity, with only a handful of vested interests likely to be losers. He suggested there was a 'striking contradiction at the heart of Europe'. 'It is quite extraordinary that we have been spending so much time making sure that goods can cross frontiers but we apparently find it impossible for gas and electricity to flow across frontiers.' He said significant disparities still existed between electricity and gas prices in different European countries. He also warned that European industry might find it impossible to compete with the rest of the world unless energy prices fell, as they were in the liberalised markets of the US and Japan. Mr Eggar said arguments that electricity and gas were natural monopolies, and that only monopolies had sufficient economic security to undertake large investment programmes required by energy projects, had been proved wrong by the liberalised UK electricity market, and the gas market in the US. He also countered claims by opponents of energy liberalisation that it would require a 'huge centralised regulatory bureaucracy'. Regulation could be left to member countries operating within an agreed framework.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT942-13006 ,"FT942-13006 _AN-ED0DLAC5FT 940427   FT  27 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: All eyes on efficiency - Can electricity companies be serious about saving energy if profits are tied to volume sales?      By MICHAEL SMITH   Mention energy efficiency to an electricity distribution company executive in the UK and he is likely to wax lyrical about his company's initiatives in the field. But behind the bluster, he might look a touch nervous. Not everyone agrees that the industry is doing all it should to help both customers and the system to improve energy efficiency, and the pressure for change is growing. Offer, the industry watchdog, is conducting a fundamental review of the way it regulates the distribution businesses of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales and Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric in Scotland. Energy efficiency is a key consideration. The issue is dividing the industry. There is no mood within the sector to abandon the form of regulation, favoured by Offer, which limits prices the companies charge rather than their profits. Offer and the companies believe this encourages the industry to be more efficient than would be the case with profit regulation. However, some regional electricity companies, backed by environmentalists, say the way the prices are curbed encourages companies to increase sales volumes rather than sell their customers energy-efficient measures. Others argue that introducing a system that leaves companies indifferent to the amount of electricity they sell would lead them to ignore customer needs. This would increase prices and eventually sideline the industry at the expense of competitors such as gas companies. There is a consensus in the industry on the need to promote energy efficiency. As Offer says, it helps keep customers' bills down and potentially reduces the harmful sulphur and carbon emitted from electricity generating plants. But why should the industry care? John Roberts, chief executive of Chester-based distributor Manweb, is refreshingly honest about the industry's motives. 'It would be nice to say we are concerned about the future of the globe and, of course, we are. But the fact is that we would rather get into this in a voluntary way that we can control than have something imposed upon us. We cannot stand back Canute-like while others demand change.' Manweb, in common with most other regional distributors, is receptive to the idea of the regulator allowing regional companies to raise a specified amount from customers to use on targeted demand-side management (DSM). For example, companies could aim energy-efficiency measures at low-income households which would otherwise not be interested in such activity. DSM measures, common in the US, could reduce the costs of maintaining and operating the distribution system to the benefit of all customers. Even under the present price control arrangements, DSM can be cost effective both for power companies and their customers - for example, where it enables improvements to the network to be deferred. However, as distributor Seeboard, based at Hove on the south coast, points out, many DSM schemes are not pursued by distributors because they will reduce the number of units sold. This is the crux of the debate over regulation and energy efficiency. Existing regulatory controls limit rises in use-of-system charges, which form the bulk of distribution revenues. In England and Wales, these charges can rise by up to 2.5 per cent above inflation a year, while in Scotland they must fall by 0.5 per cent in real terms each year. Crucially, however, the price control formula operates on a base price per kilowatt hour (made up of a weighted basket of components). The effect is to constrain the average revenue per unit distributed. This means total revenue depends on the volume of sales. Critics complain that this formula does not match revenues to costs, and fails to supply the surrogate competition which is the point of regulation in monopoly industries. The current formula assumes that all distribution costs vary with the volume of sales whereas in fact other factors include the number of customers and fixed costs. According to the Association for the Conservation of Energy, the result is that regional distributors collect more distribution revenue from the sale of the marginal unit of electricity than it costs to distribute. 'This creates an inappropriate incentive to sell more.' The association recommends there should be no volume incentive and regulation should be based on fixed costs and the number of customers. Seeboard, a regional power distributor, supports the idea that revenue incentives should reflect underlying costs 'as this is consistent with the aim of using regulatory measures to emulate competitive forces. The conflict between the incentive to sell more units of electricity and the objective of encouraging energy efficiency is clear and any revised price formula should reduce or eliminate this conflict'. Seeboard believes revenues should be linked to the number of customers served and to fixed costs, as well as volumes. That proposal, however, is anathema to companies such as Southern Electric. Henry Casley, Southern chief executive, says: 'At the extreme, if the volume incentive was eliminated, distributors would not want anybody to use electricity, since extra sales would give rise to additional costs but no additional revenue. The electricity industry could be sidelined.' Southern denies that the industry has been lacklustre in promoting energy efficiency. Over the past five years its energy marketing activities have achieved cumulative sales of some 2,000 gigawatt hours which have displaced 6,000 GWh of competing fuels. Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity, warns that if the link between revenue and volumes is diluted, this would put a partial or full cap on revenue and would reduce significantly the commercial incentive to continue marketing energy efficiency. 'Inter-fuel competition, principally between electricity and gas, would disappear,' he says. Electricity sales would fall faster than revenue and prices would be allowed to rise. The campaign by Southern and others for the 100 per cent volume incentive to be kept seems unlikely to be fully successful. In its recent review of the regional companies' supply businesses, Offer introduced a system which related revenues to a mixture of volumes, fixed costs and customer numbers. A private letter from Offer to the regional companies last week indicated that this was likely to be the approach in the distribution review. The question, to be answered on completion of the review in July, is how far Offer goes.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

He was speaking after publishing a report which disappointed supporters of the coal lobby by approving the decisions of regional electricity companies to buy gas from new stations which they are helping to build. The report was welcomed by the regional companies but criticised by the generators, who found 'serious flaws' in the report's analysis. National Power and PowerGen, the main generators in England and Wales, said they were confident the prices in their contracts with the regional companies for coal-fired power were fully justified. Prof Littlechild's investigation into the generators' margins and costs in their coal and other contracts might cast a shadow over the companies for some time. He said 'immediate and unambiguous answers to questions about their future profitability' were not likely. He was still seeking information from the two companies, he added. Although the regional distribution companies were relieved by the regulator's approval of the gas contracts, there is concern about his examination of the application of yardstick price controls to them. This could mean that, if gas stations did not prove to be the cheapest source of electricity available during the period of the contracts, the regional companies would have difficulty in passing the costs to customers. Prof Littlechild said he was looking for a form of price control that provided a sharper incentive to the regional companies to purchase economically. One form of yardstick would mean that the companies would only be able to pass on average costs incurred by all the sector. Alternatively there could be an index related to fuel costs rather than electricity costs. Prof Littlechild said that whatever was decided it would not be appropriate to apply yardsticks to the five-year coal deals already agreed tentatively between British Coal, the generators and the regional companies. This will be a relief to the government, which wants the tentative contracts to underpin any deal it comes up with to rescue some of the 31 UK pits threatened with closure. In clearing the regional companies in their 'dash for gas' Prof Littlechild said that on average contracts with independent gas stations accounted for 17 per cent to 18 per cent of requirements for electricity between 1995 and 1998. Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said his company remained unconvinced of Prof Littlechild's analysis. 'In our view he still does not do justice to our coal-backed offer.'

0,FT924-8659 ,"FT924-8659 _AN-CKJB2ADPFT 921110   FT  10 NOV 92 / Letter: Electricity in an open market      From Prof JAMES LAWTON   Sir, The purpose of the electrical supply industry is to provide reliable, economically priced electricity to the consumer. The ability of generators to optimise fuel price and security of supply in both the short and long term on the world markets is a major factor in achieving this objective. Prof Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, was therefore correct in telling the Department of Trade and Industry select committee that it is not his job to determine fuel mix. However, it is his job to protect the consumer. In regard to the gas contracts of the regional electricity companies he referred to his power to disallow uneconomic charges to pass through. He then went on to indicate that there is not a single price for electricity, that there were factors other than price and that it is not his job to review every gas contract signed by the regional electricity companies (RECs). Given this apparently self-negating interpretation (with which I agree), how to move forward? Clearly the requirement is for mechanisms that encourage proper market behaviour. Specifically, contract negotiations should be conducted in an open market and not, as now, in secret. Then prima facie evidence for misuse of market power by either RECs or generators would be visible, acting as a deterrent and providing both transparency for regulatory bodies and easily accessible evidence for any inquiry.

0,FT923-15596 ,"FT923-15596 _AN-CGABQAE7FT 920701   FT  01 JUL 92 / Muscles flexed in power play: Juliet Sychrava on the case for electricity discounts      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   MR Tim Eggar, the energy minister, is in a confrontation with Britain's blue-chip companies that might force him to tighten electricity industry regulation. Yesterday angry industrialists from the Energy Intensive Users Group lobbied the minister for an urgent reduction in their electricity bill, just a day after ICI publicly complained about electricity prices. ICI said that without an electricity price cut, its chlorine business could not compete in Europe. 'Our problem needs to be solved pretty well overnight,' said Mr Bryan Bulloch, power services manager at ICI's chlor-alkali plant. Mr Peter Ruff of the Chemical Industries Association, of which ICI is a member, supported ICI's view. 'It is in the government's interest to make sure energy pricing is realistic in the chemical sector,' he said. The chemical industry contributed about Pounds 3bn to the balance of payments, and employed 300,000 people, but sharply rising electricity bills were threatening the sector, he said. Other large companies, such as Blue Circle, Ranks Hovis McDougall and GKN, also attacked Mr Eggar when he met the Major Energy Users Council (MEUC) earlier this week. The companies say their bills have risen by anywhere between 10 per cent and 30 per cent since electricity privatisation two years ago. That contrasts with Mr Eggar's claim that 'the benefits of privatisation are coming through', made last week after South Wales Electricity said it would cut its prices by up to 2 per cent. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, said that with average profit increases of 40 per cent, other regional companies could have done far more for customers. What Mr Eggar can do for those customers now is uncertain. Traditionally, the government has countered complaints from ICI and others by saying they were simply paying the price of losing the subsidies they enjoyed before privatisation. Many large users deny that they want subsidies back. Mr Ruff said the CIA just wanted a breathing space until companies such as ICI could genuinely choose their supplier, for instance from overseas. But Mr Neil Tribick, vice-chairman of the electricity group of MEUC, wants lower prices for big customers now. That does not mean subsidies, he says, it means normal commercial practice. 'At the moment, the domestic consumer buys his energy at the same rate as industrialists buying a million times more. There is no recognition of large consumers' value to the industry.' Without large consumers there would be no reliable demand, but peaks and troughs that would make the generators' life impossible, he claims. Domestic consumers already pay an average of about 3p a unit more than large consumers. But, Mr Tribick and others argue, the differential is far less than on the Continent, where, he said, his competitors paid at least 10 per cent to 15 per cent less for their electricity. Another large user from the steel industry said: 'If we moved across the Channel we would pay 50 per cent less.' That, many large users say, is because of high UK prices, not Continental subsidies. Breaking down the UK price, they argue that it could be substantially cut. First, the 11 per cent nuclear levy or subsidy all electricity consumers pay to Nuclear Electric should go, especially now that the company is making more money. Second, the regional companies' and National Grid Company's profits show that their charges to customers for using the electricity network were set too high at privatisation and should be brought down. Finally, they should receive a discount on the underlying cost of wholesale electricity. ICI has another suggestion. It could buy coal on the world market and pay the electricity industry a charge for converting it to power. Mr Bryan Bulloch of ICI said yesterday: 'I think there is a chink there for a solution and the DTI may seriously consider it.' Large users believe there are a number of things Mr Eggar can do now. He can encourage Offer, the industry watchdog which is reviewing National Grid's charges, to take a firm line. He can bring forward the review of the regional companies' charges, which is due in 1994, and start cutting the nuclear levy. One large user pointed out that there was a precedent for tightening electricity regulation and squeezing profits in this way. 'The history of privatised monopolies is that regulation needs to be tightened up. The government set charges too generously. Now it must squeeze them.'  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

France's nuclear programme, the biggest in western Europe, is highly efficient and has helped reduce the country's dependence on imported energy, says the IEA, an influential advisory and co-ordination body which groups most members of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Since the 1973 oil price shock, France has halved its dependence on energy imports but still buys nearly all its oil from abroad, says the IEA in a report to mark France's entry to the organisation. France refused to join the IEA on its formation in 1974 because it feared this would diminish its energy policy independence, but changed its mind during the Gulf war, in view of the organisation's success in co-ordinating the west's oil stocks. The IEA praises France's low carbon dioxide pollution, a side effect of its nuclear dependence. Emissions of carbon dioxide there have fallen by a quarter over the past 12 years to 1.9 tonnes per head, among the lowest in the IEA. Yet the organisation warns that France should now do more to diversify away from nuclear energy, which accounts for 75-80 per cent of electricity and 37 per cent of total energy use. 'This is a concern from the point of view of the flexibility of the system,' said Mrs Helga Steeg, IEA executive director. The report stresses that France should maintain and modernise its nuclear programme, but suggests it should consider supplementing this with more natural gas and clean coal technology. It also disapproves of exports of nuclear electricity, a significant source of income for Electricite de France, which Mrs Steeg argued was 'not a solid policy' for importing countries. Last year Britain was France's largest export customer, followed by Switzerland and Italy. French electricity prices do not always reflect costs, especially in home central heating, adds the report. Improvement is needed here to encourage energy saving and to give a fairer chance to other kinds of energy. It does not question the usefulness of the monopolies held by France's state-owned electricity and gas utilities, but urges France to promote more competition in energy supply.

By far the majority of privatised government stocks have outperformed the market - that is, fared better than the average share - both immediately after flotation and in subsequent years. Investing in former public sector companies does not guarantee success, as buyers of shares in British Steel and British Aerospace can testify. Both have underperformed the FTSE-100 index by 50 per cent since their privatisations in 1988 and 1981 respectively, although in BAe's case the underperformance has occurred mainly in the last two years. However, BAe and British Steel are the exceptions rather than the rule. More typical - and more relevant to NIE - is the performance of the electricity companies since privatisation of the sector began three years ago. Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric, considered to be the tightest priced of all electricity stocks in the electricity privatisation process, have seen their share rise from 240p in June 1991 to 323p and 342p respectively. If they had merely kept pace with the market, their prices would be 279p. NIE's flotation benefits from the more generous approach which the government displayed in privatising the England and Wales electricity companies. One view is that this is because the NIE flotation will face competition for funds from the sale of the third tranche of BT shares. Northern Ireland Electricity procures electricity from the province's four generators, privatised separately last year, and transmits and supplies it to the whole of the province. The company is being offered at Pounds 362m, consisting of 164.6m shares of 220p each. For utility investors, the most important consideration is the dividend yield, and for NIE this is high. The average historic yield for the regional electricity companies in the England and Wales is about 5.3 per cent; for NIE it is 5.8 per cent. This, together with the City's positive view of NIE's management and prospects, means that, barring unexpected changes in the market, shares in the company are likely to rise on the first day of trading on June 21. Some analysts believe 10 per cent is possible. That does not necessarily mean that everyone should apply for shares. Investors hoping for large, quick profits will probably be disappointed. More than 800,000 people have registered an interest in the shares, and that means that some may get less than 100 shares, the minimum application. Profits, after dealing costs, of such a small amount of shares would be virtually negligible. Investors should therefore consider the long term. Among concerns about tying up capital for long periods will be the unpredicatibility of Northern Ireland politics. Government practice is to replace assets which have been damaged through terrorism but there are no cast iron guarantees. Even if all costs of a terrorist attack were recovered, there could be long term effects on staff morale and productivity. Analysts believe such considerations are outweighed by the positive elements offered by NIE. Chief among these is that the regulatory regime covering the province is settled until at least 1997. In England and Wales, the regulator has said that he may refer the generators to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, and the 12 regional electricity companies (Recs) face regulatory reviews over the next year which could limit their ability to increase profits and increase dividends. Northern Ireland has no such uncertainty and its innovatory regulatory regime means that most of the prospective income in transmission and distribution is guaranteed, regardless of whether sales go up and down. If unit sales fall, NIE is allowed to raise its prices. This is a double edged sword. It increases potential for slack marketing in the lead-up to the competitive threat posed by British Gas which may start selling gas to households from the middle of the decade. However, it also provides the company with an even greater incentive for cutting costs. The scope is considerable given that there are six employees per thousand customers compared with the Recs' 3.6. All this means that NIE should be able to increase dividends by about 12 per cent a year for the next four years and most analysts are advising clients to apply for shares. Some, including John Wilson, of UBS, believe it may even be worth buying shares in the market early on the first day of trading, before prices rise significantly. 'The company makes an excellent long term investment and provides a good hedge against the regulatory risk of the electricity companies in England and Wales,' he says.

He told a coal conference in Amsterdam that neither company would make important additional commitments in the run-up to privatisation 'other than at a price which would allow them to add to stocks in place of future additional purchases'. This is a reference to a suggestion by one of the generators that it may be prepared to buy coal in the short term but only at a price considerably below the 92p a gigajoule offered by British Coal. British Coal is reluctant to agree to such a deal because it would jeopardise future sales at a potentially higher price by a privatised coal industry. Mr Clarke's comments come amid anxiety in coal communities that the corporation will move shortly, possibly this week, to close pits among the 15 or so considered vulnerable. British Coal operates 30 pits, following 21 closures since last October. Mr Clarke warned last week that he was pessimistic about the prospects of 12 mines reprieved by the government in a white paper last March. He told yesterday's conference of international coal executives that the scope for import penetration in the UK was very limited. The UK coal market was being squeezed out by other fuels 'for reasons which appear to have little to do with the economics of generating electricity.' The Major Energy Users' Council, representing large companies including Imperial Chemical Industries, has urged Offer, the electricity regulator, to refer the electricity generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. In its submission the council says the MMC should examine the behaviour of the electricity companies and the operation of the wholesale electricity pool. It asserts that there is 'little, if any, evidence of vigorous competition and this is probably inevitable with a duopoly structure'. Editorial Comment, Page 21   Companies:-  British Coal Corp.

The TVA announced yesterday that it would not complete a half-built reactor at Watts Bar in Tennessee, or two reactors at Bellefonte in Alabama, though it expects to start another virtually complete Watts Bar reactor next autumn, joining three reactors already in operation. 'We are still in the testing phase for Watts Bar 1. I believe that will be the last stand for this generation of nuclear power in the country,' said Mr Craven Crowell, the TVA chairman. The authority will decide next year what to do with the three reactors, one of which is 88 per cent complete. Mr Crowell said that he had a duty at least to look for financial partners who might want to complete the reactors, though he thought it improbable that he would find any. 'I don't hold out great hope,' he said. 'It just costs too much to build a nuclear plant.' The partially completed plants could be converted, however, to another energy source such as natural gas. The decision to halt construction was driven by the need to do something about the TVA's heavy debt burden, which now totals Dollars 26bn (Pounds 16.6bn). Perhaps Dollars 17bn of that can be attributed to the ambitious nuclear construction programme which the TVA began in 1966. 'One third of our operating costs goes towards paying interest on our debt, and the debt has been driven by nuclear construction,' Mr Crowell said. Under the new policy announced yesterday, the TVA will stop adding to its total debt no later than October 1997, and will maintain an internal debt cap about Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn below the ceiling of Dollars 30bn set by the US Congress. Nuclear reactors are usually more expensive to build than fossil fuel electricity generation plants but they use less fuel. Even so, ever tighter safety standards have increased construction costs, and also have required utilities to spend more money on adding safety features to their existing reactors. In addition to that, the federal government's inability to come up with a long-term storage site for highly radioactive nuclear waste has left nuclear generators wondering what to do with their spent fuel. The nuclear energy industry, however, argues that advanced reactor designs can provide competitively priced electricity and are essential to the long-term US energy security. Mr Crowell, however, says that the TVA cannot continue to pile up debt by pursuing an out-of-date nuclear policy, and must get its costs down in the shorter term, in preparation for deregulation of the electricity industry. He believes that privatisation of the TVA is unlikely, nevertheless, because of its nuclear division.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

The Grid, which runs the electricity transmission system in England and Wales, also asked large industrial users to consider signing up to be cut off at short notice in return for savings on their annual bills of around 10 per cent. The proposals mark the latest move to increase the flexibility of the electricity supply system where power generation is currently in the hands of the duopoly made up by National Power and PowerGen. National Grid currently pays Pounds 310m a year to the two generators for a series of back-up services required to run a safe, and economic electricity supply. These costs are, in turn, passed on to consumers. If large users, and eventually, domestic customers, agree to be cut off during peak periods, the Grid will not require certain back-up services such as plant held in reserve (by the generators) to meet surges in demand. 'By securing an alternative supply for these vital services, we are expanding competition into this area. 'There is a potential for significant cost reductions,' Mr Charles Davis, the Grid's commercial manager, said at a seminar for 100 representatives of the UK's largest electricity-using businesses. At the same meeting, speakers from Florida outlined the state's success in getting domestic consumers to agree to be cut off at certain times. They estimated that by the year 2000 all of the state's reserve requirements will be provided in this way. However, UK industry experts said that the metering technology for households to be involved in such a scheme is expensive. National Power welcomed the Grid's proposals, but said the room for cost savings was limited as a certain number of back-up services could be provided only by power stations.

The International Union of Electricity Producers and Distributors (Unipede) forecasts that gas growth and increased efficiency in power production should lead to a 15 per cent fall in carbon dioxide emissions per unit of electricity between 1990 and 2010. Demand for power is also likely to grow more slowly as fuel efficiency measures take effect. Unipede puts the annual rise at 1.8 per cent between 1990 and 2010, against 3.4 per cent in the previous two decades. Growth will be considerably more marked in southern Europe than in the north. Unipede's forecasts are published today as more than 1,000 mainly European delegates meet in Birmingham, England, for the union's week-long triennial conference. The growing use of natural gas has been prompted by economic and environmental considerations. In most countries power stations fired by combined cycle gas turbine technology produce cheaper electricity than new plants using coal and nuclear power energy. Unipede forecasts that nuclear power's share of the market will fall from 34 to 31 per cent between 1990 and 2010. Coal is predicted to suffer the biggest decline, from 37 to 29 per cent, and oil to drop from 10 to 6 per cent. Gas is expected to rise from 7 to 20 per cent. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 43 per cent during the two decades. Within the overall increase, the share of domestic and agricultural sectors is expected to remain at about 25 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. The share of demand from services is expected to rise from 22 to 26 per cent but industrial consumption is forecast to fall from 44 to 40 per cent. Although there is currently a surplus of electricity generation in western Europe, Unipede expects the total to grow by about a fifth from the current 500 gigawatts.

0,FT942-2249 ,"FT942-2249 _AN-EFTD4AF2FT 940620   FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (8): Bonanza raises hackles  -British utilities face profiteering charges      By MICHAEL SMITH   Four years after the England and Wales electricity system was privatised, the companies created for the state sell-off are in a state of flux. Professor Stephen Littlechild, director general of the Office of Electricity Regulation, is reviewing price controls which consumers say have allowed the regional distribution companies to make excessive profits. He is threatening tough action following charges that their prices and profits are too high, sometimes blatantly so. National Power and PowerGen, the generating companies carved from the non-nuclear assets of the Central Electricity Generating Board, have also been under the regulator's scrutiny following claims, particularly from large customers, that they have too much influence over the market. In this, say critics, the generators are assisted by a trading system, the wholesale electricity pool, which constitutes one of the most complicated and arcane markets in the world and is in need of serious reform. The judge and jury on the charges is Professor Littlechild, the industry regulator who was appointed earlier this year for a second five year term of office. He cleared the generators of abusing their power, but nevertheless struck a deal to temper their strength. He is also increasing pressure for reform of the trading pool. One possibility is that companies will be allowed to bypass the pool when they trade in electricity; existing rules mean all power must be traded through the pool. The pool is also conducting experiments to allow buyers of electricity a greater role in price determination. With so much change in the air other countries must be wondering whether the UK experiment in electricity privatisation has gone wrong. Not surprisingly the electricity companies deny this. They argue that the changes are evolutionary rather than revolutionary and are refining a system that has, after all, kept the lights on and has reduced prices in real terms for all but the very largest companies. Consumer groups dispute the claim of price reductions, pointing out that it depends which date you take as the start of privatisation. But there is grudging recognition that the industry is more efficient and more service-oriented than it was before privatisation. Occasional calls for renationalisation attract little support and the Labour Party would be unlikely to make it a priority if it won the next general election. However, few people would deny that the government committed errors when it laid the groundwork for privatisation at breakneck speed in the late 1980s. Most industry analysts believe that the CEGB's non-nuclear assets should have been broken up into a greater number of smaller bundles than the two chunks allocated to National Power and PowerGen. Even ministers acknowledge this as a mistake, pointing out it was influenced by the original plan to include the commercially unattractive nuclear stations in the sale. The reasoning was that the stock market would not buy small power companies that included nuclear stations. In the end, the government was persuaded that investors would not buy any nuclear stations, whatever the size of the parent company, and they were kept in the state sector. By then, however, it was too late to split up National Power and PowerGen without abandoning the timetable for privatisation. It was left to Prof Littlechild to sort out the subsequent problems, and this was what he attempted to do in his settlement with them earlier this year. The deal is that the generators will endeavour to sell off 5,000 to 6,000MW of generating plant by the end of next year; until then they have agreed to adopt policies which will lead to reducing prices in the electricity pool. In exchange, Prof Littlechild agreed he would not refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for at least two years. By then, competition will have grown as independently-owned power plants come on stream. The deal satisfied few, other than the large users of electricity including Imperial Chemical Industries, who buy their power supplies at prices directly related to the pool price. However, the vast majority of consumers are unaffected by short term pool price changes since their supplies are covered by long term hedging contracts. They were, therefore, indifferent to Prof Littlechild's settlement with the generators. Independent generation companies, however, complained that the price cap would deter them from setting up new plants. Given that the deal was supposed to foster competition, this is a serious charge. Another problem is that the settlement may turn out to be merely a temporary fix. It is far from certain that the generators will be able to find buyers for their plant at the kind of prices that they consider acceptable. And even if they do, the plant they keep will probably continue to set the price in the electricity pool. It is this power to set prices that most offends free market champions like Prof Littlechild. Little wonder then that he is pushing for the pool to accept bypass arrangements. The more trade occurs outside the pool - that is between a generator and a customer - the less important its prices become. However, securing the industry's agreement for bypass arrangements will not be easy. Some companies including regional electricity companies argue that the pool is effectively bypassed anyway because of the hedging arrangements. They are concerned that formal bypass arrangements would make the pool even less transparent and would produce little savings for consumers. Concerned though the regional electricity companies are about pool reform, their over-riding consideration this summer is the distribution review which Prof Littlechild is conducting. Leaks of a letter from his office to the companies earlier this summer suggested that the companies may have to reduce distribution prices by up to 20 per cent next April. Future increases would be limited to inflation minus 4 per cent. Several of the companies are warning privately that unless Prof Littlechild softens his line then they will take their case to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Most analysts think the regulator will compromise and allow the companies a return on their assets which they can present to shareholders as at least reasonable. Undoubtedly the excessively good times are over for the distribution companies. But the party is not about to end.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

The company, however, raised its total dividend for the year by 16 per cent to 19.5p,compared with 16.8p, putting it among the leaders in the regional electricity companies' dividend race. Pre-tax profits for the group were Pounds 145.5m, up Pounds 3m on the year before and were also after lower interest payable of Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 11.2m). Earnings per share were shown up from 47.5p to 49.5p. The Pounds 20m exceptional charge related to the decision last March to sell or close down the group's 96 retail units because of accumulated losses. Mr John Wilson, the chairman, said it had been a year of 'considerable change and progress'. He cited the sharp improvement in the contracting business, which had transformed a Pounds 17m loss into a small profit, and the Pounds 90m acquisition of BAA's electricity distribution networks at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. He said the company 'had cleared the decks' and it was time to signal confidence through a strong increase in the dividend. The rise in the pay-out, the second highest in the current electricity results season, followed a lag in dividend growth relative to earnings growth in the two years since privatisation, and 'you can't dissociate yourself from what's happening around you', according to Mr Wilson. Costs had also been reduced through higher productivity, manpower reductions, lower bad debts and a pension surplus. Real cost savings amounted to 6.6 per cent. London Electricity is passing some of the benefit on to customers through a 2 per cent tariff reduction in April and a Pounds 7.50 rebate next autumn. Mr Roger Urwin, the chief executive, said that London's future strategy would be to diversify into areas close to the core business, utilising the company's skills and its strong financial position. COMMENT Clearing the decks is the word for it. London has now sorted out its non-core business, and though the price was high, that is more than can be said for a lot of other RECs. Meanwhile, the BAA deal shows promise, and lies close to London's skills and operating area. Another healthy sign was the reduction in gearing despite the acquisition. The strong dividend growth was basically a catch-up after two years of slow growth, though it leaves the level of cover at the low end in the sector. The shares rose 10p to 476p in a strong market. Warburg Securities has London on a prospective yield of 5.8 per cent, which is above the sector average, and probably generous given that the clean-out has now been accomplished.

Representing the parliamentary group of  the National Democratic Union [NDU], Sadoyan drew the attention  of the reporters to the figures in the budget that was recently  passed by the Supreme Council and demonstrated that they do not  correspond to the truth. According to those figures, the monthly  income of the average person in the republic was 254 dram in  February 1994, indicating that it had grown by 15.4 times while  consumer prices rose by 125.8 times [as published]. In other  words, the living standards of the population declined by  8-fold. In addition, according to the same budget, the gross  national product of the republic must be 9.285 billion dram in  1994, but the real figure is expected to reach 60.100 billion  dram by the end of the year. In other words, the inflation rate  is expected to be 6-fold (597 percent). Sadoyan claims, however,  that if a more realistic approach is taken, the inflation rate  will be 20-fold. He says that the government is distorting the  figures so that it can hide the large difference between the  1.7-fold growth in incomes and 20-fold increase in prices.    The remarks of Semyon Baghdasaryan, the other member of the  NDU parliamentary group, about energy production were even more  interesting. It has been determined that the electrical energy  output of the republic declined by 2-fold from 11,270 million  kilowatt-hours in the first 11 months of 1989 to 5,822 million  kilowatt-hours in the corresponding period of 1993. On that  basis, the supply of electricity to the population should have  declined by 2-fold and not by 12-fold.    Thus, where has the electricity generated in the republic  gone? In Mr Baghdasaryan's words, 48 percent of the electricity  generated was lost in the transmission network alone, and 25 to  30 percent was distributed through illegal or so-called ""private  supply"" means. This assumes that 50 percent of the 305 million  kilowatt-hours of electricity generated in November 1993 was  delivered to the population and the remaining 50 percent was  given to industry. According to Mr Baghdasaryan, because of this  situation not only electrical energy but industrial production  is lost.    Mr Baghdasaryan says: ""Officials of the Ministry of the  Interior derive personal benefit from the `private services' of  supplying electricity."" He noted that if this situation  continues, the directors of substations may illegally privatize  their units and decide on their own who receives electricity and  who does not.    Parliamentary deputy Seyran Avagyan said that the harsh  taxation system does not help the importation of high-priority  foodstuffs into the republic. He said that today the minimum  monthly expenses (bread, salt, sugar, heating oil and soap) of a  family comprised of four members is 2,095 dram. Assuming that  two members of the family work, each working person must  therefore earn at least 1,047 dram a month at a time when the  minimum monthly wage is 110 dram (176 dram beginning in April).  The deputies then spoke about Armenia's domestic and foreign  policies. In particular, Shavarsh Kocharyan declared that  Armenia must look for strength in itself and rely less on  outside forces.

Failing To See This Today Means  Bringing the Dark Ages Closer...in Houses and Plants""]    [Text] Perhaps there is no need to explain to anyone  what energy resources mean to Ukraine and its economy at  present, or to explain that our entire standard of living  depends more and more perceptibly on the cost of electricity,  coal, gas, and fuel oil.    A conference of the leaders of the basic sectors of  Ukraine--the power industry, metallurgy, and the coal  industry--held a few days ago by the Cabinet of Ministers  indicated that there would not be an easy solution. While there  was a general consensus to the effect that prices for products  should be reasonably restricted, the approaches themselves to  establishing price scales for energy resources got a mixed  reception.    This is how Vasiliy Kotko, deputy chairman of the State  Committee of Ukraine for the Use of Nuclear Energy, clarified  the position of the employees of the nuclear power industry.    [Kotko] The nuclear power industry was virtually the only  sector of the national economy of Ukraine to finish out the year  1993 with a noticeable increment in the volume of production.  Nuclear power stations generated a total of 75.2 billion  kilowatt-hours of electricity, or more than one-third of all  electricity generated in our country. This came close to the  maximum volume in the history of the operation of Ukrainian  nuclear power stations. These results are all the more  significant because they were achieved in an environment of  mounting economic crisis. They testify to the great potential of  the nuclear power industry, its high level of viability and  stability.    Nonetheless, the situation that has now emerged in the  industry is not just difficult, but we might say catastrophic.  All nuclear power stations are facing a most difficult economic  situation. Beginning in the second half of 1993, virtually no  fresh fuel has been purchased because of a shortage of funds; in  1993, two times less fuel was purchased than in 1990. Spent  nuclear fuel has not been shipped out for long-term storage,  once again because of a lack of funds. Contractual relations  between many suppliers and nuclear power stations with regard to  equipment, spare parts, and scientific servicing of nuclear  installations have actually been severed....    [Rassokha] However, the nuclear power industry operates by  way of complete self-recoupment and supports itself by proceeds  from energy generated. How could the industry have virtually  gone bankrupt financially with those kind of increments in  volume?    [Kotko] This is due to the fact that the nuclear power  industry generated electricity and sold it to the state, but the  state has not fully settled for it. There are two reasons for  this. The apparent reason is that our main and only consumer,  the National Dispatching Center of the Ministry of Energy of  Ukraine, does not pay for the electricity received from us, or  pays late. At present, the ministry is in debt to the nuclear  power stations to the tune of 550 billion karbovantsy,  approximately enough for one month of our operation. However,  this is the surface of the issue. The main reason is rooted in  the rate policy of our government. The government is trying to  contain the overall growth of prices in all sectors of the  national economy, i.e. inflation, through fixed prices for  power, coal, and gas. I will note that after the beginning of  1993, the rate for nuclear power stations remained unchanged for  almost half a year. The introduction of each of the new rates  was delayed by one to two months.    As a result, inflation has not been stopped, but the  resources of the power industry have been thoroughly undermined.  Right now it is hard to even assess the damage.    [Rassokha] What does the rate for electricity from nuclear  power stations come to at present?    [Kotko] It now stands at 118 karbovantsy per kilowatt-hour.  On the whole our rates during all of last year were at the very  least two times lower than those of thermal power stations.  Nuclear power stations stand for efficient power generation.    In May 1993 the government raised the rate for our  electricity by a factor of 10 all at once. However, prior to  this we gave up the electricity almost free of charge for a long  time, for example, in April--at 10 percent of its actual cost.  In all of this, electricity is not the kind of product that one  may produce, deposit at a warehouse, and wait for its price to  grow. We have sold it, it is gone, and it is not possible to  recover the funds anymore.    [Rassokha] Given this economic array, why have you not  succeeded in persuading the government that a change in its rate  policy is necessary?    [Kotko] The government has officially acknowledged the need  for a change in the rate policy. Moreover, the government laid  down in a decree that prices for electricity should change  automatically if prices for energy sources grow by more than 20  percent. However, the Cabinet of Ministers is not acting on its  own decision.    [Rassokha] Why?    [Kotko] Because it understands that an increase in prices  for  energy sources and electricity will be followed by an increase  in prices for everything else. So it is trying to hang on to  previously established prices for a while longer.    Understandably, no one wants to raise prices for bread,  butter, and even that same electricity--neither the population  nor the government. However, this unpopular decision will have  to be made later after all, but with more difficult consequences.    [Rassokha] How much longer can the nuclear power stations  continue if this rate policy continues?    [Kotko] I believe that we have now reached the extreme limit  and have depleted the resources of the industry. If this policy  is continued, irreversible processes will begin.    This means that even if we do get the funds, we will no  longer manage to turn them around because our standard reserves  have been cut back to the limit. First of all, we will not have  time to buy fuel and will not be able to go on operating. Our  suppliers do not have fuel reserves either. They begin to  produce for us only after the receipt of prepayment. The  manufacturing cycle lasts no less than half a year; taking into  account the difficulties we have in converting and transferring  payments, we may receive the fuel even later.    I believe that if the situation is not changed right now, a  condition may develop as soon as tomorrow whereby the shutdown  of some power units, or perhaps of all the power stations in  succession, will become unavoidable.    First of all, our rate should now be revised immediately; it  should come to no less than 300 karbovantsy per kilowatt-hour.  It should change with inflation and with the cost of energy  resources taken into account. These are, at minimum, two  necessary conditions.    Last year the personnel of the nuclear power industry kept  their word and did a lot to prevent the energy crisis from  mounting. We are geared toward giving much of ourselves, too, if  we are given an opportunity to work normally and produce  electricity. However, we want our labor and our products to be  paid for accordingly.     "
0,FT933-8078 ,"FT933-8078 _AN-DHRCGABPFT 930818   FT  18 AUG 93 / Monopolies Reports on British Gas: Consumers 'will face price rises' - Industry reaction      By MICHAEL SMITH   CONSUMER organisations warned yesterday that gas bills would rise next year if the recommendations in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission reports were implemented. Independent gas companies criticised the MMC's suggested timetable for reform as too slow. Mr James Cooper, chairman of the Gas Consumer's Council, said: 'If these recommendations are implemented it appears that large numbers of domestic consumers will pay more for their gas. The reports were expected to remove much of the uncertainty - that it certainly has not achieved.' The National Consumer Council said that the government had not carried out any detailed analysis of costs and benefits to consumers. 'This does not bode well for prices and standards of service in the long term, over which no controls are envisaged.' Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, said the reports offered nothing for the consumer and added: 'The cost of loosening British Gas's stranglehold on the gas supply system will be paid through dearer gas bills if present price controls are relaxed.' Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat energy and environment spokesman, said that greater competition in the gas industry should be accompanied by an increasingly strict regulatory process, guarantees of no discrimination over the category of customer, and no risk of an increase in domestic customers' gas bills. Utilicorp UK, which has gas joint ventures with five electricity companies, said the commission had taken the minimum steps necessary to introduce competition into the domestic market. The reports 'posed no real threat to British Gas's monopoly for five years,' said Mr Roger Turner, Utilicorp's managing director. 'This report is a gesture as far as the consumer is concerned. There is a danger that nine out of 10 consumers will never enjoy the benefits of cheaper prices through competition.' Mr Malcolm Faulkner, marketing director of the Norweb electricity distributor which has a gas joint venture with Utilicorp, said that, while the report's conclusions were welcome, 'it seems to be all jam tomorrow. We would like to see it more in line with the electricity market which will be fully opened up by 1998.' Mr Faulkner welcomed the recommendation that British Gas divest its supply arm and said that he hoped it would lead to a further splitting up of the gas distribution company to enable meter reading to be performed independently. 'There could be a licensed meter operator,' he said. This opened up economies of scale possibilities between gas and electricity meter reading. However Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, an independent gas company, said the regulatory authorities should look carefully into whether regional electricity companies should be allowed to supply gas in their areas. 'They would constitute a serious threat to competition. They could cross-subsidise between their regulated electricity businesses and their unregulated gas businesses.' Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas director-general, welcomed the reports even though they rejected his suggestion of breaking British Gas into 12 regional companies and introduced liberalisation at a slower rate than he wanted. 'The recommendations will put gas customers on the same footing as electricity customers in opening up the market to competition with all the benefits that will bring, he said. Ofgas dismissed suggestions that breaking up the British gas monopoly would lead to price rises for small users. With proper safeguards, this need not happen, it said. Sir James said his next tasks included regulating relations between the separated businesses which are to be created within British Gas, and setting new terms for the transportation and storage of gas. 'Progress on these should not be affected by decisions on the ultimate ownership of the different businesses.' Mr Dave Stirzaker, leader of 32,000 gas workers in the Unison union, said implementing the recommendations would mean the loss of at least 20,000 jobs in companies which supply contracts or services to British Gas, as well as the 20,000 jobs in British Gas itself. Mr Donald Macgregor of the GMB general union said the report's recommendations did not reflect customers' demands for a good and safe service or the high level of skills needed for the job. Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, said the recommendations should allow the company to plan ahead with greater certainty. Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said it should be in the interest of the company's shareholders to split the supply business from transportation, provided an appropriate financial and regulatory framework for the process could be found.

0,FT924-10021 ,"FT924-10021 _AN-CKCCTAB8FT 921103   FT  03 NOV 92 / ICI blames closures on cost of power      By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, DAVID LASCELLES and DAVID GREEN   ICI YESTERDAY blamed the cost of electricity for the closure of two chlorine plants at Hillhouse, near Fleetwood, Lancashire, with the loss of about 100 jobs. Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymers, warned of a long-term threat to more jobs if electricity prices were not brought down to German levels at least. He said UK electricity cost ICI Pounds 31 a megawatt hour now, against Pounds 25 for similar supplies in Germany. US manufacturers of chlorine-based chemicals pay less than Pounds 20  - the price ICI was charged before privatisation. Electricity accounts for about 70 per cent of variable costs, compared with about 60 per cent before privatisation. The company says it has lost Pounds 30m in sales and Pounds 20m in profits this year because it cannot afford to run chlorine plants for long enough to meet export demand. Chlorine production will now be concentrated on ICI's three plants at Runcorn, one at Wilton, Teesside, and one at Northwich, Cheshire. Most of the British plastics industry depends on ICI's chlorine production, but ICI says managers have less than 24 hours' notice of the next day's electricity price, making sensible planning and budgeting impossible. Mr Brogden said that ICI had approached the generators, the supply companies, the regulator, the Department of Trade and Industry, and ministers including the prime minister. 'We have had tea and sympathy, but that's all. 'For all of us in manufacturing, the transition of the electricity industry into a duopoly simply was not adequate to achieve the government's intention of moving to a true market-based electricity industry in the UK.' ICI has to buy its electricity at pool prices. Suppliers will not negotiate long-term contracts at lower levels than can be achieved through the pool. Electricity for Runcorn's operations, which consume 1 per cent of national electricity supplies, cost Pounds 26 a megawatt hour last year and rose to an average Pounds 29 in the first nine months of this year. As prices rise, ICI will cut production further, eventually creating a shortage of home-made chlor-chemicals in the UK, which foreign competitors are likely to fill. Meanwhile, Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, called on the government to 'kick out' the props supporting expensive power if it wants a more competitive energy market with better prospects for coal. Mr Wallis made clear that he was referring mainly to state-owned Nuclear Electric, which operates the nuclear power stations in England and Wales and receives more than Pounds 1bn a year from the nuclear levy. He told the Coal Industry Society: 'Nuclear Electric would be insolvent without the nuclear levy. But with the levy at its present level, Nuclear Electric is, on paper, the country's most profitable generating company.' By the middle of this decade, he said, Nuclear Electric would displace the equivalent of 25m tonnes of coal a year. 'It is able to pre-empt the market by selling its product at whatever price it likes, and with its new-found riches it is continuing to run beyond their design life, at considerable expense, plant which the Central Electricity Generat-ing Board had written off as uneconomic five years ago.' Nuclear Electric has decided not to go ahead with a planning application for the Sizewell C power station in Suffolk before the government carries out its energy review in the wake of the colliery closure programme. The company had been intending to submit the application early this month.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT923-14319 ,"FT923-14319 _AN-CGHATAEGFT 920708   FT  08 JUL 92 / Power bills could be cut by Pounds 300m: Watchdog proposes new price structure      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   ELECTRICITY BILLS in England and Wales may fall after Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, yesterday made its most significant move since the industry was privatised two years ago to tighten electricity regulation. Savings for large industrial consumers might help the government head off complaints from companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries that high electricity bills make them uncompetitive overseas. Offer yesterday proposed a new pricing formula that would result in a substantial cut in the National Grid Company's charges - which are a proportion of all electricity bills paid by consumers. A total of Pounds 300m could be cut from the aggregate bill of all consumers in England and Wales over the four years for which the new formula would be set. The present formula allows National Grid to increase prices with inflation, but under Offer's proposed formula it would have to keep price rises to 3 percentage points below inflation. Most domestic consumers will save a few pounds as a result of the change, Offer said, but very large industrial consumers may save millions of pounds. The new formula would provide National Grid with 'a tough but realistic target', said Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer. Prof Littlechild said National Grid could afford to charge its customers less by improving efficiency and by cutting costs by 5 per cent, rather than the 3 per cent the company had proposed. Prof Littlechild said he also believed that the company's cost of capital was significantly lower than it claimed. The new formula would not allow National Grid to increase charges if more consumers used the network, as it previously could. Breaking the link between more customers and higher revenues would help promote energy efficiency by removing the incentive to boost demand, Offer said. There is no sign yet whether National Grid, which said yesterday it was considering Offer's statement, will accept the new formula. Some City analysts believe the proposed formula could wipe Pounds 60m off the company's profits. National Grid is expected to reply to Offer in about a week. If National Grid does not agree to the proposal, the case will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Shares in the 12 regional electricity companies that jointly own National Grid rose yesterday, as the City had already discounted Offer's announcement. Offer's decision was viewed as a good omen for similar reviews of the regional electricity companies, due in 1994. Analysts hope Offer, whose proposed formula restricts National Grid's pricing rather than directly limiting its profits, will take a similar approach to the regional companies. Offer also hinted that it would change the way their charges are linked to inflation, as it did with National Grid yesterday. Instead of having to predict inflation when they set their prices, the companies will be able to use a historic inflation figure. That would make electricity prices more predictable and stable, Prof Littlechild said. Lex, Page 22 Seeboard profits up, Page 24  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "
0,FT932-1867 ,"FT932-1867 _AN-DFVCUAC0FT 930622   FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (11): Locked out of the new market - Michael Smith on the imminent collapse of the remnants of Britain's once great coal industry      By MICHAEL SMITH   SUCH WAS the public furore over the UK government's pit closures programme last October that it seemed that only a fundamental change on energy policy could get ministers off the hook. Six months later, however, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, won parliamentary support for a programme which was remarkably similar to that which led to the original decision to close 31 pits. Although 12 of the pits were reprieved and another six mothballed, the stay of execution for some, and probably most, will be short, and British Coal has already given notice that it wants to close three. The problem is that the government did little to create the room in the market essential for their survival. That means that towards the end of the century, the fuel constituents for electricity, the main market for coal, will be used in much the same proportions as were envisaged before last October. Coal will still be the largest element, with perhaps 40 to 50 per cent of electricity in England and Wales being made from it. But that compares with about 70 per cent in 1990. The difference is mainly accounted for by the growth of gas, which may claim 25 per cent of the market against nothing at the beginning of the decade. Nuclear power, strengthened by the opening of the Sizewell B plant and improved efficiency, has the potential to increase its 23 per cent market share. Coal has been in constant decline since the second world war but few production drops have been as steep as that between last year, when 65m tonnes went to the generators, and next. So far at least British Coal has the promise of only 30m tonnes in 1994-5. The fate of the 12 reprieved pits depends largely on how much more the corporation can persuade the generators to take, but this is unlikely to be more than 8m tonnes, enough to sustain perhaps half of the dozen pits and none of the further six which have been mothballed. The sharp sales drop is down to two main factors. The first is that the economics of building power stations are such that all new power stations under construction or being planned will be gas-fired. The government's coal review sparked vigorous debate about whether electricity from new gas stations was cheaper than that from existing coal plants, but the generators have no doubt about which form of electricity is cheaper if building a plant from scratch. PowerGen, the generator, says the 900MW station it has opened at Killingholme, Humberside, this year has taken three years to build, half the time a coal plant would take. The station will be run by 36 people, less than a fifth of the staff needed for a conventional coal-fired station. But if that helps explain why gas is preferred by generators it does not in itself account for the extraordinary speed of the dash for gas. There is a surplus of electricity in the UK; so why build more plants so soon? The answer has its roots three to four years ago when electricity was privatised. The move to gas would probably have happened anyway. But it has been speeded by the government's creation of just two generating companies. Fears of the two companies exercising a duopoly influenced regional electricity companies in deciding whether to help build gas-fired generating plants; 11 of the 12 have done so. Their participation was essential because they can provide guaranteed markets for the output. Supporters of the coal industry say the competition from gas is unfair because the recs (regional electricity companies) can pass on the costs of the electricity they produce to consumers. The recs, after all, have signed 15 year contracts with the gas generation companies they partly owned but only five year deals with the coal industry. However, the UK electricity regulator has ruled that the recs made sound economic decisions in setting up the plants. In the coal review ministers came under strong pressure from the parliamentary industry select committee to restrict the access of gas to the electricity market. As if to emphasise its rejection of this approach, the government, on the day the white paper was published, gave planning consent to a large gas-fired generator at Connah's Quay in North Wales. In doing so it was able to emphasise its free market approach. More important, a halt on the dash-for-gas could have landed the government with a myriad of compensation claims. It had, after all, always encouraged the recs' diversification and the move into gas generation. Ministers potentially had more leeway with nuclear power, as it owns all the major nuclear companies, including Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear. Again it resisted any curbs on future generation. Failing to bring Sizewell B in Suffolk on stream was never a serious consideration but at one stage the ageing magnox reactors appeared in danger. Again money was a primary consideration. Closing them early would have hit inflows into the Treasury at a time when public finances are tight. Perhaps in an attempt to balance this lack of action, the government claimed some success in cutting back orimulsion, the bitumen based fuel imported from Venezuela. The coal white paper suggested that Venezuela had volunteered a cut of 500,000 tonnes of coal equivalent a year. This was at the margins anyway and would not save even one pit. Shortly afterwards, however, BP Bitor, sole importer of the fuel, said it expected existing sale levels to continue. So what did the white paper change? The major difference between the October plan and that now in place is that the government has introduced the idea of subsidies. It says it will foot the bill between imported coal prices and those produced from the 12 reprieved pits. The caveat is that British Coal must first find a market for them. Given that the UK last year imported 20m tonnes of coal, that in theory should not prove too onerous. However, at least half of the imported product is of a specialist nature not easily accessible in the UK. That perhaps means that 10m tonnes can be displaced by UK coal. The hope is that by the time the subsidy is withdrawn, at the time of the coal industry's privatisation within two years, some of the reprieved mines will have got the costs down to a level where they can compete effectively with imports. Perhaps some of the mines that British Coal no longer wants will be able to compete with imports in the private sector.

The station, Hams Hall in Coleshill, Warwickshire, is still active, but due to close this year as part of the company's strategy of replacing coal stations with gas plant. The freight park, to be built on part of the 800-acre site, would include a link to the Channel tunnel and handle more than 1m tonnes of freight a year. The proposed development is a joint venture with Trafalgar House Business Parks. PowerGen has not yet decided what it will do with the station and the land it occupies.

The ITC ruled that unfairly low-priced pure and alloy magnesium exported to the US from Norsk Hydro's Becancour plant was damaging the US magnesium industry, with production subsidised through cheap energy prices from Hydro Quebec, the Canadian electricity producer. Hydro Quebec is not part of the Norsk Hydro group. In July, the US Commerce Department cleared Norsk Hydro of allegations of dumping magnesium from Norway in the US. The new ITC ruling seeks a 21.61 per cent countervailing duty on Norsk Hydro's Canadian pure and alloy magnesium exports to the US, with a 32.33 per cent dumping duty on pure magnesium. The company will appeal against the ITC decisions at a panel under the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement, and believed it would prevail. Norsk Hydro wanted a review of the countervailing duty rate, taking into account an amendment to an electricity deal signed this week with Hydro Quebec. The new contract met all criteria spelled out in a July decision for risk and profit-sharing electricity contracts not to be subject to countervailing duties. 'This should allow elimination of the 14 per cent part of the countervailing duty erroneously attributed to the electricity contract,' Norsk Hydro said; the review should be completed before the year ended. In July, the company said the Commerce Department had accepted its offer to renegotiate power-supply contracts with Hydro Quebec and repay some CDollars 20m of provincial investment funds from Canada and Quebec to establish its Becancour plant. Since the charges were made last September, Norsk Hydro has cut output to half the Canadian plant's 45,000-tonne-a-year capacity.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The Ipswich-based company's stance is the first opposition to emerge from the industry to a plan many are backing as a relatively easy way of keeping 10 to 15 British Coal pits open. In its submission to the Department of Trade and Industry's energy review, Eastern has joined other regional companies in calling for increased competition for the two generators. However Dr James Smith, Eastern chairman, said yesterday that his company could not support calls for the government to delay the planned reduction of the so-called franchise market through which regional companies have a monopoly to provide electricity to all but the largest customers in their own areas. The government intends to phase out the franchise market in stages from 1994 so that by 1998 even households could choose from which regional company to buy their supplies. This week regional companies including Southern told MPs that delaying these plans would enable them to buy more electricity generated from coal on long-term contracts because they would be more certain of the size of their markets. Dr Smith said yesterday that it was illogical for regional companies to argue for more competition to be introduced for generators but not for themselves. He said that 'providing the price was right' more coal could be used for electricity generation than has been tentatively agreed between British Coal and the generators.

The Grid's generation business - pump storage facilities - consists of about 2,000MW of plant at Dinorwic and Ffestiniog in Wales which has typically supplied about 0.5 per cent of the total output in England and Wales. Analysts put its value at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 500m. In a speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs, Prof Littlechild also urged the regional electricity companies to sell their entire stakes in the Grid, rather than keep back some of the shares for disposal later. He said his preference was that they sell their entire stakes at flotation, 'but if not, within a specified, but short, period after'. In addition he said there 'would be merit' in considering greater separation of the regional companies' distribution networks from their other activities. He said: 'A clearer separation between monopoly networks and potentially competitive activities is more conducive to effective competition and the protection of customers.' While Prof Littlechild is not able to force the regional companies to comply with his wishes, his views will influence both industry executives and the government, which has a golden share in the Grid. He said continued ownership of the Grid by the regional companies, acceptable as a transitional measure since privatisation in 1990, seemed increasingly inappropriate. 'But it is important for the development of competition that transmission be clearly independent of interests in generation or supply.' Prof Littlechild has also thrown his weight behind the idea that some of the proceeds of the Grid sale should be given to electricity consumers. The Grid had a book value of about Pounds 1.2bn when the regional companies were privatised but is now thought to be worth more than Pounds 4bn. The Labour party is pressing for a large part of the difference to be handed over to customers and the companies are proposing a 'rebate' of about Pounds 10 for each customer.

0,FT931-10367 ,"FT931-10367 _AN-DBICOAD0FT 930209   FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: India's private thoughts on power - Delhi recognises that without improved electricity supply, the reform programme will falter      By STEFAN WAGSTYL   FREE electricity is one of life's few blessings for slum dwellers in Shahdara, east Delhi. It is easily obtained by scrambling up an electricity pole and attaching a wire to the overhead mains. Occasionally someone gets electrocuted in the process, but not often. Electricity board officials turn a blind eye to such pilfering, which happens all over India. The effort of collecting payment from slums is not worth the revenues. Also, decades of socialist thinking have encouraged many Indians to regard the mostly state-owned electricity distribution boards as welfare agencies. Farmers in Karnataka state, south India, pay just 5 per cent of cost for their current. In neighbouring Tamil Nadu they pay nothing. The result is chronic losses for the industry and electricity shortages leading to frequent power cuts for consumers. However, the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the reform-minded prime minister, is committed to overhauling the industry: it recognises that without improved electricity supplies, the economic modernisation programme will grind to a halt. After years of relying on state-owned industry, Mr Rao is calling on private companies - including foreign groups - to build and operate 100 per cent privately owned power plants. But business has so far been slow to respond. In the last year, the ministry of power has attracted inquiries from 40 companies, including 25 from abroad, interested in building and operating power stations with a total capacity of 20,000 MW. But only four small-scale plants with a combined capacity of 1,300 MW are under construction, all by Indian-owned companies; four large projects totalling 8,000 MW and involving foreign capital, have been approved by the government, but none is yet under way. The cautious response is partly due to the huge scale of the proposed investments and partly to doubts about the government's ability to overhaul the industry's anti-commercial practices. Though ministers in Delhi are committed to reform, many local politicians, who use cheap electricity to buy farmers' votes, are not. As Mr S V Joshi, director of power distribution at the Indian affiliate of Siemens, the German engineering group, says: 'It took the US 10 years to switch from public to private sector power generation. India can't do it in two or three.' The government's 1992-1997 economic plan calls for the addition of 31,000 MW of public sector generating capacity to the existing total 78,000 MW (which includes 9,000 MW from private plants). But the public sector does not have the funds to implement the plan. Even if it did, India would still be short of electricity. Hence the need for private investors. As the head of the Delhi office of a European engineering group says: 'If we can get it right, the opportunities are limitless.' Getting it right involves getting the finance right. With a large power station costing Dollars 1bn and more, the only viable way for private companies to fund such projects is to split the cost between different equity partners and lenders, including multilateral institutions such as the World Bank. For example, Enron, the US energy group, is planning a Dollars 2bn plant for Maharashtra state to supply Bombay. Enron is considering asking lenders for 80 per cent of the funds, with 20 per cent in equity split between three partners - Enron, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and General Electric, the US engineering group which would supply much of the equipment. The World Bank, which has funded much of India's existing power capacity, says it would support schemes involving private companies. Officials believe public sector boards are generally poor managers - because of breakdowns, Indian power plants run at an average of 60 per cent of their full capacity and 23 per cent of their output is lost during transmission. However, money alone will not persuade private companies to invest. They also want to be certain their investments will be safe and they will get an adequate return. The Indian government has proposed contracts which would allow generating companies to pass on increases in fuel costs (the main variable cost) and earn a minimum net annual profit of 16 per cent. But most foreign companies say this is not enough. They are asking for central government guarantees that they will be paid by the state-level electricity boards, which are the main distributors. The companies are worried because the electricity boards are controlled by local state governments, which use electricity supply as a political tool. Foreign companies are also concerned about the security of fuel supplies since most plants will rely on coal from state-owned mines. However, the central government has so far ruled out guarantees, saying the answers lie mainly in watertight, legally enforceable contracts. The most the power ministry will entertain is indirectly endorsing guarantees offered by state governments. This may not be enough even for Enron. Aware of such doubts, the power ministry this month ordered state governments to permit private companies to enter into power distribution as well as generation. This would allow private companies to supply, for example, a selected group of consumers, such as factories on an industrial estate - potentially an attractive option. The ministry is considering further incentives to tempt foreign companies. Officials also point to the success of the four Indian private companies in the industry - the Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Company, the Calcutta Electric Supply Company, Ahmedabad Electricity and Tata Electric Companies. All are profitable and most are expanding capacity. Mr Joshi of Siemens says: 'This proves India can do it.' But no-one expects a quick transformation. Mr M Ranji, a senior power ministry official says: 'There are no easy solutions. That's the cost of democracy in India.'   Countries:-  InZdia, Asia.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

Mr Wallis's comments to a Commons select committee inquiry into energy policy come ahead of a report next month by the electricity industry regulator on the viability of the gas stations. The construction of these is partly behind a projected slump in the demand for coal. If the regulator were to agree with PowerGen and others including its rival generator National Power, there would be widespread implications for the regional electricity companies that are in ventures to build gas stations and for the government's review of energy policy. However, the problems of British Coal finding a growing market for its products were underlined when Mr Wallis said that even if BC could compete in world markets his company would expect to reduce its share of the company's fuel input to 60 per cent. That compares with a current total of 75 per cent. In several years' time it would equate to about 18m tonnes compared with a total in the current financial year of 24m. The reduction would be a result of PowerGen's wish to have a more diversified fuel portfolio. On the economics of combined cycle gas turbine power stations, Mr Wallis said the Killingholme power station in Humberside already operated by his company would be able to supply electricity at 2.5p per unit. This compares with the 2.8p possible from a coal-powered station in 1992-3, assuming prices in contracts tentatively agreed with British Coal but still to be ratified. The select committee also heard strong criticism of the regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, from Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users' Association. The Institute for Public Policy Research, a left-of-centre think tank, wants a government group to be established with responsible for energy policy. It is also urging the government to adopt a national electricity generation capacity plan to make the best of fuel resources.  The Financial Times   London Page 11  "

Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, also said yesterday that his department was studying cutting the price of British coal through subsidies or further levies on consumers. He told MPs that it was a 'genuinely open review' and that the government had not reached views on any of the 15 areas for action which had been identified by the review team. Many of the options, however, were subject to European Community and international constraints. Those constraints were highlighted yesterday when Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the energy commissioner for the EC , told a parliamentary select committee that the UK would have to reduce the nuclear levy, raised from electricity consumers, if it wanted to subsidise coal. Commission policy is that only 20 per cent of energy used to produce electricity can be subsidised. In the UK all of this is taken up by the nuclear industry. Although the levy on electricity bills is falling - the surcharge on bills will be reduced from 11 per cent this year to 10 per cent in 1993 - further action may be required if coal is subsidised. Mr Heseltine's announcement suggests that none of the proposals made in public to the trade and industry select committee has been ruled out completely. Mr Martin O'Neil, Labour's energy spokesman, said Mr Heseltine's 'dramatic widening of the coal review' would make it 'even more difficult for him to face down public opposition to his pit closure programme'. Mr Heseltine's list included an investigation of the 'dash for gas', suggesting that the government may scale back future generation plans and review the operation of pricing formulae which critics say obscure judgment of the real cost of gas. He also referred to criticism of the electricity market after its privatisation two years ago, saying there would be consultation with the regulator about whether any company is abusing its market position. National Power and PowerGen, the two generators in England and Wales, have been accused of operating a duopoly to force up prices. Other areas for investigation are: Reducing the cost of coal production through changing working practices and privatising pits; Trade in coal, through increased exports of UK coal and import substitution, and in electricity, through interconnectors with Scotland and France; The impact of environmental commitments, including those relating to carbon emissions and desulphurisation, and the development of opencast mining.

In the 1980s, solar the, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Ever since Iraq overran the rich oil fields of Kuwait, the phone in Kathleen  Flanigan's Westwood office has not stopped ringing.    ""People keep calling just to ask about our technology,"" explains the  spokeswoman for one of the country's most successful solar power producers, Los  Angeles' Luz International. ""It's really picked up since Aug. 2.""    There is no doubt that the Iraqi invasion and the subsequent energy crisis have  focused new public attention on renewable energies -- technologies such as  solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and hydroelectric that generate electricity  without the environmental side effects of most fossil fuels.    But, although producers of renewable energy are grateful for the new attention,  many are irritated that the public still thinks renewable energy is only a  dream for the future.    ""It's out there already,"" Flanigan says. ""And it does work.""    Despite sharp cutbacks in federal research and tax support for renewable energy  technologies, most of them have left the laboratory and are out in the field  generating electricity.    Nationwide, 5% of current production of electricity and one-third of all new  power capacity installed since 1985 has come from solar, wind, geothermal and  biomass facilities. In California, a full 12% of the state's electricity needs  are already provided by these sources.    All the same, although industry advocates and producers are proud of their  progress in the past few years, they point to technological, government and  business challenges that will confront each of the new technologies in the  coming decade. Solar Solar technologies can generally be divided into two  groups: solar thermal systems, which use sunlight to heat water or other  fluids, and photovoltaic technologies that convert the sun's light directly  into electricity. In the 1980s, solar thermal technologies made the leap from  small, modular units designed to heat individual buildings to large, commercial  electricity-generating systems. Luz International has had the greatest success  with such systems, using acres of concave mirrors in the Mojave desert to heat  a special conducting fluid that then superheats water to spin steam turbines.  Luz supplies a total of 354 megawatts of power to Southern California Edison,  enough electricity to meet the needs of half a million residential customers.  As it unveiled a new 80-megawatt plant last month, Luz reported that its costs  have fallen from 24 cents per kilowatt hour in 1984 to 8 cents today -- a price  that is becoming competitive with gas, oil and nuclear power, which cost  between 3 and 7 cents per kilowatt hour. But, although solar thermal power has  enjoyed some commercial success, it represents only about 0.1% of U.S. electric  consumption and is not expected to climb much higher. Experts agree that the  real advances for solar power will come in the second area of solar technology,  photovoltaics. Photovoltaic technology uses mirrors to concentrate photons of  sunlight onto silicon cells. The impact of the photons shakes loose silicon  electrons, whose movement generates electric current. Although the cost of  photovoltaics has fallen from $1.50 to 30 cents per kilowatt hour over the last  decade, photovoltaic systems remain much more costly than other energy sources.  Still, photovoltaic technology is so promising that the government is  concentrating most of its solar research dollars on it. But solar shares a  problem with other renewable energy systems: Although they are usually cheap to  operate, they are expensive to build. This is because the resources --  sunlight, subterranean water, wind -- cost almost nothing, but the high-tech  facilities that change them into electricity are expensive. Facilities that use  fossil fuels, on the other hand, are cheap to build but require a continuous  supply of costly oil, gas or coal.Wind Wind energy got an undeservedly bad name  in the 1970s, proponents insist. As investors rushed to take advantage of the  tax shelter the federal government offered for renewables, many projects were  rushed to completion. ""The technology simply wasn't ready,"" says Randall  Swisher, president of the Washington-based American Wind Energy Assn. ""We moved  wind into manufacturing too rapidly."" But in the mid-1980s, after making small  but crucial improvements, such as washing the turbine blades periodically to  remove insects, the industry got back on its feet. Now California's 15,000 wind  turbines operate reliably enough to provide 1,500 megawatts of power to the  state, enough to supply the residential needs of the City of San Francisco.

In the 1980s, solar the, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Ever since Iraq overran the rich oil fields of Kuwait, the phone in Kathleen  Flanigan's Westwood office has not stopped ringing.    ""People keep calling just to ask about our technology,"" explains the  spokeswoman for one of the country's most successful solar power producers, Los  Angeles' Luz International. ""It's really picked up since Aug. 2.""    There is no doubt that the Iraqi invasion and the subsequent energy crisis have  focused new public attention on renewable energies -- technologies such as  solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and hydroelectric that generate electricity  without the environmental side effects of most fossil fuels.    But, although producers of renewable energy are grateful for the new attention,  many are irritated that the public still thinks renewable energy is only a  dream for the future.    ""It's out there already,"" Flanigan says. ""And it does work.""    Despite sharp cutbacks in federal research and tax support for renewable energy  technologies, most of them have left the laboratory and are out in the field  generating electricity.    Nationwide, 5% of current production of electricity and one-third of all new  power capacity installed since 1985 has come from solar, wind, geothermal and  biomass facilities. In California, a full 12% of the state's electricity needs  are already provided by these sources.    All the same, although industry advocates and producers are proud of their  progress in the past few years, they point to technological, government and  business challenges that will confront each of the new technologies in the  coming decade. Solar Solar technologies can generally be divided into two  groups: solar thermal systems, which use sunlight to heat water or other  fluids, and photovoltaic technologies that convert the sun's light directly  into electricity. In the 1980s, solar thermal technologies made the leap from  small, modular units designed to heat individual buildings to large, commercial  electricity-generating systems. Luz International has had the greatest success  with such systems, using acres of concave mirrors in the Mojave desert to heat  a special conducting fluid that then superheats water to spin steam turbines.  Luz supplies a total of 354 megawatts of power to Southern California Edison,  enough electricity to meet the needs of half a million residential customers.  As it unveiled a new 80-megawatt plant last month, Luz reported that its costs  have fallen from 24 cents per kilowatt hour in 1984 to 8 cents today -- a price  that is becoming competitive with gas, oil and nuclear power, which cost  between 3 and 7 cents per kilowatt hour. But, although solar thermal power has  enjoyed some commercial success, it represents only about 0.1% of U.S. electric  consumption and is not expected to climb much higher. Experts agree that the  real advances for solar power will come in the second area of solar technology,  photovoltaics. Photovoltaic technology uses mirrors to concentrate photons of  sunlight onto silicon cells. The impact of the photons shakes loose silicon  electrons, whose movement generates electric current. Although the cost of  photovoltaics has fallen from $1.50 to 30 cents per kilowatt hour over the last  decade, photovoltaic systems remain much more costly than other energy sources.  Still, photovoltaic technology is so promising that the government is  concentrating most of its solar research dollars on it. But solar shares a  problem with other renewable energy systems: Although they are usually cheap to  operate, they are expensive to build. This is because the resources --  sunlight, subterranean water, wind -- cost almost nothing, but the high-tech  facilities that change them into electricity are expensive. Facilities that use  fossil fuels, on the other hand, are cheap to build but require a continuous  supply of costly oil, gas or coal.Wind Wind energy got an undeservedly bad name  in the 1970s, proponents insist. As investors rushed to take advantage of the  tax shelter the federal government offered for renewables, many projects were  rushed to completion. ""The technology simply wasn't ready,"" says Randall  Swisher, president of the Washington-based American Wind Energy Assn. ""We moved  wind into manufacturing too rapidly."" But in the mid-1980s, after making small  but crucial improvements, such as washing the turbine blades periodically to  remove insects, the industry got back on its feet. Now California's 15,000 wind  turbines operate reliably enough to provide 1,500 megawatts of power to the  state, enough to supply the residential needs of the City of San Francisco. As  with solar, the coming challenges for wind power are not primarily  technological but commercial. In 10 to 20 years, Swisher estimates, wind power  could go from supplying 0.2% of the nation's electric needs to a full 10%.

0,FT911-433 ,"FT911-433 _AN-BELAGAD8FT 910511   FT  11 MAY 91 / A fight for power in the generation game: The row over rules governing companies producing their own electricity      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   A GARDENER who sold a few extra tomatoes to his local shop would be upset if the government set up an Office of Tomato Regulation which compelled him to register as a tomato producer, sell all his tomatoes to a central Tomato Pool, and buy back at a higher price any he wanted to eat. It sounds absurd. But, according to Mr David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power Association, electricity generators might face just this situation by January. Mr Green's fears relate to the long dispute over the rules governing industrial companies which generate their own electricity on site. If some lobbyists, notably the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales, have their way, a chemical plant generating its own power and selling its surplus could be forced to sell all its electricity to the pool, or spot market. It would have to buy its own needs back at a higher price even though the electricity would never leave the site. The lobbyists argue that such sites receive all the benefits of being connected to the national grid, such as back-up if their own generators fail. These benefits are paid for by other electricity buyers, when they buy electricity from the pool, through 'uplift'. That is a margin on top of what is received by generators selling into the pool. The lobbyists say that industrialists wishing to sell their surplus should also pay uplift by putting all their power through the pool. Otherwise, they will ride on the backs of small consumers who ultimately pay for uplift through their electricity bills. The electricity industry representatives on the Pool Executive Committee (PEC), which runs the pool, must decide on a rule for on-site generators by July. If they cannot, the decision will pass to Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary. 'You can disconnect from the system,' says the representative of one regional company. 'But don't expect to stay connected and not pay.' He points out, however, that if everyone disconnected 'there would be a smaller number of people supporting the grid system, which could ultimately fall apart'. Mr Green replies that 'the regional companies want to discourage people from on-site generation because they lose out; they lose their wires business'. It is certainly true that on-site generation was one of the regional companies' anxieties at the time of privatisation. Industrialists considering on-site generation may admit that they should pay something for access to the grid - a flat charge is one possibility being discussed at the PEC. But their grievance runs deeper than the question of 'uplift'. Any company that generates power now for its own consumption, but buys or sells more than 10MW from the grid, counts as a generator under the new electricity regulations. It has to belong to the pool, and that does not just mean paying pool fees. 'We don't want a generation licence, and we don't want to be a generator - we don't want to be pool members,' says Mr Alan Belk, general energy systems manager at Air Products, which supplies on-site oxygen and other gases to companies such as British Steel. It would like to provide electricity, too, as part of an integrated process. But it would then count as a generator. It is not just a matter of costs, which could be around Pounds 1m extra on the Pounds 80m combined-heat-and-power (CHP) generator Air Products wants to build on-site at British Steel - a highly efficient system that would cut on-site energy costs considerably. If it generated enough electricity to count as a national generator 'we could be called on by the grid to stop generating if the national system was overloaded,' Mr Belk says. 'Or we could be called on to supply the grid.' Clearly, British Steel would be unhappy with on-site power with those risks attached. British Steel has produced a strongly worded submission to the PEC on the subject. It argues that regulations should not place at a disadvantage industrial users, who already bear the second-highest electrical energy costs in Europe. It seems unlikely that the regional electricity companies will win the debate over 'uplift', especially as Offer, the electricity watchdog, seems inclined to believe that their interpretation of the regulation is far-fetched, and is proposing a compromise fee for on-site generators. Even if the question of the fee is settled, other more vexing issues remain for companies such as Air Products. The CHP system Mr Belk plans could double generating efficiency at the British Steel site. In the Netherlands, where Air Products has a CHP scheme on a Rotterdam refinery site, it attracts a 25 per cent capital grant from the Dutch government. The UK government has also recognised CHP's environmental and energy efficiency benefits, and is committed to promoting its development at 120 identified industrial sites. But if on-site generators are forced to pay high charges and run high risks for their connection to the grid, the incentives for building such systems will be seriously diminished.

National Power's investment of Pounds 60m in the project is the most significant yet in a planned programme through which it aims to invest Pounds 1bn overseas by the end of the century. The opportunity to run the Pego power station, being built 75 miles north-east of Lisbon, arose because of the Portuguese government's decision to open up the electricity generation market to the private sector. In the UK, liberalisation of power generation means that National Power expects its 41 per cent share of the UK electricity generation market to fall in the mid-1990s as independent gas-fired plants come on stream. The company hopes eventually to derive about a quarter of its income from abroad. It already has joint venture projects in Pakistan and, more recently, Malaysia where it announced last month it was investing Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) in two gas fired projects with a total capacity of 1,500 MW. National Power's consortium beat off bids from the US, Germany, Belgium and the UK to win the Pego agreement signed in Lisbon yesterday with Electricidade de Portugal (EDP). The consortium has incorporated a joint venture company, Tejo Energy, which will own the station. The Pounds 700m project will be financed by the consortium, providing about Pounds 140m in equity, of which NP will control 40 per cent. Other participants are Endesa, the Spanish utility which is thought to have about 25 per cent of the shares, and Electricite de France and EDP, with 10 per cent each. Portuguese investors will also have an opportunity to buy shares. The station's first generating unit is due to be commissioned in April next year. Tejo will be licensed to operate the station for 28 years, supplying electricity to EDP, and coal supplies will be bought on the international market. Mr Graham Hadley, National Power executive director, said demand for electricity in Portugal was growing strongly. The deal provided an opportunity to construct a further two generating units on the site.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

After months of stagnation, there are signs that the generators and British Coal have agreed to work towards a 'wedge-shaped' deal under which the generators would buy about 45m tonnes of coal a year, falling to about 30m within a few years. That compares with the 65m tonnes the generators buy annually under contracts that end next March. It would initially generate about 90m kilowatt hours a year - about half the total electricity market open to the generators. PowerGen, one of the two large generators in England and Wales, will this week put an offer based on that deal to the 12 English and Welsh regional electricity supply companies. The generators will not agree to buy coal unless they can sell the electricity it generates to the regional companies. PowerGen, which previously seemed reluctant to agree a deal with British Coal at all, is now understood to believe a deal can be done, although British Coal's prices are still above world levels. The regional electricity companies are dragging their feet, in spite of prompting from Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. He is understood to be keen to secure a deal in time to put legislation for British Coal privatisation before the Commons this autumn. One regional company chief executive said: 'We have no reason to sign a deal at all except a predetermined government timetable.' The regional companies are concerned because the captive domestic market will be liberalised progressively after 1994 and they may find themselves with a long contract to buy coal-fired power and no customers for it. They are also concerned that Offer, the industry regulator, might penalise them if it proves that they could have supplied customers with cheaper power. National Power, the other large generator in England and Wales, recently offered the regional companies a coal-based deal. But they said both generators were failing to give them adequate details of the coal deal, and are hesitant to expose themselves by signing individual contracts.

By 1995 the capacity of power supply from Inner Mongolia is  to rise to 1.50 million kw, and by 2000 that figure will climb  to five million kw, according to the power department of the  region.    Beijing gets one seventh of its electric power from Inner  Mongolia, which is rich in coal resources. Since 1990 a total  of four billion kwh of electricity have been transmitted to  Beijing from the region.    In the past, most of the herdsmen in the region had to rely  on cow dung for heat and light, and as late as the 1950s there  were only seven small power plants with a total capacity of  1,750 kw in the autonomous region. But by 1987 the total  electricity production capacity in the autonomous region had  surpassed 800,000 kw.    Officials said that since 1988 a group of large  thermoelectric power plants have been built. So far, the  generating capacity has topped 2.40 million kw -- more than  enough to meet the local demand.    At present, several large power plants are still under  construction. Upon their completion in 1995 they will increase  the total capacity to eight million kw.     "

In its policy on industrial development, the Lao government  has attached great importance to the expansion of hydro-power  plants. With its own input combined with assistance and loans  from friendly countries and international financial  institutions, the Lao government has in the past years tried to  exploit this potential. This has also provided opportunities for  investors to participate in various forms, such as joint  ventures, build-operate-transfer projects and so on.    One example is the construction of a hydro-power plant at  Seset in the southern province of Saravane. The Seset plant came  on line a few years ago and has a generation capacity of 45  megawatts, more than enough for domestic consumption in the  whole south of the country. The Seset power plant is the second  largest in the country, second only to the Nam Ngum Power Supply.    Last month, the state-run electricity company, Electricity  du  Laos, signed a contract with a French company, SOGREAH, for a  survey to be conducted at Nam Leuk. In the same month, the  Committee for Planning and Cooperation signed a memorandum of  understanding with Thai company MDX Public Co., Ltd. on the  development of the Nam Ngum Three Hydro-Power Project. The Nam  Leuk water flows into Nam Sang and Nam Ngum, while the Nam Ngum  Three project is located at the junction of Nam Ngum and Nam Ma.    The local electricity company has received a loan for the  Nam  Leuk project from the Asian Development Bank. Estimated cost of  the project is U.S. $90 million. The project is expected to  produce 40 megawatts of power.    As provided in memorandum of agreement for the Nam Ngum  Three  project, the Thai company will conduct a survey at a cost of  U.S. $1 million. Once completed, the project will be capable of  producing 400 megawatts of power. In this venture the Lao side  will hold a share of 45 percent with the balance held by the  Thai company.    Laos earns 800 million baht (U.S. $32 million) a year by  selling electricity from its Nam Ngum power supply to Thailand.  Revenue from the export of electricity represents the second  largest source of foreign exchange for the country.     "
0,FT933-12634 ,"FT933-12634 _AN-DGWCHACAFT 930723   FT  23 JUL 93 / National Power justifies role in pool price rises      By MICHAEL SMITH   NATIONAL POWER, the UK's largest electricity generator, said yesterday that it used its market power in a 'transparent and principled way' in an attempt to minimise the chances of a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over recent rises in electricity prices for large customers. The company said its bidding practices in the electricity wholesale pool were fully justified and the current pool price was not excessive. Prof Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, asked National Power and other companies including PowerGen and the National Grid for explanations after pool prices rose 10 per cent in April. He subsequently warned that he would refer the generators to the commission if he was not satisfied with their responses. He is due to publish his views in the next two weeks. Some analysts believe a reference is increasingly likely by 1995, if not over pool price rises then over an issue such as the generators' costs and margins. Most consumers have been unaffected by the pool price changes because of fixed-price contracts between generators and suppliers. It is the large industrial users, who buy directly from the pool, who have been hit hard. National Power said yesterday that it told the regulator that pool prices alone, uncovered by fixed-price contracts, would have provided an inadequate income in the first three years after privatisation. Pool prices were artificially low because of surplus capacity. If current prices were maintained this year, pool revenue would cover cash operating costs and make some contribution to capital investments and debt and equity servicing costs, National Power said. But its bid prices more realistically reflected the cost of electricity production. It added that increases in uplift charges, a mark-up added to the pool price to pay for administrative costs of the pool, resulted from reinforcement work being carried out on the national grid. National Power said it had priced its bids to 'recover our losses but no more' when power stations were put out of action by the work on the grid. Sharp upward price movements in the pool appeared to be caused by the scheduling and price setting mechanism, National Power said.   Companies:-  National Power.

Enron and the Maharashtra state government in western India yesterday signed an agreement under which the Maharashtra state electricity board will buy power from Enron's 695MW gas-fired plant, which will be constructed at Dhabol on the coast. The successful completion of talks with Enron will come as a relief to the Indian authorities in their quest to attract foreign investment into the power sector and into India generally. The project has attracted much attention; a failure in negotiations might have discouraged other potential investors. Dhabol is the second big power station project for which a power purchase agreement has been signed after the government last year invited private investors into the state-dominated generating industry to help ease India's chronic electricity shortages. National Power, the UK generator, and the UK-based Hinduja trading family last month signed a similar pact for a 1,000MW plant with the authorities in the southern state of Andrha Pradesh. In each case, the power purchase agreements are being supported by payment guarantees from the state and, indirectly, from the central government, a key condition sought by foreign investors who have otherwise been loth to invest in schemes involving the heavily indebted state electricity distribution boards. Enron originally envisaged a much larger scheme, a 2,000MW plant fuelled by liquid natural gas imported from Qatar. The company impressed the Indian authorities with its determination to press ahead rapidly with the project, pursuing its negotiations very vigorously. But the project ran into criticism from, among others, the World Bank, which was concerned about the cost, the reliance on imported fuel, and about doubts whether Maharashtra, which is relatively well served with power plants, really needed such a large new station. Enron now plans to build the giant plant in two stages: a 695MW plant to be completed by 1997, and a 1,320MW extension, which has yet to be approved by the state electricity board, and is planned to be finished by late 1998.

British Gas's warning that it would not raise its dividend this year - because of a new price cap imposed by the industry regulator - had a knock-on effect on electricity companies as they too await a pricing review. Such reverberations through the sector reflect the traditional view of utility stocks as interchangeable bond surrogates. A vigorous debate is under way among analysts and brokers as to the relevance of bundling together electricity, gas, telecommunications and water companies in one utility sector. The protagonists divide into two camps: the 'divergers' and the 'convergers'. The former believe the utilities are going their separate ways. Their regulatory climates vary widely and their financial returns are diverging. Corporate activity and entry into unregulated sectors will reinforce these trends, as will the growth of competition in all the industries except water. On this view, gas and telecommunications are prime candidates to lose their utility badges. British Gas and British Telecommunications remain dominant in their domestic markets, but they face stiff competition. Both companies are exploiting overseas opportunities with relish. BT, for instance, will this year invest more in MCI, a US phone company, than in its UK network. With Mercury, cable companies and other new entrants taking market share in all telecoms sectors, BT chiefs speculate that the present regulatory price cap - due to expire in 1997 - will be the last. Mr Robert Morris, analyst at Goldman Sachs, sees manifold opportunities for BT if it expands its home market and becomes an international leader in new services. Yet fears that competition is a one-way street have dragged down BT's share price, exacerbated by a slow-down in nominal dividend growth. Real dividend growth is expected to be between 3 and 4 per cent over the next few years, less than for electricity or water. Mr Nigel Hawkins, of Hoare Govett, believes the decision to privatise gas and telecoms as single entities, but to split up water and electricity distribution, has created a regulatory divide between the two groups of utilities. 'In practice where there is more than one operator, the regulator tends to be more generous to the sector as a whole, as we are likely to see with water and electricity in the reviews of their price caps, making a significant difference to expectations.' Hence, in part, the better performance of water and electricity shares of late, although the latter has suffered in recent days. However, Mr Hawkins paints a sharp difference even between water and electricity. With regulatory reviews ongoing in both industries, their regimes are diverging. While the water companies are set to have a price cap of, effectively, RPI+1.7 per cent, the Recs are likely to have to make a one-off cut of between 12 and 15 per cent with a price cap thereafter of around RPI-2.5 per cent. Furthermore, the lifting next year of the ban on the Recs being taken over will open up entrepreneurial options. For water, he expects real dividend growth of around 4 per cent, while for electricity distribution it will be close to 6 per cent. In short, the water companies will become 'akin to bonds', while Recs will be less sensitive to bond movements. Not all diversifiers go that far. Mr John Wilson at UBS points to underlying growth in electricity demand of less than 1.5 per cent: 'It is inconceivable that a company can grow its earnings and dividends greater than its growth of business in the long term.' He sees gas and electricity, where limited competition is emerging, as natural bedfellows, with water as a monopoly and telecoms as a fully competitive business. The 'convergers' do not claim that the utilities will perform similarly in the short or medium term. They see the post-privatisation history of all four industries as a continuum and minimise the significance of competition and diversification. Mr Bill Dale, utilities analyst at SG Warburg, says: 'British Gas and BT are, in effect, more mature utilities than electricity and water, leading to an inevitable slow-down in their financial returns which will affect the others in due course. 'The privatised companies find it far easier to grow profits in their early years, when the cost-cutting - particularly redundancies - is easy and initial regulation is lighter.' As for competition and diversification, 'The track record of utilities diversifying is dreadful, and any institutional investor will initially take a negative view of it.' In the convergers' view, then, in the long-term all four utilities might be expected to perform at a fixed discount to bonds, as in the US. Fleming Securities stresses the 'increasingly close' relationship between the gilt/equity ratio and the dividend yield of the utilities index relative to the FT-A All-Share. 'As competition and regulation reduce the scope for unexpectedly large rates of dividend growth, UK utilities will take on even more of the characteristic bond-like behaviour of their US counterparts.' Whether they will become bond substitutes remains problematic. While they serve as reasonably effective inflation hedges, their capacity to hedge against interest rates is more limited because in the UK price caps - and the permitted rates of returns underlying them - are fixed for several years at a time. For all that, 'divergers' and 'convergers' agree that no self-respecting institution would want to do without the four utilities in their portfolio, given their size. It is all a question of balance.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.     P4813 Telephone Communications, Ex Radio.

Its annual power  output reached 37.15 billion kwh and showed a 7.4 percent  increase over 1992. Its annual volume of power supplies reached  30.85 billion kwh and showed a 4.1 percent increase over 1992.  The per capita productivity on the province's power industrial  front reached more than 74,900 yuan in the year and showed a 15  percent increase over 1992, topping the previous peak. By  vigorously promoting sales and bringing the cost and spending  under strict control, the province's power industrial front  showed a decrease in varying degrees in the standard coal  consumption and the rate of electricity losses over 1992. The  front saved more than 137,000 metric tons of standard coal and  24 million kwh of electricity in the year. Meanwhile, the  province invested 1.95 billion yuan in the capital construction  projects of power production, which showed a 31.6 percent  increase over 1992. The volume of electricity turned out by the  newly built generator sets reached 220 kilovolts in the year.  The transmission lines newly established in the year were 22  km. The capacity of transformer substations newly built in the  year reached (?50,000) kilovolt amperes. The province's power  industrial front also scored marked achievements in bringing in  foreign capital for the construction projects.     "

According to Coal UK, an industry newsletter, National Power and PowerGen have made offers well below British Coal's present price of Pounds 1.85 a gigajoule. National Power, the larger of the two, is believed to have offered Pounds 1.50, and PowerGen Pounds 1.10. PowerGen's lower price reflects its lesser dependence on supplies from British Coal. The contracts will run for five years from next April. The present contracts are based on artificially high prices intended to help the coal industry. Although the central element of the negotiations is over the amount of coal to be taken by the generators, the price will have a strong bearing on the amounts, as well as on British Coal's ability to compete with new gas-fired generating capacity. The generators are determined to bring UK coal prices down closer to world levels, but British Coal needs prices that will make it a viable business after privatisation, due later this year. National Power yesterday declined to comment on details of the negotiations. It said the talks were aimed at satisfying the distribution companies' requirements for realistically priced power and British Coal's interest in suitable prices, quantities and contract lengths. Juliet Sychrava writes: Large industrial consumers in the UK faced the highest electricity price increases for seven years in the 12 months to April, according to a survey of 1,200 companies by National Utility Services. Large electricity consumers pay 4.28p a unit, the survey found, compared with 3.94p last year. That is cheaper than Italy, Germany, Belgium, and Eire, but more expensive than the US, France, Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Australia and Canada. The survey warned that prices might rise further if more competition in electricity generation did not emerge and it supports large consumers' claims that they have not benefited from electricity privatisation. Those consumers, represented by the Major Energy Users Council, have been lobbying the government to intervene in the new electricity market created at privatisation. The users council says the market gives too much power to National Power and PowerGen to push prices up.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

The unplanned Ukrainian electric energy imports, which  started in November after the energy supply situation within  Ukraine became critical, ""caused economic damage to consumers  belonging to the system"", Tombor told the VILAGGAZDASAG economic  daily.    Electricity suppliers in the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  Poland, Romania, Hungary and the eastern part of Germany set a  January 21 deadline for Ukraine to return the extra energy,  drawn after these states' grids were separated from the Russian  and Ukraine-Bulgarian electricity grids in November.    Hungary supplied a quarter of the extra energy to Ukraine  but  practically all other central European states were affected by  the unplanned draws, which caused ""considerable frequency  fluctuation"" in the Centrel system, Tombor said. He added  however that Hungary had not had to introduce any consumption  restrictions due to the extra Ukrainian consumption, but  electric appliances here slowed down and were overstrained.    Currently, only a 400- and a 200-kilovolt electric conductor  is in use between Hungary and Ukraine after the main  750-kilovolt line went out of use in November. The central grid  is to be reconnected with the Russian and Ukrainian electricity  grids after mid-May, he said.     "

The new division will invest in the development, construction and operation of combined heat and power plants for customers in the UK and overseas. Mr John Earl, managing director of Cogeneration Investments, said the company will support British Gas's Global Gas business in its overseas operations. 'Cogeneration provides a lot of environmental benefits and can be at the end of many fuel chains,' he said. Cogeneration involves the production of electricity and recycling the waste gases to provide heating or cooling for other industrial processes. Cogeneration Investments signed its first contract, worth about Pounds 15m, to provide the energy requirements for SCM Chemicals Europe - one of the world's leading titanium dioxide makers - for the next 15 years. As part of the deal, the company will build a 15MW CHP plant at SCM's south Humberside site. The plant is expected to operate at over 80 per cent efficiency compared with 30 per cent from conventional power stations, and greatly reduce carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Mr Earl said the company expected to sign another deal this year and was involved in discussions on two further contracts.   Companies:-  British Gas.     Cogeneration Investments.

Many more among the 45,000 power users able to shop around for supplies from April 1 have signed deals with local distributors that will give them significant price reductions. Eligible users include industrial concerns, supermarkets, large schools and hospitals. Some distributors - including Manweb, in the north-west of England and in north Wales, and Midlands Electricity - say they have offered consumers outside their regions price cuts of up to 20 per cent. Most reductions fall within 4 per cent and 10 per cent. Some consumers enjoying lower tariffs have received no immediate financial benefit. The reductions stem from the second stage of the liberalisation of the electricity market, which will allow users of between 100kW and 1MW at their period of peak consumption to pick from any licensed supplier. Until April 1 they have had to buy from their regional distributor. Only consumers of more than 1MW had a choice of supplier. By 1998, all consumers, including householders, will be able to select their supplier. To take advantage of the deregulated system from April 1, eligible consumers should already have signed contracts with a supplier, which should have registered the arrangement with the electricity pool, through which power is traded. Ms Margaret McKinlay, pool chief executive, said the organisation knew of 7,300 deals involving a customer and a supplier other than their regional distributor. 'We expect that figure to grow perhaps by about double,' she said. Consumers can still sign deals. The pool requires 20 working days' notice before agreements come into effect. Most regional power companies say consumers with lower demand, perhaps 100kW to 300kW, are less interested in shopping around. Some users in that category complain of difficulty in persuading power companies to make acceptable offers. Powerline, the supply subsidiary of Midlands Electricity, says it has targeted smaller companies and, partly as a result, has won 1,000 sites outside its area.

The regional electricity company has established three divisions to refocus its business in the run-up to 1994, when the market will be open to greater competit - ion. Network services is taking over the regulated distribution activities, including the restructured electrical contracting business and the operation of the airport distribution systems acquired from BAA earlier this year. Customer services will be responsible for the regulated supply of electricity. Energy services will concentrate on the competitive market of bulk electricity trading, including pooling and settlement operations. The group's other competitive interests, such as electricity marketing to customers with demands greater than 100kw and gas marketing through its joint venture with Total Gas, will also be part of the energy division. Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said: 'This is the next logical move since we were floated. The reorganisation reflects the change in our business.' The company has withdrawn from retail operations and restructured its contracting operations, leading to the loss of 350 jobs.

He said no sector would be spared in his campaign for greater flexibility and competitiveness in the economy. A key element would be the reduction of subsidies in all sectors over the next five years and the privatisation of a broad range of state companies. In a hard-hitting paper presented to his Free Democratic Party (FDP), the junior partner in the Bonn coalition, Mr Rexrodt said the politically sensitive coal industry should be included in the reforms. Direct federal subsidies to the western states, excluding federal tax concessions and soft loans, totalled DM13.5bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in 1992, or 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Nearly half the subsidies have been earmarked for supporting agriculture and the coal industry, the latter accounting for 19 per cent of western Germany's total energy consumption. In 1990, coal mining subsidies amounted to DM80,500 per employee, or 1.8 times the average yearly income of a blue-collar worker. A reform of the coal industry would be particularly welcomed by western German consumers. The sector's price structure was mapped out in a 1980 agreement between the coal and electricity industries. The agreement stipulated the amount of domestic coal the utilities undertook to burn for the remainder of the century. But because of high production costs, the electricity companies pay about DM280 per ton, compared with world prices of DM80. To compensate for the high cost of coal, the electricity utilities collect the Kohlepfennig, a levy from the consumer. This explains why German electricity is among the most expensive in the European Community. The FDP paper was jointly put forward with Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and head of the party. An FDP spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt wanted to present the paper on creating more competition when parliament resumes after the summer recess. By singling out reductions in subsidies and the faster privatisation or deregulation of the public sector  - including Deutsche Telekom, the national telecommunications company, and Lufthansa, the state airline - economists said that Mr Rexrodt was challenging structures which helped maintain high costs for the consumer, as well as wage levels.

British Gas said it received advance payments totalling Pounds 230m by noon on Thursday from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of its 18m domestic customers. Full returns from its national network of gas showrooms will not be available until next week, however. There have been suggestions that the electricity companies would receive advance payments of as much as Pounds 1bn. This will not be known until next week because of the holiday weekend. The companies reported the collection of more than Pounds 663m from householders. This figure does not take into account the final rush as Thursday's deadline approached. Banks and building societies that have the regional electricity companies and British Gas as customers will be among the main beneficiaries from the rush to meet the March 31 VAT deadline. Most of the companies have decided to deposit the advance payments with banks and buildings societies, although they also mentioned money market funds as possible destinations. Manweb and Northern Electric were the only regional electricity companies to say they were still considering what to do with the extra cash. If the intentions to favour banks and building societies materialise, it will mean that much of the money will be 'recycled'. Most consumers withdrew funds from banks or building societies to make the advance payments, which they hope will give them an effective yield greater than the relatively low rates on offer for savings. Most electricity companies say the extra interest earned will be used to cover the administrative and data processing expenses associated with the imposition of VAT. Seeboard said its decision to deposit in building societies the Pounds 64m it received from 115,000 customers by Wednesday night meant it was 'effectively returning' the capital. Scottish Power will donate the extra interest it receives to groups 'who have been disadvantaged by the introduction of VAT on fuel'.

0,FT911-3417 ,"FT911-3417 _AN-BDYBFAABFT 910425   FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (2): Greens urge sales reduction - The Environment      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   DRAW YOUR curtains at dusk. Use a toaster to make toast. Dust your lightbulbs frequently. They may sound like commonsense, but these household hints are a central plank - although some say a shaky one - of the UK government's environmental strategy for the electricity industry. They come from Yorkshire Electricity's recently published Code of Practice on the efficient use of electricity. Under the regulations of the new electricity industry, each regional electricity company must publish such a code, helping the public get more value from each unit of electricity. The industry rarely talks about using less electricity, environmental lobbyists such as Friends of the Earth point out. 'A reduction in electricity sales is needed to reduce the threat of global warming,' the group insisted in a document published in October last year. Electricity is, Friends of the Earth says, 'Britain's number one contributor' to both global warming and acid rain. Every unit of electricity (kWh) used, the group points out, means the emission of nearly 1kg of carbon dioxide (CO), one of the 'greenhouse' gases. The UK electricity industry is responsible for around 33 per cent of the CO released into the atmosphere every year. It is also a leading producer of the gases that cause acid rain - nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxides (SOx), annually releasing around 0.8m tonnes of NOx - 71 per cent of the UK total - and 2.6m tonnes of SOx - 29 per cent of the national total. There are two basic ways to deal with the problem - developing technology to generate electricity more cleanly and efficiently; and using less of it, or energy efficiency. Japan is often held up as a model - its energy ratio is 2.7 compared with the UK's 4.2, undeniably helped by the fact that energy is expensive. It also has a package of stringent regulations enforcing energy efficiency such as labelling for electrical appliances, setting building standards and giving incentives for energy saving measures. The UK government has begun to go the same way - although not far enough, its critics say. It will spend Pounds 26m this year on grants to help low income households use less energy, and will probably introduce a voluntary appliance labelling scheme next year. In addition, under the new electricity industry regulations, all users pay a levy on electricity generated from fossil fuels which then goes to fund more environmentally friendly methods of producing electricity. All the regional electricity companies, moreover, must take a certain percentage of their electricity from these 'renewable' sources, such as wind or wave power. The government's white paper on the environment sets a target of 1,000MW to be generated from renewables by the year 2000, and has further said they could provide 24 per cent of UK energy by 2025. But from the electricity industry's point of view, what really matters is finding ways to make fossil fuel production of electricity cleaner. The industry is under pressure - new UK legislation, under the auspices of the EC, will require power stations to cut SOx emissions to 60 per cent below 1980 levels by 2003, while NOx must be 30 per cent lower than in 1980 by 1998. And the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), has set a target of stabilising CO at 1990 levels by 2005, with which the UK has conditionally complied. There are three main options for the industry. First, it can clean up after combustion of coal or oil, notably by fitting scrubbers known as 'flue gas desulphurisation' or FGD units to the power station chimneys, which clean the gas as it leaves. This is the route the UK has so far adopted - 8,000MW of FGD are being fitted at present. However, few people regard this as an adequate long-term solution: FGD does not deal with NOx and critics point out that 8,000MW is a negligible amount compared with continental FGD installations. The second option is to switch into another fuel. Natural gas is the frontrunner. It releases very little sulphur or nitrogen, and burnt efficiently in a new 'combined cycle gas turbine' station (CCGT) which recovers waste heat from combustion to drive a steam turbine, it is around 50 per cent efficient compared with 37 per cent at best for a conventional coal fired station. This means less CO is released per unit of electricity produced. Most of the new power stations due to come onstream in the mid-90s in Europe will be CCGT. The third option is to devise technology that burns coal more cleanly. In Europe and the US a new generation of coal-fired power stations is being developed. By the 1990s they will be up and running - and green enough, their creators say, to compete with gas. There are other variants: in the UK British Coal has masterminded a process  -known as 'the topping cycle' which combines partial gasification with the new combustion technology. These clean coal technologies can cut emissions of sulphur by up to 99 per cent, and nitrogen by between 80 and 90 per cent. By improving efficiency from 35 per cent to up to 46 per cent they also cut CO emissions. The UK has no plans for any clean coal plant. The government has invested around Pounds 20m in clean coal research, and is currently conducting a review of the area, which may result in further investment later this year. So far the money to fund a clean coal plant - a new technology that involves commercial risk so cannot win City backing - is just not there. Ultimately, however, it will only be built when the two electricity generators order it, and while gas continues to be cheap and available, they are very unlikely to do so. But environmentalists should take heart. A quiet revolution in industry's use of electricity is taking place. CHP or combined heat and power systems, which generate electricity and heat from a single source, are slowly catching on. These systems can be twice as efficient as conventional boilers and can cut CO emissions by 70 per cent. If CHP capacity reaches 30,000MW by 2020, as the government hopes, national CO emissions could fall by 15 per cent.  The Financial Times   London Page 35  "
0," FR941007-1-00018   FR941007-1-00001        (4)     Terms of trade effect:     Decreased oil imports would improve the balance of trade and strengthen the U.S. dollar. This would leave U.S. consumers unambiguously better off. This balance-of-trade effect is not considered in private decision-making. However, like the monopsony effect, counting this as an externality raises broader issues regarding free trade. DOE intends to consider whether there is anything special about oil that justifies an externality value for it, while excluding one for other products.   (5)     Financing of government strategic stockpiles and military operations associated with oil:     Some analysts have suggested that the costs of stocking the strategic petroleum reserve and, more importantly, maintaining the military power needed to minimize oil supply disruptions are an additional source of externalities. DOE intends to study this source of externality in more detail, with particular emphasis on whether the size of the change in import dependence that might be attributed to alternative appliance efficiency standards would have any effect on government expenses.   In addition to these quantifiable aspects of energy security externalities, some analysts contend that reduced oil consumption will increase U.S. flexibility in conducting foreign policy. DOE intends to consider this issue, recognizing that any benefit here would again relate to the size of the impact of the efficiency standards.   Issue 19: The impact of incremental appliance efficiency standards on oil consumption.   A central issue in trying to estimate the energy security value to reduced oil imports is the quantitative effect of incremental efficiency standards on domestic oil consumption. The appliances being considered in this rule affect oil consumption either directly, as is the case with oil-fired furnaces, or indirectly by reducing the use of oil to generate electricity.   In 1990, according to the     Annual Energy Outlook for 1993 (AEO93),     about 2 percent of total U.S. oil consumption was used for residential space heating. By 2010, the same source projects that oil used for residential space heating will decrease significantly, and account for only about 1 percent of a higher total oil consumption.   The current efficiency standard for residential oil-fired furnaces is 78 percent. Moving from the current standard to 95 percent, for example would after complete stock replacement, reduce oil consumption in this category by less than 20 percent, and by less if there is a ``rebound'' effect. Marginal changes in this standard could have only an extremely small effect on total oil consumption.   In the case of appliance standards that affect electricity consumption, the amount by which oil consumption is reduced depends upon the fuels used to generate electricity. According to the AEO93, about 4 percent of the primary energy consumption used for electricity generation in 1990 was oil-based. That percentage is projected to remain approximately constant through 2010. Because oil's share of electricity generation is so small, changes in appliance efficiency standards for electric appliances will not significantly alter total oil consumption in the nation.   Based on the national fuel mix used in 1990, each kilowatt hour of electricity saved will reduce oil consumption by 0.000072 barrels. Given this ratio, each dollar of externality value attached to a barrel of oil translates into only 0.007 cents per kilowatt hour on a national average basis.   Oil-based electricity might be significant in some regions of the country. Additionally, oil tends to be used for peaking power. DOE intends to study whether regional and peak-load considerations might cause significant divergences from the national ratio of barrels of oil per kilowatt hour. However, because the national ratio is so low, it seems unlikely that even taking into account regional and peak-load considerations could result in large energy security externality values for electric appliances even if a high per-barrel externality value were deemed appropriate.   Issue 17: The impact of efficiency standards on domestic oil production and oil imports.        "," FR941007-1-00018   FR941007-1-00001        (4)     Terms of trade effect:     Decreased oil imports would improve the balance of trade and strengthen the U.S. dollar. This would leave U.S. consumers unambiguously better off. This balance-of-trade effect is not considered in private decision-making. However, like the monopsony effect, counting this as an externality raises broader issues regarding free trade. DOE intends to consider whether there is anything special about oil that justifies an externality value for it, while excluding one for other products.   (5)     Financing of government strategic stockpiles and military operations associated with oil:     Some analysts have suggested that the costs of stocking the strategic petroleum reserve and, more importantly, maintaining the military power needed to minimize oil supply disruptions are an additional source of externalities. DOE intends to study this source of externality in more detail, with particular emphasis on whether the size of the change in import dependence that might be attributed to alternative appliance efficiency standards would have any effect on government expenses.   In addition to these quantifiable aspects of energy security externalities, some analysts contend that reduced oil consumption will increase U.S. flexibility in conducting foreign policy. DOE intends to consider this issue, recognizing that any benefit here would again relate to the size of the impact of the efficiency standards.   Issue 19: The impact of incremental appliance efficiency standards on oil consumption.   A central issue in trying to estimate the energy security value to reduced oil imports is the quantitative effect of incremental efficiency standards on domestic oil consumption. The appliances being considered in this rule affect oil consumption either directly, as is the case with oil-fired furnaces, or indirectly by reducing the use of oil to generate electricity.   In 1990, according to the     Annual Energy Outlook for 1993 (AEO93),     about 2 percent of total U.S. oil consumption was used for residential space heating. By 2010, the same source projects that oil used for residential space heating will decrease significantly, and account for only about 1 percent of a higher total oil consumption.   The current efficiency standard for residential oil-fired furnaces is 78 percent. Moving from the current standard to 95 percent, for example would after complete stock replacement, reduce oil consumption in this category by less than 20 percent, and by less if there is a ``rebound'' effect. Marginal changes in this standard could have only an extremely small effect on total oil consumption.

That this is not so has already been demonstrated in the new 100kW market where, despite the installation of sophisticated electronic meters and communication channels, tariffs have been simplified. The mass of data generated by the new meters is ignored when charging the customer and is only required to calculate what the supplier should pay the generator. To replace existing reliable meters with high technology complex devices, purely to satisfy the accounting systems of the wholesale market, cannot be the way forward for the smaller industrial and domestic customer. The additional cost will in fact kill the competitive market and effectively maintain the present monopoly situation cloaked in pseudo competition. Who would benefit from this? Possibly those arguing for the complex solution. The proposals being suggested are equivalent to Kelloggs charging Sainsburys, not on the number of cases of cereal supplied to the warehouse, but on a count of the number of cornflakes consumed at the breakfast table.

Without the necessary supply  of power, the entire economy will be bottlenecked.    The country's power industry has been improving steadily  since 1975 when Deng Xiaoping was in charge of the work of the  State Council. But the most rapid progress has been recorded in  the last six years, as 12 to 14 million kilowatts of generating  capacity has been installed annually.    Nevertheless the industry still faces a shortfall.    This so-called electricity bottleneck has, in fact, lasted  for 24 consecutive years. Today, electricity production falls  short of demand by 20 per cent and some 120 million rural  Chinese still live in the dark.    Rapid expansion of the power industry is necessary.    During their industrialization, some countries in the world  have invested more than 2 per cent of their gross national  product (GNP) annually to expand their power industries.  However, between 1980 and 1992, only 1.24 percent of China's  GNP per annum was invested in the power sector.    Construction of power grids has also lagged behind demand.    Moreover, investment in applied science and technology for  power generation has been declining.    The fund-raising mechanism for enterprises in the power  industry should be implemented and a scientific and rational  pricing system for the use of electricity should be set up.    That electricity is a commodity was ignored as recently as a  few years ago, and so fund-raising for construction projects of  the power industry from both the domestic and international  financial markets was severely hindered.    Plants, equipment and the technology used in many power  stations and transmission grids are outdated. This results in a  waste of generated energy.    As to the future, the Ministry of Power Industry (MPI) is  considering increasing China's generating capacity by about 15  million kilowatts per year between 1995 and 1997.    Beyond that to the year 2000, 20 million kilowatts are to be  added annually. Assuming China carry out this plan [as  published], its total installed electricity capacity will be  about 300 million kilowatts by the turn of the century.    If China's GNP grows 8 to 9 per cent annually, the estimated  generating capacity of 300 million kilowatts should by and large  ease the power shortage nationwide, making it possible for each  county in the country and 95 per cent of the country's rural  households to have access to electricity.    It is hoped that the State, with the backing of relevant  departments, will increase its annual investment so that the  input constitutes at least 2 per cent of GNP, the minimum  required to ensure the industry's steady development.    In line with the central government's policy of allocating  funds for building key State projects the MPI will compete for  preferential policies. Particularly, low-interest loans for  rural regions in the country's minority, poor and remote areas  will be sought to develop the power industry.    The MPI will also encourage the development of new power  sources. the transmission of power via grids from energy-rich  provinces to those suffering from shortages, and investment from  developed coastal regions to the relatively poorly developed  power supply industries of the hinterlands.    Economically advanced regions will be encouraged to be  self-reliant in terms of electricity by collecting funds  themselves for investment in their own power sectors.    The MPI urges enterprises to create new channels of  fund-raising and will permit them to apply to banks directly for  loans and to other financial institutions for the issue of bonds  and shares after seeking the approval from relevant government  organs.    State Council officials said that China needs more foreign  investment in the power industry to compensate for the shortfall.    The MPI will experiment with issuing bonds of enterprises  abroad, and use the money collected to develop the power  industry.    It will also permit some power sector enterprises, which  have  good economic returns, to issue shares overseas. And it will  set up fund-raising companies abroad to help enterprises in the  power industry to raise funds from international sources.    Because power supply is of great importance to the national  economy, foreign investment in it will proceed under the State's  macro-control.    Domestic investment should provide about 80 per cent of  funding and the remainder will be sought from foreign investors.    To provide the public with reliable and quality service at  reasonable prices, the MPI will continue to develop thermal  power, hydro-electric power and limited amounts of nuclear power.    The MPI aims to harness the country's rivers to generate  between 70 and 80 million kilowatts of hydropower by the turn of  the century.    To achieve the goal, hydro-electric sites in the mainstream  and tributaries of the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze  River, the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, and the  Lancangjiang and Honghe river valleys will be targeted.    The power industry will monitor experience in the  construction and operational performance of the Qinshan and Daya  Bay nuclear power stations. The two successful nuclear power  stations in China will lay a good foundation for the development  of nuclear power in China in the next century.    In terms of the operational mechanism of State-owned  enterprises. modern corporate systems will be introduced.    State-owned enterprises will gradually be converted into  limited companies and shareholding companies.    The standard shareholding system will ensure independence  from government interference and create more channels for  fund-raising.    To pave the way for the management reform of the industry  the  MPI has drafted the Electric Power Law.    Within three to five years, a comprehensive legal provision  for the power industry, with the Electric Power Law as its  centre, is expected to be established in China.     "

Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, confirmed that under rules governing the new competitive electricity market, the tunnel was a big enough customer to choose its own supplier. The Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment were in dispute with London Electricity because they wanted to take power supplies for the tunnel from PowerGen, the privatised generating company. Prof Littlechild said he viewed the two tunnels as a single site, with demand of more than 1MW over a three-month peak usage period - the threshold above which customers can choose their electricity supplier. The ruling might have implications for local authorities in purchasing electricity for street lighting.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT924-12695 ,"FT924-12695 _AN-CJTB8ABKFT 921020   FT  20 OCT 92 / Uncertainty in power industry after climbdown      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   BRITISH COAL welcomed the government's reprieve of threatened mines and its promised review of the energy market last night. But the rest of the UK power industry was plunged into uncertainty by the about-turn on pit closures. The move is likely to force a postponement of the privatisation of British Coal, originally due next year. Electricity companies also fear that the government will now put pressure on them to raise their purchases of coal-based power to help keep extra pits in business. Under the privatisation schedule, all contracts between British Coal and the electricity industry are supposed to be freely negotiated from next April. British Coal said a review of the energy market would expose the difficulties it is facing, particularly the threat of gas-fired power stations which it says are squeezing out coal. But, the company added: 'It would require a significant change in these market realities for a UK coal industry on anything like the present scale to survive. It is not in British Coal's power to alter the fundamentals of the market for power station fuel supplies.' If the review means a larger coal industry than once planned, the government would have to intervene in the electricity market to make room for extra coal - there is already a vast oversupply with nearly 50m tonnes in stockpile. Intervention would take the form of further subsidies, or direct action by government to shut off alternative fuels. Mr Heseltine's action yesterday reprieved mines capable of producing 22m tonnes a year. have no need. The generators have agreed to take 40m tonnes of coal when contracts expire in March, but they are already having difficulty finding a market for their electricity among the distribution companies. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, one of the two large generators, said: 'We share the government's desire to see an early conclusion to the linked negotiations with the regional electricity companies and British Coal for contracts after March 1993.' It was clear that yesterday's decision was so rushed that Mr Michael Heseltine's Department of Trade had not had time to consider the wider implications for the closely interlinked energy market. The DTI was unable to say last night how it would deal with the likely knock-on effects. The government had been hoping to put enabling legislation for the privatisation before parliament this autumn. That may still go ahead, but actual sale negotiations will not be able to proceed so long as there is uncertainty about the number of pits that is to be kept open. Among the courses of action open to the government to stimulate demand for coal would be to scale back the nuclear power industry, which receives more than Pounds 1bn a year in subsidies, curb imports of electricity and coal, or halt the construction of gas-fired power stations. Mr Heseltine indicated yesterday that he would consult Professor Stephen Littlechild, the regulator of the electricity industry who is conducting a review of electricity supply prices, including the effect the growing role of gas as a fuel would have on the industry. Prof Littlechild said he would speed up parts of his review if necessary. 'I will wish to discuss with all those concerned how best I can assist the consultations planned.'

As Unionists prepared to join today the process of round-table talks taking place in Belfast, Mr Richard Needham, the province's economy minister, stuck by the Northern Ireland's Office plans to split the electricity utility in preparation for privatisation. His intransigence came despite pleas for a re-think in order to foster the co-operation ministers hope will see a new devolved government in the province and a replacement Anglo-Irish agreement. As if to tempt participants in the round-table talks, Mr Needham said that, if a new administration for the province was set up this summer, locally elected politicians would be able to reverse his decision. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, last night called for privatisation plans to be shelved while round-table talks continued. Before 'direct rule' in 1972, energy policy had been in the control of the Northern Ireland administration, he said. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, today meets Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, leaders of the main Unionist parties, for what could be the last of his bilateral meetings before full round-table discussions start - probably next Tuesday. Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paisley have joined forces with Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, to ask for a meeting with Mr John Major to discuss Northern Ireland electricity. At question time yesterday, Mr Hume drew parallels between the co-operation over the electricity industry and hopes for political progress. He urged Mr Needham to 'reconsider your position'.

The Ministry of Trade  and Industry will look into what changes are needed in  legislation and prior administrative decisions to guarantee  this. As large a part of basic energy needs as possible should  be supplied by natural gas plus solutions involving new  technology based on peat, wood, and other domestic energy  sources. It may be necessary for the state to participate in  finding another supply source for gas. The permit procedure in  connection with importing electricity will be retained to enable  the state to supervise the safety and environmental  acceptability of the imported energy.    These three points are new features in the energy policy  statement the government sent to the parliament on Wednesday [24  November]. The statement clearly reveals a more positive view of  natural gas, but it points out that it will not be possible to  import Norwegian gas to Finland before the beginning of the next  decade at the earliest.    ""Nothing new has happened,"" said Marketing Director Harry  Anton of Neste. ""We are in constant contact with both the Swedes  and the Norwegians, but there is still no one in Sweden who  plans to start importing Norwegian gas. A pipeline through  Sweden is needed to get the Norwegian gas to Finland.""    Nevertheless, Anton sees the statement as a positive signal  from the government and hopes it will also be regarded in this  light in Sweden. The negotiations with Norway are becoming more  urgent in view of the fact that the Norwegians must eventually  decide where they are going to build supply pipelines for their  gas. On the other hand, the Meripori coal power plant and the  combined power plant that will probably be built in Skoldvik  will provide new electricity production capacity, giving Finland  a little more time in the natural gas negotiations, Anton  pointed out.    Electricity Needs Increase    The government's energy policy statement assumes that  electricity consumption will increase at an annual rate of 2  percent during the next 10 years. This means that Finland will  need 2,000 MW in new production capacity by 2005 and 3,500 MW by  2010. The need is based on the fact that, in addition to  increased consumption, old capacity will be phased out.    Imported electricity is one alternative in the energy policy  statement, but the government assumes that it will be imported  only from countries that observe international environmental  agreements and safety regulations.    In practice, such a decision could eliminate the importation  of electricity from Russia and the Sosnoviy Bor nuclear power  plant outside St. Petersburg. However, Finland has an import  agreement with Russia that will be in effect until 1999, and  production director Anders Palmgren of Imatran Voima [Finnish  power-generating company] says it would not be easy to break the  agreement. Determining who is complying with international  safety regulations can be difficult, he indicated.    Nuclear Waste Alternative    Finland also has an agreement in effect with the Russian  authorities with regard to nuclear waste from Lovisa, and  Palmgren sees no reason to break the agreement. Theoretically,  nuclear waste from Lovisa can be shipped back to Russia as long  as the power plant is in operation, Palmgren said, but the  commercial terms are renegotiated every five years. The current  commercial agreement will be in force for another four years,  and Palmgren did not think it should be broken.    ""It is true that we have the alternative of taking care of  our waste ourselves, we have had that all along,"" said Palmgren.  ""But the money we now pay to have our waste taken care of and  processed in Tchelyabinsk also helps the Russians finance the  cleanup of the area, which suffered heavy radioactive  contamination in the 1950's.""    Palmgren thought the government had yielded to outside  political pressure in formulating its statement and pointed out  that it would certainly be possible to provide final underground  storage for the waste from Lovisa in Finland, but that it would  be a barbaric way to dispose of it. In this case usable fuel  would also be buried while long, medium, and short-lived waste  would all be mixed together.    Therefore Palmgren feels it is better to send it to Russia  now that it is also possible for both Imatran Voima and  Finland's Radiation Safety Center to check that the waste is  handled properly.    Old Formula    In other respects Wednesday's statement repeats the  government's old formula for the economic management of  Finland's energy. One element is energy taxes to make energy use  efficient and achieve the environmental goals that have been  set, another is a revised program to cut energy use and sector  agreements on energy-saving measures in industry.    The government also wants to increase the use of bioenergy  and other domestic energy. To promote this goal, increased  support will be given to research in new technologies applicable  to gasification plants, among other things. It will become  easier for small-scale power plants to enter the electricity  network and the possibility of increased electricity production  in connection with the cellulose industry will be studied.    The government is also stressing the development of energy  technology and will subsidize export efforts in this area. In  addition, the electricity market will be deregulated and there  will be increased competition. Previous emission goals will  remain in effect in the energy sector, sulfur dioxide emission  must be cut 80 percent in relation to the 1980 level, nitrogen  dioxide emission 30 percent, and carbon dioxide emission will be  checked at the end of the 1990's.    Industry Dissatisfied    Industry's Energy Association feels the government's energy  policy line is still based on empty phrases just as it was after  the negative decision on nuclear power. The association's  president, Pentti Sierila, says the government's energy  statement is not in line with the good goals that are presented  at the beginning of the statement.    ""The energy policy line that has now been presented is based  on hopes and comprehensive state subsidies in the belief that  energy needs can be satisfied through the increased production  of bioenergy and by implementing the purchase of natural gas  from Norway,"" Sierila said in a comment on the statement.    He is surprised that the government does not say anything  about the price of energy. He feels the structure and level of  energy taxes should be reconsidered.    ""The line that has now been presented will inevitably  increase the use of fossil fuel and thus make it impossible to  achieve the environmental emission goals Finland has committed  itself to internationally,"" Sierila said.    Greenpeace Approves    The environmental organization Greenpeace is pleased with  Finland's decision to stop exporting nuclear waste to Russia.  Imatran Voima has shipped highly radioactive nuclear waste from  Lovisa east of the Urals 11 times.    Greenpeace has launched highly visible campaigns against the  shipment and processing of nuclear waste in various parts of the  world. Protests have been organized in such countries as  Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany, and England.     "

The statement clearly reveals a more positive view of  natural gas, but it points out that it will not be possible to  import Norwegian gas to Finland before the beginning of the next  decade at the earliest.    ""Nothing new has happened,"" said Marketing Director Harry  Anton of Neste. ""We are in constant contact with both the Swedes  and the Norwegians, but there is still no one in Sweden who  plans to start importing Norwegian gas. A pipeline through  Sweden is needed to get the Norwegian gas to Finland.""    Nevertheless, Anton sees the statement as a positive signal  from the government and hopes it will also be regarded in this  light in Sweden. The negotiations with Norway are becoming more  urgent in view of the fact that the Norwegians must eventually  decide where they are going to build supply pipelines for their  gas. On the other hand, the Meripori coal power plant and the  combined power plant that will probably be built in Skoldvik  will provide new electricity production capacity, giving Finland  a little more time in the natural gas negotiations, Anton  pointed out.    Electricity Needs Increase    The government's energy policy statement assumes that  electricity consumption will increase at an annual rate of 2  percent during the next 10 years. This means Finland will need  2,000 MW in new production capacity by 2005 and 3,500 MW by  2010. The need is based on the fact that, in addition to  increased consumption, old capacity will be phased out.    Imported electricity is one alternative in the energy policy  statement, but the government assumes that it will be imported  only from countries that observe international environmental  agreements and safety regulations.    In practice, such a decision could eliminate the importation  of electricity from Russia and the Sosnoviy Bor nuclear power  plant outside St. Petersburg. However, Finland has an import  agreement with Russia that will be in effect until 1999, and  production director Anders Palmgren of Imatran Voima [Finnish  power-generating company] says it would not be easy to break the  agreement. Determining who is complying with international  safety regulations can be difficult, he indicated.    Nuclear Waste Alternative    Finland also has an agreement in effect with the Russian  authorities with regard to nuclear waste from Lovisa, and  Palmgren sees no reason to break the agreement. Theoretically,  nuclear waste from Lovisa can be shipped back to Russia as long  as the power plant is in operation, Palmgren said, but the  commercial terms are renegotiated every five years. The current  commercial agreement will be in force for another four years,  and Palmgren did not think it should be broken.    ""It is true that we have the alternative of taking care of  our waste ourselves, we have had that all along,"" said Palmgren.  ""But the money we now pay to have our waste taken care of and  processed in Tchelyabinsk also helps the Russians finance the  cleanup of the area, which suffered heavy radioactive  contamination in the 1950's.""    Palmgren thought the government had yielded to outside  political pressure in formulating its statement. He pointed out  that it would certainly be possible to provide final underground  storage for the waste from Lovisa in Finland, but that it would  be a barbaric way to dispose of it. In this case, usable fuel  would also be buried while long, medium, and short-lived waste  would all be mixed together.    Therefore, Palmgren feels it is better to send it to Russia  now that it is also possible for both Imatran Voima and  Finland's Radiation Safety Center to check that the waste is  handled properly.    Old Formula    In other respects Wednesday's statement repeats the  government's old formula for the economic management of  Finland's energy. One element is energy taxes to make energy use  efficient and achieve the environmental goals that have been  set, another is a revised program to cut energy use and sector  agreements on energy-saving measures in industry.    The government also wants to increase the use of bioenergy  and other domestic energy. To promote this goal, increased  support will be given to research in new technologies applicable  to gasification plants, among other things. It will become  easier for small-scale power plants to enter the electricity  network and the possibility of increased electricity production  in connection with the cellulose industry will be studied.    The government is also stressing the development of energy  technology and will subsidize export efforts in this area. In  addition, the electricity market will be deregulated and there  will be increased competition. Previous emission goals will  remain in effect in the energy sector, sulfur dioxide emission  must be cut 80 percent in relation to the 1980 level, nitrogen  dioxide emission 30 percent, and carbon dioxide emission will be  checked at the end of the 1990's.    Industry Dissatisfied    Industry's Energy Association feels the government's energy  policy line is still based on empty phrases just as it was after  the negative decision on nuclear power. Pentti Sierila, the  association's president, says the government energy statement is  not in line with the good goals that are presented at the  beginning of the statement.    ""The energy policy line that has now been presented is based  on hopes and comprehensive state subsidies in the belief that  energy needs can be satisfied through the increased production  of bioenergy and by implementing the purchase of natural gas  from Norway,"" Sierila said in commenting on the statement.    He is surprised the government does not say anything about  the price of energy. He feels the structure and level of energy  taxes should be reconsidered.    ""The line that has now been presented will inevitably  increase the use of fossil fuel and thus make it impossible to  achieve the environmental emission goals Finland has committed  itself to internationally,"" Sierila said.    Greenpeace Approves    The environmental organization Greenpeace is pleased with  Finland's decision to stop exporting nuclear waste to Russia.  Imatran Voima has shipped highly radioactive nuclear waste from  Lovisa east of the Urals 11 times.    Greenpeace has launched highly visible campaigns against the  shipment and processing of nuclear waste in various parts of the  world. Protests have been organized in such countries as  Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany, and England.     "

Independent assessments said the plan - with the government setting aside its aim of increasing in 1994 the number of industrial consumers able to shop around for electricity - might save more than 10 of the 31 threatened pits. The franchise, or non-competitive market, would continue to supply about 70 per cent of electricity in England and Wales. Minimum market shares would be established for power from coal, gas, nuclear and renewables sectors. Coal could have two thirds of the franchise market initially, going down to about half in five years. That would enable it to make sales to the generators of 54m tonnes annually initially, falling to 44m in year five. Under the 'balanced fuel supply pattern', nuclear power would have about 22 per cent, roughly its current market share, at both the start and end of the five-year period. Gas would increase its share from 8 to 20 per cent. The proposal, outlined to MPs at the Commons trade and industry committee yesterday, is bound to be seen as self-serving from a company fighting suggestions that coal's market share could be improved by closing nuclear reactors. It is likely to have significant appeal to the government because it would upset few vested interests. By lowering the limit from 1994 of the competitive market to customers above 100kw, rather than the current 1MW, as currently envisaged, only about 40,000 extra customers, on top of the current 5,000, would be free to choose their electricity supplier.

Mr Rexrodt wants the country's electricity grid and gas networks to be thrown open to foreign and domestic competition. This would reduce energy prices, which for some categories are the highest in the European Union and break the political and economic influence held by giant utilities such as RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk. Officials from RWE, the largest utility, said Mr Rexrodt's plan were not surprising. 'Its not really a new theme (from the ministry) we are hearing. Let us see the final draft legislation,' he said. But officials from Veba, the energy-based conglomerate whose electricity subsidiary, PreussenElektra, holds a fifth of the market in western Germany, said the measures should be matched by greater competition in the rest of Europe. 'Everyone says the energy sector in Germany is a monopolistic structure. But what about other EU countries,' he said. What makes Germany different is that there is no single formal regulatory body overseeing electricity pricing. The regional utilities, or the distribution companies, must agree their tariffs with local municipalities, which often own part of the utilities. However, officials in Bonn and Brussels are sceptical that Mr Rexrodt can succeed, particularly in an election year, although they realise he has to try.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

Both the large generation companies, National Power and PowerGen, have announced projects in places as far apart as India, eastern Germany and the US. Some of the regional electricity distribution companies are also looking overseas. These wider aspirations are understandable given the crowded nature of the UK power market with its large surplus of generating capacity. But the news has been received with caution on the stock exchange. Investors are not sure whether utilities should be chasing business abroad, and they are watching developments carefully. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, puts his company's international case bluntly. NP's share of the UK generation market is being whittled away by new competitors, such as Nuclear Electric and the independent power producers, and will probably fall below 40 per cent quite soon. To achieve growth, NP must either diversify out of electricity, which it is unwilling to do, or try to sell its electricity expertise in new markets. What particularly attracts NP overseas is an estimate by the World Bank that 800,000MW of new electricity capacity - more than 10 times the capacity of the UK electricity industry - costing Pounds 500bn will have to be built globally over the next 10 years, much of it in the Third World. NP is prepared to commit Pounds 1bn to this market, a sum which, geared up as power projects usually are, could involve it in Pounds 15bn of power stations. PowerGen, NP's smaller competitor, is also worried about pressures on the home front, so it commissioned McKinsey, the management consultants, to assess its chances overseas. McKinsey identified 350 companies with the strength to compete in the international power market, and placed PowerGen among the top 10. This, Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen's chief executive says, helped persuade him to pursue opportunities abroad. Both NP and PowerGen are keen to play down the risks in their strategies. Mr Graham Hagley, NP's managing director for international business development, says the company intends to build a mixed portfolio of overseas investments in which those with high risks and high rewards are balanced by others which are less exposed financially, but produce lower returns. NP's recent Dollars 160m acquisition of TEVCO, the owner of seven power plants in the south eastern US - its largest so far - falls into the second category, and provides 'ballast' for higher risk ventures in areas such as the Indian subcontinent and the Far East. One of these involves NP teaming up with Ashok Leyland of Madras to build a 1,000MW coal-fired station in Andhra Pradesh at a cost of Pounds 1.3bn. 'Our concept is to hold a significant stake and have long-term operating responsibility,' says Mr Hagley. NP could contribute expertise both in the construction and management of the project. PowerGen is sticking closer to home. Its major projects so far have been in Portugal, where it is participating in a gas-fired power station, and in eastern Germany where it is negotiating with other partners to buy a power station and the nearby coal mine which supplies it. 'We're not running a race,' says Mr Wallis. 'We're being a bit sniffy, looking for quality investments. We're telling our shareholders that we're limiting ourselves to activities for which we have the management skills.' PowerGen is unlikely to go into either the US, which is too competitive, or India because of the risks, but it is looking at the Asean states and China. In particular he hopes that cementing PowerGen's links with German partners will give it a base for expansion into the east European market. But competition in the international power market has intensified in recent years. The main players include large US utilities, and manufacturers of power generating equipment in North America and Europe. Among the UK electricity distributors, Midlands Electricity has teamed up with Enron, the Houston-based gas company, and several US utilities in a joint venture called Wing Merrill International, which is looking at projects in Kuwait, Turkey and China. The risks are high. Mr Wallis estimates that 50 per cent of international power projects fail to get off the ground. People are bamboozled by over-optimistic profit forecasts, or fail to do their homework properly. 'There are often skeletons in the cupboard,' he says. Analysts have said that PowerGen's project in Portugal could run into trouble because the power station was started before the government reached agreement on how to ship in the gas. But Mr Wallis said the delay on gas was foreseen and his company is not exposed financially. One of the precautions that National Power took before embarking on its Indian project was to secure a guarantee from the Indian government that it would receive all the payments and dividends due to it. All of which explains why investors are cautious. Mr Alex Milne, electricity analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, says that foreign markets are a 'reasonable area' for UK generators to look at, given their technical expertise and financial strength. He applauds their measured approach, but in such a new market there is little way of judging how successful their investments will be.

The deal would have created the largest investor-owned power utility in the US. SCEcorp, the parent of Southern California Edison, which provides power in the Los Angeles area, has been trying since 1988 to take over San Diego Gas and Electric, in a deal valued at more than Dollars 2.8bn. It is unclear whether or not SCEcorp will appeal against the regulators' veto. The unanimous ruling by the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) follows its consideration of a 1,300-page report, published last February, which said the benefits of the merger would be outweighed by its negative impact on competition. The decision comes in the wake of several recent mergers in the widely fragmented power generation sector. Analysts have suggested this could be the start of a wave of takeover bids which would allow utilities to reap economies through pooling. The Californian PUC said it had ruled against the merger because the utilities had not proven that the deal would provide long-term net benefits for customers. It also feared the deal would have adverse effects on competition among utilities which transmit power or which sell in the open market the excess electricity they have generated.

0,FT923-13982 ,"FT923-13982 _AN-CGJA7ABMFT 920710   FT  10 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Power prices   THE FIRST full-year results from the electricity industry have done little to dispel the view that it was privatised not only with the wrong structure but on the wrong terms - at least from the point of view of the consumer. Profits are so buoyant that many regional power distributors have been able to produce real dividend increases of 10 per cent, so contributing to the severity of the recession. Two of them have been so embarrassed that they decided to hand part of their profits back to customers. One year is a short time in which to judge a complex business that still has a lot of shaking down to do. Part of the profit surge came from a price catch-up to which the electricity companies were entitled under their complex pricing formula. Professor Stephen Littlechild, director general of Offer, the industry regulator, has promised to leave the formula alone until 1994-95, because he believes that the electricity companies need that degree of certainty to increase their efficiency. This view has merits. But if it is already clear that the terms on which the industry was privatised were more than just marginally too generous, it also has serious flaws. One is that the price formula ensures that benefits earned by the electricity companies through cost reductions flow to the shareholders, rather than customers. Once the economy recovers, that generous starting point is likely to ensure that profits will remain inordinate even if electricity prices rise at less than the rate of inflation. Another flaw is that should present trends continue the adjustment which is bound to follow the 1995 pricing review will be so large that the industry will have to go through another disruptive upheaval. There are, admittedly, still big uncertainties in the market, above all the renegotiation with the generators of supply contracts for coal prior to the privatisation of British Coal. These contracts, which should be concluded by the end of the summer, could have a big impact on electricity prices. Professor Littlechild has, however, already begun to squeeze other links in the electricity supply chain. He has warned the generators that they might face a monopoly inquiry if they engage in predatory pricing. He has also just imposed a tough new price formula on the National Grid Company, which has a monopoly on the grid. Both moves were intended to address complaints from wholesale users of electricity, such as ICI, about fast-rising electricity prices. Once the new coal contracts are concluded, it would make sense for the regulator to follow the process through by imposing pressure on the regional distributors as well, by reconsidering both the price formulae and the threshold for outside direct supply to their customers. These are risk-free utilities. Customers should not suffer because the initial formulae were too generous to shareholders. Voluntary hand-outs are not a substitute.

0,FT924-710 ,"FT924-710 _AN-CLWCDAA1FT 921223   FT  23 DEC 92 / Coal crisis imperils French connection: David Lascelles on cross-Channel power in the grid      By DAVID LASCELLES   ONE SOLUTION canvassed for the coal crisis is to shut off the cross-Channel cable that enables Electricite de France, the state-owned French utility, to sell power into the UK grid. The attraction is that French exports are equivalent, by the estimates of British Coal, to between 6m and 7m tonnes of coal a year. That is the output of about six or seven pits, or between 6,000 and 7,000 miners. Moreover, EdF is widely thought to enjoy state subsidies that give it an unfair advantage over UK sources of fuel, which have to operate unaided. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who is reviewing the pit closures, has promised to look at the French interconnector. So he may act to alter its role, although his scope for action is not as wide as the coal lobby seems to believe. The interconnector was opened in the early 1980s with a capacity of 2,000MW  -about the size of two large power stations. The intention was to enable the British and French grids to balance out peaks in demand. But EdF was more aggressive than the Central Electricity Generating Board and by the late 1980s the traffic was largely one-way. When the UK electricity industry was privatised in 1990, EdF became a member of the electricity pool - the market through which bulk power is sold in the UK. It also negotiated individual contracts with all 12 of the regional distribution companies in England and Wales, and one Scottish company. Those arrangements expire in March, and there is pressure from the British side to prevent EdF negotiating new ones. The Coalfield Communities Campaign, one of the most active pro-coal lobby groups, demanded at a Commons committee inquiry last month that base-load electricity imports be stopped and the link be reduced to a peak balancing role. The campaign also alleged that EdF was dumping electricity on the UK market. Other lobbyists have called for the link to be used to export UK electricity to France and beyond. Reversing the flow might create demand for an additional 15m tonnes of coal, they argue. EdF has begun a counter-offensive. Earlier this week, its head of European sales, Mr Jean-Pierre Guery, was in London for talks. He said EdF intended to go ahead with negotiations for new contracts and he rejected suggestions that his company was able to sell electricity at subsidised prices. One of his main arguments was that EdF's sales help keep UK electricity prices down, so that cutting the link would only damage the consumer. Nor would banning imports necessarily lead to more coal being burnt - the south of England, where the French connection is made, depends heavily on oil-fired stations. Although the English grid draws on all power stations, there is a bottleneck between the coal-fired stations in the north and the heaviest demand in the south. The regional companies are also keen to sign up with EdF because it widens their source of supply. Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive of Seeboard, which has an 80MW agreement with EdF, said last week he expected to negotiate new contracts shortly. The main question Mr Heseltine will have to address is whether the UK has the right to ban imports. The EC's single market officially comes into being in January and it would be hard for the UK to erect a barrier to electricity, particularly since it has been one of the champions of a single market in energy. Mr Guery pointed out that the agreement creating the link gives EdF contractual rights it would seek to protect. Mr Guery was not encouraging on the prospect for UK electricity exports - he said UK generators were unlikely to be able to price competitively in the French market. Nor could they export through France to third countries because transit costs would be too high. But he did foresee the link resuming its balancing role eventually. EdF seems intent on keeping the traffic one way, at least for the time being, and there is little the government can do about it without triggering a diplomatic incident. One measure does seem likely, though. French electricity is not subject to the UK's nuclear levy - the 10 per cent tax on electricity bills to pay for decommissioning nuclear power stations. Critics say EdF can charge prices that reflect the levy, but pocket the difference rather than hand it to the UK Treasury. Mr Guery says that does not happen. But the lure of subjecting French sales to extra taxation is one Mr Heseltine will almost certainly not be able to resist.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

This was because of the threat to coal-fired power stations from the many new gas-fired power stations being built in England and Wales. The sales cut would force British Coal to reduce the number of pits from about 50 to even fewer than the 14 that NM Rothschild, the government's advisers on the British Coal privatisation, have estimated would survive. Mr Edwards' appearance before MPs followed controversial efforts by the British Coal chairman to dismiss him. Although Mr Edwards is still officially BC's commercial director, he is expected to leave the company when his lawyers have settled terms. Mr Edwards said coal imports, the subsidised nuclear industry and other fuels were also threats to British Coal. If the government removed the advantages these other fuels enjoyed, British Coal could still win a five-year contract to sell 50m tonnes of coal to the electricity generators. He said British Coal could help itself by cutting costs and prices to the electricity industry. However, he said, the price should not fall below Pounds 1.60 per gigajoule, compared with Pounds 1.85 today. Although imports were only around Pounds 1.35 per gigajoule, UK coal offered better security without exchange rate risk. It was unlikely that British Coal would lose all its sales to gas and imported coal. 'I'd say the centre of gravity for demand for British Coal was closer to 25m tonnes,' he said. This compares with the 30m to 35m tonnes predicted by NM Rothschild. Mr Edwards also said there was no economic justification for building many of the new gas stations because the power they would produce would be expensive at 2.9p per unit compared with 1.8p to 2.2p at existing coal stations. The reason they were able to go ahead in spite of being uncompetitive was because they were backed by long-term contracts to sell power to the 12 regional electricity companies which buy power from generators and sell to customers, and so did not have to compete in the market place. The reason the regional electricity companies had been anxious to back independent generation projects was to gain bargaining power with the two big generators, National Power and PowerGen, Mr Edwards said. National Power and PowerGen had then felt obliged to build gas stations to defend their market share. The industry would be relieved if this competitive investment in gas could be stopped, he believed. British Coal said yesterday that it welcomed Mr Edwards' warnings about the 'dash for gas'. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman for a year, had 'made it plain that all electricity users stand to lose from excessive and unnecessary investment in new gas-fired stations', the company said.

Stripped of its technical language, the 50-page report dismisses one of the central arguments put forward by supporters of the coal industry - that gas has been unfairly squeezing coal out of the electricity generation market. His analysis will make it much harder for the government to justify curbing the growth of gas as it seeks ways of averting further pit closures. To compile his report, Prof Littlechild examined dozens of contracts for the sale of electricity produced from a variety of fuels - coal, gas and nuclear. His conclusion is clear. The contracts that regional electricity companies have signed with power generators for gas-based electricity are not uneconomic. Prof Littlechild says they should be welcomed as they add diversity to fuel supplies, and bring environmental benefits. He goes further, and maintains that gas-based electricity is the cheapest on the market and distribution companies are right to sign up for it. While admitting that comparing prices is difficult, he places electricity from coal at 3.2p per kilowatt hour, nuclear power at 3p, and gas in the range of 2.7p to 3p. Altogether, it is a much clearer and stronger conclusion than anyone expected. That accounts for the furious reaction from the coal lobby. The main objection from the power generators was that Prof Littlechild had used wrong assumptions about the extent to which generation capacity is used. His prices were based on average use of 53 per cent, while many power stations operate up to 90 per cent of the time. The longer they run, the cheaper their costs. 'He's comparing chalk and cheese,' National Power said. There are, however, nuances to the report that coal may find more encouraging. One of Prof Littlechild's findings is that there is still a large hole in the energy market in the mid 1990s that could be filled, at least in part by coal. He added up all the long-term supply contracts and matched them against the electricity companies' forecast needs. That showed that in 1995 as much as 35 per cent of the market will remain uncontracted for. The hole, by Offer's estimates, is the equivalent of 25m tons of coal. Although other fuel sources will fill part of it, it shows the market is far from closed. Gas occupies a smaller part of the market than generally believed - only one sixth. Prof Littlechild raised the possibility that while gas contracts may be the cheapest, they may not accurately reflect the true cost of generation. He has no evidence of this but intends to investigate further. That is worrying for the gas industry - many electricity distributors have equity interests in gas generation projects. The report has a sting in the tail. Prof Littlechild wonders whether power generators are overcharging for coal-based power in the new round of contracts they are negotiating with distributors. Although that is consistent with Prof Littlechild's concerns that the generators dominate the electricity market, it implies that coal-based power might be sold more cheaply, benefitting the coal industry. 'Can the price of coal be brought down? Is there scope for reduction in the generators' margins?' he asked yesterday, implying that the answer to both questions was yes. His questions sent tremors through distributors because they could be interpreted as implying that a company which signed up for the new coal contracts might be in breach of its licence obligation to buy electricity as economically as possible. That might further damage efforts to get long-term coal contracts in place. Prof Littlechild sought to soothe those fears by saying he would not stand in the way of short-term deals that enable the market to function. The question in the wake of the report is its impact on Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, as he formulates a new policy for coal. Prof Littlechild's report reflects the views of an independent regulator. However, its task is not to address the political issues that might have a decisive influence in shaping policy, and the report could equally be brushed aside if Mr Heseltine decided that halting the dash for gas was the best way of preserving miners' jobs.

After a two-month investigation, Prof Littlechild has concluded that power from gas-fired stations is not uneconomic, and that it conforms to present price controls. 'My review does not so far suggest that regional electricity companies have breached their economic purchasing licence conditions,' he says in a report to be published today. His findings, which are still preliminary, will have a powerful influence on the review of energy policy being conducted by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, in the wake of the crisis over pit closures. His overall conclusion will make it hard for Mr Heseltine to blame gas for the coal industry's problems. It also weakens the case for calling a halt to the construction of further gas-fired power stations, many of which he has already approved. But Prof Littlechild's report will also provoke a strong challenge from the coal lobby which claims to have evidence that gas is costlier than coal. Prof Littlechild's main findings are: The contracts which the regional electricity companies have signed with gas stations 'appear to compare well with other contracts available'. The contracts have added diversity to the regional electricity companies' sources of supply. They are also less vulnerable to environmental regulation because of the low emissions from gas stations. Regional companies 'looked to the future, actively seeking the most economic and competitive sources of supply from new generators as well as existing licensees'. Prof Littlechild also casts doubt on claims by the coal lobby that coal-fired plant can produce electricity for as little as 2p per unit, compared with more than 3p for gas-fired power. 'I do not think it is realistic to expect such prices,' he says. He stresses that his report is incomplete. He will announce further conclusions on January 31. The dash for gas resulted from the lifting of an EC ban on the use of gas for power generation. Over the past two years, more than two dozen gas projects have been announced, the first of which are now starting up. If they are all completed, they could displace as much as 30m tons of coal a year. Gas power stations fire up coal conundrum, Page 10  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "
0,FT922-8305 ,"FT922-8305 _AN-CENCNAAWFT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (12): North Sea bubble - Doubts on the UK dash for gas      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   WHEN Roosecote power station opened in Barrow-in-Furness last October, it was hailed as the first in a new generation of gas-fired power plant that would provide new competition for the privatised UK electricity industry. Referring to the 20 'significant' private power projects that are in the pipeline, Mr John Wakeham, the then energy secretary, said: 'I am convinced that independent projects are poised to play an increasingly important role in the future of the electricity generating market.' But the proliferation of these projects has not been welcomed by all of Mr Wakeham's fellow politicians. The House of Commons select committee on energy has issued repeated warnings that the construction of many new gas-fired stations could be a case of 'competition for its own sake'. National Grid, the company which owns and operates the electricity transmission system, cautioned last month that if all of the current power projects came on stream, they would contribute to 60 per cent over-capacity in the market by 1997. The company said it had 28 applications from new independent projects to join the national grid, amounting to 22,370 MegaWatts of new capacity by 1997. This implies that around 10 older, coal-fired stations would have to close in order to achieve a more reasonable margin of 30 per cent excess capacity. It highlights a fear in the industry that the days are numbered for many efficient coal-fired plants. In addition, the economic case for many of the new gas stations has not been proven. Critics argue that, for many of the projects, high gas prices will lead to an electricity price higher than that of the coal-fired plant. Since many of the regional electricity companies are partners in a number of the gas-fired generation projects, the critics claim that higher electricity prices will be passed on to the captive domestic consumer. Gas-fired power stations are undoubtedly cleaner than coal stations and many advocates of the new wave of generating plant point to their environmental benefits. But British Coal has estimated that, if coal plant is fitted with scrubbers which reduce emissions, the price of the electricity produced would still be slightly lower than the cost of power from a gas-fired plant. Mr David Porter, chief executive of the Association of Independent Electricity Producers, justifies the dash for gas: 'Britain should enjoy the benefits of diversity in power generation and that includes a role for coal, but the electricity industry cannot sustain itself by pricing its product on the output of fully depreciated coal-fired power stations.' The great wave of interest in new generating plant came with the blessing of the government when the electricity industry was privatised just over two years ago. Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary (the position has now been axed), was keen to see the development of competitors to National Power and PowerGen, the privatised generators of England and Wales carved from the old Central Electricity Generating Board. Overseas energy companies rushed to link up with regional electricity suppliers in a bid to build new plant. Simultaneously, the two generators themselves announced plans for an ambitious construction programme of gas-fired power stations. At the time, gas prices were reasonable and supplies were plentiful. But as British Gas became inundated with a flow of enquiries for gas contracts, it realised it would not have enough gas supply to fill them all. By March last year, the company moved to push up gas prices and cut off demand, in the process rendering many of the proposed power projects uneconomic. British Gas was eventually forced by its regulator to reduce its price increase although it has limited the availability of gas. Since the new price under the so-called LTI3 schedule is still higher than the pre-increase price, many of the projects teeter on the brink of viability. So far, nine projects have signed contracts for gas supply with British Gas, several others are pursuing deals with other producers and four additional projects are confident of securing supply. In addition, 10 projects have received planning permission. As well as the cost of gas supply, the location of the project and the efficiency of the plant will also influence its economics. But it is probably true to assume that not all of the 28 projects which have applied to the National Grid for a connection to the transmission system, will eventually be built. Consultants and industry observers estimate that between 14 and 20 projects are viable.  The Financial Times   London Page VIII  "

You also say that, were there to be a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the MMC could recommend a break up into smaller units. I suggest the industry structure is quite compatible with efficiency. Although privatisation was not ideally carried out, the UK will soon have some of the world's most efficient coal power stations, together with environmentally friendly gas power. Economic theory moved away some time ago from a simple association between industry structure and efficiency and any argument based purely on the duopoly claim needs to be justified. There are two theoretical benefits from break up: lower average production costs and more competitive pricing of the output. On the first point, it is scarcely credible that production costs would be lower with five or six companies - on the contrary there are probably some economies of scale. Both generating companies are now heading for a halved workforce with substantial reductions in other operating costs. On the second point, the regulator has accepted that pool prices remain below avoidable costs. The pool will be a highly imperfect spot market for some time to come, but there is no evidence that the generating companies are exploiting their power, for the simple reason that they would gain very little from it, but would immediately fall foul of the regulator. Both are now careful to avoid any behaviour that could be construed as anti-competitive. This largely removes any danger to the public interest. Break up would therefore probably raise the overhead cost of electricity and reduce the generation industry's purchasing economies in fuel and transport, for little or no benefit in the pool. It would also rob the UK of the opportunity to take a large position in the emerging foreign generation market, where the two companies should be able to produce substantial profits and export earnings in future. Over the next five years, the electricity regulator will be able to point to lower prices for most customers, better service and a choice of supply. This is not a bad outcome for an imperfect privatisation. Simon Taylor, fellow in economics, St Catherine's College, Cambridge CB2 1RL   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The World Bank expectsdemand of Dollars 24bn a year for power projects in the region in coming years. There is no doubting the need: the debt crisis brought new spending on power projects almost to a halt across the region. The big electricity deficit that developed has led to widespread power cuts in many countries. In some, such as Colombia and Honduras, it has had a palpable effect in slowing economic growth in recent years. The debt crisis brought about another development: budget stringency led many governments to shed responsibilities, to privatise and to encourage privately-financed projects in areas previously in the government domain. Yet handing over more responsibility to the private sector has raised questions about how growth in generating capacity will be financed, particularly since the big project financiers for governments - the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank - are unable, or have limited ability, to lend direct to the private sector. The reaccommodation of Latin America in the world's financial markets has helped to ease the way, although many international banks remain inhibited from lending for a variety of reasons. Only Chile - the pioneer in developing private electricity generating capacity in Latin America - has developed its local capital markets sufficiently not to depend on foreign finance. Bankers agree that the necessary, if not sufficient, condition for private finance is the establishment of a regulatory regime that lenders feel they will be able to trust over a long period of time. The pricing of electricity is of huge political significance and governments are often tempted to keep prices down to preserve their popularity. A study by the Latin American Energy Organisation (OLADE) showed that in 1990 only five Latin American governments were charging prices at or above long-term marginal cost. 'This is changing quite rapidly,' said Mr Vijay Chaudhry, head of the power division of the International Finance Corporation's infrastructure department. Now more and more governments are introducing realistic pricing policies that send the right signals to investors. Not everywhere, however. In Brazil, where government ministers have spoken about bringing in private generating capacity, the local price of electricity is under 5 US cents per kilowatt/hour. 'You can't build world scale generating capacity at that price and and make money,' said Mr J. Scott Swensen, senior portfolio manager at Scudder Latin American Trust for Independent Power. This trust, which has investment of Dollars 100m, was launched with the idea of generating some Dollars 500m from institutional investors. In Mexico, where the government has ostensibly allowed independently-financed power generation, the state electricity company has made life difficult for would-be private-sector investors. Mr Swensen says many investors are comfortable with Mexico and there is a big scope for large-scale investment in power generation there. There have been some recent signs of progress on the long-delayed 700MW Samalayuca II plant near the US border in the state of Chihuahua, south of El Paso, Texas. This envisaged a 20-year build, lease and transfer agreement, with plant to be owned by a consortium led by GE. Mr George Aguilera, general manager of GE Power Systems,Mexico, told a conference in January that he expected Mexico to add 18 gigawatts to its generating capacity over the next decade, with steam turbines accounting for nearly 55 per cent of orders. New generation orders in Brazil were expected to reach 22GW Argentina 11GW, Colombia 4.5GW and Venezuela nearly 10GW. He predicted that gas turbines would account for 45 per cent of the generation mix, with steam turbines steady at a little over 25 per cent and hydro installations a little under 30 per cent. Some, of these figures might seem too high. When generating capacity already under construction comes on stream in Argentina, for example, some observers think the country may even have an electricity surplus. Private refurbishing of existing plant has already generated important gains in capacity. With heavy rains helping hydro-electricity generation this year, prices fell to 4 US cents per kilowatt-hour. But it is not only in the large economies that private generating capacity is coming on stream. Two companies, Amoco and Southern Electric International, have just won a bid in Trinidad  Tobago to expand generation to the installed 1,100MW capacity. And even in countries where the overall pricing regime is not particularly investor-friendly, a growing number of stand-alone private projects aimed at generating electricity for a group of users is emerging. This seems particularly workable where the potential users have a foreign exchange generating capacity - it has been used in the Dominican Republic to provide power for a group of hotels. Overall, manufacturers of power generation equipment are enthusiastic about the prospects. Mr Aguilera of GE commented: 'Latin America and the Caribbean, when combined with the US and Canadian markets, make a potential trading bloc that could surpass the European common market, and more than hold its own against the emerging mega-market of Asia.'

SCEcorp, the parent of Southern California Edison, which provides power in the Los Angeles area, has been trying since 1988 to take over San Diego Gas and Electric in a deal valued at more than Dollars 2.8bn. SCEcorp can appeal against the regulators' veto, but it was unclear yesterday whether it would do so. The unanimous ruling by the California Public Utilities Commission follows its consideration of a 1,300-page report, published last February, which said the benefits of the merger would be outweighed by its negative impact on competition. The decision comes in the wake of several recent mergers in the widely fragmented power generation sector. Analysts have suggested this could be the start of a wave of takeover bids which would allow utilities to reap economies through pooling. The Californian PUC said it had ruled against the merger because the utilities had not proven that the deal would provide long-term net benefits for customers, and because it would have adverse effects on competition among utilities which transmit power or which sell in the open market the excess electricity they have generated.

It said the contract, estimated to be worth Pounds 12m annually, is the biggest and most comprehensive deal announced in the market for users of between 100 kilowatts and 1 megawatt. Eastern's shares rose 9 1/2 p to 674p, although part of the increase was attributable to its move this week to buy back some of its equity to boost earnings per share. From April the 45,000 England and Wales consumers of between 10kw and 1MW of electricity will for the first time be able to pick which company to take their supplies from. Previously they have been able to buy only from the monopoly distributor which supplies their region. The change will not affect the physical source of the electricity which is generated by separate companies. This is because suppliers trade rather than generate electricity. Virtually all of McDonald's stores fall into the 100kw to 1MW category. Mr Keith Smith, McDonald's chief building services engineer, said Eastern's offer would provide the company with savings of about Pounds 1.4m on its total UK bill, including franchise stores, of Pounds 18m.

By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC      SAN FRANCISCO      Cervantes sings again.    This time, however, the impossible dream bears no Broadway glitz. Don Quichotte  -- a.k.a. Quixote -- is tilting at distinctly operatic windmills in San  Francisco.    Jules Massenet's sugar-coated portrait of the eccentric man of la Mancha has  not fared particularly well in the opera house. Although ""Don Quichotte"" served  as a grateful vehicle for Feodor Chaliapin at the Monte Carlo premiere back in  1910, the opera has been revived only sporadically in the interim.    Basically, its survival in the repertory has depended on the whim of popular  bassos who want to be profondo in quest of romantic grotesquerie. Vanni Marcoux  actually eclipsed Chaliapin in the composer's favor as the protagonist. In  recent years, both Ruggero Raimondi and Nicolai Ghiaurov have triumphed in the  challenge. San Diego ventured ""Don Quichotte"" on behalf of the unforgettable  Norman Treigle in 1969, only to introduce a very young Michael Devlin in the  role when Treigle fell ill.    Now it is Samuel Ramey's turn. At the War Memorial Opera House on Sunday, the  American basso didn't attempt much of a character study. He pasted some  appropriate gray whiskers on his youthful face and donned a whispy wig.  Otherwise, he remained the handsome matinee idol to whom we have become  accustomed.    On the surface, his Don might just as well have been named Giovanni. One  expected him to proudly bare his hairy chest at any moment.    Ramey let us forget about the aging knight of the doleful countenance. He  conveyed little of the sublime madness that should illuminate the hero's  quixotic manners and quirky stances. He did convey essential dignity, however,  and he sang very nicely.    Sang very nicely? That is a ridiculous understatement.    Ramey sang beautifully. He sang magnificently.    He sang with firm, warm, rolling, even tone. He sang with ease that flagged at  neither range extreme, with extraordinary lyrical suavity and reasonable  dramatic point.    When the spirit moved him, he even sang softly. Muted dynamics have never been  a Ramey specialty. But here, in moments of ecstatic reflection, he floated  pianissimo tones that created their own aura of mystical pathos. It was a happy  revelation.    Any vocal performance of such quality would justify the exhumation of a work as  flawed as ""Don Quichotte."" Compounding good operatic fortune, San Francisco  managed to complement Ramey with two eminently worthy colleagues and a  remarkably sympathetic conductor.    Michel Trempont as the doggedly devoted Sancho Panca provided an ideal  counterforce -- dramatically earthy and musically elegant. He steadfastly  avoided comic caricature and, despite rather slender baritonal resources,  tugged the assembled heart-strings heftily in the climactic scena beginning  ""Ca, vous commetez tous un acte epouvantable.""    Last seen here as Waltraute, Katherine Ciesinski portrayed Dulcinee, the  mezzo-soprano vamp with a heart of gold and an abiding love of pearls. She sang  with vibrant insinuation and acted with alluring abandon that nearly validated  the inherent cliches.    In the well-staffed pit, Julius Rudel made Massenet's perfumed banalities sound  sensuous, urgent, even noble. This American conductor from Austria really knows  his way around the fragile French repertory.    It would be nice to report that San Francisco provided an appropriately  compelling theatrical framework. Unfortunately, the physical production turned  out to be a thing of shreds and patches.    The innocuous, painterly canvases were borrowed from Chicago. Pierluigi  Samaritani, the designer, demanded that his name be removed from the credits,  however, when numerous modifications distorted his original scenic vision. One  cannot blame him.    The all-purpose costumes, also attributed to no one, came from the warehouse of  the Opera de Marseilles, as did a monstrous, nightmarish puppet that rose in  the sky near the windmill -- breaching the quasi-realistic style of the  production in the process.    Another import from Marseilles was the stage director, Charles Roubaud. He  functioned primarily as a traffic cop.    Victoria Morgan's incidental dances looked like frantic exercises for some  ballet troupe gone a-slumming. The chorus, trained by Ian Robertson, made nice  noises and struck friendly poses.    The stage pictures certainly were stilted. At least they were pretty.    And so -- for all its sentimental vapidity -- was the music.

By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC      SAN FRANCISCO      Cervantes sings again.    This time, however, the impossible dream bears no Broadway glitz. Don Quichotte  -- a.k.a. Quixote -- is tilting at distinctly operatic windmills in San  Francisco.    Jules Massenet's sugar-coated portrait of the eccentric man of la Mancha has  not fared particularly well in the opera house. Although ""Don Quichotte"" served  as a grateful vehicle for Feodor Chaliapin at the Monte Carlo premiere back in  1910, the opera has been revived only sporadically in the interim.    Basically, its survival in the repertory has depended on the whim of popular  bassos who want to be profondo in quest of romantic grotesquerie. Vanni Marcoux  actually eclipsed Chaliapin in the composer's favor as the protagonist. In  recent years, both Ruggero Raimondi and Nicolai Ghiaurov have triumphed in the  challenge. San Diego ventured ""Don Quichotte"" on behalf of the unforgettable  Norman Treigle in 1969, only to introduce a very young Michael Devlin in the  role when Treigle fell ill.    Now it is Samuel Ramey's turn. At the War Memorial Opera House on Sunday, the  American basso didn't attempt much of a character study. He pasted some  appropriate gray whiskers on his youthful face and donned a whispy wig.  Otherwise, he remained the handsome matinee idol to whom we have become  accustomed.    On the surface, his Don might just as well have been named Giovanni. One  expected him to proudly bare his hairy chest at any moment.    Ramey let us forget about the aging knight of the doleful countenance. He  conveyed little of the sublime madness that should illuminate the hero's  quixotic manners and quirky stances. He did convey essential dignity, however,  and he sang very nicely.    Sang very nicely? That is a ridiculous understatement.    Ramey sang beautifully. He sang magnificently.    He sang with firm, warm, rolling, even tone. He sang with ease that flagged at  neither range extreme, with extraordinary lyrical suavity and reasonable  dramatic point.    When the spirit moved him, he even sang softly. Muted dynamics have never been  a Ramey specialty. But here, in moments of ecstatic reflection, he floated  pianissimo tones that created their own aura of mystical pathos. It was a happy  revelation.    Any vocal performance of such quality would justify the exhumation of a work as  flawed as ""Don Quichotte."" Compounding good operatic fortune, San Francisco  managed to complement Ramey with two eminently worthy colleagues and a  remarkably sympathetic conductor.    Michel Trempont as the doggedly devoted Sancho Panca provided an ideal  counterforce -- dramatically earthy and musically elegant. He steadfastly  avoided comic caricature and, despite rather slender baritonal resources,  tugged the assembled heart-strings heftily in the climactic scena beginning  ""Ca, vous commetez tous un acte epouvantable.""    Last seen here as Waltraute, Katherine Ciesinski portrayed Dulcinee, the  mezzo-soprano vamp with a heart of gold and an abiding love of pearls. She sang  with vibrant insinuation and acted with alluring abandon that nearly validated  the inherent cliches.    In the well-staffed pit, Julius Rudel made Massenet's perfumed banalities sound  sensuous, urgent, even noble. This American conductor from Austria really knows  his way around the fragile French repertory.    It would be nice to report that San Francisco provided an appropriately  compelling theatrical framework. Unfortunately, the physical production turned  out to be a thing of shreds and patches.    The innocuous, painterly canvases were borrowed from Chicago. Pierluigi  Samaritani, the designer, demanded that his name be removed from the credits,  however, when numerous modifications distorted his original scenic vision. One  cannot blame him.    The all-purpose costumes, also attributed to no one, came from the warehouse of  the Opera de Marseilles, as did a monstrous, nightmarish puppet that rose in  the sky near the windmill -- breaching the quasi-realistic style of the  production in the process.    Another import from Marseilles was the stage director, Charles Roubaud. He  functioned primarily as a traffic cop.    Victoria Morgan's incidental dances looked like frantic exercises for some  ballet troupe gone a-slumming. The chorus, trained by Ian Robertson, made nice  noises and struck friendly poses.    The stage pictures certainly were stilted. At least they were pretty.    And so -- for all its sentimental vapidity -- was the music.

0,FT924-8904 ,"FT924-8904 _AN-CKIBWABFFT 921109   FT  09 NOV 92 / Watchdog bitten by both sides: A regulator caught in the coal battle crossfire      By DAVID LASCELLES   PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, finds himself caught in the crossfire of the battle over coal, and he may not escape unscathed. If the harrying he received at a Commons inquiry last week is anything to go by, he is in for a rough time and could even, some observers speculate, be edged out of a job. MPs from both sides of the House accused him of dragging his feet, copping out and taking a blinkered view of his responsibilities. The clash exposed sharply conflicting views of the role of the regulator. Many MPs had hoped that Prof Littlechild, with his powerful position in the electricity industry, could provide a convenient solution to the coal crisis by forcing electricity generators to burn more coal or by cancelling their plans to build gas-fired power stations. But Prof Littlechild takes a different view. He has stuck doggedly to his position that his statutory responsibility is to protect the electricity consumer and not the coal industry. He has repeatedly stressed that his brief does not run to saving miners' jobs, let alone dictating where power stations should be built or what sort of fuel they should use. 'Responsibility for the closures lies with the secretary of state and British Coal,' he says simply. That was typical of the professor of commerce at Birmingham University who has headed Offer, the Office of Electricity Regulation, since it was formed in 1989. He is an outright free-marketeer who was selected for the job by the Thatcher government because of his belief that competition would foster the most efficient power industry. While he sympathises with those who would be hurt by the threatened pit closures, he does not intend to intervene. He does not believe that the Electricity Act, which lays out his responsibilities, authorises him to do so. People who know Prof Littlechild well do not doubt the firmness of his beliefs - which raises the questions of whether he has become an obstacle to a political solution to the coal crisis. Based in Birmingham, Prof Littlechild can afford to be remote from the political process. He has not even met Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who is grappling with the coal problem, though for some people this is a welcome sign of his independence. However, he is not totally insulated from politics. He has already said that he will bring forward an inquiry which he is conducting into the relative merits of gas and coal so that the results can be fed into Mr Heseltine's policy review. He has also appointed an assessor to see whether electricity generators are unfairly shutting down coal-fired stations. Prof Littlechild stands in the government's way in another sense. One possibility for boosting coal would be to delay the deregulation of the electricity industry and slow the growth of other fuels such as gas. But Prof Littlechild is not only personally committed to seeing the deregulation process through, he maintains that the Electricity Act obliges him to do so. So any change in the regulatory timetable would require a big shift in his position, or new legislation. In either case, he might well have to go. The government's mishandling of electricity privatisation and the resulting distortions in the power market have raised serious doubts about the value of his role. There are widespread complaints about rising prices, monopoly practices in the generating industry and exorbitant pay for electricity company executives. If Prof Littlechild has to be sacrificed on the altar of coal, it is hard to see who would run to his rescue. One idea that is gaining popularity among MPs is an Energy Commission to set energy policy and oversee the regulators. This would oblige the regulators to adhere to a government line rather than acting independently. 'It is clear that MPs would prefer a more interventionist approach,' says Mr John Wilson, utilities analyst at UBS Phillips  Drew, the securities house. He believes that investors may be nervous about electricity shares legislation may be changed. Prof Littlechild is also unpopular with MPs because they think he is in effect making policy decisions which impinge on the lives of millions - in fact, usurping parliament's role. That may be so, but it is not necessarily something for which Prof Littlechild can be blamed. The job of electricity regulator is the result of the government's policy in the late 1980s to phase out state intervention in the energy industry and to appoint an independent figure to protect the consumer. Now, that arrangement has become inconvenient for Westminster. The government finds that it needs a policy to save coal, but the regulator says that is none of his affair.

However let us hope that moves to introduce more competition take account of the grave defects of energy deregulation as witnessed in the UK since electricity privatisation. The UK experience has seen the introduction of a system that gave the generators a broad portfolio of generating plant but no guaranteed market, and the regional electric companies secure markets but no plant. The commercial decisions that stemmed from this - the dash for gas - effectively did for the UK coal industry because, although in the main cheaper than gas, the generators' mark-up rendered purchase from this source by the regional electricity companies unattractive. Valuable coal resources and coal generating plant have been squandered on the back of this policy to the detriment of the consumer. Similarly, let us hope that any moves to greater energy price transparency in the European Union allows for equal treatment between fuels, as compared to the UK situation where the government's regime provides a substantial and anti-competitive subsidy to nuclear energy through the non-fossil fuel levy. Indeed, this leads to the sad fact that the UK purchases French nuclear electricity at substantially higher costs to the consumer than would be the case without the non-fossil fuel levy.

Power Shortages: An Opportunity for Electric Power  Development in the West    China's power shortages have continued for many years, and  in  particular, since a new round of rapid economic development  began, the sluggishness of the electric power industry has  become increasingly serious.    When the state announced the policy decision that the  country's energy development strategy should shift toward the  West, the party committee and government of the Nei Monggol  Autonomous Region wasted no time in setting the guidelines of  making coal-fired power production the pace-setter and having  the power industry stimulate both coal industry development and  the comprehensive development of the economy. Nei Monggol has  proved coal resources of 217.4 billion tons, and its long-term  reserves may exceed 1.2 trillion tons. In both these respects,  it is second in the country. It has 15 coal fields with reserves  of more than 5 billion tons; the Ordos coal field has coal  reserves equivalent to 10 percent of the national total and is  the largest of the world's seven major coal fields. Nei Monggol  has abundant water resources: the Yellow River, the Ergun River,  Daihai Lake and Huangqihai Lake are all within its boundaries.  The Yellow River flows through the large Wuhai, Dongsheng, and  Junggar coal fields. There are 17 locations that are suitable  for the construction of power plants with capacities of 1  million kW or more, with a total potential capacity of 35.47  million kW. Nei Monggol's territory spans the ""three northern""  regions; it is near industrially developed regions that are  relatively resource-poor, and electric power markets in such  areas as Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, and  Heilongjiang offer extensive prospects.    The question of whether to ship coal or transmit energy has  been aggravated by the contradiction between rail transport and  haulage capacity. But the problem is becoming better understood  and views are maturing. In large-scale development of the  electric power industry, the changeover to local resource  conversion and from hauled coal to transmitted electricity will  both decrease the pressure on the railroads and realize the  objectives of a short construction cycle, low costs, and good  benefits.    Party secretary of the autonomous region Wang Qun [3769  5028]  has repeatedly emphasized that ""If the development of the energy  industry can be done rapidly, it should not be done slowly, and  if it can be done at a run it should not be done at a walk. We  must make electric power lead the way, replace coal with  electricity, have the coal industry stimulate the power  industry, export more electric power outside the province, and  convert resource advantages into economic advantages."" As a  result, the silent expanses of Mongolia have become the scene of  bustling activity in the construction of an electric power base.    Between 1988 and 1992, the region expended a total of 3.389  billion yuan to fund electric power construction. It installed  1.5098 million kW of new generating capacity, representing an  average increase of 30 percent a year. Its total installed  generating capacity has reached 4.103 million kW, and it has  built 793 km of 220-kV transmission lines. In the western zone,  the framework of a superhigh-voltage grid running eastward from  Wulashan to Datong has been built, and power lines have been  connected to the North China power grid and have been put into  operation. In five years, a total of 81.787 billion kWh of  electricity has been produced, yielding a profits tax of more  than 1.6 billion yuan.    Major electric power construction projects spread like  wildfire, and ""sun cities"" sprang up across the land. In the  course of five years, three 100,000-kW generating sets were  added at Baotou, and the installed capacity at the Fengzhen  power plant in the floodplain of the Yinma River reached 600,000  kW. The construction of the first stage of the Junggar power  plant, with two 100,000-kW generating sets, has been completed.  Work on the expansion of facilities at Hohhot, Yuanbaoshan,  Tongliao, and Huiliuhe and on new construction projects at  Haibowan, Yimin, Huolinhe, Youzhong, and Dalad has been whipped  up to a superhigh pace. Magnificent blueprints for 17 large  power plants with capacities of 100,000 kW or more have been  issued.    In the first six months of this year, Nei Monggol's electric  power industry has experienced four gratifying events: a total  output of 567.5 billion kWh and the transmission of 954 million  kWh of electricity to North China, representing increases of  13.8 and 17.04 percent respectively over last year; payment of  255 million yuan in profits taxes, up 14.14 percent from the  previous year; 80-percent implementation of 2.5 billion yuan in  investment funds; and the signing of 13 equipment delivery  contracts, representing a total of 4.6 million kW of capacity.    Benefitting From Policies, and Using Others' Funds for Power  Production    Under a planned economy, the electric power industry  receives  centralized state investments for construction, prices are  specified centrally by the state, and output, distribution and  sales are controlled by government departments. As a result,  very large investments are inherently unmanageable, the prices  charged for electricity do not reflect production costs, the  enterprises take on increasing debt, and investment capabilities  are, in essence, lost. Nei Monggol's economic strength was  limited, and even in the best years, the local financial  departments could only squeeze out 30 or 40 million yuan in  funds for electric power.    In 1988, the leadership of the Nei Monggol Electric Power  Management Office signed an eight-year funding and production  agreement with the government of the autonomous region. This  broke the stereotype of having exclusive government control of  power production and began a new practice of independent  operations, ""having those who pay the money produce the power  and receive the benefits,"" with unified creditor's rights. The  contract specified that the profits paid annually to the finance  organs would be entirely returned in the form of investments in  electric power construction; it instituted new prices for new  power generating facilities and new heat supply facilities; and  those who used external funding for power production were not  only to receive favorable consideration in state policies, but  in addition would be given special consideration in taxation,  land use, and the like. When this policy was announced,  investors appeared in droves. In the last several years, they  have established reliable investment partnership ties with a  multitude of domestic financial groups and enterprises, as well  as more than 10 countries and regions.    The leadership of the Nei Monggol Electric Power Management  Office further liberated its thinking by expanding funding  channels. Cause for encouragement is the fact that this April,  leaders from Beijing City and the Ministry of Electric Power  personally visited Nei Monggol to discuss arrangements for the  provision of electricity to the capital. For many years Beijing  has been short of electric power, and power cutoffs and cutbacks  are a frequent occurrence. This fact not only imposed serious  constraints on Beijing's economic development and caused great  inconvenience to the masses, but was also inconsistent with  Beijing's status as the capital. On 23 April, the three parties  signed a joint power generation agreement, whose first stage is  about to begin. According to the agreement, by 1995 Beijing will  have made contributions totaling 1.55 billion yuan, the  installed generating capacity in Nei Monggol's western power  grid will have increased from 1.835 million kW to 4 million kW,  and the amount of electricity that it supplies to Beijing will  have increased from 1.1 to 1.5 million kW, so that Beijing will  no longer experience power shutoffs. The second stage will begin  in 1996, and by the end of the Ninth 5-Year Plan, the installed  capacity of Nei Monggol's western power grid will reach 12  million kW, enabling it to supply 5 million kW of electricity  per year to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region.    Will Electric Power Become the West's ""Radiant Center""?    China's electric power industry bears a heavy burden and has  a long road to travel. This year, the Nei Monggol Autonomous  Region party committee repeatedly emphasized the guiding ideas  in accelerating power industry development. The Nei Monggol  Electric Power Management Office drafted objectives and measures  for the period through the end of the century in order to make  electric power construction the ""radiant center"" that will bring  prosperity to the western region.    -- Make reform increasingly thorough, transform the  mechanism, move toward markets, strengthen management, stabilize  existing power generating facilities, implement capital  construction investments of 1.83 billion yuan, commission  374,000 kW of generating capacity, and carry on effective  preparatory work for new power plant construction.    -- Make thorough use of advantages in resources, location,  and policy, develop funding channels, attract large amounts of  domestic and foreign construction investment.    -- Jointly with large domestic power production groups, use  such flexible and diverse forms as equipment investment  partnerships to obtain domestically produced equipment.  Concurrently, appoint experts to be responsible for obtaining  equipment from the west and from Russia. Implement mutual  guarantees for coal supply, power production, and transport,  unite with organizations that use electricity to produce steel  and aluminum, and assure that materials are delivered on time.    The objectives are as follows: add 4.5 million kW of new  generating capacity in the region by the end of the Eighth  5-Year Plan, with the total installed capacity reaching 8.25  million kW, and deliver 1.5 million kW of electricity to North  China and 2.3 million kW to Northeast China; by the year 2000,  bring the total installed generating capacity in the region to  21.369 million kW and deliver 5 million kW to North China and  6.5 million kW to Northeast China.    A Japanese economist exclaimed in amazement that China is  implementing a ""concentric circle"" strategy in its energy  economy. As he expressed it, the Ordos is the inner circle,  which will be the first to produce an effect and also the pivot  which will receive the benefits first. The second circle, which  radiates outward for 200 km, will constitute Nei Monggol's  central economic region. Finally, using the world's most  advanced technology, electric power will be transmitted outward  over a radius of 1000 km. These radiating circles will thus  encompass the central region, representing a third of China's  area. Thus the radiating segments of circles or ""gradient  circles"" produced by the relatively developed coastal regions  will advance circle by circle into the interior, and the  resource-rich great northwestern region will radiate its  powerful electricity outwards in expanding circles. Ultimately,  when the two sets of radiating circles coalesce into a network,  the differences between northern and southern China and between  eastern and western China will shrink rapidly.     "

The company has a 50 per cent stake in the 1,875MW plant which is the largest combined heat and power station in the world. The glittering high-tech plant is a powerful symbol of the electricity industry's 'dash-for-gas', the rush to replace coal-fired power with gas. Its four equity partners - Midlands, Northern, South Western and South Wales regional electricity companies - have agreed to buy most of the power to supply their domestic customers. 'Projects like these help us and the other regional electricity companies to keep prices in check,' said Mr David Jones, chief executive of South Wales Electricity, who is also chairman of Teesside Power, the company that will run the power plant. Imperial Chemical Industries has also agreed to buy 257MW of the electricity. In addition, waste gases from the combined cycle gas turbine plant will provide all the steam required by ICI's nearby Wilton facility. The fully computerised power station employs just 65 people compared with 650 workers at a similar coal-fired plant. It covers 23 acres - just a fraction of the 800 acres occupied by a coal plant with the same power output. Mr Jones said that Teesside would save 9m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year - it emits half the carbon dioxide of a coal plant. The plant's sulphur emissions are negligible and it produces one-ninth of the nitrous oxide waste.   Companies:-  Enron Corp.     Midlands Electricity.     Northern Electric.

0,FT942-8778 ,"FT942-8778 _AN-EESCVABHFT 940519   FT  19 MAY 94 / Power investors near deals in India      By STEFAN WAGSTYL      NEW DELHI   India's bid to attract private investment into the power industry is about to bear fruit with promoters of four projects together worth about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) close to signing financing agreements. Mr N. Ramji, joint secretary in the power ministry, said yesterday financing deals could be signed in the next 'one or two months' for the schemes, which could produce about 1520MW of electricity. The projects are the most advanced of a total of 75 schemes in which private investors, including foreign groups, have expressed interest. India opened the industry to new private investment in 1992 as part of its economic liberalisation programme. Commercial negotiations have been complex because the government is permitting investment, principally in power generation and not, generally, in distribution which remains in the hands of 17 state-level electricity boards. Operating under the influence of local politicians, state electricity boards have been notorious for under-charging politically-favoured groups and not paying their bills. Potential investors have pressed central government for guarantees of payment in the event of a default by an electricity board. Delhi has reluctantly agreed to guarantee payment in the event of default by either the electricity board or the relevant state government. The first project to get the guarantee is a 695MW plant to be built in the western state of Maharashtra by Enron, a US energy group, General Electric of the US, which will supply equipment, and local partners. Enron originally planned a Dollars 3bn 2000MW plant but has divided the project into stages. The other companies expected to complete financing arrangements soon are GVK Industries, an Indian mini-conglomerate, and ABB, the European engineering combine, which plan a 235MW station in the central state of Andhra Pradesh; Spectrum Power Generation of the US which plans a 200MW station also in Andhra Pradesh; and AES, a US generating group, which wants to build a 420MW coal-based station in Orissa state. Mr Ramji said three other investor groups had also secured government approval - Ashok Leyland, a diversified company controlled by the London-based Hinduja trading family, and National Power of the UK, which plan a 1,000MW station in Andra Pradesh; Cogentrix of the US with a 1,000MW project in Haryana, near Delhi, and ST Power Systems and CMS of the US which have proposed a 750MW station in Tamil Nadu.

The report is one of the harshest attacks on the two electricity generators since their privatisation last March. BZW forecasts pre-tax profits of only Pounds 250m for National Power by the year ending March 1994, compared with Pounds 500m for the 12 months to March 1992. For PowerGen, the brokers anticipate a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 340m to Pounds 170m over the same period. The report expects earnings per share for both companies to almost halve over the two years, and dividends to decline from 9p to 7.2p at National Power and from 9.2p to 7.7p at PowerGen. BZW believes the main reason for the squeeze on profits will be increased competition and tighter regulation in the mid-1990s and says shares in both companies should be sold. 'The shares do not reflect the possible length or depth of a profits downturn from 1994,' BZW warns. The stockbroker believes both companies' shares are overvalued by a third relative to the market. The generators face the threat of an oversupplied market as new generators come on stream in the mid-1990s. Although they are currently protected by contracts to sell electricity put into place at privatisation, these will expire in March 1993. Then, BZW forecasts, the market will be oversupplied and returns will fall. A second threat is Offer, the electricity watchdog. 'Offer is intent on realising the benefits of competition in generation,' BZW says. The stockbrokers expect Offer to be tougher than investors anticipate, and prevent the generators from artificially boosting electricity prices by closing power stations to tighten supply. Offer will force the generators to offer these stations to their competitors, BZW believes. National Power/PowerGen: Profits Under Pressure, BZW Research.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

0,FT944-14916 ,"FT944-14916 _AN-EJTEUAGGFT 941020   FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (5): Operations to be combined - The regional electricity companies      By MICHAEL SMITH   All 14 electricity distribution companies on mainland Britain and PowerGen and National Power, the generation companies, proudly boast their own gas supply arms. Some will undoubtedly make a success of them. But it is highly unlikely that all 16 companies will still be involved in what is certain to be a fiercely competitive market by the end of the decade. A few are expected to withdraw within the next year or so, particularly if the government delays full competition in gas beyond 1998. Few, if any, companies are likely to lose large sums of money since setting up gas trading teams, often of half a dozen people or less, has not entailed significant investment. But companies which withdraw will have to explain why a diversification that seemed too attractive to miss two years ago has failed to deliver its promise. The initial attractions were plain enough. The recent regulatory review of the regional companies distribution businesses underlined the perceived need from the City and elsewhere for power companies to develop a range of businesses which can make money in competitive and therefore unregulated markets. The companies certainly have the means to be able to diversify. All the regional distributors and the generators either have cash surpluses or low borrowings. The problem for them is to do so without arousing doubts among investors about whether they are capable of managing the non-power businesses they grow or acquire. The gas supply business has proved a lure because of its similarities and potential synergies with electricity. The regional companies have long experience of operating in a low margin trading business and have developed energy trading expertise which can be used in supplying gas. In many cases, the customers to whom they sell gas will be the same as those who buy their power. Electricity companies can make use of their brand name and the knowledge they have of the customers to improve their marketing. Some have merged their gas and electricity sales teams. Billing systems can be merged and, as technology develops, metering equipment can be shared. There are also synergies with companies' generation arms. SG Warburg Securities regional electricity companies with gas-fired generation - that is all of them except Manweb - should be able to 'swing' between gas generation and gas supply. This, it says, should reduce the risk of over-contracting and potentially increase operating margins as a result of seasonal demand. Kleinwort Benson makes a similar point about National Power and PowerGen in a recent research document. 'By developing a gas marketing business and a combined heat and power operations, which uses gas to drive operations, a generator has three alternative sources for any gas it buys including its own gas-fired power stations. This enables it selectively to target its supplies of gas, attaining the highest margins possible.' PowerGen was one of the first electricity companies to enter the competitive gas market after setting up a joint venture, Kinetica, with Conoco in 1990. In 1993-4, Kinetica, contributed Pounds 8m to PowerGen's pre-tax profits on sales of Pounds 130m. Among the distribution companies, Midlands Electricity was the first to move into gas marketing in August 1991. It has a 75:25 joint venture, Midlands Gas, with Utilicorp and is generally considered to be one of the strongest emerging players in the market. Utilicorp also has joint ventures with Norweb, Scottish Power, Seeboard, Sweb and Eastern. Northern Gas, the Norweb joint venture, recently announced plans to set up a national gas marketing company. Total is among other overseas companies involved with regional electricity companies; it has joint ventures with London and Yorkshire. Marathon Oil  Gas has a joint venture with Hydro-Electric. The companies with most commitment to gas are those which have gone upstream. This summer Eastern Electricity bought a 6 per cent stake in the Johnson North Sea oil field, having previously agreed to buy its entire output. Northern Electric, the last regional electricity company to move into gas supply, created an upstream gas venture with Neste of Finland and has a stake in the Victor field. Yorkshire has 7 per cent of the Armada gas field, which it bought for Pounds 27m from Amerada Hess. The aim of those companies moving upstream is to develop integrated gas businesses. Analysts believe that if the going gets tough these companies will be the last to pull out of gas supply simply because they will have to find other markets in which to sell the gas they are producing. Most believe that the going will get tough. Kevin Lapwood, analyst at Smith New Court, says the regional electricity companies' gas businesses have not lived up to expectations. 'When the market first opened up it was money for old rope, because British Gas was under pressure to give up market share,' says Mr Lapwood. 'But as the market opened up further the competition got tougher. Nobody is losing much money yet but, with margins so thin, there are quite a few companies who are unlikely to make much.' SG Warburg believes that margins could be as low as 1 per cent when the market is opened up fully. 'This could threaten some regional electric companies' continued involvement in gas, given the long wait for deregulation, of the high margin domestic market,' says analyst Nick Pink. The two main risks, says Warburg , are bad debts and failing to sell all the gas bought from a supplier to an end-user. That, in turn, could result in a distressed sale.

Many industrial plants are being forced to cut production, and New Zealanders have been warned they may soon have to work a four-day week to conserve dwindling power. One of the biggest users, Comalco, owner of the big Bluff aluminium plant, has already cut electricity consumption drastically, and is likely to get compensation from the government. Comalco is considering the expensive option of closing a third of its capacity. Electricorp, the national power utility, has been forced to bring two thermal stations, one coal and the other oil-fired, back into production. At one such station the state-owned corporation had to rehire workers whom it had made redundant less than three weeks before. Domestic customers are already having their power cut for several hours a day, with the electricity system stretched to the limit as North Island gas, hydroelectricity, and geothermal generating stations are run at full capacity to try to replace the South Island's shortfall. Mr Jim Bolger, the prime minister, has castigated Electricorp for not preparing the public for the crisis, which he says is doing immense damage by cutting industrial output as the economy is struggling to emerge from recession. At present legislation charges state-owned corporations with maximising revenues.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "
0,FT932-3264 ,"FT932-3264 _AN-DFOCRAEGFT 930615   FT  15 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: East Midlands Electricity   Deciding to borrow Pounds 150m at an interest rate of 12 per cent near the top of the interest rate cycle looks pretty rum, even without the benefit of hindsight. Doubly so when the Eurobond in question now accounts for more than East Midlands' total net debt and the company is locked into the deal for 25 years. Sadly, the financing decision is typical of East Midlands' accident-prone progress outside its mainstream electricity business - most notably in the poorly performing contracting and retailing operations. It must be some relief to shareholders that prospects in coal mining are now so poor that East Midlands has all but abandoned its ambitions there. The basic electricity business is a gift which the most inept management would find difficult to destroy. But regulatory reviews will squeeze returns. Supply generates little profit, so Offer's current review should not dent share prices. The subsequent distribution review is more important. Attempts to massage profits down by retaining costs are unlikely to fool Offer, so East Midlands' decision to cut now looks sensible. Still, even if the average regional electricity company's price cap is tightened from RPI+1.5 to RPI-6, the RECs generally could still probably manage annual dividend increases of 8 per cent between 1995 and 2000. Much of that, however, would be at the expense of dividend cover.

The increases, to be staggered over 36 months, will cover residential, commercial and industrial subscribers. The cost of electricity is a big political issue in Venezuela, even though rates are relatively cheap compared with the rest of the world. In March President Carlos Andres Perez ordered a temporary freeze on planned price increases because of political pressure following an attempted coup d'etat in February. The government has not released details of the price rises, but officials said they involved 'very small' monthly increments. The rises should boost the government's flagging privatisation programme - several electric power companies are due to be sold this year and next. They should also improve the inflation-hit profits outlook for Venezuelan power companies; the country's largest private electricity utility, La Electricidad de Caracas, recently announced an indefinite suspension of dividends due to the rate freeze. Mr Alirio Parra, minister of energy and mines, said the increases were intended to reduce the large gap between residential and commercial power rates. For many years Venezuelan industry and commerce have been subsidising residential consumption by paying higher prices. The minister stressed that, even when the new rates were effective, Venezuela's power costs would continue to rank among the lowest in the world.  The Financial Times   International Page 4  "

0,FT924-4848 ,"FT924-4848 _AN-CLACAAB8FT 921201   FT  01 DEC 92 / ICI grapples with electricity price riddle: How setting the level is more complicated than solving the Rubik cube      By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY   AT 4 O'CLOCK every afternoon, senior managers at ICI's Runcorn complex start a computer game that takes them well into the evening and produces a forecast for the next day's electricity price. Only when it is over can they determine whether ICI can afford to make chlorine in the next 24 hours. The data is no more accurate than a weather forecast. This unpredictability over the price of the vast quantity of power the complex uses - 1 per cent of all the UK's electricity consumption - has caused ICI to consider quitting its UK chlorine business, putting 7,000 jobs at risk. ICI's protests are echoed by other large-scale electricity users in the steel, glass and cement industries, as well as other chemicals companies. Chlorine is basic to the solvents and plastics sector of the chemicals industry. The chlor-chemicals industry is already under pressure for environmental reasons. Chlorine is dangerous and the regulations for making and using it are tight and getting tighter. ICI has reduced discharges of liquid chlorinated hydrocarbons into the Weston Canal at Runcorn by 80 per cent in the past five years but must reduce them from the present 45 tonnes a year to under 18 tonnes by the mid-1990s. It is allowed to emit 10,000 tonnes of gases into the atmosphere - 20 per cent down on 1987 levels - but these must be reduced to just 700 tonnes in the same period. ICI says it can afford the Pounds 50m needed to meet these targets only if profitability is restored to levels before electricity privatisation. The price ICI pays for electricity may vary unpredictably every half hour - it pays the price bid by the last electricity generating station needed to meet demand for that half-hour slot in the day. If the weather becomes colder and demand for electricity rises, the price may shoot up beyond expectations. Since ICI never knows what it has to pay until after it has consumed the power, it is crucial for managers to second-guess the forecast as closely as possible so they can shut down plant before getting caught out. To complicate forecasting, Britain's 50 power stations can, the next day, put in one of three bid prices for each set of generating equipment. Each station may have as many as four sets, making 12 potential prices from each of them every half hour. A surcharge may also apply: some stations may have to run because distribution problems at any particular moment might mean inadequate local supplies if they did not. Mr Ken Green, commercial manager of ICI's energy policy and purchasing department, says this is the electricity generators' 'open chequebook' on prices. Mr Green, a chartered electrical engineer, is in charge of trying to master Britain's electricity pricing system for ICI, but says the mathematics have so far proved beyond computer-assisted brainpower. 'We are constantly trying to second-guess the workings of a very complicated algorithm,' he says. 'The Rubik Cube was an algorithm. I worked out the rules and could eventually do it in about three minutes. 'I wish I could do the same with the formula for pricing electricity. We have computer programs to help us and still we can't develop any proper logicality.' Mr Bryan Bulloch, power services manager at Runcorn, who has prepared the company's evidence on the issue to two Commons committees, values the chlor-chemicals sector's home and export markets at Pounds 750m a year each. If ICI abandoned chlorine production to foreign competition, the overall impact on the UK balance of trade would be Pounds 1.5bn. Before electricity was privatised, ICI paid about Pounds 20 per megawatt-hour (MWh). Average costs this year will average more than Pounds 31 per MWh. About Pounds 30m of exports have been turned away because ICI cannot afford to run plant long enough to meet demand and profits are Pounds 20m down in spite of rigorous cost-cutting. Under German competition law, ICI cannot divulge how much it pays for electricity for its similar, but smaller scale operations in Wilhelmshaven, northern Germany, but a figure of Pounds 25 per MWH was inadvertently confirmed as approximately right by Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymer, earlier this month. To achieve that, ICI has to guarantee running the plant at 95 per cent capacity to keep its contribution to overall energy demand predictable. It will come off-load in cold weather to help electricity generators cope with surges. Mr Green says similar bargains cannot be struck in Britain. 'We should be able to bring to the negotiating table virtues such as load factor, load-shedding capability, size, long-term commitment and a willingness to take or pay whether we use all the electricity or not. 'But there is no negotiating table. The generators tell us the price and we have to take it or leave it.' The consequences of imposed, variable prices are an engineering nightmare for Mr Bulloch and his colleagues. Mr Bulloch says the government believes that 90 per cent of industrial electricity users are paying less than before privatisation, while big users such as ICI are merely whining. He says any company using less than 10 MW has gained, but the volume discounts for big users - Runcorn's demand is about 250 MW - have disappeared in favour of everyone having to pay the same price at any given time of day. The big users are all in strategic industries. ICI believes discounts should be available for large users once they pass a negotiable threshold, calculated so that even the most heavily discounted price would never be subsidised. Negotiation would match the lowest discounted price to the lowest profitable marginal price available locally, so as not to cause distribution problems. ICI Runcorn is less than five miles from Fiddler's Ferry, a 2,000 MW old-established plant producing cheap electricity from competitively-priced coal. At present, the marginal price of electricity to individual industrial users goes up as national demand rises. ICI's argument is that any large individual user should be encouraged to use more by paying less per unit for increasing volumes once a reasonable threshold has been cleared. This, Mr Bulloch says, is the commercial reality of any normal marketplace. But British bulk electricity markets are not normal. Mr Green says they are not even markets. There is no mutuality of self-interest between suppliers and large consumers, so no incentive to the suppliers - generators and distributors - to give ground as they operate what ICI says is, in effect, a monopoly.

With the ESR, we have developed an  advanced experimental research vehicle that, through the  implementation of revolutionary new technology, realizes a  superior combination of these factors.    The ESR uses a high-efficiency compact electric generating  plant -- composed of batteries, an electric motor, an engine,  and an electricity generator. This system gives the ESR an  energy consumption rate superior to either combustion engines or  conventional electric vehicles.    ESR employs the Series Hybrid Electric system, with which  the  vehicle is always driven by an electric motor. The Series Hybrid  Electric system is known as the most efficient among hybrid  systems with two driving modes. The first is battery-operated  mode, in which batteries supply energy to an electric motor.  This driving mode has zero emissions. Second is hybrid mode, in  which an on-board electric generating plant supplies power to  the electric motor when the batteries run low.    Energy Savings  Clean Air    -- A compact, lightweight AC induction motor and motor  controllers assure highly efficient motor operation with  excellent response at low and high speeds.    -- The 1.5-litre petrol engine developed specifically for  generating electricity incorporates the optimized inner cylinder  gas flow technology that is the base of our MVV (Mitsubishi  Vertical Vortex) engine. This water-cooled in-line 4-cylinder  engine has a high expansion-ratio cycle. The engine runs at a  constant speed to achieve both high efficiency and the cleanest  possible exhaust emissions.    -- A highly-efficient, light, and compact AC generator has  been adopted. Also, a turbo generator has been employed to  convert exhaust energy into electricity.    -- An energy regenerative brake system is available to  convert the vehicle's kinetic energy into electricity to charge  the batteries. In addition, solar cells are built into the roof  to generate electricity from sunlight.    -- Assisted by Mitsubishi Motors' proprietary navigation  system, ESR will always operate in Battery-operated Mode in  areas near hospitals and schools to achieve zero exhaust  emissions. The electrically heated catalyst system achieves  ultra-low exhaust emissions even in Hybrid Mode.       Mobility    -- The adoption of highly efficient alkaline batteries, a  lightweight body design, and reduction of drag and rolling  resistance make a range of 500 km or more possible in  Battery-operated Mode.

The union said the mental effort and communication skills in clerical jobs were comparable with the physical effort and working conditions of manual jobs. Electricity supply companies have conceded the union claim in a series of cases taken to industrial tribunals, producing Pounds 70,000 in back pay for applicants. In the move from national to company bargaining, the union has also negotiated new grading structures to give clerical workers equal pay with manual workers.

Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday that subsidies, budgeted at just under Pounds 20m this year, will be concentrated on key technologies which are environmentally acceptable and have good prospects of commercial exploitation. He mentioned solar power, wind power, fuel cells and energy from coppice (managed woodlands) and waste. But he said that other sources would cease to be subsidised when current commitments expire because of their limited commercial potential. These are tidal power, wave power and geothermal research. The renewable energy sources must contribute to diverse, secure and sustainable energy supplies, to reductions in the emission of pollutants and the encouragement of internationally competitive industries. Mr Eggar's statement on renewable energy strategy, which reaffirmed the government's goal of creating 1,500MW of renewable energy capacity by the year 2000, came in response to the 1992 report of the Renewable Energy Advisory Group which assessed Britain's capacity to produce electricity from 'green' sources. Mr Eggar said the main vehicle for promoting renewable energy was the non-fossil-fuel (NFFO) programme which subsidises electricity companies for buying electricity generated by fuels other than oil, gas and coal. The government is considering bids from renewable energy projects for the next round of NFFO contracts. Mr Eggar stressed, however, that the purpose of the NFFO was to draw in private funds, which he expected to total Pounds 3bn by 2000.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-3519 ,"FT942-3519 _AN-EFND1AGWFT 940614   FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Foreign investors favour Cemig - Brazilian electricity group attracts interest      By PATRICK MCCURRY   Brazil's Cemig, Latin America's biggest electricity company in geographical terms, has become a favourite of foreign investors. They have been attracted by Cemig's productivity gains, its low debt and the potential privatisation of Brazil's electricity sector. However, Cemig's prices are among the lowest in Brazil, raising questions about whether the company can raise profitability in the long term. Cemig, or Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, is controlled by the state of Minas Gerais, which owns 84 per cent of its voting shares and 57 per cent of its total capital. The company was created in 1952 by Mr Juscelino Kubitschek, the modernising state governor and future president, as a generator, transmitter and distributor. The state has used the company, covering an area larger than France, to gain access to international capital markets. In January, the state sold Dollars 200m of eurobonds with equity warrants in the company and it is now planning a private placement of non-voting American depositary receipts for at least Dollars 150m. Overseas interest was stimulated by a Level 1 ADR programme launched last year, and the company is adapting its accounts to US standards for a possible capital issue of Level 3 ADRs next year. Currently, about 12 per cent of Cemig's capital is held by foreigners, compared with almost nothing three years ago. Cemig has proved attractive to international investors in spite of an operating loss of Dollars 165m last year following combined operating losses of nearly Dollars 200m in 1991 and 1992. Cemig blames the losses on the government's policy of keeping electricity prices artificially low to try to control Brazil's inflation. It also says a change in accounting policy in 1990, adopted by most of the industry, led to an increase of about 60 per cent in depreciation. However, a new electricity price structure introduced ahead of the real, Brazil's new currency due to enter circulation in July, will lead to a one-off 20 per cent increase in prices for the company, according to Mr Luiz Fernando Rolla, a Cemig finance official. Mr Rolla predicts the price increase will help the company to make a small profit this year. He says investors have been attracted by its low debt, its reputation for being well managed and prospects for a long-term increase in demand in Minas Gerais state. Another attraction has been the prospect of privatisation, leading to price increases over the longer term. The government is said to be looking at the industry's privatisation but no clear decision is expected until after presidential elections at the end of the year. Cemig's total debt is only 9 per cent of shareholders' capital, partly because of under-investment, particularly since the early 1980s when many publicly-controlled companies were starved of funds. The company has also avoided the highly expensive local debt market and sought funds from agencies like such as the World Bank. Productivity has grown in the past three years, helped by 1,000 job cuts, reducing the payroll to 17,000. Another 4,000 to 5,000 jobs could go by the year 2000, says company president Mr Carlos Aloy. Cemig's ability to cut costs is limited, however, because it is obliged by the federal government to buy 17 per cent of the energy from the Itaipu hydroelectric plant on the Brazil-Paraguay border. This amounts to 28 per cent of Cemig's energy needs, but 34 per cent of its operating costs. But a more important problem, according to analysts, is that about 70 per cent of Cemig's revenues comes from industrial users, which traditionally pay lower prices than residential users.

The company said yesterday that standard customers would have Pounds 10 credited against their next quarterly bill, and customers on Economy 7 would get Pounds 16. Customers on prepayment, token or card meters would get an extra Pounds 4. The amounts are related to the standing charges that customers pay. The move follows claims in a number of consumer reports that electricity companies have increased their charges faster than inflation since they were privatised in 1989. Last week the National Consumer Council and the Consumers' Association accused the electricity industry of imposing Pounds 650m of unjustified price increases on domestic users. Eastern denied that its rebate was a response to these accusations. The plan was put for board approval last month. Eastern also pointed out that its customers had already had their bills frozen at April 1992 prices, and had received two Pounds 5 efficiency bonuses. Mr John Devaney, chief executive, said: 'Our customers are continuing to benefit to the full from our ability to manage our business costs effectively.' The company said its average domestic bills had gone up by 14.2 per cent since privatisation - but if the credits and rebates were taken into account this amounted to only 6.1 per cent. This compared with inflation of 15.4 per cent over the period. Other electricity companies are expected to announce similar rebates in the weeks ahead.   Companies:-  Eastern Electricity.

Mr Robert Atkins, minister for the economy and the environment in Northern Ireland, announced in Belfast that company's 165m shares would be offered at 220p each. This represents a historic gross dividend yield of 5.8 per cent based on net dividends for the 1992-93 year of Pounds 16.5m, or 10.02p per share. All the company's shares are being offered for sale except for a small proportion for bonus entitlements and employees. Payment for the shares will be in two instalments, the first 100p payable on application and the rest on June 28 1994. The offer, with a 100-share minimum, closes June 16. Incentives are being offered for pre-registered applicants who hold on to their shares for a given period. The offer has attracted more than 800,000 registrations. COMMENT The offer price lay at the mid-point of market expectations and was viewed in the City as providing an attractive investment opportunity. The historic yield of 5.8 per cent compares with an average in the regional electricity company sector of 5.1 per cent, pointing to a possible gain of between 10p and 15p when the shares begin trading on June 21.

The deal will substantially reduce SCA's borrowings and strengthen Sydkraft's position in the European power industry. Explaining the background to the disposal, SCA said its need for owning hydroelectric power sources had been reduced as it shifts from energy-intensive raw pulp production to using recycled fibre for its growing range of value-added wood-based products. SCA added that it would net SKr6.7bn from the sale and as a result reduce its long-term debt to SKr8.69bn from SKr17.77bn, while increasing its equity/asset ratio from 29 per cent to 47 per cent. SCA built up its large debt burden in the past few years in a corporate acquisition spree through Europe, including the Pounds 1.05bn (Dollars 1.84bn) purchase of Reedpack in 1990. In an attempt to reduce borrowings, SCA has already sold several subsidiaries, including the pulp machinery company Sunds Defibrator, and mortgaged half of Bakab's assets to the Swedish government-affiliated National Pension Funds. That mortgage will be transferred to Sydkraft as part of the preliminary agreement. The Bakab sale will also enable SCA to renew its acquisitions thrust as well as finance current capital investment programmes. The takeover by Sydkraft of SCA's hydroelectric facilities, which are in the mountainous northern Swedish region of Norrland, will take place at the beginning of 1993 with an initial payment of SKr7.95bn followed by five annual payments of SKr700m each. Sydkraft said its acquisition of Bakab will improve its competitive position as the European electricity market becomes deregulated, providing increased opportunities to sell power across national borders. Sydkraft plans to provide electricity to the German power group Preussen Elektra, which acquired a 10.5 per cent stake in Sydkraft last year. Bakab accounted for about 9 per cent, or SKr1.10bn, of SCA's 1990 total invoicing. The addition of Bakab's hydroelectric resources will also reduce Sydkraft's dependence on nuclear power as its main source of electricity generation. SCA said the deregulation of the electricity market in Sweden and the European Community and the opening of borders within Europe had led 'to a quickly changing situation' in the power sector.

Prices were down by 16 per cent in the first quarter of this year, at 2.09p a unit, as supply rose and demand steadied. Prices over the full year to March varied, though, with the unit price reaching a peak of 376p and falling as low as 0.5p, Caminus said. The average price was 2.24p, an increase of 22 per cent over the previous year, which was the first year of the pool's operation. Caminus said the main reason for this was that power stations closed, pushing up the part of the price that reflects supply and demand. Caminus remained neutral on the row over whether the pool price was too high or too low. It said both consumers, who have faced big rises, and generators, who argue that the price is too low to cover costs, have valid points. The new market in electricity had been criticised, Caminus said, but it had never been intended to give stable prices. It was not supposed to give the generators a guaranteed return on new investments.  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "

But there is no consensus about how the sector can be prised open to outside competition in a which would lead to de-regulation and liberalisation. It will be the task of the new coalition government to try and attain that consensus. Across Germany's energy sectors - electricity, gas, and coal - decades-old practices continue to exist. Take electricity. The large utilities, led by RWE, Bayernwerk and PreussenElektra, function within the demarcation and concession system whereby they have exclusive rights to supply the municipalities. The gas industry enjoys a similar monopolistic position. This has the effect of guaranteeing security of energy supply, but at the same time, it restricts choice, including price, for the municipalities and the consumer. A challenge against this system has now been mounted by Kleve, a small town on the Dutch border, which wants to end its exclusive contract with RWE in a bid for cheaper, alternative and independent energy, from across the Dutch border if necessary. The case has been referred to the European Commission. The outcome will be watched closely by the industry. But the structure and price of German electricity - among the highest in Europe - are also influenced by the practice of allowing electricity companies are permitted to collect a levy - the so-called Kohlepfennig - from the consumer to help finance the use of the high cost German coal. The Kohlepfennig is tied to the Jahrhundert Vertrag, an agreement between the coal and electricity industries in Germany covering the amount of domestic coal the utilities undertake to burn for the remainder of this century. German coal prices are higher than world coal prices - at current exchange rates, world coal prices are about DM80 per tonne but the German electricity companies pay DM280 per tonne for German coal to make up for the cost of imported coal. More than 40m tonnes of coal are subsidised by the Kohlepfennig. Phasing out of the Kohlepfennig would have social political consequences: it would affect domestic coal production output and eventually drain support from the opposition Social Democrats, whose constituencies are rooted in the coal regions. Yet the SPD also realises that it is facing pressure from industry for lower electricity prices, and is aware that the annual DM8bn required to subsidise coal continues to put a strain on the budget deficit which is over DM68bn. It is not only the coal industry which is under pressure to become competitive. There is growing pressure on the electricity and gas utilities to consider how far they are prepared to introduce Third Party Access (TPA) which would allow outsiders access to their distribution grids. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, has proposed a comprehensive reform of the energy sector envisaging some form of TPA. In October 1993, he unveiled a draft energy law intended to replace the 1935 Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, or energy law. The draft legislation proposed that operators of the electricity or gas grid, upon whom third parties are dependent for transportation, must not unreasonably hinder those seeking contracts for TPA. However, refusal to grant such TPA is not considered unreasonable in several situations: if the capacity of the line for TPA is insufficient; if no appropriate compensation for TPA is offered; if the secure supply to other customers of the operator of the line for reasonable conditions is rendered impossible through TPA; and if, in the case of gas, a curtailment of supply on international markets occurs. So far, Mr Rexrodt has been unsuccessful in pushing this legislation through because of opposition from within the government itself, and from the utilities and other related institutions. For example, the Federal Association for Gas and Water (BGW), supports in principle the idea of TPA, but only if it is reciprocal. 'Germany cannot go it alone,' argues Mr Martin Weyand, an energy expert at the BGW. However, Mr Weyand and the BGW believe that the consequences of TPA and the abolition of the principle of exclusive service areas would have the following results: inequality of opportunity. Foreign gas companies would be able to supply the German market while foreign markets - particularly France - would remain inaccessible to German gas companies; threat to security of supply. The system of long-term supply contracts used throughout Europe, which consists of long-term supply contracts with high take-or-pay obligations, could no longer be applied. However, short-term contracts would not be a suitable alternative and would not guarantee secure, area-wide supplies to customers; small consumers and medium-sized businesses and rural areas would be hit; the obligation to connect and guarantee supply could no longer be met; expropriation of private investment. Those companies which have undertaken long-term investments could lose the right to dispose of their own property and it is unclear if there would be a compensating mechanism. The Verband der Industriellen Energie-und Kraftwirtschaft, the association for industrial energy, wants greater competition because it believes it would lead to lower prices. The VIK, headed by Mr Max Dietrich Kley, a board member of BASF, the giant chemicals group and one of the largest consumers of energy, wants third party access. Indeed, BASF, through Wintershall, its gas subsidiary, is building a network of gas pipe lines across Germany precisely to break the monopoly held by Ruhrgas, the country's largest gas supplier, and introduce cheaper gas prices and more competition. But the VIK does not have the support of the Arbeitgemeinschaft Regionaler Energieversorgungs-Unternehmen (ARE), the organisation which groups together the regional utility companies. Sandwiched between the municipalities and the large utility companies, ARE can live without the strict concession and demarcation systems, since it would give them greater opportunities to compete and supply on the local level. Yet they do not want TPA because they would be smothered by outside competitors. The German government is under some pressure from the EU to deregulate. For the moment, however, there is no consensus in Brussels about how far TPA within the EU should go - while the UK staunchly defends wide liberalisation, France favours the single-buyer model which would allow one utility to import, sell, and distribute electricity in the national market. 'This would mean that the national market in France would be blocked by its own companies,' a BGW official said. Thus, without consensus either in Brussels or within Germany, it will be up to the incoming Bonn coalition to force the pace.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

His report may not now be published until next month. Investors, probably correctly, have concluded that the delay implies that talks are still going on which will avoid the companies being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The regulator seems to want National Power and PowerGen to agree to dispose of some generating plant and accept a voluntary cap on spot electricity prices. Since the companies probably have more to lose through an MMC reference, they are under pressure to agree. On the other hand, practically none of the important political constituencies now want a reference, so the regulator is a little hemmed in. If a deal is done, there will probably be some impact on profits. The generators' high dividend cover and provisions do, however, offer a defence. Even so, with the shares now yielding 20 per cent less than the market average, a good part of the growth prospects are already in price. By contrast, the regional electricity companies are still cheap, with above average yields, since investors regard them as pure utilities. Yet their financial strength and dividend growth prospects are not those of a utility. The strong cash flow and low ratings may soon attract predators. If the RECs do not move quickly to unlock the value of their National Grid holdings, and return other excess capital to shareholders, someone else may do it for them.

But this in a way that is noticeably friendlier to  the environment than that to which we are currently accustomed,  with less discharge of noxious emissions and dust, better  quality, and more recycling of residues.    Right next to the Maas Power Plant, a large conventional  coal-burning plant for generating electricity that is scheduled  to be shut down in 2000, the Cooperating Electricity Production  Enterprises (SEP) have built a demonstration plant that is to  gasify coal based on a process developed by Shell. This new  power plant, with a capacity of 253 megawatts of electricity  (MWe), is currently the largest of its kind in the world. The  system must prove itself during a three-year demonstration  phase. If successful, a big brother of ""Buggenum"" will be built  in Borsele, Zeeland, with a capacity of 600 megawatts.    The part of the Limburg installation that generates  electricity is already operating on natural gas as an element of  the startup program, and is providing 100 megawatts of  electricity to the public network. In a few weeks the colossal  coal gasifier will also be started up, says Eng. G.D. Zon, the  project director of Demkolec, a subsidiary of the SEP set up  specifically for the new project. After that, the capacity will  be gradually increased to the maximum. Ultimately the power  plant will process 2,000 metric tons of coal a day.    According to Zon, the electricity that his installation will  then deliver is still about 20 percent more expensive than that  coming from a 600-megawatt powdered coal plant, but ""Buggenum""  is intended to be a model for the large-scale application of  coal gasification. ""At a capacity of 600 megawatts with high  efficiency, the production price is competitive. But we are  primarily interested in the environmental advantages. If all  this succeeds, and you put price tags on all the aspects, then I  think that a coal gasifier will end up being cheaper.""    Coal gasification is not a new technology, as many  Limburgers  in particular know, because right in front of city hall in  Maastricht stands a statue of Father Prof. Pieter Johan  Minckelers, who discovered 210 years ago that heating pit coal  in an old barrel releases gas that is well-suited to launching  hot-air balloons and to lighting and heating. Since the  beginning of this century, the system has been applied by  municipalities on a large scale for the production for city gas,  but in the 1960's it was supplanted by cheaper and much cleaner  natural gas. For decades, industry has used the cheap gas  obtained from the production of coke, and during World War II  the Germans made synthetic gasoline from coal gas. Beginning in  1935, tests were also conducted with the underground  gasification of pit coal, but this has yet to yield commercial  success.    Coal gas as a fuel for generating electricity is indeed new.  In the late 1980's, Shell emerged as the winner of a bitter  struggle with competitors Texaco and British Gas Lurgi and was  able to provide the SEP with its technology, which came from the  technique that the company uses for oil gasification. All the  oil companies threw themselves into gasification technology  during the 1970's, says Eng. Zon. ""After the first oil crisis,  they expected a shortage and a sharp price increase for oil and  natural gas. Because of that, the raw materials for the  petrochemical industry would also become much more expensive,  and so an alternative was sought. Synthesis gas, which is  created from coal gasification, is also suitable as feedstock  for the chemicals industry. That is why you now see all the oil  companies following this route. They have invested a great deal  of money in it. Coal gasification also generates hydrogen, and  the petrochemical industry always needs that. And it is easy to  combine the carbon in the gas with the hydrogen to create  substances that you need in the chemicals industry.""    Modern natural gas-fired electric power plants can easily  achieve efficiency of more than 50 percent or even a little  higher. The test installation in Buggenum achieves 43 percent,  because of the applied technique. ""Just look at our STEG unit  (steam and gas are both fed into turbines and the power is  converted into electricity via a generator) and then we will  achieve more than 50 percent,"" says Zon. ""Then you have to  consider that we produce our own gas, while a natural gas plant  has its fuel delivered ready to use. But for this sort of power  plant there is an entire battery of equipment that treats the  gas and keeps it under pressure.""    According to the director of Demkolec, a 600-megawatt coal  gasification plant should be able to achieve efficiency of 47  percent, and theoretically even 50 percent. But Zon is no  fetishist; he points out that the most modern powdered coal  plants will match the performance of coal gasification in terms  of efficiency and environmental properties. ""I think that you  should install both systems side by side, in a competitive  relationship, with regard to power plant availability, cost per  kilowatt hour, and environmental performance."" This opinion  diverges from the Master Plan for Electricity Supply, in which  the government, if ""Buggenum"" is successful, expresses a  preference for pit coal gasification alone in generating  electricity, aside from the two other fuels: natural gas and  uranium.    The government and electricity producers are in complete  agreement that coal is absolutely essential to the large-scale  generation of electricity. In the 1970's, the ideal mix of fuels  was determined to be one-third natural gas, one-third coal, and  one-third nuclear energy, but that mix was never achieved due to  the problems with opposition to nuclear power plants. Zon, who  was the director of the Nucon engineering firm for a number of  years, which specializes in nuclear energy: ""If we were to  decide tomorrow to build new nuclear power plants, then in my  opinion you would have to regard coal gasification differently,  because nuclear energy remains cleaner and cheaper. Three fuels  with one-third each: That should remain the goal, that is  preferable in terms of the environment and price and also in  terms of fuel availability.""    The assortment of fuels used right now is quite different.  Last year, 57 percent of the electricity produced in the  Netherlands was generated with natural gas, 37 percent with  coal, and 6 percent with uranium. In order to maintain the share  of coal--a relatively cheap and widely available fuel--at that  level, coal gasification is essential as one of the techniques  for cleaner burning. The coal is combined with pure oxygen in a  gasifier at a temperature of 1,500 degrees Celsius and a  pressure of 30 atmospheres. The coal gas product is then cooled,  purified, and subjected to ""deep desulfurization,"" Zon explains,  through which the discharge of sulfur dioxide (SOinf 2/inf )  is sharply reduced. The pure sulfur residue can be easily sold  on the domestic market, because the Netherlands currently still  imports sulfur.    By diluting the coal gas, the content of nitrogen oxides  (NOx) is sharply reduced. Purification (with water) of the gas  ensures a very limited discharge of matter from the power plant.  The water is purified again and evaporated, which leaves salts  as residue. Coal gasification has another environmental  advantage: The greenhouse gas COinf 2/inf  can be captured  easily and cheaply before combustion, although that has a  negative effect on efficiency. This is not yet being done in  Buggenum, but it can be considered for new, larger power plants.    Over the next two years, Demkolec will test seven types of  coal of various composition in the power plant and based on that  draw up a ""blueprint"" for new gasification plants. In the third  year, ""Buggenum"" will work with the SEP's National Efficiency  Program, the goal being to show that the availability of the  power plant is greater than 70 percent. There are currently 120  people working at the plant on day-to-day operations, plus  another 35 experts, including a number of people from Shell and  KEMA [Arnem Institute for the Testing of Electrical Engineering  Equipment], for testing, the demonstration program, and  evaluation.    ""Shell has worked for 15 years on the total course of this  technology,"" says Zon. ""But the potential for large-scale  application of this clean technology has increased sharply over  the past five years in particular, so that we can now say  confidently that it is becoming affordable and competitive for  the Netherlands, which together with Germany has the strictest  environmental regulations in the world.""

The justification was based on the popular assumption that prices in the electricity pool are too high. Pool prices are not high. In 1990, at less than 2p per unit, they were absurdly low and my association told your newspaper that unrealistic prices would damage the emergence of competition. Today, still far below 3p, they are at best barely adequate. The pool price may not be a perfect market price but it is vitally important for every company that makes and sells electricity. Producers must have a reasonable rate of return to stay in business. As for the concern that there may be too much generating capacity, for consumers that is not a problem, but a comfort. There can be little doubt they like electricity to be plentiful, reliable and reasonably priced. Most have fared well since privatisation, as the regulator, Professor Littlechild, stated in his annual report in May. Britain has a generating industry which in many respects is leading the world. Producers large and small are investing increasingly in clean and efficient electricity production.

Either way, the comparison is more apt than it may appear. Both Taylor, whose book concentrated on European diplomacy in the 19th century, and McGowan had to get to grips with complex issues. And both deal with subjects of political import. As McGowan points out it was Lenin who pointed to the power of electricity when he said communism equals Soviets plus electricity. But throughout the world virtually all political systems have considered electricity to be a strategic industry safest in monopolisitic, often state, hands. The political power of electrical power explains the intense struggle the EC is facing to liberalise the industry and free it up to competition, with strong opposition coming both from the European parliament and the utilities. The liberalisation attempts form the focus for McGowan's study which manages to combine comprehensiveness with accessibility. Unlike many writers, McGowan, a university lecturer, has no political axe to grind. His book provides useful reading for the growing numbers of industrialists who will need to understand the proposed changes. The need arises because the EC's proposals would radically change the way the industry operates and reshape its relations with both consumers and suppliers. The main elements of its reform plan include increasing transparency of utilities accounts, achieving greater access for non-utility power producers to grid systems. Third Party Access, another plank of reform, would give greater scope for large energy users and distribution companies to deal directly with competing power producers. The effects would be to end privileged relationships between national utilities and local suppliers of fuel and equipment, and change pricing structures for consumers. Some charges may fall as competition bites but others, for example those affecting rural communities, could rise as cross-subsidies would be threatened. The trends towards privatisation and diversification among utilities would be strengthened and utilities would have to reconsider broader commitments to social policy such as maintaining job levels. There is also a risk of service deterioration. With so much at stake it is not surprising that the utilities are fighting, often with the backing of their governments, to limit the effects of the change. The book charts the influence on the debate of the UK, which through privatisation has shown how electricity systems can be ordered differently but does not necessarily provide a model for Community-wide reform, and of France, widely viewed as the country where monopolistic tendencies are most acute. McGowan points to the likely compromise solutions between the commission and opponents of reform. Under one scenario, the commission would water down its TPA directive by maintaining the principle of a more competitive system but leave it to individual users to to request access to systems. In any event the European electricity industry is moving from its strong monopolistic bias towards greater competition. The EC's willingness and ability to exercise its will should none the less determine the speed and depth of change.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2731 Book Publishing.

0,FT924-14489 ,"FT924-14489 _AN-CJIBOAD6FT 921009   FT  09 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK electricity   Mr Stephen Littlechild, the electricity watchdog, is struggling with some knotty issues. His paper on future supply regulation invites submissions on alternatives to the price control RPI-X formula. But in the same breath it appears to dismiss the main possibilities, such as rate of return regulation. Perhaps this is not surprising. Mr Littlechild has been closely identified with the development of the RPI-X regime and might be expected to defend it. Price control does indeed provide efficiency incentives which other systems lack. Yet a rate of return is implicit in assumptions made about any price cap and the reasonable efficiency gains a company can make. Thus the price control ought to be pitched at a level to make the implied rate of return comparable to that of similar businesses. Rate of return cannot simply be ignored. The RPI-X system functions well enough for the business of transmitting power down the wires: a natural monopoly from which the regional electricity companies earn almost 95 per cent of their profits. Supply - the buying and selling of electricity - is not naturally a monopoly. With more competition, price regulation could be abandoned for all but domestic customers. Unfortunately supply is a low margin business, so to lure new entrants Mr Littlechild may be tempted to sweeten supply returns at the expense of distribution. British Gas must be watching keenly. The issues of acceptable rate of return and the balance of distribution and supply are at the heart of its Monopolies and Mergers Commission reference.  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "
0,FT943-4814 ,"FT943-4814 _AN-EIGDVAC7FT 940907   FT  07 SEP 94 / People: McKinlay dives out of the Pool   Margaret McKinlay, the chief executive of the Electricity Pool, surprised the power industry yesterday by announcing that she is leaving to take up the new post of head of compliance at British Gas. The move will stir considerable interest in energy circles since the Pool and British Gas are both in the public eye these days. But the 43-year-old McKinlay felt it was time for a change, both from her point of view and that of the Pool. 'When I took on this job five years ago I wanted to make sure the Pool was capable of working, and I think I've done that,' she said. 'It can always be improved, but it would be better for another person to do that.' A graduate of Edinburgh University, McKinlay joined the Department of Energy in 1977, and worked on electricity and oil licensing before becoming private secretary to the minister of state. After a spell in administration, she moved to the coal division during the miners' strike before returning to electricity to oversee privatisation. In December 1988 she helped create the Pool, the new wholesale market for electricity which formed the heart of the privatised industry, becoming chief executive in 1990. Although the Pool has evolved as the focal point of the electricity market, it has been criticised for containing imperfections, and a number of reforms are being introduced under McKinlay's guidance. At British Gas, McKinlay will play a key role in introducing a regulatory compliance regime in the wake of last year's monopoly report. In particular, she will be responsible for ensuring the effective separation of British Gas's transportation business from its trading operations - the key feature of the new structure which will have to pass muster with the gas regulator and the company's customers. McKinlay will be based at British Gas's corporate centre and report to a main board director. She admits that she has had only limited contact with the gas industry - still very much a man's world - though she has met Clare Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, with whom most of her dealings will be. No moves have yet been made to find a successor at the Pool. One member said yesterday: 'She will be very hard to replace. She is extraordinarily conscientious, and would never leave a job half done.'   Companies:-  British Gas.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

What happened to large industrial customers' prices for 1987 to March 1991 was that an attempt was made to give them the benefit of ordinary commercial discount for quantity and regularity of custom, and also to recognise the value of load shedding at times of system stress. The present (and former) general system of pricing does not otherwise accommodate this commercial principle. The problem with the present system is that, in principle, big users pay the same prices for energy as domestic consumers, which is absurd. The difference in final delivered price of electricity arises from the additional costs of distribution to domestic consumers, as David Porter well knows. If he has evidence of state subsidy to Britain's European competitors' electricity suppliers, he should let the European Commission have it. Our studies simply show that the continental supply industry behaves more commercially than ours.

The information on the screens is in constant demand from senior executives to the humblest employees, nearly all of whom still have shares in their company bought at privatisation. Employees tend to know how their company and its rivals are faring on the stock market. According to industry executives the screens and the interest shown in them symbolise a cultural transformation which is producing a more competitive atmosphere than before privatisation. The claims are exaggerated but there have been significant changes. Electricity companies have become more outward looking and more focused on what they should and should not be doing. Although they are constantly attacked for making excessive profits - or rather the government is attacked for permitting them to do so - the standard of their service has not become a significant issue as it did for BT, after the telephone system was privatised. According to Mr Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, companies have more than met the standards he has laid down. These include guaranteeing that electricity must be restored within 24 hours of a supply fault and replacing a company fuse within four hours. A source of friction with poorer customers has been reduced by the 62 per cent drop in the number of disconnections in Britain. The City approves such improvements - largely because it means there is also less friction with the regulator - but it is much more interested in how the companies are raising their efficiency to influence profits. Critics of privatisation feel that job cutting is viewed in the City almost as a virility symbol. Thus Eastern Electricity, the largest company, was marked down until recently because some analysts viewed its management as too slow to reduce its workforce. Its shares perked up this year following a job shedding announcement. Few companies have matched the job cutting rate of National Power. Staff numbers there have been reduced from 17,000 at privatisation three years ago to less than 7,400 today. The effect on profits has been dramatic, according to Mr John Baker, chief executive. Productivity in the last year, when jobs have been reduced by 4,000, has risen by 25 per cent and salary costs by 12 per cent. Mr Baker says this would not have been achievable if the company was still in the public sector. 'Management would have been invited to back pedal in the interests of political stability. In the new climate the unions have been exceedingly constructive. It is a different culture.' PowerGen, the other generator, is down to 4,900 staff from 9,000 three years ago. Regional companies have been cutting too but less savagely, they argue, because they had less fat. Midlands Electricity is typical having cut about 800 jobs from more than 8,000. In cutting such large numbers electricity companies have taken active steps to avoid alienating those that are left. South West Electricity, for example, hired Charles Smith Associates, a management consultancy which helped Rover improve its staff morale. Performance related pay is also being introduced. For example, Seeboard recently concluded a deal for more flexible working and performance pay with retail staff. Some companies are also hoping to motivate staff by making down-line managers more profit-oriented. East Midlands electricity recently rationalised 13 so-called cost centres into seven 'profit centres'. Headquarters staff is being cut accordingly. In introducing all of these changes companies have been helped by a stream of healthy profits - some recs almost doubled profits in 1991-2 and are showing healthy rises last year. This in turn has enabled salaries to remain high. The exceptions are retail and electrical contracting employees who have seen their salaries fall as management have brought salary structures in line with the market. Elsewhere higher than average salary rises have been common. This year, at a time when public sector rises have been restricted to 1.5 per cent, electricity workers have enjoyed rises above that, and in some cases above 4 per cent. But the biggest financial gainers have been the senior executives. Most chairmen and chief executives of regional electricity companies earned between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 70,000 before privatisation and between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000 a year later and significant increases have followed. If the rises continued last year - they will be revealed in annual reports in the next few months - the Labour Party, which opposed privatisation, and others are likely to make political capital.

0,FT931-1027 ,"FT931-1027 _AN-DCZBZAGIFT 930326   FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Market to determine pits' future - The government's blueprint to tackle projected energy demands      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   THE GOVERNMENT has signalled a much bigger role for market forces in the coal industry with its commitment to move towards privatising British Coal as quickly as possible and to sell off pits the corporation wants to close. The government's white paper stressed the limited options available for extending the market for coal. There is little market for coal outside electricity generation, and the 'demand for coal in this market is set to decline significantly from current levels. There is no likelihood of significant growth in demand in other markets and a substantial risk of further decline.' The government wants to leave decisions about energy use to the free market, but it is setting up a panel to advise it on developments. This is what the white paper had to say about the main sectors: Coal The government confirms that British Coal's decision to close 31 pits 'was soundly based in the market conditions'. But it concluded that there is a case for enabling British Coal to phase the inevitable closures needed and also offer the coal industry a viable future in the private sector. In order to do this, the government is providing a subsidy for additional tonnages of coal the corporation can sell to the generators. This will be on top of contracts already signed to supply 160m tonnes over five years - 40m tonnes in 1993 to 1994 and 30m tonnes in each of the following four years. Negotiations about any additional tonnages are still under way. The subsidy will enable British Coal to compete with imported coal and other black fuels such as orimulsion. It will encourage the generators to substitute coal from the UK for coal from overseas. This will give British Coal time to implement the productivity and cost improvements in order to make coal competitive with world prices within five years. The level of subsidy is for negotiation, but the white paper embraces figures put forward by the select committee. These state that subsidies should provide the difference between the cost of additional British coal and imported coal. The subsidy will stop when the industry is privatised. It does not give any indication of what additional tonnages the corporation can expect to sell as a result of the subsidy. The government intends to speed up the privatisation process and the white paper says privatisation will be achieved at the earliest practical opportunity. The government stresses that it cannot legally force the generators to carry higher stocks of coal as a way of increasing the market, but that it would continue to consult with them over stock levels as a matter of urgency. Opencast mining production is expected to fall even further than British Coal's forecasts because of government efforts to subsidise deep-mined coal. British Coal had forecast that opencast mining would fall from 16m tonnes to 12m tonnes by 1997 to 1998. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, is reviewing planning guidance on opencast coal. British Coal has agreed that, in the approach to privatisation, it will offer to sell or licence any pit it plans to close. A new Coal Authority with responsibility for licensing pits and maintaining records of mining activity will be set up in Nottinghamshire. The government also plans to remove limits placed on underground working hours in an effort to help British Coal improve efficiency. The government intends to pass legislation that will remove restrictions under which British Coal is unable to license mines at which more than 150 workers are employed. Nuclear The government sees no justification for forcing Nuclear Electric to close any of its Magnox stations before the end of their planned lifetimes. The review of future prospects for the nuclear industry will be completed earlier than planned and the government will make an announcement later this year. The nuclear review was planned for next year. Mining communities The white paper increased the amount of cash available for helping areas affected by the pit closures to Pounds 200m. Environment The government expects the amount of coal burnt at power stations to fall in the longer term because of environmental pressures. But it has made an additional Pounds 12m available over the next three years to support research into clean coal technology at British Coal's Coal Research Establishment. Gas No measures to restrict gas-fired power generation. Orimulsion Orimulsion exports from Venezuela to the UK will stay at minimum contracted levels for the foreseeable future. This should see a reduction in consumption of at least 500,000 tonnes equivalent of coal a year from the current level. Electricity The government reaffirmed its commitment to an open electricity market with more competition to be introduced in 1994 as planned. Consumers should pay lower electricity bills because the generators will be buying subsidised coal and could then pass these savings on. The government is considering whether to allow large electricity users to bypass the pool - or the wholesale market. The electricity pool authorities are looking at introducing demand-side bidding into the electricity pool which means that large users could be given incentives to shift their electricity demands to periods of low usage. There would be no restriction on imports of French electricity. Energy Commission The government plans to set up an energy advisory panel of independent experts, which will offer advice on the development of energy markets.   Companies:-  British Coal Corp.

Their regulator is again asking questions about pool prices, although he found no evidence of price fixing last year. The generators are also locked in sensitive talks with British Coal over long-term coal supply contracts. A worthy argument about who bears the cost of nuclear power provides a welcome diversion. Industry, though, is certainly right to worry about energy costs. Subsidies in the form of cheap coal - and the low rate of return demanded of some regional electricity boards - have been lost since privatisation. In a business like chemicals the cost of power is a key component in competitiveness since many other input prices are fixed on world markets. It is difficult to prove UK manufacturers are operating at a disadvantage, but the nuclear levy is is the one component of power pricing equation still in the gift of government and an obvious target for lobbying. But the attention of the market, and of big electricity consumers, is unlikely to be switched for long from the issues of competition and coal. Energy users yesterday welcomed PowerGen's proposals on the levy, but would no doubt also applaud a full enquiry into pool prices. Industry will also be suspicious of paying any form of hidden subsidy to British Coal through higher electricity prices. Both issues have to be resolved if the generators are to continue to justify a lower yield than other privatised utilities.  The Financial Times   London Page 14  "

Prof Stephen Littlechild, director-general of the Office of Electricity Regulation, said he was cracking down on the companies. He said the price controls would save families, on average, a total of Pounds 70-Pounds 90 over the next five years. His prices formula, through which allowed prices in power distribution businesses will fall next April by 11-17 per cent, were accepted immediately by three of the 12 regional electricity companies to which they apply. Although the other nine could still appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, they are expected to follow the lead of Yorkshire Electricity, East Midlands Electricity and Seeboard inaccepting the regulator's decision. After next year's price cuts, electricity companies will be required to restrict annual distribution price rises, which make up more than a quarter of final bills, to 2 percentage points below inflation. The stock market was pleased by the review. Share prices in the companies rose by up to 10 per cent with London Electricity, up 61p to 645p, leading the way. Southern Electric, up 51p to 714p, was also among the day's strong gainers. Eastern Electricity rose 30p to 739p, a new high. The National Consumers' Council, however, said the cuts did not go far enough and failed to redress the balance between companies and consumers after recent excessive profits. Environmental groups were angered by the absence of stronger measures to encourage energy efficiency. Although Prof Littlechild gave companies new incentives to save electricity, he decided not to provide new funding for the Energy Savings Trust, the government-sponsored agency which is supposed to promote energy efficiency projects. The lower prices will also blunt the effect of the recent introduction of value added tax on electricity bills which is supposed to cut consumption. Greenpeace, the environmental group, said last night that the result would be higher atmospheric emissions and a greater danger of climate change. Prof Littlechild said the package would produce savings to consumers totalling Pounds 2.5bn over five years. Average household bills would be Pounds 12-Pounds 16 a year lower because of the controls. He said present prices in the regional companies' distribution businesses were too high, but added: 'If companies are going to make significant profits they're going to have to work much harder than at present.'

0,FT944-6741 ,"FT944-6741 _AN-EK1C5AE8FT 941128   FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (8): Combined heat and politics  -Cogeneration industry seeks a boost in Brussels      By ANDREW BAXTER   Energy efficiency and environmental cleanliness would make a strong combined argument for any kind of power generation system, but few, if any, can score so highly on both counts as combined heat and power. Unlike most conventional power generating systems, CHP recaptures the waste heat released during combustion and uses it to make steam for hot water or heating - as well as electricity. This can produce total efficiency ratings of up to 90 per cent, compared with 35 per cent thermal efficiency for the average coal fired power station or 56-58 per cent for the latest combined cycle systems. As for emissions, every 1MW of CHP reduces UK carbon emissions by 1,250 tonnes a year. It might seem odd, therefore, that the popularity of CHP varies so widely across the European Union, where CHP overall accounts for 6 per cent of electricity generated. In Holland and Denmark, the figure is 30 per cent, whereas in France it is only 2 per cent. In fact, there is a very close link between government policy that promotes CHP - or at least creates favourable conditions for it to flourish - and its success in the market place. Where governments are indifferent or allow uncertainty to develop, CHP finds it harder to prosper. The UK is a case in point. It is at the low end of the scale compared with the big European users, with only 4 per cent of its electricity coming from CHP. But the UK Government has at least set a target - of 5,000MW of CHP by the end of the century. Already, the UK has 3,000MW of CHP at work, on more than 700 sites, and until a few months ago, it looked to be coasting comfortably towards achieving the 5,000MW target. Over the past three to four years, 1,000MW of capacity has been added and the country's largest CHP scheme, a 157MW joint venture between Scottish Hydro-Electric and British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield, Cumbria, came on stream earlier this year. The problem, however, is that the UK does not have a strategy to implement the target, according to Mr David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power Association. In the past three or four months, few new schemes have been announced because potential CHP operators feel squeezed between rising gas prices - one of the main fuels for CHP - and regulated electricity prices. There is a 'fundamental uncertainty,' he says, over the course of UK energy policy, which makes it difficult to invest in CHP with confidence. As a consequence, Mr Green is now less certain that the 5,000MW target will be reached. Before the recent lull, the market had been growing steadily, with a strong surge of activity in the hotel industry, and a good showing in the paper and board sector. Relatively unexploited sectors include the chemicals and steel industry - where companies have held back making investments, perhaps because of lack of confidence in their own future survival. According to a report* in July by Marketing Strategies for Industry, the UK market for industrial CHP generation plant, excluding plants below 100KW, was Pounds 97.7m last year, up from Pounds 87.2m in 1992 and just Pounds 51.1m in 1989. The biggest segment last year, based on gas turbines with waste heat recovery boilers, accounted for Pounds 63.9m of the spending, followed by combined-cycle CHP with Pounds 25.5m. Use of both types has grown strongly over the past four years. The remaining Pounds 8.3m was spent on systems based around reciprocating engines. The CHPA believes the UK could have 20,000MW of CHP by 2020, but Mr Green says there will have to be changes in government policy to achieve this. To turn the widespread support for CHP into reality, it wants new and fair prices for the electricity from CHP plant, effective investment by the private and public sectors in community heating, incentives to stimulate investment by companies in CHP, and action to remove what it calls 'the distortion and inertia' which limits the wider use of CHP and community heating. In contrast, CHP has 'steamed ahead' in Denmark and the Netherlands because it has been a policy priority, says Mr Michael Brown, the CHPA's assistant director (Europe). The Netherlands, with its more industrialised economy, uses CHP both in industry and in district heating, while Denmark's CHP is much more focused on district heating. In Italy, the one EU country where electricity supply shortages are an issue, there has been considerable growth in CHP use, almost entirely in the industrial sector. Here, and also in Spain, electricity tariff changes have been an important stimulus. In Spain, however, a review is now under way after strong growth over the past three to four years, and a number of projects are on hold. Mr Brown believes the amount of electricity generated by CHP in the EU can rise to 8 or 9 per cent by the end of the decade, helped by the planned entry to the EU of Sweden and Finland. He believes the EU should set an ambitious target for the average percentage figure, much as has happened in the UK. The CHPA, and the recently-formed organisation Cogen Europe which groups it and six other similar associations in Europe, is hoping it can influence a number of Brussels initiatives in favour of CHP. These include the slow-moving plans for the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets, and the controversial suggestion for an EU-wide energy tax to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The CHP industry is also trying to make headway on the European energy policy green paper now being drawn up by the Commission. An initial document was fairly thin on environmental issues, says Mr Brown. 'We would like to see that beefed up.' A further lobbying front involves the EU's Save programme to promote energy efficiency. Save I, now drawing to a close, was hamstrung by lack of support from member States, says Mr Brown. Save 2 is under discussion, and whatever emerges ought to have legislative teeth, says Mr Brown. Lobbying at national level, meanwhile, continues. *Power Generation Plant: UK.

The observatory also predicted that after the  Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant is officially put into operation,  the increase in the quantity of radiation in Hong Kong per year  will be fairly low and will not affect human health.    Since the end of last August, the Dayawan Nuclear Power  Plant  has started supplying on a trial basis some electricity needed  in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Observatory set up nuclear  radiation monitoring posts in 10 areas of Hong Kong, but to date  has found no signs of an increase in the quantity of radiation.  Wang Mingsong, chief senior scientist at the observatory, said:  It is predicted that after the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant is  put into full operation, the increase in the quantity of  radiation in Hong Kong will be merely under one-thousandth the  amount of ordinary radiation exposure in urban areas; this will  not affect human health.    Dai Qianjun, public affairs manager for the Hong Kong  Nuclear  Power Investment Corporation, noted: Hong Kong's power plants  did not increase power generating equipment last year, but Hong  Kong's demand for electricity is increasing. After it is put  into operation, the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant can provide 70  percent of its electricity to Hong Kong, accounting for 17-18  percent of the amount consumed in Hong Kong; this will meet Hong  Kong's power demands from 1994 to 1995. Moreover, the low  operating cost will maintain a stable electric rate in Hong Kong  over the next 20 years.     "

The link with the South African grid was destroyed during the long civil war in Mozambique. However, work on restoring it is now expected to start within about six months, according to Mr Manuel Lopez de Costa, Portuguese ambassador in Maputo. He was speaking after a two-day meeting of the tripartite Cahora Bassa permanent commission, which comprises Mozambique, Portugal and South Africa. He put the cost at Dollars 125m (Pounds 81m), of which Dollars 50m would be provided by South Africa. Portugal and Italy would also contribute to the project. It was hoped the line would be functioning again by 1996. Work on rebuilding the 1,800 pylons along 300km of line destroyed during the war could provide employment for hundreds of unskilled workers, including soldiers demobbed from government Frelimo and rebel Renamo forces. The Mozambique and Zimbabwe electricity authorities have also issued three invitations to tender for contracts to build a high-voltage line between Cahora Bassa and the Zimbabwe grid. The first is for the extension of electricity substations at Bindura and Doma, near Mhangura in northeast Zimbabwe, and the second is for the extension of Songo substation in Mozambique. The third is for the construction of a single high-voltage line linking the three substations. Bids must be submitted by mid-June.

All they needed was a little spark  to light their short fuse.    It came when referee Kelly Mock didn't call what the Sockers said was an  obvious tripping foul against Tatu on his way to a goal in the third quarter.  It gave Dallas a 2-1 lead but also made the Sockers fighting mad.    Playing without Steve Zungul, Branko Segota and Brian Quinn, the Sockers scored  eight second-half goals for a 9-5 victory before 5,787 at Reunion Arena in a  game that ended in a bench-clearing brawl.    After Waad Hirmez scored his third goal of the night with four seconds  remaining, he went to his knees to celebrate. But before the ritual started,  Dallas defender Richard Chinapoo approached, and the two exchanged shoves and  shouts. The encounter quickly escalated as both benches emptied. Dallas  defender Doc Lawson took on several Sockers and eventually threw a windmill  right kick at Ralph Black.    Lawson, Chinapoo and Terry Woodberry received penalties for Dallas, Black and  Cacho for the Sockers.    While Chinapoo had no comment, Hirmez blamed it on frustration.    ""I went to my knees to celebrate and (Chinapoo) came at me,"" said Hirmez, who  recorded his first hat trick in two years. ""He told me 'Don't do that . . . in  here' and then grabbed my shirt.

0,FT944-3036 ,"FT944-3036 _AN-ELOCSAC1FT 941215   FT  15 DEC 94 / National Power plans fuel switch: Plant would burn controversial Orimulsion      By MICHAEL SMITH   National Power, the electricity generation company, is to apply for government permission to build equipment which will enable it to burn Orimulsion, the controversial bitumen-based fuel, at its Pembroke plant in west Wales. The company's application, expected to be lodged within weeks, is a blow to providers of other fuels including coal and gas. Burning Orimulsion at Pembroke could displace up to 5m tonnes of coal a year. National Power is already discussing with the pollution inspectorate its plans to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment at Pembroke to allow it to generate electricity there. The likely submission for section 36 (planning) approval by the government to fit the equipment indicates the company is intent on going ahead. 'We are going ahead with the project because we believe it has the potential to provide clean electricity at a significantly lower cost than competing fuels for generation,' National Power said. Before it could go ahead and burn Orimulsion, National Power would need permission from both the pollution inspectorate and from the govern-ment. National Power also believes there may be potential to burn Orimulsion at other oil-fired power stations. Orimulsion is the trade name of a natural bitumen dispersed in water. It is produced in Venezuela from the Orinoco Belt by Bitor, a subsidiary of Petroleos De Venezuela, a state-owned company. Bitor Europe, which markets the fuel in Europe, hopes to sell Orimulsion throughout the Continent - but believes the UK is among the strongest potential markets. The pollution inspectorate provoked a controversy last year when it gave permission to PowerGen, another generator, to burn Orimulsion without desulphurisation equipment at its power stations at Ince on Merseyside and Richborough in Kent. The use of Orimulsion is opposed by the coal lobby since it displaces indigenous fuels, and by the environmental lobby which points to what it says are high sulphur emissions from the fuel. Bitor Europe says the fuel emits no more sulphur than some coals already being used to generate electricity in the UK. In addition, it says Orimulsion emits less carbon and nitrous oxide than coal. Should National Power win regulatory and government approval to fit desulphurisation equipment at Pembroke, the effect on coal would be considerable. Coal burn for generation is forecast by some analysts to fall below 30m tonnes in England and Wales by the end of the decade. RJB Mining, the coal company taking over British Coal's English assets, has however made generous provision for Orimulsion burn in its calculations. It believes Orimulsion could displace 6.5m tonnes of coal in 1998-99 and 8.3m tonnes in the following year. PowerGen burns about 1m tonnes a year of Orimulsion at Ince and Richborough and has no plans to increase this amount.   Companies:-  National Power.     Bitor Europe.

He will also raise the possibility of changes to Scottish Nuclear as part of a wide-ranging restructuring of the industry. Prof Littlechild will back the companies' campaigns for privatisation but make clear his view that restructuring is essential if a sell-off is approved. As regulator Prof Littlechild does not have the power to implement the ideas he is floating. However, his views, contained in his submission to the government's nuclear review, are bound to influence the government. Prof Littlechild is concerned about the growing share - 23 per cent - Nuclear Electric has of the England and Wales electricity market and about Scottish Nuclear's 47 per cent share north of the border. In its submission to the review Nuclear Electric suggested the creation of a private-sector company for its more modern power stations, leaving its older Magnox stations in the public sector. Prof Littlechild will ask the government to consider taking the more radical step of dividing the ownership of Nuclear Electric's advanced gas-cooled reactor stations. Nuclear Electric said yesterday it had not seen Prof Littlechild's recommendations. Mr Mike Kirwan, finance director, said any break-up decision would be for the government He said his company did not abuse its position in the market and, because Nuclear Electric was not setting prices in the wholesale electricity pool, there would be no competitive advantage in splitting it up. He added that smaller companies would weaken the nuclear industry's potential to export its technology and know-how.   Companies:-  Nuclear Electric.     Scottish Nuclear.

The Grid's generation business - pump storage facilities - consists of about 2,000MW of plant in Wales which has typically supplied about 0.5 per cent of the total output in England and Wales. Analysts put its value at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 500m. Prof Littlechild, speaking to the Institute of Economic Affairs, also urged the regional electricity companies to sell their entire stakes in the Grid, rather than keep some shares for disposal later. He also said that there 'would be merit' in considering greater separation of the regional companies' distribution networks from their other activities. He said: 'A clearer separation between monopoly networks and potentially competitive activities is more conducive to effective competition and the protection of customers.' While Prof Littlechild is not able to force the regional companies to comply with his wishes, his views will influence both industry executives and the government, which has a golden share in the Grid. He said continued ownership of the Grid by the regional companies, acceptable as a transitional measure since privatisation in 1990, seemed increasingly inappropriate. 'But it is important for the development of competition that transmission be clearly independent of interests in generation or supply.' Prof Littlechild has also backed the idea that some of the proceeds of the sale should be given to consumers. The Grid had a book value of about Pounds 1.2bn when the regional companies were privatised but is now thought to be worth more than Pounds 4bn.   Companies:-  National Grid Holdings.

0,FT943-13585 ,"FT943-13585 _AN-EGSDRADDFT 940719   FT  19 JUL 94 / Technology: Dial M for meters - A look at a trial scheme to measure water and energy consumption by telephone      By JANE MARTINSON   From the beginning of next year, telephones in the office and in the home could be leaking information about our lives as we sleep. The information they will relay is likely to concern our energy consumption and how much water we use, and the callers they will be 'talking to' will be the utilities that bill customers for these services. Up to 150 residents in Doncaster, in the north of England, are taking part in a trial in which their telephones are used to read their electricity and water meters. The trial, which runs until the end of the year, is a joint project between Yorkshire Water, Yorkshire Electricity, British Telecommunications and Schlumberger Industries. The latter supplies the meter interface unit (MIU) which converts the data from the meters to a central database via the telephone network. A subscriber line access controller (Slac) calls the MIU when instructed by the companies' computers to read the meters. Four ports on the MIU enable four different meters to be read. The Yorkshire trial is using just two. The trial uses technology developed by BT which enables the telephone lines to convey data without ringing. The aim is to leave customers blissfully unaware that their telephone lines are involved in any activity. If a customer uses the telephone while the meter is being read, the call from the utility will automatically end. No call from an electricity company will delay a call for an ambulance, for example. The introduction of the no-ring facility, which negates the usual ringing current of normal calls, has required a big investment by BT and involved large-scale infrastructure changes. The costs of installation have been kept down because the facility has been installed at the same time as other BT developments, such as being able to identify a caller. Changes both to the telephone exchanges and the software used in digital exchanges have been implemented. BT plans to install this 'no-ring' facility on most of its 25m lines before the start of next year when it will be available for commercial use. Future applications could include equipment monitoring and control for photocopying machines and a 'home automation' system whereby heating, lighting and security can be checked automatically. But, says Andrew Batchelor, services development manager at BT: 'We are focusing on the utility sector as our first market. This is because the utilities have a more pressing requirement to have some technology available to help them out of a commercial difficulty.' This 'pressing requirement' felt by the water and electricity industries is the need to cut costs before forthcoming large-scale reviews by industry regulators. Both reviews will consider pricing controls and will take into account the companies' ability to cut costs and improve efficiency. The onus after the reviews will be on both industries to prove to investors that they can still increase dividends based, among other things, on continuing to cut costs. The Yorkshire trial is one of a number involving utilities, particularly electricity companies, and automatic meter reading. Joint ventures such as the one in Yorkshire also point to a move towards multi-utilities with one company providing both electricity and water. A few smaller multi-utilities in the US are testing the use of telecommunications for meter reading. But Peter Harrie, marketing manager at Schlumberger Industries, says the scale of the potential market in the UK - which has some of the biggest utilities in the world - makes the Yorkshire trial particularly exciting. The City appears to be watching signs of such closer co-operation with great interest. Robert Miller-Bakewell, utilities analyst at NatWest Securities, predicts that there will be seven multi-function utilities in the UK by 1997. 'We will see a move towards more multi-function utilities in the UK, perhaps along the lines of those in the US but probably bigger. One of the things driving this forward is the need to cut costs and eliminate the overlap.' Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett, also foresees closer co-operation at both operating and management levels. 'In terms of billing, for example, telecoms must be in a pole position for utilities.' But there are still a number of questions concerning the cost-effectiveness of automatic metering. The meters used in this system are more expensive than traditional ones and costs will not come down until they are produced and used in bulk. Most industry analysts accept that the 'man in a van' system with an engineer making regular, if infrequent, readings will remain cost-effective until 'special' reads need to be carried out. These include returns to homes where nobody was in or an address changes. Having a qualified member of staff visiting premises has other advantages, although as Harrie says: 'Some people find it difficult arranging a convenient time for their meter to be read and others don't like strange people coming into their homes anyway.' Proponents of the scheme argue that 'added value services' should be added to any cost benefit analysis. For utilities' customers, improvements could include the elimination of estimated bills, immediate informed response on queries and complaints, and flexible tariffing and billing. The electricity industry already sells energy to big industrial users in 30-minute lots that could be accurately gauged with such advanced metering. The system will also enable water companies to detect leaks more easily and to prepare load profiles of customers. A shared billing system between the water and electricity companies could lead to shared information about bad-debt customers. In the Yorkshire trial, each utility has access only to its own meters but the possibility of utilities sharing information is likely to cause alarm. 'This is certainly a complex subject, which is why nobody is rushing into it and why we're having trials to see how customers react to having their phones used in this way,' says Batchelor. 'We're taking this fairly slowly, although we have been impressed by the reaction so far,' he adds. Yorkshire Water is also tentative. 'Our main aim is improving services. We are not doing this purely for the sake of new technology.'   Companies:-  Yorkshire Water.     Yorkshire Electricity Group.     British Telecommunications.     Schlumberger Industries.

0,FT924-6162 ,"FT924-6162 _AN-CKWCKACOFT 921123   FT  23 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK utilities   With strong balance sheets and improving cash flows, UK utilities have very different finances from their foreign counterparts. Gearing for the UK regional electricity companies varies between 5 per cent and 30 per cent, while US electricity utilities typically have gearing between 50 per cent and 100 per cent. Interest cover is also higher in the UK than elsewhere. BT's operating income covers its interest payments more than 11 times, that for the US 'baby bells' only between 3 and 4 times. Comparisons with continental firms are even more startling. By the second half of the decade many UK utilities will have substantial net cash and while privatised UK firms arguably face competition, they could still run happily with higher levels of debt. The anomaly arises because the companies were sold as though they were conventional businesses expecting to earn reasonable returns in a competitive market. Their restructured balance sheets reflected this, but profits have increased much faster than expected partly because competition has evolved slowly and their capacity to cut costs was higher than had been thought. BT's return on capital employed is now 21.4 per cent, compared to an average 11.4 per cent for the 'baby bells'. Higher gearing might improve returns for shareholders, but that would depend on what the companies did with the borrowed money. British Gas and the electricity generators can make a case for investing in areas of expertise such as exploration and production and power generation overseas. BT and the regional electricity companies might consider returning the cash to shareholders before it burns a hole in the directors' pockets.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

During the past  several years mankind has come to understand that fossil energy  resource reserves are limited and that pollution from fossil  energy resources has obviously destroyed the equilibrium between  global space and the overall ecology on which mankind depends  for its existence and that non-polluting new energy resources  and renewable energy resources are truly energy resources on  which it can rely.    Wind energy is a clean and renewable inexhaustible energy  resource. Through more than 10 years of research and  development, the technology is maturing and the economic and  social benefits are apparent (the price of wind-generated  electricity in the United States is $0.06 to $0.07 per kWh and  will drop to $0.04 by the year 2000). As a result, the developed  countries are competing to develop it and are investing large  amounts of capital, formulating several medium and long-term  development programs, and establishing all types of  organizations to conduct RD (such as Denmark's (Lisuo) Wind  Powered Generator Experiment Station, the United States Wind  Energy Association, the Japan Wind Energy Association, the  European Wind Energy Assocation, etc.). At the same time, all  countries are competing to formulate the associated policies  such as providing tax exemptions for private capital investments  in wind energy in the United States and requiring that electric  power companies purchase wind-generated electricity from  wind-powered generating fields, and the implementation of a  one-third subsidy from the state in Denmark for private  purchases of wind-powered generators and permitting the sale of  electricity to electric power companies.    Wind energy development and utilization in China has always  been a concern of the state and several key wind energy projects  were included among projects to attack key ST problems  during  the Sixth 5-Year Plan, Seventh 5-Year Plan, and Eighth 5-Year  Plan.    China has now established an ST and production staff  of more  than 3,000 people, and we have established several 10 production  plants (producing small-scale and large and medium-sized  wind-powered machinery) with an annual small-scale wind-powered  generator production capacity of 30,000 units, and development  and production of 55 kW, 120 kW, and 200 kW wind-powered  generators is now in progress. China as a whole has now extended  120,000 small wind-powered generators and we have nine  medium-sized and small wind-powered generating fields under  construction. China's wind-powered installed generating capacity  is now more than 20MW. As part of it, Inner Mongolia and  Xinjiang have made enormous contributions to small wind-powered  generator and large wind-powered generator demonstration,  extension, and application.    China's wind energy development and utilization can be  divided overall into four phases: Phase 1 involved the  development of small 10 kW and smaller wind-powered generators.  Phase 2 involved the commercialization, batch production, and  extension of small wind-powered generators. Phase 3 involved the  development of medium-sized 10 kW to 100 kW wind-powered  generators. The present Phase 4 involves batch production of  medium-sized wind-powered generators and the development of  large (100 kW and up) wind-powered generators. The commercial  wind-powered generators that China is now capable of producing  in batch amounts are: 100 W, 150 W, 200 W, 250 W, 300 W, 500 W,  1 kW, 3 kW, 5 kW, 20 kW, 30 kW, 40 kW, 55 kW, and 120 kW  generators. China will be capable of small-batch production of  the 200 kW wind-powered generators it developed around the end  of 1995 to improve the situation of using foreign-made  generators in our nine wind-powered generating fields in Inner  Mongolia, Xinjiang, Liaoning, Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong,  Zhejiang, and other locations.    Moreover, China has developed its own eight varieties of  wind-powered water-raising machinery with a maximum flow rate of  up to 120 to 200 tons per hour and a maximum lifting height of  140 meters, and the performance of certain devices has now  attained international levels. Applications of China's  wind-powered water raising machinery have already produced  rather good economic results. For example, using FDG-7  wind-powered water lifters for two-stage water raising in salt  fields can conserve over 10,000 kWh of electricity annually for  a savings of about 6,000 yuan. Wind-powered water lifting  machinery used in the Tianjin region has produced very good  economic results in desalination of vegetable fields and they  are now making major efforts to extend them.    China is a developing country with a large population, vast  territory, and shortages of energy resources. The development of  new energy resources is a strategic shift for energy resources  and can produce real benefits. Given China's technical  capabilities, developing wind energy is certainly not something  that cannot be attained. China's famous scientist Qian Xueseng  [6929 1331 2773] wrote to the China Wind Energy Technology  Development Center in 1991 describing the world's major efforts  at present to develop wind energy and China's broad prospects  for wind energy development and saying that we must develop them  in a major way instead of just piddling around.    In June 1991, at the Wind Energy Construction Planning  Conference held by the Ministry of Energy Resources, Minister  Huang Yicheng [7806 3015 6134] pointed out that ""developing wind  energy requires that we foster everyone's initiative and that we  get organized, improve our understanding of using wind power to  generate electricity, and focus on wind-powered electricity  generation as one force in overall electric power construction.""    According to preliminary plans by the Ministry of Energy  Resources, we will strive for an increase of 120 to 200MW a  year. To achieve this objective, given China's existing wind  energy technical forces, we should take the route of  self-development, which means organizing China's wind energy  experts on our existing technical foundation in a planned  manner, absorbing the essence of advanced generators from  foreign countries, developing large generators that conform to  China's national conditions, and engaging in cooperation as  appropriate with foreign businesses that are willing to provide  technology as well as expanding the proportion of  domestically-manufactured components and attaining a complete  shift to domestic production. In the long term, some of our  products should satisfy domestic demand and some of them should  be exported to developing countries to attain a foreign exchange  balance in the entire process. We must watch out that all  departments do not engage in blind importing without conducting  economic analysis. The State Science and Technology Commission  and other ministries and commissions should control imports and,  except in cases that have state permission, we should focus on  protecting our own nascent industry, and the State Science and  Technology Commission should increase its investments in wind  energy RD. The State Economics and Trade Commission should  increase its investments in the wind-powered machinery industry  and strive to attain a domestic production rate of 80 percent  for the wind-powered generators in China's wind-powered  generating fields by 2000 to change the present lopsided  development situation.    Currently, the international price of large wind-powered  generators is about $900 to $1,000 per kW whereas the price of  small domestic hydropower generators is 3,000 yuan renminbi per  kW, so when they are being produced in large batches the price  of China's large wind-powered generators could be 4,000 to 5,000  yuan renminbi and each kWh of electricity about 0.04 yuan  (large-scale development of wind energy would be best among new  energy resources), so it would be entirely capable of competing  with thermal power in regions that have electric power  shortages. Wind-powered electricity on Nan'ao, Guangdong, has  been welcomed by the local electric power bureau and the Nan'ao  Island Electric Power company can sustain its existence now by  selling electricity generated by wind power. Thus, we can affirm  that with the state's guidance the development of wind energy  will produce real benefits.     "

Pool - or spot market - prices in England and Wales would also be critical in determining the future profitability of the two companies, the prospectus said. Hydro-Electric, the smaller of the two companies, was more forceful than ScottishPower about exporting electricity. Mr Roger Young, chief executive, told a London press conference yesterday: 'Virtually all our profit growth will come from generation and supply.' Since the industry was restructured last March, both companies' electricity sales have increased significantly, the prospectus shows. Hydro-Electric's sales have grown from 7.4m megawatt-hours in the year ending March 1990, to 10.1m MW-hours this financial year. ScottishPower's sales have increased from 19.8m to 21.9m over the same period. In both cases the increase stemmed largely from increased sales outside the companies' area. Hydro-Electric was also more assertive about competing in the electricity market, selling directly to large industrial customers in England and Wales. It has won 11 contracts to supply 39 customers outside its region. ScottishPower, which has been less openly aggressive, won contracts to supply 10 customers outside its area, and has since lost two. It will consider alternatives to direct sales, in particular selling to the pool in England and Wales, the company said. ScottishPower was cautious about the future of prices to large customers, which it believed might fall significantly. If that happened, the company said, it may become uneconomic to supply those customers. Both companies said they expected to make considerable cost savings in the generation business, particularly because they will have lower cost gas-fired generation from mid 1992, when gas from the North Sea Miller field will be available to supply the power station at Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, whose output they share. Mr Young gave a warning that the quantity of Miller gas that would be delivered was one of a number of uncertainties faced by Hydro-Electric. Another risk was the plan by both companies to upgrade the interconnector, which connects the Scottish grid to the National Grid in England and Wales. ScottishPower said it expected demand for electricity to bring some natural growth to its other main business, the transmission and distribution of electricity to end customers. This 'wires' business, which is generally regarded as stable and predictable, represents 70 per cent of ScottishPower's operating profit, but only 45 per cent of Hydro-Electric's, the prospectus disclosed. Hydro-Electric said its distribution business should continue to make a substantial contribution to profits, but it was vulnerable to growing competition from gas. About 52 per cent of end users in the company's area were served by a natural gas network compared with 84 per cent in the UK overall, the company said. Unlike the 12 electricity companies of England and Wales, the distribution businesses of the Scottish companies will not be able automatically to increase revenues by raising prices. The 'x factors' that regulate how much they can increase prices on top of inflation every year are much lower - at 0.2 for each company - than their southern rivals.

The three regional companies, giving evidence to a Commons committee on energy, also supported growing calls for the government to postpone liberalisation of the electricity market from 1994. Southern Electricity said that maintaining the existing levels for competition, where only large customers have a choice of who supplies them, would allow British Coal to secure a five-year contract for 55m tonnes in 1993-94 and 45 tonnes thereafter. That is 15m tonnes a year more than the proposed current contract between British Coal and the generators and could help to keep more than 10 pits open. Norweb's call for a break-up of National Power and PowerGen into five separate companies reflects resentment among the regional companies over generators' pricing policies since privatisation two years ago. Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, said his company was concerned that the present structure of the bulk electricity market did not allow sufficient competition, and even after all independent gas-fired power stations were built they would supply only 13 per cent of the market. Mr Harvey said his company suspected that National Power and PowerGen were keeping back 3 per cent, or about Pounds 100m, of the benefits of lower coal prices. He said the same regulatory framework that applied to the regional companies' supply businesses should be applied to the generators. Mr Duncan Ross, chairman of Southern, said independent power plants were the only means to get strong down-ward pressure on generators' prices. Yorkshire Electricity said a larger and more secure franchise (non-competitive market) should not result in higher prices to customers. It said there was obvious scope for monopolistic profits to be made in the absence of generator competition. Yorkshire also suggested a one-year interim contract between British Coal, the generators and the regional companies while regulatory and contractual issues were resolved.

When the small group of enthusiasts started restoring the windmill as a retirement project in 1974 they thought it would be a five- or six-year task. The mill is Victorian, it stands 75ft and when it was built it was the most up-to-date in the Vale of Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire. In 1984 the group decided not to hold a tenth birthday celebration as there was so little visible progress. Nine years later they are in a jubilant mood, as they have just completed the massive task of building and erecting the four 30ft wood and canvas sails, each weighing a ton. Last weekend the sails turned successfully and tomorrow, Sunday, to celebrate National Mills Day there will be tours of the mill and a photographic exhibition inside. 'Who knows, we might be milling in time for the millennium,' said the project leader, architect Patrick Tooms. At 61 Tooms is one of the younger members of the group. They hope to complete the task in four to five years, and that they will be able to achieve this using entirely voluntary labour without exceeding the original budget of Pounds 15,000. They have spent some Pounds 13,000, of which about three quarters came in grants from various public bodies and the New Horizon trust, which supports unusual activities by retired people. 'Heroic' would be a fitting word for some of the efforts of the restorers, for whom the first task was to rebuild from scratch the huge wooden gallery that surrounds the building at a height of 35ft, without the use of a scaffold. One of the next jobs was rebuilding the top few courses of brick-work so that they could start restoring the mechanism that allows the giant metal cap to rotate on a circular metal track on top of the walls. 'At the time we had a psychiatrist working with us whose hobby was bricklaying,' Tooms said. 'But that wasn't the only mad thing we have got up to.' Perhaps the maddest thing of all was building the mill in the first place. It is picturesquely but impractically sited in the lee of the hill that forms a backcloth to the village. It was this situation, coupled with the fact that the mill never worked very efficiently, that meant the basic structure of the building was in such good condition when the group started the restoration. Although the mill, the tallest in Buckinghamshire, was equipped with all the latest technology when it was completed in 1832, the one thing it always lacked was a good blow. So after a working life of some 50 years - latterly assisted by a huge steam engine - it was abandoned. It remained in that state, an eyecatching relic, until the late 1960s, when the parish council decided the community would benefit if it could be restored. 'Today people jokingly suggest that our main achievement has been to add value to every house in the village as the mill now adds so much to the character of the place,' Tooms said. 'Until we recog much of the main spur wheel - one of the major remaining tasks - and get all the machinery working, we shan't know whether there's enough wind to grind corn. It's a case of suck it and see,' said Tooms' right hand man, retired airline pilot Gordon Rodwell, 70. Nevertheless the great task continues every Sunday. The total workforce numbers nine, though there are never more than seven present at the weekly work sessions. The oldest member is retired sales executive Denis Moreton, 80, the youngest, and the only one who is not retired or semi-retired, is carpenter Bob Bleasdale, 40. There is an air of optimism in the group, and as part of the transition from millwrights to millers they plan to pay a joint visit to one or two of the four commercial working windmills in the country. 'We shall soon be able to run the machinery and see what happens,' Tooms said. 'We are used to taking one thing at a time, so no setback is too catastrophic. With an average age in the group of 63 all we hope is that we are all alive to see the end result]' Quainton Mill is open from 10am-1pm on Sundays.

0,FT944-6824 ,"FT944-6824 _AN-EK1C5ACXFT 941128   FT  28 NOV 94 / A chip or two off the old barriers: Michael Smith explains why progress in opening up Europe's energy markets has been slow      By MICHAEL SMITH   Five years after launching a campaign to liberalise Europe's energy markets, the European Commission has made only limited progress in increasing competition among electricity and gas producers. Amid concern over the effects on consumers of dismantling what are in many cases state-owned monopolies, many energy companies have stubbornly resisted attempts to open up the market. Liberalising markets will be high on the agenda when European Union energy ministers meet in Brussels tomorrow. The Commission regards the creation of a free market in power and gas as one of the most important elements in creating a single market for goods and services. 'How can you ask, say, the chemicals or metals industries to compete without access to energy on similar conditions?' asks Mr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, director-general of the EU competition directorate. 'What is at stake is the credibility of the internal market and the competitiveness of European industry.' One reason for the slow progress in liberalising European energy markets is the relative lack of competitive or public pressure. The need to deregulate parts of the telecommunications market was clear to most EU member states, as technological changes made existing national and European regulations less relevant. And consumer pressure for cheaper air fares encouraged progress in the airlines industry. In the absence of such pressures, there are powerful lobbies against greater competition. National energy monopolies have encouraged their customers to believe that change in gas and electricity markets might threaten safe delivery of supplies and push up prices. To many consumers, the scope for competition looks limited because it makes no sense to have rival electricity grids and gas pipe networks. There is also opposition to change from the workforces in the gas and electricity companies, which amount to 1m people in the EU. Concern about potential job losses is heightened by the experience of the UK electricity market, one of the first to be deregulated, where some companies have shed more than half their staff. A single energy market would not necessarily break up large integrated monopolies. But it would remove their monopoly rights to gen-erate power and supply it to the customer. The Commission argues that such competition would make utilities more efficient: prices would fall and become more uniform across the Union. It has adopted a two-pronged approach for achieving this. The first prong involved forcing countries to end statutory monopolies enjoyed by national utilities to import and export gas and electricity, which the Commission says are illegal under EU law. Several cases are progressing through the courts, though none has yet concluded. The second prong is legislation to improve competition within member states. A proposed directive, first drafted in 1992, would require energy companies to 'unbundle' themselves, by separating the financial accounts of their production, transport and distribution arms. This would make it more difficult for these companies to subsidise loss-making parts of their businesses out of the profits from their monopoly over distribution of energy. New companies would then find it easier to enter the market, if they could see that they were able to undercut the energy utilities in particular parts of the business. The main stumbling block to agreement on the directive is what is known as 'third party access', obliging energy companies to allow competitors to use their networks for an 'appropriate' charge. Thus PowerGen, the privatised UK generator, could supply electricity to French industrial companies through the French national grid. Currently, if it wants to export to France, PowerGen can do this only by selling power to Electricite de France, the monopoly power company. Third-party access is opposed by most European power and gas companies, with the support of many members of the European Parliament and some of the larger governments. They argue that energy needs special protection from competition, because of the size of investment needed in the industries. Long-term planning would be more difficult if they were subjected to full competition, endangering security of supply, at a cost to at least some customers. There are also fears of cherry-picking - that large energy users might be picked off by foreign energy companies, leaving the national company with the less profitable users. In Italy there are fears that if other countries were to supply large energy users in the north, the poorer south could be left to shoulder the costs of the indigenous system. And companies in countries such as Germany and Belgium fear they could not compete with their counterparts in, say, France, because of different regulatory, taxation and social regimes. Some German companies say they are not against third-party access in principle, and are as efficient as their foreign competitors. But their prices are higher as a result of an obligation to buy expensive German coal. Similarly, Mr Michel Loncour, a strategy manager at Tractebel, the Belgian energy company, says that competition will be unfair if companies operate under different national rules: 'Europe needs harmonisation on issues like environmental protection, the security of nuclear plants, taxation, subsidies and the cost of capital,' he says. The Commission is currently considering a common energy policy for Europe, but agreement is politically difficult and some years away. That offers little immediate help in creating a free energy market. The Commission could consider formulating a final directive around the concessions already made by opponents of more reform. For instance, most countries would probably agree to unbundling the accounts of electricity monopolies and introduce competitive tendering for new plants. In an attempt to win agreement on third-party access, the Commission has agreed the idea of a 'negotiated', rather than automatic, right to access to power networks. This would allow host companies to refuse access on the grounds that security of supply could be threatened, with an arbitration system for disputes - a compromise that most of those in favour of liberalisation would consider accepting. However, opponents to reform think even 'negotiated third-party access' goes too far. Some, including the French, want to introduce a concept of a 'single buyer' as an alternative to third-party access. Under this arrangement, deals between electricity users and foreign suppliers would have to be reached through the host country's transmission system operator, which would be the sole purchaser of electricity supplies within that country. Reformers, already concerned about the concession on 'negotiated' third-party access, believe the single buyer concept would lead to little change. 'If too much is conceded, the introduction of competition could be logjammed for a decade,' says Mr John Baker, chief executive of the UK's National Power generation company. 'It may be preferable to wait three or four years, since a delay might enable them to get the important principles through.' Free-marketeers like Mr Baker believe that liberalisation is inevitable: increasingly, countries such as Italy, Spain and the Netherlands are starting to deregulate their energy industries. In Germany, once a strong opponent of change, supporters of third-party access include Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister. In addition, the Nordic countries that will join the EU next year are likely to support liberalisation, since they have already deregulated their energy markets. Nonetheless, the scale of opposition means that real progress on liberalisation could take years rather than months.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

The decision by the national executive of the SPD was immediately condemned by leaders of the governing coalition as undermining the fundamental development prospects of the German economy. It throws into doubt the year-long efforts to negotiate a cross-party 'energy consensus' intended to provide a clear framework for the investment plans of the energy industry, including both domestic coal mining and nuclear power. It also calls into question the long-term future of the German coal industry, which has survived so far on a mixture of direct subsidy paid by electricity consumers and cross-subsidies from nuclear power paid by the electricity generators. The SPD, which controls the governments of several key states in the federal republic where nuclear plants operate, also declared its determination to switch from reprocessing nuclear waste - in Britain and France - to direct disposal. However, the party leadership has left open the question of how long the present generation of nuclear plants may be allowed to operate, thus giving Germany's electricity generators a chance to plan the gradual abandonment of nuclear energy. It also set no timescale for the switch from reprocessing to direct disposal, for which there are no sites currently available in Germany. In spite of its decision, the SPD remains divided on the nuclear issue. While the environmental wing of the party is fiercely opposed, those who come from coal-mining areas, like the Ruhr, are sympathetic. They believe that Germany's expensive domestic coal industry can only be guaranteed a long-term future if its high cost can be offset by the much cheaper supply of nuclear-generated power. The SPD decision was announced after the party's national executive rejected a compromise put forward by Mr Gerhard Schroder, the prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony, allowing a continuing 'nuclear option'. The decision amounts to a severe blow to Germany's nuclear power plant manufacturers, led by Siemens KWU, but a compromise with which the two main electricity generators, RWE and Veba, can live. The third main power generator, the Munich-based Bayernwerk, is heavily committed to nuclear energy, and therefore strongly opposed to any non-nuclear option. Without a cross-party compromise on energy, the power generators say they have no clear framework for their long-term power station planning. Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, who negotiated the compromise with Mr Schroder, expressed his regret at the SPD decision. 'I cannot see how, under these circumstances, a energy consensus can still be achieved,' he said. Negotiations scheduled for tonight will still go ahead, he said. 'Failure of the talks would be a bitter setback for Germany's economic base, for which the SPD would be responsible.'   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT924-12136 ,"FT924-12136 _AN-CJVB5AC3FT 921022   FT  22 OCT 92 / Search for a balance of power: A review of Britain's energy policy must overcome past mistakes and economic constraints      By DAVID LASCELLES   Tumultuous events have forced the government to launch a review of UK energy policy only days after it tried to shut down half of the coal industry. But as Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the Board of Trade, sets about his task he must already know that it is deeply unenviable. Few, if any, of the possible courses of action before him are free of pain, and none are without a heavy financial cost. Set against the background of the UK's deeply depressed economy and the Treasury's tight constraints on public spending, whatever answers he does come up with will be heavily tinged by the short-term view. This augurs badly for an industry in which time scales are measured in decades. It is bound to go against the thrust of the government's own free market policies. Not that Mr Heseltine has a shortage of options. As the most fuel-rich country in Europe, the UK has the flexibility to develop an energy balance from a wide range of sources: coal, gas, oil, nuclear, even - given the British Isles' long coastline - wind and tidal power. But that is not the only balance to be struck. If reversing some of the pit closures means keeping open uneconomic mines, Mr Heseltine will also have to decide how the extra costs are to be paid for. Will they fall on the taxpayer, or the consumer of electricity? If the answer requires intervention from on high, how is that to be squared with the government's commitment to a free market? And how far can it tinker with one element of the tightly interlinked energy balance without upsetting all the others? Mr Heseltine's difficulties have a long history. Some of them stem from past mistakes, such as the decision in the 1960s to develop a nuclear power industry using the wrong technology, or a tendency to build unnecessary power stations in order to meet a short-term expedient. But many of them also relate to the government's own attempts to create a competitive market, a process which still has some way to go and has accumulated its own errors. Today, the UK has an energy market where only one fuel - oil - is relatively free. Gas is becoming freer since privatisation and is finding a new role as a power generation fuel, though the monopoly of British Gas remains a fact of life in much of the market. Electricity, privatised two years ago, is a duopoly of generators plus a string of regional monopolies where the barriers to full competition will only be removed in stages up to 1998. Nuclear power receives more than Pounds 1bn a year in subsidies, but the government plans to review its future in 1994, and phase the subsidies out by 1998. Coal also receives heavy subsidies, though in the form of artificially high prices from the electricity industry rather than state hand-outs. The government's original intention was to reduce coal to a commercially viable size next year so that it could start supplying coal at competitive prices and keep up the steady process of deregulation. If that process is now to be slowed, it will have knock-on effects throughout the electricity industry, in nuclear power, and also in gas. Mr Heseltine's real challenge is to find a way of enlarging coal's share of the market - or at least slowing its steady decline - in a way which causes the least damage to other sectors, particularly the electricity industry. But he will also want to keep alive the ultimate policy goal of a competitive market. The main reason for coal's steady decline is its high cost - and to some extent its dirtiness. This means that coal's immediate future depends either on subsidy, or on driving out fuels which are even more expensive, or on inhibiting competition from cheaper sources of power. It also means compromises on the environmental front - which may be the easiest aspect to the problem given the low place which greenery holds on the political agenda in a recession. The power industry is already buzzing with possibilities. A relatively easy step would be for Mr Heseltine to delay the next stage in the deregulation of the electricity industry. At the moment, the market has two tiers: the 'free' market for large customers using over 1MW of power a year where any supplier can compete, and the franchise market which is the monopoly of the regional distributors, and where most coal-based power is sold. In 1994, the threshold of the free market is due to be lowered to 100KW - effectively extending it from the country's 5,000 largest customers to the next 50,000. By preserving the present structure Mr Heseltine would create more long-term certainty, and give the regional distributors a reason to commit themselves to buy more coal-based electricity. By one power industry estimate, he could raise coal demand by 8m tonnes a year, enough to keep eight pits open and save 8,000 of the 30,000 jobs at risk. The beauty from Mr Heseltine's point of view is that the cost of this would be hidden in higher-than-necessary household electricity bills. But it would require him to intervene with Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity market regulator, and postpone the deregulatory process, something that could harm the electricity industry as well as the consumer. 'Competition has entered the market, and is here to stay,' said Mr Ed Wallis, the chief executive of PowerGen yesterday. 'We would rather have competition than direct regulatory direction.' A further possibility would be to accelerate the retirement of the UK's older nuclear reactors. Nuclear has grown rapidly to 20 per cent of the market and has the advantage of not producing emissions. But it is a loss-making industry, and for consistency's sake should be subjected to the same discipline as coal. Closing the old reactors would create space in the market for about 9m tonnes of coal a year at the cost of relatively few jobs. However the substantial decommissioning costs would have to be borne by the Treasury and would be less easy to hide. Again, it would mean interfering with the timetable and pre-empting the long-promised 1994 nuclear review. Although many of the problems which are currently facing the coal industry have been blamed on the 'dash for gas' by power generators, Mr Heseltine's ability to call a halt to this trend is limited. For one thing, the true competitive position of gas vis-a-vis coal is hard to ascertain because the crucial figures are closely held commercial secrets, and the case for halting it is far from proven. Short of revoking licences for new gas power stations, his only course of action is to intervene once again with Prof Littlechild to enforce the electricity companies' obligations to buy power at the best possible price. Even then, Prof Littlechild could not order the closure of the gas stations; he could only penalise companies for using them. The outcome of all of this is bound to be a compromise which will save some miners' jobs at the cost of higher tax or electricity bills. But the exercise will not have been entirely futile if it brings greater clarity to some of the more fundamental issues which are involved in UK energy policy. It is already clear, for example, that trying to create a free market in energy - one area where the UK is a world leader - is much less simple than the government thought when it embarked on the exercise in the late 1980s. Mr Michael Grubb, an energy expert at the Royal Institute for International Affairs, said yesterday: 'The whole debate shows that energy cannot be treated as an area where government has no role. It is too regulated, too strategic, too close to the national interest.' The two most unwelcome results of deregulation have been a surge in power station construction to the point where the UK could have 30 per cent more capacity than it needs, and a sharp rise in fuel imports. These both have a similar cause: the private sector managements were unhappy with the structure of the state-owned businesses which they inherited. They are now taking solutions into their own hands by importing cheaper fuels than the UK can produce itself, and developing their own power sources. Is this the price of change, or should government take a stronger leading role? Mr Patrick Lane of Oxford Economic Research Associates believes that it is the inevitable result of 'holding back the water' in the energy business. But these trends look worrying to many people and will strengthen the case for more central direction. Among those pressing for a more active government role are two leading academic energy specialists, Nigel Lucas and Ian Fells, who called in a report yesterday for the creation of an Energy Commission to assign responsibility for planning electricity capacity and choosing fuels. They argue for an energy policy driven by wider considerations: for example, greater use of coal by power stations where the environmental effects can be localised, and saving gas for other uses. On the other hand, recent events have rekindled memories among older power industry hands of the damage done by earlier government interventions - the very events which gave Britain an inefficient power industry and provided the impetus to the privatisation drive. Indeed, Mr Heseltine's efforts to save miners' jobs may have wide public support, but they could well introduce fresh distortions into the energy market. 'The old employment-led energy policy is reasserting itself,' says Mr Jonathan Stern, a specialist in the gas industry. 'Keeping people in work is a worthy aim, but I thought that the whole ethos had changed.' Perhaps Mr Heseltine's strongest justification for trying to influence the energy balance would be if he could come up with a good long term case for coal. The national interest argument is certainly strong, and environmental objections can be eased with promises of major advances in clean coal technology. But the economic currents running in coal's favour are not strong, at least in Europe, because of cost and the emergence of more attractive alternatives. 'Coal is a declining fuel throughout the western world, and will continue to be so,' says Mr Grubb. To challenge this view Mr Heseltine would have to abandon his own claim that the economic case against coal is 'unanswerable', and that seems most unlikely.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     UK ENERGY POLICY: TOUGH CHOICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Power generation fuels  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- thousand tonnes                     1985      1990       1995est    2000est    20005est  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Coal               42,149    47,876      45,501     43,034     41,658 Oil                11,652     7,684       7,058      4,238      2,544 Gas                 1,201     1,567       5,914     14,133     18,936 Renewable  Other       0       436         424        605        885  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total              55,003    57,564      58,896     62,009     64,022  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: EC Commission  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "
0,FT941-15570 ,"FT941-15570 _AN-EANDNACYFT 940114   FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (1): Power station will cut pollution - The impact of the FGD units will be felt throughout Britain and, to a lesser extent other parts of Europe which have long complained about the acid rain emanating from the UK      By MICHAEL SMITH   Mr Barry Fincham and his colleagues at National Power were not impressed when a party of Japanese visitors to the Drax power station in the early 1980s suggested they followed their example and built facilities to lower sulphur emissions. 'We all thought it was a bit of a joke,' he recalls. They have had to change their minds. A decade or so later Mr Fincham has just completed his 33-year career in the electricity industry with a six-year stint overseeing the construction of the flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) units which the Japanese recommended. The Pounds 700m project passed its first milestone recently, just before Mr Fincham retired, when Babcock, the largest contractor, handed over to National Power the first two of the six FGD units which are scheduled to be built by 1996. The construction of the units is not the kind of story which can capture the public imagination in the way that, say, the Channel Tunnel, has. But its environmental and economic impact has been, and will be, felt throughout the country and, to a lesser extent other parts of Europe, including Scandinavia, which have long complained of the acid rain emanating from the UK. The size of Drax, named after a small village near the site in north Yorkshire, means that almost anything coming out of or affecting the power station has widespread consequences. It is western Europe's biggest coal-fired power station, generating about 10 per cent of England and Wales's electricity needs or enough electricity to satisfy the needs of half of inner London. Design, construction and manufacture of the FGDs constitutes one of the largest environmental projects in the world. Building the FGDs has provided employment for 2,500 people with peak activity requiring 1,700 employees on site. More than 90 companies have been involved with contracts ranging from hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Pounds 420m of work undertaken by Babcock. For some companies the project has been a turning point. 'Drax has set us on our feet again,' says Mr Ivan Harris, engineering director of Birtley Engineering which had a Pounds 25m contract to build the materials handling system for the project. 'It put us on the map as a mechanical handler and has given us the references to win contracts elsewhere including Saudi Arabia.' The fact that Birtley, Babcock and other contractors were able to pass the first stage of the contract into National Power's hands on time and within budget will be seen as a significant achievement for British industry, and one that perhaps 10 years ago would have been unimaginable on such a large-scale project. Days lost through industrial action on the project amounted to less than 0.25 per cent. But while the project - and allied programmes to reduce nitrous oxide emissions - has been welcome for an economy which was either in recession or growing slowly for much of the past six years, its most long-lasting effects are likely to be on the environment . Fitting the FGD units will cut 90 per cent of the more than 250,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide which are emitted from the plant each year. It will also make a hefty contribution to the UK's target of reducing emissions to 60 per cent of 1980 levels by 2003, as part of a worldwide effort to reduce the acid rain which causes such environmental damage. If the coal lobby were to have its way, National Power and PowerGen, the other main generator in England and Wales, would follow the lead of their counterparts in western Germany and fit FGDs to each of their coal-fired power stations. That would give a far better chance of survival both for the 25 remaining coal-fired stations and the remnants of the coal industry which in the past 18 months has shrunk from 50 to 22 pits. If current trends continue - that is, if gas-fired electricity and nuclear power increase their market shares as expected - there will be about 15 coal-fired power stations by the end of the century and no more than a handful of pits to service them. The chances of FGDs being fitted to any more than Drax and two or three other coal-fired stations are remote. Later in the decade, National Power may consider building more FGD units for burning Orimulsion, a bitumen-based fuel imported from Venezuela, but it is unlikely to add any to its 17 coal-fired stations other than Drax. PowerGen, with seven coal-fired stations, is already building an FGD plant to clean about 2,000 megawatts of electricity at its Ratcliffe power station, but there are doubts that it will fulfil the strong indications given in its flotation prospectus three years ago that it would build a similar facility at its Ferrybridge C power station. Although the government has said it expects PowerGen to fit 4,000MW of FGD, the company is likely to argue that it should be relieved of any obligation at Ferrybridge because of the contribution it is making to cutting sulphur emissions by replacing coal-burning stations with gas-fired plants which are more environmentally friendly. 'We will continue to make future investment decisions on a step-by-step basis as emission targets and market circumstances require,' the company says. When Scottish Power was privatised, the company anticipated building 2,000MW of FGD at its Longannet power plant but there are strong doubts both at the company and among environmentalists about the worth of doing so because of the low sulphur content of Scottish coal. One possibility is that Scottish Power be relieved of some of the requirement on it to reduce sulphur content in return for contributing financially to an FGD construction in England and Wales. The generators' reluctance to commit themselves to anything other than Drax and Ratcliffe is explained by the cost. National Power says the Drax FGD will add 0.6p a unit to the cost of producing electricity which compares with about 2.6p per unit for power traded in England and Wales's wholesale electricity pool. It argues it cannot simply pass all of this through to the customer because that would lead to its losing market share to new independent companies producing electricity from combined cycle gas turbine generators. The company's critics say National Power can afford to absorb the cost increases following its stronger-than-expected financial performance since privatisation and the value to the company of coal contracts agreed with British Coal earlier this year. Whatever the arguments, Mr Granville Camsey, National Power executive director for group technology, says the company is willing to pay a price for the environment. 'Any industrial enterprise that doesn't take responsibility for the environment will lose out,' he says. 'Increasingly towards the end of the decade, investors will choose companies with high profiles on the environment. You can no longer afford to take a de minimis approach.' But Mr Camsey also acknowledges that National Power would be unable to satisfy the requirements of the government's pollution inspectorate on reducing sulphur emissions had it not constructed the Drax FGD. Its construction of gas-fired power stations, which produce virtually no sulphur, are unlikely to be enough. Drax employees are unlikely to be too concerned about the motives of National Power and the Central Electricity Generating Board, its predecessor prior to electricity privatisation, for building the FGDs. The 630 workers know that most of them will have a job until well into the next century if they want one. Not many employees at coal-fired power stations can have anything like that kind of confidence.   Companies:-  National Power.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT934-11170 ,"FT934-11170 _AN-DKBDEAEMFT 931102   FT  02 NOV 93 / Personal View: Nuclear answers need right questions      By IAN FELLS and NIGEL LUCAS   The government review of the UK nuclear industry, scheduled for 1994 and then brought forward to 1993, is getting off to a slow start. The Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of the Environment disagree about the scope of the terms of reference and discussions are stalled awaiting the decision on whether the Thorp reprocessing plant is to go ahead. The terms of reference could be narrow, as Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, hinted in June, when he identified the central question as: 'Would new nuclear power stations be commercially viable in the UK . . . without any subsidy from government or taxpayer.' A narrow review is unlikely to do more than conclude that the industry may build new plant if it can find private capital. With such terms of reference the review will be futile. None the less, this is apparently the route that government would like to take, because it is consistent with the market-led energy policy, stoutly reaffirmed in the White Paper, The Prospects for Coal. The danger of a market-led policy is that it is at the mercy of market distortions. These distoritons are serious in the energy sector, and have led to the perverse closure of viable coal mines and power stations while gas-fired plant are opened at higher costs. Taking the same approach to the nuclear industry is likely to have the same effect. The situation is pressing. The ageing and obsolescent Magnox plant and, very soon, the first of the advanced gas-cooled reactors must be replaced if the nuclear industry is to have a future, and if it is to continue to make the 20 per cent contribution to UK electricity supply wisely proposed by the then energy secretary, Cecil Parkinson, when he designed the privatisation of the electricity supply industry. Many advantages of nuclear power are not expressed in the marketplace. Supply is secure compared with natural gas, which in the next few decades will have to be brought from ever-more remote areas. Nuclear electricity is one of the few energy forms which pays its environmental costs. If the idea of climate change arising from the greenhouse effect is taken seriously, then it is important to be able to express this benefit in decision-making. In the US, Congress has written into the 1992 Energy Policy Act the idea of integrated resource planning, which will provide the means to measure the social impact of energy planning. Something similar is needed in the UK. The review offers the opportunity to develop acceptable means of incorporating non-market factors into decision-making to establish a balanced portfolio of cost-effective, clean and secure energy sources. It is one thing to establish what should go into this portfolio; it is another to achieve it in a sector that is largely privatised and market-oriented. The City would not buy nuclear generators the first time round. In the event, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear performed well, with output per employee rising by more than 50 per cent in three years, and costs falling and profits rising rapidly. But the fundamental obstacles to privatisation remain; the perception of possible liabilities from decommissioning, fuel reprocessing and waste disposal are intimidating for private investors. There is still uncertainty about the cost of electricity from any new nuclear plant. We believe that electricity from a Sizewell C can be competitive with gas, but it is a question of convincing prospective investors. The main economic advantage of nuclear is that, once built, the fuel costs are low and stable and, therefore, so is the price of electricity. A new nuclear plant is unlikely without government support. Government must find mechanisms that are coherent with Brussels' competition policy. Instruments are available. Funding could be by issuing hypothecated government-backed bonds; access to markets could be facilitated by obliging regional electricity companies to contract part of their requirement over, say, 30 years; licences for construction of power stations could be auctioned, with conditions specifying fuel choice, giving government influence over the type of fuel burnt, while maintaining competition. But the best answers will not be found without asking the right questions. The first step is a broad review seeking the methods of measuring the social impact of energy choices and then the means of implementing the desirable choices.

Strong cash inflows, low debt or net cash and limited growth opportunities within a stable business are the main criteria needed. One group which clearly fits the bill is the regional electricity companies. By the time the important distribution review is completed next summer most will have minimal borrowing. They will also have dividend cover around 3 times, and annual cash flow per share averaging 112p. Already they are trading at a premium to net assets of about 50 per cent. Such basic utility businesses should have much higher gearing and lower dividend cover. The electricity companies justify the excess equity on the grounds of diversification and regulatory risk. Yet the companies have not been over-endowed with credible diversification ideas. And even the most draconian tightening of the price cap next year would only make them cash neutral. Besides, the regulator may take a dim view if the companies operate with too much equity and thus an unnecessarily high cost of capital. Far from waiting until after next year's review has established a medium-term regulatory framework, they may be wise to address the issue as part of that process. They could propose that they take on debt to finance a share buy-back for the benefit of shareholders, while customers might get a one-off lowering of electricity prices. Those boards which try to skate around the issue of excess capital for fear that they may get harsher treatment from Professor Littlechild are only deluding themselves.

Endesa sees the privatisation of utilities in neighbouring countries as an opportunity to become Latin America's first multinational company in the energy sector. The process began last year, when Endesa acquired a controlling stake in Argentina's Central Costanera, a power generator, and a minority shareholding in Edesur, an electricity distribution company. The Dollars 100m investment was financed in part with an Dollars 85m syndicated credit led by Credit Suisse First Boston. Mr Rodrigo Danus, chief of Endesa's financial division, says the company is preparing to bid for Hidronor, a group of five power plants in southern Argentina which will be privatised in the first half of 1993. Company executives have also travelled to Peru to study the planned state sell-offs of Electro Lima and Electro Peru. Endesa, which generates over half of Chile's electricity, posted profits of Dollars 260m last year, a 30.2 per cent increase over 1991. The results were 'the best in the company's history,' according to Mr Jose Yuraszeck, chairman. It recently became the first private sector corporation in Latin America to win an 'investment grade' rating from Standard  Poor's, the US ratings agency. At home, Endesa has begun work on a Dollars 450m hydroelectric dam in Chile, partly financed by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation. Environmental groups oppose the dam's construction on the grounds that it will destroy wildlife and affect Indian communities in the reaches of the Bio Bio, Chile's longest river. In Argentina, Mr Yuraszeck said Endesa had increased electricity production at Central Costanera nine-fold since it took over the plant last May.   Companies:-  Endesa.

WOODS   Among the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean, Nevis is one of the smaller islands. It is sister island to St Kitts. Nevis is very much the little sister, a village of an island, 9,000 people clustered around a dormant volcano with the sea lapping at their feet, writes Michael J. Woods. Nevis is in the group known as the Leeward Islands, which seems to mean little for the wind blows constantly, especially up in the hills, and keeps the humidity at comfortable levels: the perfect climate for the active, I thought, for I am a restless soul and cannot be doing with endless days on the beach. Like many of its neighbours, Nevis has a history of sugar plantations dating from the 17th century. The remains of some of the sugar estates are still being found. I visited several in the company of a local guide, David Rollinson. Each had a windmill built like a nuclear silo to withstand the battering of hurricanes and the agitation of earthquakes - the price to be paid for living on an otherwise perfect island. Jim Johnson, another guide, led me to a sugar mill ruin he had only recently discovered, buried in a secondary growth of jungle. The remains of the private chapel were almost filled with living pillars of weeping fig stems. The weeping fig is a fast-growing and prolific tree, and there is a great spreading example at the entrance to Montpelier Plantation Inn which was my home for the week. It casts dense shade over the front of the main building, once part of a sugar factory. The great house no longer exists but is notable for being the place where Nelson married Frances Nisbet in 1787. The Montpelier is perfectly located on a saddle on the lower slopes of Nevis' volcano. It has such a relaxing atmosphere that I could feel my resolution to be active seeping away as each day passed. Like many similar islands, Nevis has suffered from the damage caused by imported mammals. Goats, sheep, pigs and donkeys do little for the indigenous flora while mongooses, and the rats they were brought in to control, have eliminated the native agoutis, iguanas and edible frogs. While the bird life is limited, there were enough fish to satisfy anyone. To see them, Julian Rigby took me in his boat across the two-mile strait to St Kitts. Fish, mainly small and in electric blues and yellows, played and fed among the coral and sea fans. Occasionally I would glimpse something more subtle, a flat fish rippling beneath the sand, for instance. Sometimes it was more sinister: when five larger, almost circular fish, in silver edged with blue, swam through in line astern, every inhabitant of this underwater world fled. St Kitts was also the location of my most active exploit of the week, climbing Mount Liamuiga. This is St Kitts' volcano, 3,700ft high and topped with cloud forest. The route we followed was carved out of the mountain-side through the rain forest by slaves in 1690. Greg Pereira drove us in his Landrover through steep cane fields to the edge of the forest where we stopped for a picnic breakfast. We were already promisingly high. From here he pointed to our destination on the crater rim, 1,000ft below the summit proper. The forest was cool and delightful, full of tree ferns and palms. Some tall trees had buttress roots and others had been overtaken by strangler figs, while the ground was green with soft club moss. The path steepened until, at times, we were climbing ladders of roots. But the views both over the island and down into the forested crater, with its occasional sulphur-fringed fumeroles, were worth the climb. On my last day I went to find Nevis' water source, up a track spiralling around the mountain. But, after an hour or so, the attraction began to fade and I found visions of a cool dip and a leisurely lunch by the pool at the Montpelier floating into my mind. The sun seemed to get hotter and the hills became increasingly steep. I never did reach that spring. Michael Woods was a guest of Montpelier Plantation Inn, PO Box 474, Nevis, West Indies, (tel: 809-4693462).

But for rival electrical goods retailers it raises renewed questions about the nature of this newly liberalised competition. Dixons, the UK's biggest electrical retailing chain, yesterday said it intended to file a submission with the Office of Fair Trading alleging unfair retail competition from the regional electricity companies (Recs). Mr Mark Souhami, deputy chairman, said the Recs were subsidising their retail activities from profits generated by their electricity interests to the disadvantage of rival retailers and the detriment of electricity customers. 'It means consumers are possibly having to pay more for their electricity because these companies are choosing to subsidise unprofitable retailing activities. This goes to the heart of the regulatory environment,' he said. 'At the time of the privatisation we drew attention to what we thought would happen. But we have had to wait a bit before sticking our heads above the parapet again and shouting 'Yaboo]'' Mr Eamon Bradley, chief executive of the joint venture, yesterday rejected the charge although he accepted the retail businesses would lose money this year as a result of restructuring charges. 'Our retail businesses are stand-alone businesses and are not subsidised by the electricity companies. The merger will hold up to scrutiny from any source. We are delighted to see how worried the competition are,' he said. Originally, the Recs opened high street showrooms to offer customers facilities to pay their bills and provide information. Many of them also, as a sideline, sold electrical appliances to promote the wider use of electricity. Retail activities still represent less than 10 per cent of Recs turnover. But following their privatisation two years ago, many Recs developed a more serious interest in retailing seeing it as an attractive avenue for expansion in a related but unregulated market. Many Recs believed there were considerable advantages in merging their retailing, marketing and buying skills and began to acquire more stores as the loss-making Rumbelows chain announced it was making a phased withdrawal from the market. Several Recs have also expanded into more profitable out-of-town locations - even outside their own catchment areas. Mr Rodney Forrest, stores analyst at stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing, says their commercialisation will be a slow process. Over the long term, he suggests, the Recs will form professional retailing businesses run on strict commercial lines. But this is only likely to lead to the closure of many of the unprofitable smaller outlets leading to a more rational market. 'I cannot believe that Dixons or Comet will suffer much over the next five years,' he said. Indeed, he suggested that they might benefit from the commercialisation process.

Growing competition in the market and the pressure to protect the environment mean that utilities are being forced to reshape their strategies      By DAVID THOMAS   SLOWLY but surely, competitive forces are beginning to prise open the monopolistic and nationalistic world of electricity generation. Utilities around the world are beginning to feel the cold winds of commercial pressures. 'The old watchwords of 'obligation to serve' and 'build new capacity to meet future demand well in advance' are being replaced by an industry built on contractual relations and commercial orientation,' a recent report on the European industry concluded.* Governments are cutting back their funding support for the industry and large industrial customers are increasingly chafing at high electricity prices. Meanwhile, recession is forcing the industry to pare back its projections of future demand: in western Europe, annual growth over the next few years is unlikely to reach the 3.2 per cent recorded in the second half of the 1980s, let alone the 7.2 per cent of the golden years in the 1960s. The European Commission is casting an increasingly jaundiced eye over the gamut of arrangements which hinder free trade in electricity within the EC. Last month, the Commission gave Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain two months to show that they were not impeding the free flow of electricity across their national boundaries. Failure to do so could result in legal action by Brussels. 'Competition and the freedom to import and export are essential components of the policies needed to create an internal energy market,' argued Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for competition. The moves are widely seen as an opening shot in what is likely to prove a long battle with the utilities to create 'open access' in electricity supply, thereby allowing large business customers to shop around for cheaper power. The UK industry has seen the greatest changes over the past year, as the government's privatisation programme has come to fruition. The flotation of the 12 regional electricity companies, together with National Power and PowerGen, the conventional generators, completed the process in England and Wales. They will shortly be joined in the private sector by Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric, the two Scottish companies due to make their stock market debut in June. That will leave only the industry in Northern Ireland, which is scheduled for sale next year. Radical though these privatisations are, perhaps even more innovative has been the UK's attempt to create a new trading market in electricity known as the pool. It is still too early to judge the success of this new market, the heart of the government's attempt to inject competition into the industry. Pessimists fear that the electricity regulator will find the new structure inadequate for fostering full competition in the industry, just as his counterparts in gas and telecommunications have found in their domains. Yet the electricity companies have already begun to forge new strategies to meet the demands of the private sector, notably by switching their power plant ordering programme away from large coal stations towards gas. The switch towards gas-fired generation has become a notable trend throughout the industrialised world. Gas stations are quicker to build and cheaper to operate than large coal or nuclear plants. Crucially, they also have environmental benefits, emitting less sulphur dioxide (which causes acid rain) and carbon dioxide (which causes global warming) for an equivalent amount of energy as coal stations. Indeed, green pressures are now the number one concern of many utilities, as public awareness of the environment, the flow of eco-regulations and the cost of cleaning up plant mount in almost equal measures. Nowhere is this more true than in eastern Europe, where the newly democratic countries face the twin task of reducing their dependence on inefficient coal-fired stations and dealing with the aftermath of inadequate safety standards in Soviet-designed nuclear plant. Collaboration between the two formerly divided halves of Europe is likely to mount. Czechoslovakia has already signed a technical accord with France, whereby Europe's premier nuclear nation will help the Czechs to upgrade their eight Soviet-designed reactors to EC standards. Germany has been putting together a powerful consortium of west German utilities, leavened by some non-German firms led by Electricite de France, to modernise east Germany's industry. One estimate suggests that investment of DM30bn-DM50bn (Pounds 10bn-Pounds 16.6bn) will be needed in east Germany's industry over the next six years. While prospects are good for gas-fired and combined heat and power plants, the nuclear industry worldwide remains in the doldrums. Having braced itself for a burst of bad publicity to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the industry has to cope with an even more intractable problem: a continuing dearth of orders over the next decade. Those countries, such as France where public acceptance of nuclear power remains high, tend to have a surplus of capacity; whereas in others, notably the US, there is no sign of the public distrust of the nuclear option waning. * European Electric Power Trends.

The delegation stopped at  Colombia Municipality where Raul and his companions talked with  Manuel Quesada, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba  [PCC]. First, the good news: The sugar harvest is progressing at  101 percent of the plan and 40 percent of the production plan  has been completed. The Colombia Mill, which has meet every  production plan in the last 20 years, expects to do so again.  The mill is engaged in the sugar recovery program and to this  end will contribute the 16 recently created Basic Cooperative  Production Units, in addition to the state farm managed by the  Youth Labor Army [EJT], which has increased the yield of its  sugarfields by 10,000 arrobas per caballeria, and the Leningrad  Farming Cooperative with its 112 caballerias.    During a visit to cattle ranches, Raul points out the  negative aspect of extensive marabu weeds, saying that a  solution has to be found so that the 25,000 head of cattle yield  more milk and meat. [Politburo member Alfredo] Jordan explains  that a nationwide machete campaign is being waged against marabu  with the double goal of preserving the pastures and collecting  kitchen firewood for workers' dining halls and homes.    The report on defense is very encouraging. Colombia was the  first municipality of the Eastern Army area to achieve Ready for  Defense in the Second Phase status and its 17 defense zones are  attaining higher levels of readiness.    In Jobabo, we meet with Norge Rodriguez, first secretary of  the PCC. We proceed directly to the pride of the locals: the  Loma Alta state farm. This farm has 200 workers mobilized for  two years from the municipality -- population 50,000 -- and the  provincial capital. The 60 narrow-furrow caballerias of plantain  yielded 253,000 quintals in 1993. This year they expect to  surpass the 300,000 mark. The production of this, another state  farm, and eight farming cooperatives is enough to distribute 40  pounds of vegetables per capita a month to every person in the  municipality. The goal is to attain 1 million tubers,  vegetables, and grains in 1995 to meet the people's needs and  help supply the provincial capital.    Rodriguez, proud of the accomplishments of the municipality,  shows us the local wine factory which produced 189,000 bottles  in 1993 and plans to produce 300,000 in 1994. He spoke with  enthusiasm of the local food production and its highly diverse  service facilities.    On the outskirts of Las Tunas City is something new: modest  minidairy farms -- perfect to supply milk for children and the  elderly of nearby communities. There are 45 of these farms on  the periphery of the city. Horse-drawn carts distribute the milk  early in the morning. Housewives boil the milk as was customary  before the widespread implementation of centralized  pasteurization. Raul congratulated Misael Enamorado, first  secretary of Las Tunas Municipality, for this accomplishment,  trusting that shortly the other five communities will have their  own minidairy farms.    Windmills are becoming a common feature in the profile of  Las  Tunas City. The goal is to supply water, without using  electricity, to the organic gardens of various sizes appearing  in empty lots in the city. Because of the lack of resources to  build every windmill needed, locals have made use of  old-fashioned wells to draw water and irrigate the gardens by  hand. These lots provide fresh vegetables and direct sales to  the neighbors at standard prices. The vendor estimates the  weight, since they lack scales. This is a practical  antibureaucratic measure by the masses and for the masses.    In light of this fact, as well as the minidairy farms and  other efforts, Raul states with delight that this is a blow to  bureaucracy which is sometimes removed from reality and the  interests of the masses; a bureaucracy may be well-intentioned  but capable of destroying a revolution, as has unfortunately  already happened in other countries. Raul stressed that this is  not a fatalist statement because in the case of Cuba we are  lucky to have a commander in chief like Fidel, a sworn enemy of  bureaucracy and more aware than anyone else of the masses'  morale, hopes, and needs, and who trusts more than anyone else  the revolutionary spirit of his people. There is no sign of  disenchantment in Raul as he recalls some of the mistakes made  in agriculture. He affirms with optimism that the only positive  aspect of errors is the possibility of learning from them to  avoid repeating them.    Raul is accompanied by Central Committee members Julian  Lopez, first secretary of the PCC in Las Tunas, and Vilma Espin,  president of the Federation of Cuban Women, among others.     "

But the twin rulings by the Office of Fair Trading and Offer, the electricity regulator, included a disclosure that the 12 regional electricity companies (Recs) had lost a combined Pounds 105m in that market over the three years since privatisation. Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, which brought the complaint that triggered yesterday's rulings, said it felt its complaint was vindicated by these figures, even though the charge of anti-competitive behaviour was not upheld. 'We are very pleased that the facts are now out in the public domain and that shareholders can see for themselves what is going on,' said Mr Mark Souhami, Dixons deputy chairman. Dixons had complained that Recs had maintained lossmaking retail activities by cross-subsidising them from the electricity supply and distribution businesses. Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said he accepted that the activities were lossmaking. 'But I have concluded that no Rec is significant enough to command market power. It is most unlikely that any Rec could contemplate a strategy aimed at ousting from the market such well-established competitors as Dixons and then recouping its losses out of higher retail prices.' Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, said that while the Recs had made losses and earned very low returns on their retail businesses, this 'does not in itself mean that they are being cross-subsidised by the regulated businesses. Electricity prices and profits are not higher as a result of retail losses than they otherwise would have been.' He added that the losses would be borne by the shareholders, and it was a matter for them whether it was commercially sensible to incur them.

0,FT923-3008 ,"FT923-3008 _AN-CIOBXABPFT 920915   FT  15 SEP 92 / Ministers delay Ulster electricity sell-off      By Our Belfast Correspondent and DAVID LASCELLES   COMPLETION of the privatisation of Northern Ireland's electricity industry was postponed last night. Unexpectedly Mr Robert Atkins, the province's economy minister, said a number of outstanding matters needed to be resolved. 'The most important of these relates to the funding of the proposed interconnector to Scotland and an application which the government has made to the European Commission for assistance towards its costs,' he explained. 'The government strongly supports the application and hopes for its success, but recognises the need for the Commission to undertake a thorough evaluation of it. 'Consequently, although one option for the flotation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) was November 1992, it will not be possible to complete the sale this autumn.' NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m interconnector project earlier this year, and the government is believed to be seeking about Pounds 70m from the Commission towards the cost of construction. The first part of the sell-off took place in April when Ulster's four power stations went into private hands. British Gas bought the biggest station, Ballylumford near Larne; Nigen, an American-Belgian consortium, acquired Kilroot and Belfast West; and a management-employee buy-out team bought the Coolkeeragh plant at Londonderry. The sales grossed about Pounds 300m for the Treasury's coffers. It had been anticipated that the transmission, distribution and supply business would raise another Pounds 350m for the government. Advertisements have been running almost nightly on Ulster Television. NIE is the last UK electricity company to be privatised and is small and isolated in comparison with the distribution companies on the mainland, David Lascelles writes. The government is keen to create an interconnector with Scotland to improve sources of supply and sharpen competition. A link with the Irish Republic has also been proposed. The Scottish link, rated at 250MW, would be capable of supplying 20 per cent of Northern Ireland's electricity demand, although as the province's own generation capacity expands it might begin exporting power to Scotland. There are also plans to connect Northern Ireland to the UK gas pipeline network. The delay means that NIE will now probably have to wait for the completion of the sale of British Coal.

0,FT943-1155 ,"FT943-1155 _AN-EIZD8ACUFT 940926   FT  26 SEP 94 / FT Guide to Britain's Nuclear Review      By DAVID LASCELLES   This week is the last for submissions to Britain's review of nuclear power. What is the background? Britain's nuclear power industry consists of 13 power stations (11 in England, two in Scotland), accounting for about 25 per cent of all UK-generated electricity. (Another two are being decommissioned and a further one, Sizewell B, is due to come on stream shortly.) Originally the intention was to privatise them along with the rest of the electricity industry in 1989. But resistance by investors to the risks of nuclear power made this impossible. Instead, nuclear power was put into two state-owned companies, Nuclear Electric, covering England and Wales, and Scottish Nuclear. The government pledged to review nuclear policy in five years' time, to determine its future. What will the review achieve? The aim is to focus on prospects for nuclear power, examining economic and commercial viability of new nuclear stations against the background of the government's energy policy. The review will also examine options for private-sector finance, and ponder privatisation. A separate review will examine problems of nuclear waste. What are the issues? Capacity: Only one nuclear power station, Sizewell B, is under construction, so a key question is whether any more should be built. By the end of the 1990s many first-generation Magnox reactors will be reaching their end. Unless replacements are planned soon, the industry will start to shrink. Nuclear Electric wants to start building Sizewell C and other stations soon. Scottish Nuclear will need a new station around 2010. Economics: Since it was placed on a commercial footing, the industry has boosted performance. The cost of generating nuclear electricity has fallen sharply, but is still higher on average than electricity from conventional power stations. Both Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear predict that nuclear power can become fully commercial later this decade. Provisions: One of the biggest financial drags is the cost of providing for the disposal of nuclear waste and of de-commissioning power stations when they are retired from service. When the two state companies were created, the government placed all these liabilities with them, but did not provide money. In Nuclear Electric's case, it set up the nuclear levy which will add about 10 per cent to electricity bills until 1998; by then, provisions should be adequate, according to the company. It also provided guarantees for Scottish Nuclear's provisions, and arranged for it to receive an above-market price for its electricity for five years. Privatisation cannot occur until this aspect is dealt with in a way that satisfies investors. One possibility: the government might assume responsibility for some of the past liabilities, particularly those created by Magnox stations. Generation: Because nuclear power stations cannot be started and shut down as easily as coal and gas-fired, they qualify for base-load running: meeting the country's basic day-to-day needs. But owing to their huge cost (about Pounds 3bn for building Sizewell C), they would also need guaranteed supply contracts, running for as much as 30 years, to satisfy potential backers. This timescale is far beyond the present capacity of the electricity market, so the government might have to guarantee such contracts beyond normal commercial terms (say 15 years) as a condition for privatisation. Does Britain need more nuclear power? In capacity terms: no. The UK has a large surplus of power generation, mainly because of the rapid growth of gas-fired stations. Coal-fired power stations are also being shut. But the nuclear power industry warns that gas prices could jump, and that gas could run out early next century. It also claims a strong environmental case for nuclear. What are the environmental issues? With the UK committed by international treaty to cut harmful emissions, there is a premium on 'clean' power sources. Nuclear stations emit virtually no gases. The industry also points out that, once its provisions are made, it will be the only power source paying the full cost of its environmental impact. The real difficulty with nuclear power lies in waste disposal. Britain has no lasting solution to this problem, though the government favours deep burial. For now, waste is either stored in vaults on-site or sent to Sellafield, in Cumbria, for reprocessing. Can the nuclear power industry be privatised? The two nuclear companies want to be privatised in order to escape political manipulation and to diversify their activities. They also claim they will be able to operate commercially. However, the City has doubts about viability and risks. Prospects will depend on whether the government is prepared to underwrite the industry in order to make it attractive to investors.

0,FT943-6514 ,"FT943-6514 _AN-EH2B3ACCFT 940829   FT  29 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fundamental revision of water charging is required      From Dr ALAN HOLMANS and Mrs STEPHANIE HOLMANS   Sir, Professor John Kay (Personal View: 'Clever trick but the cracks remain', August 16) pointed out that a large part of the water industry's present investment programme comprises environmental capital expenditure. Householders are not simply paying for water and sewerage services, as they are for gas and electricity supplies. They are also paying for purer water and cleaner rivers and beaches. In this respect water charging is fundamentally different from gas and electricity pricing. It is the principal reason why there are 'inflation plus' price limits for the water companies, as against 'inflation minus' for British Gas and the regional electricity companies. It is also the main reason for much larger inter-regional disparities in water charges than in the charges of other utilities. Water charges have to cover two separate sets of capital expenditure - to meet a growing demand and improve security of supply, and to produce environmental benefits. The former is the normal activity of a utility, similar to that of the gas and electricity industries. Environmental benefits, however, are 'public goods' (available to all, whether or not they have paid for them). Ideally, public goods should be tax-financed. But water charges contain a large compulsory element, because water is a natural monopoly with no real substitute and is also a necessity. If the environmental component of water charges is treated as a de facto tax it performs poorly in terms of accepted tax principles. There are arbitrary geographical disparities. Because most domestic water charges still depend on the former rateable values, their incidence is regressive. Rate rebates mitigated the regressiveness of domestic rates. There is no similar scheme for water charges. When rates were the local tax, the rate support grant system included an equalisation element to produce equal rate poundages for equal expenditure, in relation to need, across all authorities. The costs and finances of purer water and cleaner rivers and beaches should also be equalised nationally. Present arrangements produce pooling within each water company's territory. Different geographical and historical factors account for large arbitrary differences in individual water companies' environmental expenditure and water charges which are not compatible with principles of equitable taxation. Amendments to the 1989 legislation would be needed if water charges were to be split into two parts. The 'tax' component of water charges should be based on national equalisation of environmental costs and finances. It should also be related more closely to the ability to pay, via a rebate scheme. The charges for water utility services, on the other hand, could continue to be determined by Ofwat within the existing regulatory framework.

0,FT921-10590 ,"FT921-10590 _AN-CBEBPAELFT 920205   FT  05 FEB 92 / Electricity customers warned on bills row      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and JOHN HUNT   INDUSTRIAL electricity users may face legal action if they go ahead with their threat of refusing to pay the nuclear element in their annual power bills when contracts are renewed in April. Large consumers say they will not pay the nuclear part of their bills - which amounts to 11 per cent of the total power charge - in protest at electricity price increases. The UK generators and regional electricity suppliers must pass on the levy to the government and may sue the users to recoup their money. Mr Jim Keohane, director of energy contracts at East Midlands Electricity, said, 'We won't do anything precipitate, but if they don't pay the levy, then we can start charging interest on any part of the bill that is unpaid or we might institute legal proceedings to recover our money.' Mr Keohane said he was sympathetic to the concerns of the main users, since they will be facing large price increases in April, largely arising from the price rise for wholesale electricity in the so-called 'pool'. The UK generating companies, National Power and PowerGen, say pool prices must rise to reflect their costs. In a recent speech to big users, Mr John Baker, chairman of National Power, urged them to be extremely vigilant about the additional costs such as the nuclear levy which are included in their bills. He refused to comment yesterday. PowerGen called the Pounds 1.2bn nuclear levy 'unjustifiable'. It said: 'It's unfair that customers and taxpayers should pay for keeping open old nuclear plant.' Industrial users' electricity bills are made up of four main components, but charges for power make up more than 70 per cent of the total. The other elements include charges for using regional companies' wires and the transmission cost of using the national grid, as well as the nuclear levy. National Grid, the company that runs the UK's transmission system, said yesterday it would keep the cost of using the grid the same - on average - this year as last year. A protest about delays in granting licences to National Power and PowerGen to operate under the Environmental Protection Act was sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, by Friends of the Earth yesterday, John Hunt writes. The two generating companies should have been given authorisations by the Pollution Inspectorate by the end of August. The authorizations wouold have limited power-station emissions. The act requires details of the companies' applications to be placed on a public register. The companies appealed against that on grounds of commercial confidentiality. The Department of the Environment yesterday said a report on the appeals had been written and was with Mr Heseltine. Ms Fiona Weir, FoE air pollution campaigner, said Mr Heseltine was allowing the power generators to hold up implementation of 'vital new pollution laws'.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT923-506 ,"FT923-506 _AN-CI1B0AB4FT 920928   FT  28 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK utilities   Shares in water and regional electricity companies outpaced the market by 50 per cent and 25 per cent respectively in the year to the end of August. They have lost half this relative advantage since sterling was suspended from the ERM. Some under-performance was on the cards anyway. Established utilities usually trade on a yield premium to the market to compensate for their relatively limited growth prospects. Water and electricity companies have been benefitting from the loose regulatory framework under which they were privatised. Thus there were expectations of respectable dividend growth up to their first regulatory review in 1995, but the market was already just starting to look beyond. Now the economy is liberated from German-style interest rates, the promise from the water companies of real annual dividend growth of 3-5 per cent up to 1995 looks, arguably, less enticing. Logic suggests the yield premium should rise. Both utility sectors, however, are now trading at a 40 per cent yield premium to the market, levels last seen immediately before the general election when renationalisation looked a distinct possibility. Since their revenues are still linked to the inflation rate, it is not obvious why water and electricity stocks have suffered absolute price falls while index-linked gilts have surged ahead. Too close a comparison is dangerous, since, in practice, fund managers rarely consider the two markets together. That said, a 5 per cent fall in electricity shares and 6 per cent fall in water stocks seem hard to justify - unless investors are simply going on experience of how utilities perform in a rising market. Recent history is hardly auspicious. In the bull market running up to 1987, both British Telecom and British Gas traded to yield premiums to the market of 60 per cent. This may have had more to do with the regulatory cycle than the market cycle, but water and electricity are also facing the prospect of a tighter regulatory environment. If they are also outpaced in terms of earnings growth by the market, managements may be tempted to take bolder steps towards building unregulated businesses. The more aggressively expansionist of the water companies, such as Severn Trent, already trade at a yield premium to the sector.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

BUT  THE INDUSTRY SEES SEVERAL HELPFUL DEVELOPMENTS ON THE HORIZON.      By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait, sending oil prices soaring, America's nuclear  power industry was on the offensive. Its advertising, already scheduled to run  in several national magazines, showed a menacing cobra whose body was made of  oil drums. The message: Continued U.S. reliance on foreign oil is dangerous.    When Iraqi tanks crossed the border, the U.S. industry was ready. Within two  weeks, the ad campaign was expanded to 18 major daily newspapers, at a cost of  $150,000. But the extra spending -- and the discomfort of rising oil prices --  marked only a small and temporary blip in the $6-million-a-year media campaign  by the U.S. Council on Energy Awareness, an arm of the nuclear power industry,  to revive the long-dormant business of building power reactors.    Rather than rely on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, suppliers of nuclear power  are placing their bets on longer-term hopes: continued steady growth in  electricity demand and new designs for reactors that are cheaper to build and  easier to operate.    ""Our policy is pretty much 'steady as she goes,' "" said council spokesman Carl  Goldstein. Indeed, analysts say, there may be no other viable strategy for an  industry that hasn't received a new construction permit since 1979.    Nuclear power provides 19.5% of the nation's electricity. But these days the  industry makes its domestic profits doing repairs and maintenance on existing  plants rather than designing and constructing new ones.    There are 114 operating plants, but only nine under construction -- and only  two of those have firm completion dates. ""There simply are no more in the  pipeline,"" said Frank Ingram, a spokesman for the federal Nuclear Regulatory  Commission. ""We suspect several of (the plants under construction) may never  get finished."" Meanwhile, Ingram noted, the agency is concentrating on making  sure that existing reactors run safely.    The major reason that the utility industry has shunned new orders for reactors  is that it simply takes too long -- usually a decade or more -- before a  utility can win final approval from regulators to begin operating a new nuclear  power plant.    Prospective customers for nuclear power plants do ""not trust the regulatory  system on (both) the state and federal levels,"" said Goldstein of the Council  on Energy Awareness, whose membership consists of utility companies, equipment  manufacturers and builders of power plants. ""They have no confidence that if  they make investment decisions, these will be supported when the plant is  built,"" he explained.    Indeed, in many areas, state regulatory bodies are prohibiting utilities from  increasing their prices to help pay for nuclear power plants, effectively  forcing them to take the construction costs out of their profits. During the  1980s, the amount of construction costs that public utility commissions refused  to include in rate-setting totaled a staggering $15 billion.    Although the nation's appetite for electricity keeps rising -- it has jumped  54% in just seven years -- the future of nuclear power looks comparatively  bleak.    California, with nearly 30 million people the nation's biggest state, gets 14%  of its electricity from nuclear power plants, but prospects are virtually nil  that more will be built there. State law forbids licensing of new plants until  there is a demonstrated safe method of disposing of nuclear waste. And the  federal Energy Department isn't expected to complete its work on waste disposal  methods and site selection until well into the next century.    ""I don't see nuclear power representing a viable option in the foreseeable  future,"" said Charles Imbrecht, chairman of the California Energy Commission.    Even if the waste-disposal problem is solved, the high cost of building nuclear  power plants -- and lingering questions about their reliability -- still pose  massive obstacles, Imbrecht said.    Nuclear power ""commands an enormous amount of capital over a long period of  time and is simply not going to attract customers"" unless the technology  becomes more competitive, he said. If it has any future at all, he asserted, it  lies with smaller-sized plants -- not the behemoths that were built in the  1960s and 1970s.    Imbrecht insisted that California's diverse sources of power -- from natural  gas, underground steam fields, hydroelectric power and purchases of electricity  from other regions -- have made the state less vulnerable to foreign  interruptions. Only 1% of California's electricity is generated by oil, down  from a whopping 48% during the 1973 Arab oil embargo against the United States.  There is ""absolutely no danger of the lights going out in California any time  this decade,"" Imbrecht asserted.    As a result, even nuclear power enthusiasts don't foresee any easy expansion.  ""Clearly, we favor nuclear power,"" said Tom Dennis, Southern California  Edison's Washington representative. The company's nuclear power plant at San  Onofre ""has a great record,"" he asserted.    Dennis said Southern California Edison has been bullish on nuclear power, ""and  we think it can work."" But he conceded that even the crisis in the Persian Gulf  won't move Congress to ease the licensing process. ""I doubt any fast-tracking  will be done as a result of what takes place in the Middle East,"" he said. ""I  don't think the crisis will result in anything but a clearer recognition that  there needs to be a national energy policy.""    Strategists at the Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. say they believe that the  United States needs both coal and nuclear power to meet its future energy  needs. But Herb Woodeshick, special assistant to the company's president, said  it would take major regulatory reforms to persuade the nation's utility  industry to construct new plants.    Among them: A one-step licensing process to replace the separate construction  and operating permits now required, resolution of the waste-disposal issue and  a standard new design for nuclear plants. ""When someone starts to build a  plant, you need to be sure it can be done in six or seven years,"" Woodeshick  said.    With even its friends still reluctant, the nuclear power industry recognizes  that it is unlikely to make a comeback any time soon, even in the face of the  gulf crisis.    ""Our campaign is consistent, our message is clear -- that imported oil is  dangerous,"" Goldstein said. ""Fortuitously, our latest series of ads fit right  into the world situation.""    Goldstein emphasized that, every day, nuclear power displaces the use of  740,000 barrels of oil in producing electricity -- about the same amount that  the United States imported from Iraq and Kuwait before the crisis began.    Only 6% of America's electricity is generated by burning oil, but almost 20% of  total generating capacity is oil-fired, he warned. ""If utilities had no other  choice but to use this spare capacity,"" he said, ""oil consumption could shoot  up as much as 3 million barrels a day.""    Despite the industry's pessimism, there are some changes on the way:    * Analysts expect that a new generation of nuclear reactors -- a standard  design that would be far less complex and easier to operate -- will be  certified by 1994, or possibly sooner.    * The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has adopted a proposal recommending a  single-permit procedure to replace the current two-step system. But industry  officials believe that they will need new legislation to make the procedural  changes unassailable to challenges, and Congress is likely to balk at such a  plan.    * The industry hopes to wage its future public relations battles partly on  environmental grounds, arguing that nuclear energy is clean and emits no  ""greenhouse gases."" ""Our polls show environmental concerns are more telling  than energy issues,"" Goldstein said.    If the industry is politically skillful -- and lucky -- utilities may be  ordering new plants by the middle of the decade, Goldstein suggested.    But an air of pessimism still prevails. A publishing and economic consulting  company has scheduled a conference in Washington later this month on the theme  of standardization of nuclear power plants.

BUT  THE INDUSTRY SEES SEVERAL HELPFUL DEVELOPMENTS ON THE HORIZON.      By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait, sending oil prices soaring, America's nuclear  power industry was on the offensive. Its advertising, already scheduled to run  in several national magazines, showed a menacing cobra whose body was made of  oil drums. The message: Continued U.S. reliance on foreign oil is dangerous.    When Iraqi tanks crossed the border, the U.S. industry was ready. Within two  weeks, the ad campaign was expanded to 18 major daily newspapers, at a cost of  $150,000. But the extra spending -- and the discomfort of rising oil prices --  marked only a small and temporary blip in the $6-million-a-year media campaign  by the U.S. Council on Energy Awareness, an arm of the nuclear power industry,  to revive the long-dormant business of building power reactors.    Rather than rely on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, suppliers of nuclear power  are placing their bets on longer-term hopes: continued steady growth in  electricity demand and new designs for reactors that are cheaper to build and  easier to operate.

The 900MW output of Killingholme, on Humberside, is equivalent to that produced from a station supplied by two large coal mines. It is the first of three combined cycle stations planned by PowerGen. National Power, the other large generator, is building a gas-fired station on a site adjacent to PowerGen's Killingholme plant. All but one of the 12 regional electricity companies are involved in building combined cycle stations. Enron, the US company, recently opened a 1,875MW plant on Teeside. Combined-cycle stations use exhaust gases from a gas turbine to power a steam turbine, thereby reducing emissions. Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said yesterday that Killingholme, built at a cost of more than Pounds 290m, would probably not have been built unless the electricity industry had been privatised. 'Privatisation really gave the board the right to manage, to do what it believed was commercially right,' he said. At privatisation, 'we inherited power stations that were on average 20 years old. They were predominantly coal. Fuel was expensive and dirty. When you compare combined cycle stations to coal equivalents it is difficult to see the disadvantages,' Mr Wallis said. Meanwhile, Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, yesterday warned that even more jobs would have to go from the coal industry if was to become fully competitive with imports. 'If we are prepared to accept the assistance of the taxpayer to allow us to become yet more efficient, then we must accept that there will be a price to pay,' he said. British Gas has completed its second gas auction, offering supplies to 102 companies that applied for gas under the release programme agreed by the company as a way of encouraging competition.

Under the Tories, it will be privatised, and might eventually shrink to nearly half its present size. Under Labour it would be a public company, and the bulk of its pits would stay open. 'If we are elected,' says Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary, 'we would immediately stop any move to privatise British Coal, and reverse any moves designed simply for privatisation.' Labour would also protect British Coal's markets by a moratorium on building new gas-fired power stations, to force the electricity industry, British Coal's main customer, to keep buying coal. Labour would further protect British Coal by restricting imports of foreign coal. The Conservatives welcome competition from gas and imported coal because it will put pressure on British Coal prices, and thus on electricity prices. If a Conservative government is returned, National Power and PowerGen, the generating companies, will probably announce plans to increase coal imports by building new terminals capable of handling around 40m tonnes by the mid 90s. Whoever wins on April 9 will oversee the contract negotiations which will determine how much coal British Coal sells to the electricity industry. A Tory government would be more likely to influence British Coal to drop prices and tonnage sales to the generators, and to sign a one-year contract rather than the long-term agreement the company would like and would get under Labour.

0,FT944-1957 ,"FT944-1957 _AN-ELSBYABYFT 941217   FT  17 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Policing the utilities   There is a palpable sense of national unease about the activities of many of Britain's privatised utilities. It is symbolised by the decision of British Gas to station security guards outside its showrooms to deflect the wrath of customers angry at the withdrawal of services. Something seems awry in a world where senior managers get 75 per cent salary increases while seeking to cut the pay of their employees; where massive redundancy programmes run alongside accelerating profits; and where shareholders - yesterday it was the turn of Yorkshire Electricity's lucky investors - receive large payouts while consumers feel they are paying over the odds to what remain monopoly suppliers of essential services. Not all the privatised companies are in the dock. British Telecommunications, after a period of deep unpopularity in the late 1980s, attracts favourable ratings. The contrast between BT and the gas, water and electricity companies explains the unpopularity of the last three. The salary of BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance was notorious while BT was an inefficient, expensive monopoly. Now BT's prices are falling fast; telecoms regulation is seen to be tough; competition between phone operators is a reality in the consumer market; and although a heavy BT redundancy programme is in progress, consumers, not shareholders, are regarded as the main beneficiaries. By contrast, water prices have gone up sharply since privatisation. Gas prices are to rise for many consumers over the next year. Electricity prices are falling somewhat, but by nowhere near the decline in the cost of distribution - the main source of the regional electricity companies' profits. And in none of the three industries is competition yet a reality for most consumers. In water, it will never become so. Caught in the cross-fire In addition, jobs have been shed at a dramatic rate, while dividends and top managers' salaries have risen sharply. It only took the egregious provocation of Mr Cedric Brown's 75 per cent salary increase as chief executive of British Gas, at the same time as the company is seeking to cut the basic pay and holiday entitlement of its showroom staff, for MPs to start calling for public inquiries. The employment select committee this week decided to investigate executive pay in the new year. How justified is the concern? In some respects, the utilities are doing no more than ministerial bidding. The gas and electricity companies were caught in the cross-fire over the government's unpopular decision - now partially abandoned - to levy 17.5 per cent value added tax on domestic fuel. The increase in water charges has been caused in part by onerous EU directives on water quality, which the government tried too late to persuade Brussels to reconsider. That still leaves the fundamental issues of executive pay and the balance which the gas, water, and electricity companies have struck between their employees, shareholders and consumers. Unconvincing claims The arguments about executive pay have been extensively rehearsed in our letters column with respect to Mr Brown. Managers must be paid according to responsibility, and multi-billion industries need to be able to attract top-flight executives. But it is hard to claim that large salary increases and generous share options are required to 'incentivise' individuals who were already willingly in post. It is equally unconvincing to claim that executives need to be rewarded for managing a shift towards competition and business abroad, which has largely still to happen. The public feeling that it comes down to greed is difficult to resist. On cost cutting, the utilities should be offered nothing but applause. In almost all cases, redundancies have been voluntary and on generous terms. The benefit to the nation as a whole from lower utility prices must outweigh any temptation to use the utilities as a source of unproductive employment. Britain has the lowest business telecoms prices of its main European competitors - a significant factor in the competitiveness of its financial services sector, upon which hundreds of thousands of jobs depend. However, in other utilities too much of the gain from improvements in efficiency has gone to shareholders instead of consumers. This is manifestly the case with the regional electricity companies. Interim dividends up to 47 per cent higher than last year are currently being announced. The water and electricity companies have done far better than expected in their cost cutting, but virtually all independent observers believe the regulatory regime established at the privatisation of the two industries was unduly slack, and has been insufficiently tightened in the latest reviews. The boards of the utilities should have greater regard for public sensibilities in setting their salary levels. But it is the regulators who ought to ensure that a fairer balance is struck between consumers and shareholders.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0," FR940304-1-00166   FR940304-1-00014        The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society,   indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $22.3   billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2 and 3   are $25.4 billion and $27.3 billion, respectively. See Technical Support   Document, Table 3.6.     C.     Energy savings.     As indicated above, standards will result in   significant savings of electricity consumption for fluorescent lamp ballasts.     D.     Lessening of utility or performance of products.     As indicated   above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the   standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of   fluorescent lamp ballasts.     E.     Impact of lessening of competition.     The determination of this   factor must be made by the Attorney General.     F.     Need of the Nation to save energy.     Fluorescent lamp ballasts   use electricity directly. In 1987, 27 percent of commercial sector source   electricity (or 2.17 quads) was accounted for on a national basis by   fluorescent lamp ballasts.     In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards   will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of   Volume A. 45  Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed   in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO    2    ). For fluorescent lamp   ballasts at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated   SO    2     reduction would be over 2,417,000 tons. During this time period, the peak   annual reduction of SO    2     emissions that are expected to be emitted by power   plants in the United States is 1.20 percent. For standard levels 2 and 3, the   reductions are 2,797,000 tons and 2,986,000 tons, respectively. The highest   peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.47 percent.         45     See footnote 37.       Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO    2    )   emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total   estimated NO    2     reduction would be 2,218,000 tons. During this time period, the   peak annual reduction of NO    2     emissions that are expected to be emitted by   power plants in the United States is 1.19 percent. For standard levels 2 and   3, the reductions are 2,566,000 tons and 2,739,000 tons, respectively. The   highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.47 percent.     Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon   dioxide (CO    2    ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030,   the total estimated CO    2     reduction would be 1,174 million tons. During this   time period, the peak annual reduction of CO    2     emissions that are expected to   be emitted by power plants in the United States are 1.17 percent. For standard   levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 1,358 million tons and 1,450 million tons,   respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.44   percent.     Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in   reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because   virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in   oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For   standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 230.41 million   barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2 and 3, the   reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 266.97 and 285.05 million   barrels, respectively.         5. Conclusion        Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the   Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve   the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is   technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the   Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard   level 3 for amended fluorescent lamp ballast standards.     Of the standard levels analyzed, level 3 will save the most energy (17.0   quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department   assumes that all fluorescent lamp ballasts will be electronic rapid or instant   start.     After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the   National Appliance Energy Conservation Act1988 imposed 1990 standard for   fluorescent lamp ballasts with standard level 3 for fluorescent lamp ballasts.   The Department concludes that standard level 3 for fluorescent lamp ballasts   saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and   economically justified.            "," FR940304-1-00166   FR940304-1-00014        The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society,   indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $22.3   billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2 and 3   are $25.4 billion and $27.3 billion, respectively. See Technical Support   Document, Table 3.6.     C.     Energy savings.     As indicated above, standards will result in   significant savings of electricity consumption for fluorescent lamp ballasts.     D.     Lessening of utility or performance of products.     As indicated   above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the   standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of   fluorescent lamp ballasts.     E.     Impact of lessening of competition.     The determination of this   factor must be made by the Attorney General.     F.     Need of the Nation to save energy.     Fluorescent lamp ballasts   use electricity directly. In 1987, 27 percent of commercial sector source   electricity (or 2.17 quads) was accounted for on a national basis by   fluorescent lamp ballasts.     In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards   will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of   Volume A. 45  Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed   in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO    2    ). For fluorescent lamp   ballasts at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated   SO    2     reduction would be over 2,417,000 tons. During this time period, the peak   annual reduction of SO    2     emissions that are expected to be emitted by power   plants in the United States is 1.20 percent. For standard levels 2 and 3, the   reductions are 2,797,000 tons and 2,986,000 tons, respectively. The highest   peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.47 percent.         45     See footnote 37.       Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO    2    )   emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total   estimated NO    2     reduction would be 2,218,000 tons. During this time period, the   peak annual reduction of NO    2     emissions that are expected to be emitted by   power plants in the United States is 1.19 percent. For standard levels 2 and   3, the reductions are 2,566,000 tons and 2,739,000 tons, respectively. The   highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.47 percent.     Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon   dioxide (CO    2    ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030,   the total estimated CO    2     reduction would be 1,174 million tons. During this   time period, the peak annual reduction of CO    2     emissions that are expected to   be emitted by power plants in the United States are 1.17 percent. For standard   levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 1,358 million tons and 1,450 million tons,   respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.44   percent.     Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in   reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because   virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in   oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For   standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 230.41 million   barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2 and 3, the   reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 266.97 and 285.05 million   barrels, respectively.         5. Conclusion        Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the   Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve   the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is   technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the   Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard   level 3 for amended fluorescent lamp ballast standards.     Of the standard levels analyzed, level 3 will save the most energy (17.0   quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department   assumes that all fluorescent lamp ballasts will be electronic rapid or instant   start.     After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the   National Appliance Energy Conservation Act1988 imposed 1990 standard for   fluorescent lamp ballasts with standard level 3 for fluorescent lamp ballasts.   The Department concludes that standard level 3 for fluorescent lamp ballasts   saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and   economically justified.            "

The exhibitions were  set up on Tehran's permanent exhibition site for international  trade fairs.    At the end of his inspection tour, the president was  interviewed by our correspondent and expressed his views on  these exhibitions.    [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] The outstanding  features  of the electricity industry exhibition were too many to be  mentioned in this interview. However, one of the features which  interested me greatly was to witness the result of a move which  started two years ago with the aim of enabling us to manage all  aspects of the electricity industry on our own -- such as  production, transfer, and distribution. With regard to the  distribution of electricity, we are almost fully self-sufficient  in that everything to do with all 20 posts [as heard] is being  done inside the country.    As far as the transfer of electricity is concerned, we are  also largely self-sufficient. In production too, there has been  a major move during the last two years, and now we are able to  build everything which is feasible and cost-efficient inside the  country and meet the needs of our hydroelectric, steam, gas, and  compound cycle power stations.

The sale, which follows a long drawn out dispute about ownership rights of eastern Germany's utility assets, will be followed by the privatisation of the region's remaining 14 utility groups to RWE and Bayernwerk, western Germany's other two largest utility companies. PreussenElektra, which owns and operates nuclear, hard coal, and brown coal power stations, will acquire the eastern German regional utilities of Frankfurt/ Oder, Magdeburg, Neubran-denburg, Potsdam and Rostock. It is expected to invest at least DM800m (Pounds 312.5m) in the modernising and upgrading of the power stations. Veba and its other subsidiaries plan to invest DM8.4bn in eastern Germany over the next four years. The sale will give Preussen-Elektra a virtual monopoly over the generation and distribution of electricity in the region as a result of the Stromvertrag, or Electricity Contract signed in 1990 between the former east German and west German governments. Under the terms of the contract, west Germany's utility companies are legally permitted to own 51 per cent of eastern Germany's fifteen utilities groups, with the remaining 49 per cent held by the municipalities. However, in order to underwrite investments of about DM46bn by western German utilities, the contract stipulated that eastern Germany's regional utilities must, over the next 20 years, buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag, eastern Germany's largest major utility company. This group is controlled by western Germany's eight electricity companies, including Preus-senElektra. However, Veba officials said that although PreussenElektra will enjoy a virtual monopoly, they added that the company fears increasing competition from the gas sector, as well as a continuing decline in energy consumption. Energy consumption in eastern Germany has fallen 40 per cent since 1989 largely due to the collapse of manufacturing.   Companies:-  PreussenElektra.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT922-8821 ,"FT922-8821 _AN-CEKAUAEBFT 920511   FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (3): Sea gas will drive new stations - The region will provide power for England in the 21st century      By MAURICE SAMUELSON   DISTINCTIVE new industrial landmarks are springing up on the flat countryside between the Wash and the Humber estuary. They are the chain of gleaming new power stations which will supply much of England with cheap, environmentally clean electricity well into the 21st century. As a result of the new investment, the region could one day rival the coalfields of Yorkshire and the Midlands as a centre for bulk electricity generation. All the new generators there will use natural gas from the North Sea, and comprise high efficiency combined cycle technology, in which the waste heat from the primary gas turbines is used to drive auxiliary steam turbines. The area's first new station, at Killingholme on south Humberside, is due to start supplying the national grid in the autumn. The 900 MegaWatt plant, owned by PowerGen, one of the successor companies of the former Central Electricity Generating Board, will be the biggest non-nuclear power station to be opened in Britain since the 1970s. The PowerGen plant is the first of eight large gas-fired power stations planned in this area and over the next five years. They have a total capacity of 5,730MW, which, on a warm bank holiday evening, could supply a high proportion of national demand. The list includes a second 800MW PowerGen plant at Killingholme, and a 620MW station on the same site being built by National Power, the bigger of the non-nuclear companies carved from the CEGB. The catalyst for the programme was the 1990 privatisation of the electricity industry which demolished the monolithic CEGB and opened the door to competitive electricity generation. Two other factors have attracted a large part of the planned new generating capacity to the South Humberside and Lincolnshire area: Its accessibility to the main 'super-grid' lines built to convey electricity to south-east England from the power stations of the Yorkshire and Trent Valley coalfields; and Its terminals for the gasfields of the southern North Sea, which are set to rival the coalfields as the principal fuel sources for electricity production. These twin factors, says Mr Philip Champ, director for power station development at East Midlands Electricity, are 'the magnet which has made the region around the Wash the busiest bit of England'. In addition to those planned at Killingholme, new plants are being built or planned at Brigg, Keadby, Stallingborough and Sutton Bridge. The radical nature of the overhaul of the electricity industry is evident in the exotic mixture of companies behind the new projects. They include the privatised regional electricity companies (before being privatised, they were restricted only to distribution of power) and numerous overseas companies, ranging from combustion equipment suppliers to overseas utilities. A Pounds 400m plant at Keadby, South Humberside, is a partnership of Scottish Hydro-Electric and Norweb, the North West electricity distribution company. In the Pounds 400m plant, at Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, East Midlands Electricity is partnered by Electricite de France, the French state utility, GEC Alsthom (the Anglo-French combustion plant-maker), France's Compagnie Generale des Eaux, and Iberdrola, an independent Spanish utility. PowerGen's first Killingholme station is being built by Siemens, the German electrical giant, and its Kraft Werk Union power generation group. The biggest single project, the 1,320MW South Humber Bank, at Stallingborough, is being developed by IVO (Imatran Voima Oy), Finland's biggest electricity company, which is also the contractor for the Yorkshire Electricity-led 240MW station at Brigg, a British Sugar refinery site. The Brigg turbines will be supplied by the Lincoln-based European Gas Turbines, 90 per cent owned by GEC Alsthom and 10 per cent by General Electric of the US. Contrary to the ripples which power station projects sometimes cause elsewhere in Britain, the people of this area have seemed rather unconcerned at the rate of new development in their midst. Planning permission for a power station has been available for years at Stallingborough, proposed site of the South Humber Bank plant. Similarly, at nearby Killingholme, bought by the CEGB in 1957, there had been successive plans for stations - both oil and coal - all of which were abandoned for economic reasons. But there would be local anger if suggestions resurfaced to use Killingholme for a different energy-related purpose - in the mid 1980s, it was one of the places studied by NIREX for the burial of low level nuclear waste. (The idea was later dropped when the government went for a deep-level burial ground at Sellafield, Cumbria, but could be re-examined if the Sellafield scheme were abandoned.) There is also local anxiety over plans for a big new coal importing terminal at Immingham. The plans were shelved before the general election, but might be revived if the new Conservative government gives the electricity industry the green light to expand coal imports. Local resistance to the new port is laced with concern about the effect it would have on employment in the Yorkshire coalfield. On the other hand, many locals will breathe a deep sigh of relief over the effect of the smallest power station being built in the area. The 15MW station, on the site of the former Flixborough chemical works, will be powered by the manure of nearly 1m chickens a year reared on the Scunthorpe area's 40 battery farms. The highly pungent 'poultry litter', as it is clinically called, has been traditionally used to fertilise the area's rich farmland giving it its recognisable aroma. This is one power station which should significantly improve, rather than pollute, the atmosphere.  The Financial Times   Survey LIN Page 24  "

This was despite slack domestic demand and a drought-induced fall in hydraulic production which forced a switch to more costly coal-fired operations. The results, which brought earnings per share up to Pta449.3 from Pta408.8, were marginally ahead of forecasts. They are likely to raise expectations that INI, the state holding company which owns 75 per cent of the utility, will further reduce its equity through an international share offer. Endesa said it owed its profitability last year to lower overall debt - long-term debts fell sharply by 24 per cent while short-term borrowings increased by 16 per cent - to falling interest rates and the devalued peseta, and to internal cost controls. These compensated for a modest 0.8 per cent increase in energy sales to electricity distributors and an increase of 1.8 per cent in direct sales to consumers and for a 5.1 increase in operating costs. Consolidated revenue rose by 4.7 per cent to Pta752.5bn. The company, which has a 2 per cent stake in Germany's RWE and owns 7 per cent of the Venezuelan utility, Electricidad de Caracas, has been an active buyer of equity in private Spanish utilities. The aim is to boost its distribution network ahead of the formal deregulation of the domestic electricity sector. Endesa is understood to be negotiating the sale of 6 per cent of its equity to RWE and to the UK's National Power and the placement of a further 4 per cent among institutional investors. Following a 1988 partial privatisation, 23 per cent of the utility is listed on the markets and, since 1992, some 10 per cent of the free float is in the form of ADS on the New York stock exchange.

He added that the total amount spent by the United Saudi  Electricity Company in the Western Region on electricity for the  holy pilgrimage shrines in Mecca, in order to add new stations  and to reinforce and expand new services for subscribers and  pilgrims going to the Holy Mosque in Mecca, has been more than  SR400 million ($106.6 million).    After making an inspection tour yesterday of the holy  pilgrimage shrines in Muna, 'Arafat, and al-Muzdalifah and  familiarizing himself with the electrical services provided by  the Western Region and its preparations for the pilgrimage  season, al-Zamil demanded that, in return for these generous  expenditures, citizens should make a constant effort to conserve  electricity. He said that preparations for the pilgrimage season  are being completed and are being done by a [single] unified  office in Muna. In less than 10 hours, orders are received and  processed concerning tents and services for pilgrims, and  maintenance teams always stand by ready to help.    Concerning the inauguration of the new Ajyad electric  transformer station in Mecca yesterday (Tuesday), al-Zamil said  that it constitutes basic support for the holy pilgrimage  shrines as well as reinforcement for the region's sources of  electric power for providing electric services.    Prince Majid Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of the province of  Mecca, yesterday inaugurated the Ajyad station in Mecca, which  was completed at the beginning of this month, and those  attending included Minister al-Zamil, Engineer Mahmud Tibah,  head of the administrative council of the electricity authority  of the Western Region, Dr. Bakr Hamzah Khushaym, director  general of electricity for the Western Region, and Dr. Rabi'  Sadiq Dahlan, deputy governor of the province of Mecca.    It should be mentioned that the United Saudi Electricity  Company in the Western Region put up the Ajyad transformer  station at a total cost of SR157 million ($21.8 million), and  implementation of the project took 15 months. This was in  addition to implementation of the project dealing with  construction of the al-Shubaykah transformer station, which has  the purpose of providing a principal source of power for the  area including the Holy Mosque in Mecca, which has a heavy  demand for electricity. The cost of this project was SR118  million ($31.4 million), and it was completed in 18 months.  Furthermore, the company implemented the project for expansion  of the Muna transformer station at a cost of SR18 million, the  project involving laying out the electrical cable between the  Holy Mosque transformer station and al-Misfalah [name as  transliterated] at a total cost of about 54 million riyals, and  the project involving straightening out the path of the  above-ground electricity line from the Jabal al-Nur transformer  station to the 'Arafat transformer station at a cost of SR6  million, the implementation of which took six months.    Right now the Umm al-Qura University transformer station is  being put up, at a total cost of SR118 million, and work on this  project will come to an end at the beginning of next year.     "

0,FT941-9600 ,"FT941-9600 _AN-EBNCXACUFT 940214   FT  14 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Littlechild's power gamble   The British government's decision in the late 1980s to privatise the power generation industry as a duopoly has been a costly error. Consumers have been charged more for their electricity than they would have been in a more competitive market. To free themselves from the generators' market power, regional electricity companies made premature investments in gas-fired plants. As a consequence, thousands of coal miners lost their jobs. Last week's deal between Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, and National Power and PowerGen will do nothing to repair the damage of the past. What it may do is make things better in the future. But even that is far from certain. The reason for some hope is that Prof Littlechild has focused on the heart of the problem: the fact that National Power and PowerGen own virtually all the country's coal and oil-fired plants. These have higher running costs than the nuclear and gas-fired stations owned by competitors and so, under the complex pool system, are the last to be brought on stream as demand mounts. Control of this marginal plant effectively enables the duopoly to fix prices not just in the pool, the wholesale spot market for electricity, but also for longer-term contracts. Under the deal with Prof Littlechild, National Power and PowerGen have agreed over the next two years to sell 6,000MW of plant, equivalent to six large stations. The hope is that the new owners of this capacity will bid vigorously to keep prices low. In the interim, there will be a two-year price cap, cutting pool prices by up to 7 per cent. The price cap will benefit large industrial users, which often buy electricity direct from the pool. Smaller companies and residential customers, though, will get little immediate relief. Their prices are largely determined by five-year contracts put in place at the beginning of last year. Not ideal Although the prices in these contracts are even higher than pool prices, Prof Littlechild decided not to revise the terms. This is largely because the government brokered the contracts when it was trying to find a way out of the 1992-93 coal crisis. Prof Littlechild's resort to price control is not ideal. Price regulation can make a market less flexible and competitive. However, in this instance, it can be defended as a purely temporary measure while the divestment process is completed. The bigger question is whether the disposal of 6,000MW of plant or roughly 10 per cent of England's generating capacity will be enough to curb the duopoly's market power. Prof Littlechild thinks it will. Once competition from new gas stations, Nuclear Electric and imports from France and Scotland is included, the duopoly's share of generating capacity will fall to under 50 per cent. Too optimistic However, it would be wrong to be too optimistic. Nuclear Electric, gas stations and imported electricity may dent the duopoly's market power, but not by much given that they do not own marginal plant. And, though the new competitors created after the duopoly's divestments will be in a better position to influence prices since they will probably own marginal plant, it remains to be seen whether two minnows will be sufficient to restrain the market power of companies many times their size. Why, then, did Prof Littlechild not insist on a much more ambitious disposal programme? That would have broken the duopoly's power for good. The answer is almost certainly that to do so would have required a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Not only would that have delayed any benefit to consumers. Prof Littlechild, who must have been acutely aware of ministers' recent refusal to back an MMC recommendation to break up British Gas, could not have been sure of the outcome. An MMC referral would also have postponed the government's plans to sell its remaining 40 per cent stake in the generators. There is something to be said for clinching a deal now rather than gambling on a monopoly investigation. But Prof Littlechild has also gambled that the sale of a handful of stations will be sufficient to curb the generators' power. Customers can only hope his gamble pays off.

Cheng Kejie, chairman of the region, told reporters that the  hydropower station is believed to be second only to the  projected Three Gorges Hydropower Station in scale, and when it  is completed it will be the second-biggest in Asia.    During the first-phase construction, a water control dam  with  a height of 375 m [meters] will be built, and seven generating  units with a total generating capacity of 4.2 million kw will be  installed. When this phase is completed the hydropower station  will generate 15.67 billion kwh of electricity a year, according  to Cheng.    During the second-phase construction, two more generating  units, with an aggregate generating capacity of 5.4 million kw,  will be installed.    The entire project will require a total investment of 30  billion yuan (about 3.448 billion U.S. dollars), of which 970  million U.S. dollars will be provided in the form of World Bank  loans.    The chairman explained that the station will not only  provide  more electricity for Guangxi, but also play a positive role in  fighting flooding on the lower reaches of the Hongshui River.    He said that the new hydropower station will be jointly  built  by the State Energy Investment Corporation, Guizhou and  Guangdong Provinces and Guangxi.    Guangxi will bear 25 percent of the total investment needed  and will be able to use 50 percent of the electricity to be  generated.    The Hongshui River abounds in hydroelectric resources. The  State Council has approved the building of ten stepped  hydropower stations, with a total generating capacity of 11  million kw.    Construction has started on most of these hydropower  stations; four of them have finished their first phases and are  already transmitting electricity.    The chairman added that local departments are already busy  with the preparatory work, including the building of highways  leading to the construction site, for the formal launching of  the Longtan Hydropower Station Project.

Thanks to its inefficiency, power cuts are a daily fact of life. At the height of the country's economic crisis in late-1990, many users were without electricity for 20 hours a day, writes Stephen Fidler. As a result, there has been a huge shift to privately-generated electricity. Every important office building, factory and hotel in the country needs a private generator. This is not only hugely inefficient - it also raises the costs significantly of doing business in the country: a generator capable of producing 1,000 kilowatts costs Dollars 1m. Capacity in such microgenerators is estimated at around 600-700MW, equivalent to the capacity of the state Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE). At its worst, estimated generating capacity of CDE fell to around 400 megawatts. This compares with nominally installed capacity of 1,200MW and demand of closer to 800-900MW. The crisis prompted President Joaquin Balaguer to replace the head of the CDE, since when there has been an increase in capacity, helped by loans from the World Bank to rehabilitate some electricity plants. Loans from the Inter-American Development Bank are also ready for the rehabilitation of more. As a condition for their help, the international financial institutions insisted that outsiders be brought in to administer the company, a task to be taken over by Fenosa, the Spanish utility. Offers have been placed to provide a further 600-700MW of privately generated capacity, but it is not clear how much of this will be installed. Government officials make much of the country's hydro-electric capacity which it claims should fill the supply gap. Industry observers, however, reckon the priority use for the reservoirs is irrigation rather than electricity generation, and that hydroelectricity will only provide marginal input to the grid. For now, improved management and maintenance have raised capacity to an estimated 700MW. This is still insufficient to cover demand and blackouts remain common, but there has been a marked improvement from 18 months ago. The problem remains in the longer term, where there is nothing to stop future managers of the system once again running down capacity through abysmal management and maintenance procedures.

0,FT944-12266 ,"FT944-12266 _AN-EKBD9AD0FT 941102   FT  02 NOV 94 / Yorkshire Electricity loses deal in Sweden      By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES and RICHARD WOLFFE      STOCKHOLM, LONDON   Yorkshire Electricity yesterday abandoned plans to buy a 17.3 per cent stake in Stockholm Energi, Sweden's third-largest energy producer, after an effective veto from the newly-elected Stockholm city council. The SKr1.8bn (Pounds 154m) deal was central to the diversification plans of the regional electricity company. It is understood that Yorkshire will receive around SKr200m in compensation. Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive, said: 'We are obviously disappointed that the new political regime in Stockholm does not wish to go ahead with the agreement that was made with the former regime.' The swing to the left in the Stockholm elections reflected a broader national trend which carried the Social Democrats back to power last September with a more critical policy on privatisation. Yorkshire's shares rose 24p to 759p as the City expected Yorkshire to follow East Midlands Electricity's decision to give Pounds 186m back to its shareholders in a special dividend payment. Yorkshire could alternatively buy back up to 10 per cent of its shares after its closed period ends on December 16. The Swedish deal appears to have fallen victim to horsetrading on the city council, which owns Stockholm Energi, following municipal elections. The elections left the Social Democrats needing support from two parties opposed to the agreement. When the deal was agreed in June, a centre-right coalition was in control. 'This is purely a political decision,' said Mr Inge Telander, a spokesman for Stockholm Energi. He said the group, which produces around 13 terawatt hours (twh) of electricity a year, had needed a partner to bolster its balance sheet after its SKr2bn purchase of hydropower generating facilities in June 1993. A deal with Yorkshire would have strengthened its equity-to-assets ratio from 11 per cent to more than 25 per cent. The company was also seeking expertise from Yorkshire ahead of a planned deregulation of the Swedish electricity market. However, this deregulation was last week postponed by the new Social Democratic government. A proposal to list Stockholm Energi has also been abandoned.   Companies:-  Yorkshire Electricity.

Will those new (no chemicals) ionization pool purification systems really work  and do they use much electricity?    ANSWER: An ionization pool water purification system can reduce the amount of  chlorine and other chemicals you need by more than 90%. It uses only several  dollars worth of electricity per swimming season.    Using minerals, silver and copper, to purify water is an ancient process. Even  in extremely low concentrations, silver kills bacteria. Copper, in the same low  concentrations, stops the growth of algae. The concentrations are lower than in  many types of natural mineral drinking water.    An ionization water purifier uses two electrodes that are made primarily of  copper and silver. When a low-voltage electrical current is passed between the  electrodes, copper and silver ions are given off into the swimming pool water.  There isn't any danger from this very low voltage.    You can easily install a purification unit yourself. The special electrodes are  housed in a small bowl-shaped tank with inlet and outlet pipe flanges. These  attach to the piping outside your pool. You will still need the filtering  system to remove dirt. You can wire it so that the purifier comes on when the  pump starts.    The purification system has an electronic control unit that adjusts the  concentration level of the copper and silver ions in the pool water. You use a  simple test kit, included with the system, to check the concentration level  until you find the proper adjustment for your pool.    When you first install the ionization system, you still have to use some  chlorine and chemicals until the ion concentrations get to an adequate level.  Then, a couple of times each swimming season, you should add some standard  chemicals for a quick treatment of the pool water.    Other than couple of cents per day for the electricity to operate the unit,  your only expense is the replacement of the electrodes about every three to  five years. They come in a set with new gaskets and you can replace them  yourself.

0,FT941-3588 ,"FT941-3588 _AN-ECODSAHHFT 940315   FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (14): Imperfect but improved - The CEGB warned that supply security would be damaged if power generation were to be separated from the national grid . . . but this was just one of the many myths that were exposed / Privatisation      By RAY DAFTER   A Study of the Privatisation of the Electricity Supply Industry in England  Wales by Alex Henney EEE Ltd, 38, Swains Lane, London N6 6QR, Pounds 400 389 pages Give or take the odd flicker, the lights have stayed on in Laddingford. In the broad sweep of civilisation, this may seem to be of trifling consequence. But I have always regarded my domestic supply - based as it is on electricity dribbling from the end of a rural supply line in Kent - as a fairly accurate indicator of the health of the electricity supply industry. When, prior to privatisation, the Central Electricity Generating Board warned that the security of supply would be seriously impaired if generation was separated from the national distribution grid, I stocked up with candles. And yet this proved to be just one of the many myths and weaknesses exposed by the privatisation of the industry - one of the most complicated and ambitious attempted by any Government. The CEGB, for instance, claimed its system was 'the envy of the world', and yet, as Alex Henney shows time and time again, the board was inefficient, complacent and downright misleading when it came to presenting the true cost of nuclear power. The industry was producer-dominated, with the area electricity boards having little influence over (or, one suspects, little understanding of) its wholesale price, the bulk supply tariff. Management was patchy and over-influenced by trade unions, while the Electricity Council, the central co-ordinating body, was largely ineffectual. It must be said that there was little malevolence in all of this. The managers and staff did their best; indeed, their dedication to public service (demonstrated admirably in the aftermath of the 1987 hurricane) has often been undervalued. It was the basic structure of the industry that was wrong. It was also highly politicised. For all of its shortcomings, privatisation has produced a considerable improvement on the original system. The industry is much more commercially aware; power and influence has been transferred to where it should always have been - the distributor, or regional electricity companies (RECs). This commercialism, this desire for a quick return, has inevitably put strains on other strategically-important energy industries, however. It has given rise to the dash for gas in generation; it has accelerated the run down of the coal industry, while opening the import gates to foreign (often subsidised) coal. It has also put a question mark over the longer-term future of the currently aided nuclear industry. The lack of an energy policy is all too evident. A former chairman of the London Electricity Consultative Council, Alex Henney has been a long-time critic of the supply industry. In this study he has provided a comprehensive analysis of the financial and operational processes of privatisation. Given the complexity of the subject - and it did take an army of 600 experts to plan the process - he is to be commended for mastering the detail. Where this book disappoints is in its lack of personality. Little is recorded of the tensions and arguments that punctuated, and in part shaped, the privatisation debate. Why was it, for instance, that Sir Philip Jones, chairman of the Electricity Council, was sidelined from events, in spite of his substantial Whitehall experience and propensity for grappling with complex issues? What of Lord Marshall, former chairman of the CEGB and the world's most colourful and controversial exponent of nuclear energy? When, in 1989, the government decided to exclude all nuclear reactors from privatisation he was 'invited to resign'. That is all we are told. And then there were the chairmen of the area boards. They were far from united in the privatisation debate, displaying varying degrees of commercial acumen, personal ambition, retribution, and plain old-fashioned public service. Most of them are still in place, now as leaders of the privatised RECs (and doing very nicely, thank you). Alex Henney is a consultant, advising - among others - electricity companies, which might explain why he has steered well clear of the more colourful personal issues. This is a pity, for it was the personalities, not statisticians, who shaped the new electricity supply industry with all its market strengths and imperfections.

0,FT911-5096 ,"FT911-5096 _AN-BDPBVADQFT 910416   FT  16 APR 91 / Challengers emerge for UK telecoms market      By HUGO DIXON and JULIET SYCHRAVA   TWO NEW companies are poised to enter the newly-deregulated UK telecommunications market - representing a potentially serious challenge to British Telecom and Mercury Communications, the existing long-distance operators. British Waterways, the public utility which runs the UK canal system, has linked up with privately-owned US Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance telecoms carrier, with a view to providing an alternative long-distance network in the UK. The newly privatised electricity supply industry is also considering entering both the long-distance and local telecoms markets. Last week chairmen of the twelve regional electricity companies and the National Grid Company discussed forming a joint-venture to apply for licences. Both moves were prompted by the government white paper last month which opened the Pounds 10bn-a-year telecommunications market to competition and paved the way for any company to apply for licences to supply telecommunications services. British Rail has already announced plans to enter the telecoms market by laying cables alongside its tracks. The two new challengers believe their existing networks offer them a cheap way of entering this potentially lucrative market. British Waterways would lay fibre optic cables along the bottom of its canals, while the electricity supply industry would hang the cables between its pylons. British Waterways and Sprint plan to invest between Pounds 50m and Pounds 75m to build a trunk network to within 5 miles of half the UK's population. Mr David Ingman, British Waterways' chairman, said the aim would be to act as a carrier's carrier, supplying high quality capacity to other operators, such as personal communications networks, and large business customers. Under government regulations British Waterways will not be allowed to invest any of its own money in the project and most of the shares will have to be owned by the private sector. The partners intend that GPT, Britain's largest telecommunications equipment supplier, would provide the submarine cables. A final decision to proceed with the project will be taken in the next couple of months after further assessment of the market. The electricity industry's plans are potentially more ambitious, with one executive saying a total of Pounds 400m may be invested. The companies are considering carrying not only telephone, but also television and data services. Some regional electricity companies have not yet committed themselves to the project out of fear that the City would take a dim view of such early diversification. Others - notably Northern Electric, Norweb, and Yorkshire, together with the National Grid Company - are enthusiastic because there are not many other significant opportunities to expand outside their core business. Norweb and Yorkshire have also considered developing independent regional telecommunications networks. The final decision on whether to apply for a licence will be taken in May, said Mr David Morris, chairman of Northern Electric, who is leading research into the project for the thirteen companies. 'We have reached a milestone in the study process,' he said. 'But further work must be done to appraise the project in financial terms.'  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "

The chairmen of the 12 electricity consumers' committees in England and Wales said that while profits and dividends had increased since privatisation, 'the ordinary non-investing customer has enjoyed little financial benefit'. They said there was no evidence that recent announcements of 'small' price reductions and price standstills were prompted 'other than by a need for the companies to remain within the current price formula'. Of the 12 regional companies the highest cut was 6 per cent - by Norweb. Five companies implemented freezes. The committee chairmen said price reductions of at least 5 per cent would have been appropriate. They said they would lobby Prof Littlechild to take advantage of the distribution price-control review, now under way, to tighten the price formula. Separately, Prof Littlechild yesterday announced standards that require the 12 regional electricity companies and two in Scotland to carry out Pounds 100m of expenditure on energy-efficiency measures in the next four years. Under a review of prices of the companies' supply businesses conducted last year, the regulator provided each company with an allowance of Pounds 1 per customer per year for expenditure on energy-efficiency projects. These include subsidising the fitting of insulation in customers' homes and reducing the prices of energy-efficient appliances. The key requirement of the standards is to ensure that the money raised by the companies is spent on 'worthwhile projects which will benefit the customer'. The savings will be calculated in accordance with a formula proposed by the Energy Savings Trust. Companies will be encouraged to target special-needs customers, such as the elderly, disabled and low-income families. Prof Littlechild said the companies would produce annual reports which would 'allow for an informed public debate about the value to customers of the energy-efficiency measures'.

Energis, National Grid's new telecoms subsidiary, intends to use its pylons to install a fibre-optic telecoms network between Britain's leading towns. It plans to have a network covering 17 of the 23 biggest towns and cities in England and Wales operating by next April. It talked yesterday of prices about 15 per cent lower than those of BT and Mercury. Scottish Hydro-Electric also gained a licence yesterday. It too intends to use its network to offer phone services, but is looking for a joint venture partner to undertake the telecoms side of the business. Businesses will be the main beneficiaries of the increased competition at first, but Energis intends to market to residential customers from the outset. Energis is budgeting to spend Pounds 100m on its fibre-optic network in the next year. Although its pylon network does not extend to Scotland, it is looking for arrangements with Scottish carriers - including Hydro-Electric - to provide a network north of the border. Energis is negotiating to connect with BT's local network to take calls the last part of the way to businesses and private customers. It is also starting connection talks with cable TV companies, 58 of which are building local telephone networks in conurbations. This could enable it to bypass BT in much of the country. Mr Gordon Owen, Energis chairman, predicted that the company would soon be 'the third force' in UK telecoms. 'This is a significant milestone in our plans to use the electricity industry to offer a full range of residential and business services to UK communications customers.' Four public network licences have been granted since the government decided to open the UK's fixed-network market two years ago. The others have gone to Ionica, which is building a national radio-based network, and Colt, which this month gained permission to operate a fixed network within the M25 area. Colt intends to start offering services in the City later this year. Together with the cable TV companies' local networks, the new operators look set to end the BT and Mercury duopoly that has existed since 1984. National Grid is jointly owned by the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales. Hydro-Electric is an integrated supplier and distributor of electricity in northern Scotland. Four other electricity companies have also applied for telecommunications licences: ScottishPower, East Midlands Electricity, Yorkshire Electricity (through a joint venture with Kingston Communications, the Hull telecommunications infrastructure operator) and Norweb. The applications are still under consideration. Cable television companies installed more than 15,000 new telephone lines in April, bringing the total to more than 156,000. This is a rise of almost 50,000 since January. At the same cable television subscribers rose by 3,943 during the month to stand at 458,410 - an increase of 22,000 this year. The Cable Television Association says the number of homes that are now close to cable networks this year - and therefore available for subscription - could reach nearly 1m.

It was an  important new measure, but in its actual implementation, are the  localities doing what they please?    Deceiving Those Above and Below--Jacking Up the Per Capita  Net Income    When a county in the western part of the central Shaanxi  plains reported its per capita net income last year, the county  statistics bureau compiled the figures submitted by the towns  and townships and let the leader in charge of the bureau review  the numbers before submitting them to the city. When the manager  saw that the per capita net income was only 570 yuan, he thought  it was far too low and immediately met with several deputy  county heads to reach a consensus: ""We have worked hard for the  last year, and we have so little to show for. It won't do."" In  fact these people only had their own promotions in mind. The  county chief who was in charge of agriculture summoned the head  of the statistics bureau to the county government office and  eventually changed the per capita net income to 590 yuan, and  the number was then sent to the city. The city statistics bureau  noticed that the per capita income of the people in a village in  the mountains in a certain town was only 176 yuan. They worried  that it might drag down the whole city's per capita income, and  so the manager immediately called up the county statistics  bureau which got in touch with the town statistician who said  that the number had been reported by the town. The county  statistics bureau later took it upon itself to change the per  capita income to 340 yuan. The whole county's per capita net  income was raised by 20 yuan, and based on the rule that the  peasant's burden may not exceed 5 percent of the per capita  income of the previous year, the county was taking away 1 yuan  from every peasant. The county claimed that the peasant's share  was only a little more than 4 percent, but in fact it was 9  percent.    Relevant data show that counties tempering with the per  capita net income figures is a nationwide practice; it is only a  matter of how far each would go.    Rural Electricity Prices Turn Somersaults    Walk around any village and mention electricity price and  you  will see how angry the peasant can get. They are very unhappy  with the ""electric tiger."" Study shows that electricity prices  differ among the 21 towns and townships and 250 villages in one  county, and none is complying the current state-set price. Some  charge more than three times the state-set rate; their receipts  come in all shapes, colors, and forms.    From data provided by the electricity department, one learns  that electricity rate for lighting is a three-tier system: low,  normal, and peak rates which translate to 0.129 yuan per degree,  0.257 yuan per degree, and 0.386 yuan per degree respectively.  Motive electricity generally cost 0.207 yuan per degree. When I  checked the receipts of the 312 electricity customers I visited  in the county, I found most were standard invoices used in the  cities and a few were town- and village-level invoices; some  were blank slips.    The Chen family in Group 3 of Miganqiao Village in a certain  township owns an electric oven (with two-phase motor.) When the  electrician collects the bill, he adds the amount of electricity  consumed by the oven to the bill. That household's monthly  electric bill comes to an average of 50 yuan. The Sunjiabao  Village in a certain township makes its own electric bills and  charges as much as 0.70 yuan per degree, which shocks most  people. Two villages in another town issues blank slips and  charges 0.30 all the way up to 0.60 yuan per degree. Some  peasant families have to make do with oil lamps.    Some village group cadres pay little or nothing for  electricity. This has become a common practice. This is because  village-level cadres can hire and fire electricians at will.  Those who obey the village cadres, who do special favors for the  cadres' families, and who do not charge the cadres will get the  jobs, and so the electricians collaborate and add the cadres'  household electric bills onto the other villagers' bills and  even raise the charges as they please to let the cadres reap a  profit.    Improper Apportionment Still Runs Rampant    Today, when the leading cadres go out, they want to show  off.  They want fancy cars, the best-selling cars. They get money by  hook or by crook so that they can buy cars. They use bank loans  to buy cars; they spend official administrative funds on cars.  Despite specific regulations handed down by the State Council  regarding the grades of cars they can buy, everybody, regardless  of rank, is buying a SANTANA.    A certain township has a new ""Beijing"" jeep. In June of this  year, it appropriated 20,000 from each township-affiliated  enterprise, and without getting permission from the  purchase-control office, they bought a SANTANA. A few days  later, the county financial bureau sent someone down to  investigate. The township leader wined and dined him and paid a  fine. An illegal car was thus legalized. The year's jeep is to  be used by the county leaders when they go to the villages, and  the new SANTANA is for use when they go to town.    Today, reportedly, the township party committee secretary is  rewarded for the clever apportionment and is put to work in high  places by the county leadership.    Appropriating money from township enterprises in fact is  adding to the peasants' burdens.    Some Thoughts on Easing the Burden    Since the 1980's, the Party Central Committee and the State  Council have paid special attention to the issue of the  peasants' burden. They have always made protecting the peasants'  interests the most important starting point of their rural work.  They have promulgated a series of policies and measures which  have played a definite role in easing the peasants' burden. But  why is the cancer of heavy burden still here? The problem lies  in the fact that some localities and departments are halfhearted  in carrying out the policies; they move and then stop, and they  distort the policies, or they just go through the motion of  carrying out the policies.    One of the keys to reducing the peasants' burden lies in the  hands of the leading departments at all levels, because many  projects that add to the peasants' burden originate from these  departments. If they do not have a sound and clear understanding  of the problem of the peasants' heavy burden, if they do not  begin to take effective measures, it would be difficult to solve  the problem. To reduce the peasants' burden, there must be a set  of laws and regulations which would severely punish those who  impose heavy burdens on the peasants, so that the party's rural  policy can be implemented smoothly and without obstacle. To ease  the peasants' burden, all sides must work together and lend  their support. Speeding up rural economic development and  increasing the peasants' income are also necessary conditions  for easing the peasants' burden.     "
0,FT932-318 ,"FT932-318 _AN-DF2CGAF7FT 930629   FT  29 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Monopoly fears dog German coal strategy - The difficult privatisation of the east's vast lignite fields      By JUDY DEMPSEY   LAUSITZER Braunkohle, or Laubag, is eastern Germany's biggest open-cast lignite mine. These vast brown coal fields straddle the states of Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. And like almost every other industry in eastern Germany, Laubag is to be privatised. The former state-run mines are currently under the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry. But of all the sales undertaken by the Treuhand, the privatisation of Laubag is proving one of the most difficult. A consortium, led by Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE Energie, western Germany's utility company, is negotiating to buy Laubag from the Treuhand. The consortium includes RWE Energie, PreussenElektra, and Bayernwerk, Germany's three biggest utility companies. The big three, as they are known, already have interests in eastern Germany. Each holds a 25 per cent stake in Vereinigte Energiewerke AG, or Veag, eastern Germany's big utility company, which operates the region's high voltage transmission grid and depends on brown coal for power generation. Under the terms of the stromvertrag, or electricity contract of August 1990, eastern Germany's regional utilities must buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag in order to underwrite the massive investments it is undertaking. These include the modernisation, or construction, of brown coal-fired power stations. In practise, however, the stromvertrag has severely restricted competition in eastern Germany's electricity sector. Although Veag is monopolised by the big three, it is legally owned by the Treuhand, which intends to privatise it by the end of the year. But the agency is insisting that the privatisation of Veag should be coupled with the privatisation of the Laubag lignite fields. 'It makes sense,' a Treuhand official said. 'The sale of electricity and coal must be linked. Both companies need each other. Veag needs Laubag's coal for electricity generation and Laubag needs coal contracts with Veag for its economic survival.' It now appears, however, that Rheinbraun is slowing down the Treuhand's attempts at selling Laubag partly to de-couple this complex privatisation process. If Rheinbraun succeeded, Veag, once privatised, could be in a much stronger position to negotiate coal contracts suited to its own interests. Such a development would mean that the existing electricity monopoly in eastern Germany would be extended to the brown coal sector - and dominated by the same west German utility companies. The Treuhand is aware of this. But as it has no choice, for the moment, but to negotiate only with the Rheinbraun-led consortium for the sale of Laubag, the least the agency wants is a competitive price structure introduced for eastern German lignite. To make Laubag economically viable, the Treuhand reckons it requires annual delivery contracts of about 57m tonnes to Veag's power generation blocks in eastern Germany. But Rheinbraun is arguing that it is not certain it can sell that amount to Veag because consumption of brown coal in eastern Germany will not be high enough to absorb this amount. Before unification annual lignite supply of 87.7m tonnes accounted for more than 68 per cent of eastern Germany's primary energy consumption (compared with 8.5 per cent in western Germany). In 1990, that figure fell by 12 per cent, and a further 26 per cent in 1991 following the virtual collapse and closure of eastern Germany's uncompetitive industry. In a recent study, Goldman Sachs, the investment banker, suggests that electricity demand in eastern Germany has bottomed out. 'The problem remains. It is difficult to give any precise forecasts for future energy consumption of brown coal,' said Mr Gunther Kramer, one of the board members of Laubag, and formerly employed by Rheinbraun. 'We are arguing with the Treuhand and Veag about the size of the coal contracts, in particular about the price per tonne of coal,' a senior Rheinbraun official said. 'We would prefer open coal contracts for Laubag, rather than one which locks us into permanent contract deliveries, because we are not sure about future consumption of brown coal,' he added. Rheinbraun's reluctance to agree on coal delivery contracts for Laubag coincides with a suggestion by Veag that it may delay part of its own building programme, most notably, the construction of a second new 800 MW power generation block at Boxberg, to which Laubag would deliver coal. Mr Martin Martiny, a member of Veag's board, said recently that the building timetable for Boxberg might be put back because 'it is difficult to know how much brown coal eastern German industry will in future need, and therefore how much Veag will require for power generation'. Treuhand officials argue that if Veag does not adhere to its original building programme, it will have the effect of delaying the privatisation of Laubag. 'We cannot sell Laubag without an agreement with Veag over coal contract deliveries,' a senior Treuhand official said. 'This is important for setting the selling price, establishing the economic viability of Laubag, guaranteeing jobs for the thousands who are employed at the mines and financing environmental clean-up.' But it is not primarily the uncertainty about eastern Germany's future energy consumption of brown coal that is undermining the Treuhand's attempts at putting coal contracts in place so as to speed up the privatisation of Laubag, but rather the network of mutual west German interests attempting to monopolise energy pricing in eastern Germany. For instance, Veag is monopolised by the big three, which, through Rheinbraun, is negotiating to buy Laubag. In theory, a comfortable 'in-house' private deal could be forged between Veag and Laubag on the size, price and delivery timetable for coal contracts, once the Treuhand privatises Veag. That is precisely what the Treuhand wants to avoid. 'You can see the challenge facing the Treuhand,' said an investment banker who has advised the agency on other privatisation contracts. 'The Treuhand's role is to privatise Laubag and Veag at the best possible price. Yet it knows it has to deal with one big family which dominates Veag. That family does not want to go against its own interests as it attempts to acquire Laubag.' Another investment banker agreed. 'Rheinbraun believes the Big Three in Veag will drag its feet over setting the price and size of coal contracts for Laubag because Veag believes electricity is more profitable than coal,' he said. 'It thinks it can wear down the Treuhand in the hope that the agency will de-couple Veag from the sale of Laubag, then the brown coal can be sold at a much cheaper price to the big three consortium headed by Rheinbraun.' The Treuhand appears determined to stick to its original plan. 'We are not going to de-couple the privatisation of Veag and Laubag. There's little enough competition in eastern Germany without extending a monopoly over coal prices as well. The stromvertrag (electricity contract) has already limited competition for electricity prices. We are not going to be pushed around, and see the creation of another monopoly,' the senior Treuhand official declared.   Companies:-  Lausitzer Braunkohle.   Countries:-  DEZ   Germany, EC.

0,FT924-1397 ,"FT924-1397 _AN-CLRBYAB6FT 921218   FT  18 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: DTI says costs of renewable energy are high      By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent   ELECTRICITY generated by most forms of renewable energy is several times more expensive than using conventional fuels, according to a long-awaited report commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry. But the report - which was originally due in the spring and was published yesterday - calls for government intervention to help renewables become established. It argues that current prices of coal, gas and nuclear energy do not reflect start-up and environmental costs. The Renewable Energy Advisory Group argues that large offshore wave energy projects are unlikely to be uneconomic. A separate review for the DTI on the potential for wave energy, published at the same time, comes to the same conclusion for 'the short to medium term'. The advisory group, which began work in September 1991, says that with government help renewables could 'plausibly' contribute between 5 per cent and 20 per cent of 1991 levels of electricity supply by the year 2025. It estimates that this could save at least 10m tonnes a year of carbon dioxide emissions - around 5 per cent of projected emissions of the gas, which is believed to be implicated in global warming. The report makes clear that most renewable energy costs at least two to three times as much as existing sources. Costs quoted for coal, gas and nuclear energy by the energy industry are between 2.2 p and 3.5 p per kWh, although the figures are disputed by environmentalists. The report recommends the government to help investment in renewables by underwriting a minimum level of 1,500MW by the year 2000 compared with the present agreed level of 1,000MW, and by guaranteeing fixed-term electricity supply contracts of between 10 and 15 years. The report urges the government to do this through the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation which requires the regional electricity companies in England and Wales to take a specified amount of power from 'clean' energy sources. The extra cost, funded by a levy on electricity consumers, is devoted almost entirely to nuclear energy. The government would need permission from the European Commission to extend the levy beyond 1998, the present limit. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, criticised the 'short-term' approach to wave energy and the 'puny target' of 1,500MW from renewables by 2000, recommending instead a target of 3,500MW.

The company, which operates the nuclear power stations of England and Wales, called for commercial freedom to compete with National Power and PowerGen. 'The original obstacles to privatisation have been largely overcome,' it says. 'The company has been transformed since its formation in 1990, increasing output by almost 45 per cent and doubling productivity by March this year. Market share has risen from 16.7 per cent in 1989-90 to more than 23 per cent last year. 'The company's five advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) stations are among the best-performing in the world. This achievement, coupled with the successful completion of Sizewell B within the committed programme and below budget, provides assurance that Nuclear Electric has a sound commercial base on which to operate profitably and competitively in the market. 'The AGR stations and Sizewell B (the pressurised-water reactor station) will be profitable without government subsidy. Risks over liabilities and uncertainties over income of these stations have been greatly reduced to the point where the majority of risks for the AGR and PWR stations can now be considered transferable to the private sector. 'The expected lifetimes of the (six) Magnox stations have been exhaustively reviewed. Nuclear Electric is confident that they may continue to operate economically into the next century. However, the risks associated with their back-end costs, resulting from decisions taken decades ago, would not be acceptable to the private sector. 'To achieve a successful privatisation, the risks and liabilities to which investors are exposed must be appropriately allocated. One approach would involve Nuclear Electric divesting its operations to a new subsidiary, whose shares would be sold to private investors and which would then take forward the electricity generating of Nuclear Electric. The unprivatisable risks and liabilities would be retained by government. 'The new privatised company would own and operate the AGR and PWR stations, taking responsibility for related nuclear and other liabilities amounting to some Pounds 6bn. (It would not own the Magnox stations which would remain in state hands, but it might operate them.) Government would take a last-loss position on risks and would be paid premiums for doing so by other parties to the agreement. 'This option would transfer to the private sector the majority of the commercial risk in nuclear electricity generation; create opportunities to introduce competition to the management of long-term nuclear liabilities; give the private sector financial responsibilities for the company's investment decisions; and create substantial income for the government from the sale of shares. 'Privatisation could be completed within 18 months, without the need for new primary legislation.' Environmental and strategic benefits: 'The electricity market is not structured to respond to environmental and strategic needs. Nor does it take full account of the environmental effects of different forms of generation. The polluter does not pay. 'Adjusting the market framework to deliver the government's energy and environmental policy objectives would involve creating incentives to generators to invest in non-pollution technologies. 'Nuclear generation is alone among major technologies in accounting for and dealing with the effects of the entire fuel cycle. This is because it internalises the costs involved in waste management and decommissioning. The fact that the equivalent environmental costs of fossil-fuelled generation are ignored produces an imbalance in their relative costs and lead to market distortion. 'Nuclear Electric's current operations save the emission of more than 60m tonnes of carbon dioxide and 840,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide annually compared with a conventional coal plant. Of the options open to government to reduce gaseous emissions, nuclear energy is the most effective. It is controllable, certain in its effect, sustainable and can be achieved in a relatively short time without requiring a change in public lifestyles. 'Nuclear power also offers national benefits to the balance of payments, to employment and the export of technology. The industry employs 40,000 people directly. Building Sizewell C would provide 20,000 jobs during peak construction. 'A successful bid for a Taiwanese power station by the Westinghouse consortium, of which Nuclear Electric is a part, would create 5,000 jobs in British engineering over five years.' New plant construction: 'Nuclear power is more capital-intensive than combined cycle gas turbine stations which are being developed rapidly, but fuel costs are much lower. The cost of nuclear generation is therefore far less sensitive to fuel price movements, which many experts expect to rise significantly in real terms over the next few decades. 'In order to exploit fully the substantial national investment in Sizewell B, it is important to proceed with construction of a further plant as soon as possible. Nuclear Electric's investment appraisal of Sizewell C and Hinkley Point C (a Sizewell B replica for which the company has already gained planning consent) has indicated that on current expectations about gas prices, the projected annual return to investors would lie in the range of 5 per cent to 9 per cent. 'Price Waterhouse, advising the company, do not consider that sufficient private capital could be attracted unless the internal rate of return of a project exceeded 11 per cent in real terms. 'Government action is required to bridge the gap between the expected returns and market requirements. 'To ensure that the majority of risk is transferred to the private sector, a substantial private-sector consortium would have to be created to take responsibility for construction. Government support would be needed in three areas: security for lenders during construction; long-term electricity purchase contracts; and share of regulatory risks. Financing would be easier if the project sponsors included a privatised nuclear generating company. 'Income security could be provided by means of a new non fossil-fuel obligation order (which would oblige regional electricity companies to take a certain amount of nuclear power). This may require primary legislation.' Mr John Collier, Nuclear Electric chairman, said the review was about whether the UK wanted nuclear power to wither away, or whether it wanted to recognise its role in providing market competition, long-term electricity supplies and environmental balance. Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said that unless the government took action, Sizewell B could be the only nuclear power station operating in the UK in 30 years.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Nuclear Electric powers up for privatisation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   1989/  1990/  1991/  1992/  1993/94                                      90     91     92     93   prelim  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Output (terawatt hours)            42.5   45.0   48.4   55.0    61.0 Income: market sales (Poundsm)     2044   1077   1167   1426    1732 levy premium (Poundsm)                    1195   1265   1280    1230 Operating profit (loss)*            n/a (1009)  (783)  (564)   (224) Accounting unit cost                5.2    4.4    4.2    3.6     3.1 (p/kWh at Oct 93 values) Return on capital employed %*              3.4    7.9   11.0    14.4 Market share %                     16.7   17.4   18.5   21.6    23.2 Staff employed at year end       14,164 13,542 12,674 11.323   9,454 Productivity (GWh/employee)         2.9    3.2    3.6    4.5     5.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Restated for Financial Reporting Standard No 3 but before provisions for restructuring and before revision of previous year's nuclear provisions Source: Nuclear Electric  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Nuclear Electric.

We are both willing and able to use larger amounts of UK-produced coal provided a market can be found for the electricity generated from it and fair mechanisms can be agreed to meet the additional costs.' Generators' monopoly power is criticised in the report which calls for tougher price controls Neil Clarke chairman British Coal 'The report supports our consistently stated view that only a radical transformation of the market would change the prospects of many of our collieries. I am pleased that this report points the way to a more stable and secure future for our miners. It is a cool and rational assessment of the benefit of maintaining a substantial indigenous coal mining business for years to come.' British Coal would get up to Pounds 500m in subsidies over five years to become competitive with world prices John Collier chairman Nuclear Electric 'The recommendations open the way for a secure future for coal and nuclear power in the UK. In particular the committee has taken full account of our argument that there should be no sense in closing our nuclear stations early to make room for coal. . . it's far cheaper to run our stations than to close them. I'm happy with the suggestion that the fossil fuel levy and the company's inherited liabilities should both be taken away from Nuclear Electric.' Nuclear Electric would lose some of its levy revenue, but also some clean-up liabilities John Harris chairman East Midlands Electricity 'I disagree with the suggestion that franchise on the provision of electricity supply should be extended from 1994 to 1998. This will increase electricity prices. But I go along with the general thrust of the report which is that there should be government subsidy to keep pits open. . . The miners will have to ensure that in the next few years their pits will become more competitive. However I would want to see that the subsidy is not open-ended.' Regional suppliers would have to buy electricity generated from UK coal or risk losing licence Tony Craven Walker chief executive Monument Oil  Gas 'In identifying the need to provide for non-domestic quality gas, the committee has recognised the requirement to utilise Britain's energy reserves to maximum efficiency. I welcome the recognition of the project to develop four oil and gas fields in Liverpool Bay, north Wales, which has been suspended pending the outcome of the energy review.' Independent gas projects have been accused of stealing coal's market Arthur Scargill president NUM 'The report is unacceptable to the NUM and to mining communities. In spite of overwhelming evidence, the committee has refused to address the problem of the rigged market which led to the unlawful and irrational closure decisions. We find it incredible and inexplicable. . . that the committee has refused to recommend the phasing out of expensive nuclear power. . . and has not recommended stopping the 'dash for gas'.' Unions may win reprieve for thousands of jobs, but may lose out on cost-cutting Eamonn Butler director Adam Smith Institute 'Any subsidy to coal will cost jobs elsewhere in the oil and gas industries. It will also cost jobs among ordinary taxpayers. Businesses who are finding it difficult at the moment will face higher tax bills and employ less people for less time as a result.' Committee claims the measures are ultimately aimed at fostering a better energy market Lord Melchett executive director Greenpeace 'The committee appears will to have neglected the environment in favour of a quick fix designed to address political expediencies. Instead of subsidising just one declining and polluting industry, the nuclear industry, it is proposing to prop up another, the coal industry, without addressing the long-term future environmental and economic results of such a decision.'

0,FT942-13324 ,"FT942-13324 _AN-EDZEDABQFT 940426   FT  26 APR 94 / World Trade News: Caribbean energy sell-off generates keen interest / Review of various governments' efforts to divest state electricity interests      By CANUTE JAMES   Two US companies have agreed to purchase a 49 per cent stake in Trinidad and Tobago's state-owned power company for Dollars 112m (Pounds 76.7m). It is the largest transaction in the efforts of several Caribbean governments to sell their electricity companies, once considered the preserve of the state. Southern Electric International of Atlanta, Georgia and Amoco Business Development, a subsidiary of the Chicago oil company, are concluding the details of one of the larger privatisations in the region. The new investors will be responsible for operating and maintaining the generating facilities which provide electricity for the country of 1.2m people. The Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission has installed capacity of 1,178MW and generates just over 600MW, which is adequate for existing demand. There was, however, a growing need for additional generating capacity to be installed by 1996 if reliable power supply was to be guaranteed, said Mr Barry Barnes, Trinidad and Tobago's energy minister. To meet this schedule, the Trinidad company needs Dollars 90m-Dollars 125m, which it is unable to raise. Many other governments in the Caribbean are shedding their public power companies, anxious that they will become millstones, weighing heavily on already weak budgets. Most public energy companies are getting out of the business of generating, and some are becoming regulatory bodies overseeing the private companies which are taking over. The expansion and diversification of Caribbean economies over the past decade has left many state-owned power companies unable to keep up with demand, and without the resources to provide energy reliably and at acceptable rates. Frequent increases in the cost of power has reduced industrial competitiveness, while financially pressed governments have not been able to raise funds for expansion. Governments, under pressure to be fiscally prudent, have been unable to continue financing the deficits of the power companies and along with other state enterprises they have been offered for divestment. Indicative of the plans for the region's state-owned power companies is the plan by the Dominican Republic to restructure the Compana Dominicana de Electricidad and sell parts of it to private foreign and local companies. The company has been unable to meet the national demand for electricity of about 1550MW. The CDE's rated capacity is 1350MW, but output has fallen to as low as 540MW in recent years, and is now at just over 950MW, mainly because several plants have fallen into disrepair. Proposals for restructuring the country's electricity system involve splitting the CDE into three sections, responsible for generation, transmission and distribution. Transmission facilities will remain under government ownership, while power plants and distribution networks will be sold. Rates will be determined by the market, with generators selling to distributors while paying a fee to the government for using the transmission facilities. The changes will coincide with the inauguration of an expansion in installed capacity which should exceed demand and end shortages caused by plant breakdowns. All new generating capacity in Jamaica will be constructed and operated by private foreign and local companies as the first part of the government's move to divest and deregulate the Jamaica Public Service Company. The first of this is a 60MW plant under construction by US and local investors, and which is to be commissioned by 1996. It is part of a Dollars 160m programme by the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank to expand power generation and promote local and foreign private investment in the power industry. The Jamaican government has not yet determined which aspects of the power company's operations will be divested. The Grenada government is negotiating with WRB Enterprises of Florida which wants to buy a half of the island's state-owned power company. The Guyana Electricity Corporation is listed among several companies which the government wants to divest. There is, however, increasing interest in tapping the country's significant hydro power potential. The government is considering the construction and operation by foreign companies of a 100MW station at a cost of about Dollars 250m. The need to find foreign private participants in power generation has also affected Cuba. Despite the suspension of work on a nuclear power plant in Jaragua on the south coast, the government is carrying out basic maintenance of the facility while advising that it would welcome a foreign government or company as a partner to finish and then operate the facility. The plant, with a rated capacity of 430MW, requires about 42 tonnes of enriched uranium as its initial load and a further 14 tonnes a year.   Companies:-  Southern Electric International Inc.

0,FT943-4378 ,"FT943-4378 _AN-EIICUABZFT 940909   FT  09 SEP 94 / MPs say aid for renewable energy gives poor value      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   The government's Pounds 340m of subsidies for renewable energy programmes, such as wind power and 'hot rocks', has been attacked as poor value by a cross-party committee of MPs. The Commons public accounts committee said yesterday: 'It is very doubtful that the relatively modest increases in new electricity generation justify the large sums spent.' The report accepts that the programme has yielded useful information about green power, and supports the UK's international obligation to develop clean power sources. But it expresses reservations about the value of the subsidies administered by the Department of Trade and Industry, which will rise to Pounds 150m a year. The subsidies are made through the non-fossil fuel obligation, an official programme which obliges electricity companies to buy a proportion of their power from sources other than coal, oil and gas. The extra cost is covered by a levy on domestic electricity bills. The report points out that fewer than half the projects approved in the first two rounds of subsidies are actually producing electricity; half the projects in the second round may never start at all because they have been blocked by local planning objections, for example in the case of wind farms. The MPs say they are 'disappointed' that in spite of Pounds 54m being spent on wind energy programmes, 84 per cent of installed wind turbine capacity in the UK is provided by foreign manufacturers. The report also attacks subsidies for 'hot rocks' - drawing heat from deep in the earth. Even though Pounds 40m has been spent on this programme, there is no technology capable of exploiting this resource at a reasonable cost in the foreseeable future. Targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions can be achieved without expanding the nuclear power industry to replace coal-fired power stations, the Association of Nuclear-free Local Authorities says in a submission to the government's nuclear review.

Instead of utility officials having to enter homes, factories and offices to measure the amount of water, gas or electricity used, future readings could be taken from moving vehicles through low-power radios from transmission devices on the meters. Meters could also be read down the mains electricity network, with information sent back to users, if necessary, about new charges or rates of consumption. At present, these technologies are still in the trial stage, the main interest being shown by the water industry. Aid-Call, which makes medical alarms for the aged, will start installing its meter-reading devices later this year for tests. In the US, remote meter reading is common. But Terry Giles, Aid-Call's technical director, says tougher UK and continental European regulations and the use of different frequencies for meter-reading radios than in the US means different equipment is needed. Aid-Call, part of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the big French water and communications concern, has spent three years developing its product, called Ramar. It uses transponders to obtain the readings through low-power radio. Giles says remote metering technology needs to be cheap since so many devices have to be installed. Ramar has just gone into partnership with Kent Meters, which makes more than 7m meters a year for the world market. The companies will work on a radio-assisted, hand-held reading system capable of reading meters up to 50m away and a mobile system to obtain readings in vehicles moving at up to 30mph from distances of around 100m. In Somerset, Wessex Water plans tests on a different system developed by Remote Metering Systems, half-owned by Scottish Hydro-Electric. Tom Houston, Wessex's commercial services manager, says the trial will show whether meter reading by electricity works over long as well as short distances.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-13503 ,"FT942-13503 _AN-EDYDRACAFT 940425   FT  25 APR 94 / Electricity chiefs' chance to earn their wages: Why industry regulator Stephen Littlechild is likely to get tough in his review of prices      By MICHAEL SMITH   The chairmen and chief executives of Britain's 14 electricity distribution companies will never have a better chance to prove they are worth their threefold pay rises many have enjoyed since privatisation four years ago. During the next three months they will lock horns with Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, in negotiations which will have more effect on their companies' profitability than perhaps any other single factor in the next five years. Last week Prof Littlechild was talking tough ahead of discussions which will determine how he regulates the companies' monopoly distribution businesses, which typically provide 85 per cent of their profits. The City took fright. Electricity share prices fell by up to 5 per cent on Friday as investors digested leaks of confidential letters from Prof Littlechild to the companies in which he suggested distribution price rises in future years should be limited to up to 4 per cent below the rate of inflation. The companies will have to take a much bigger hit in the first year of the new regulatory regime beginning next April. Prof Littlechild does not mention a specific figure in his letters, but analysts estimate that the stances he is taking on a variety of issues, including the cost of capital, could lead to distribution price cuts of 20 per cent. That could lead to a cut of 5 per cent to 7 per cent in pre-tax electricity prices paid by consumers, of which distribution costs form about a quarter, compensating in part for rises in the rate of value added tax. With several rounds of negotiations still to go, Prof Littlechild's letter is viewed as his opening shot, leaving plenty of room for compromise. But there are strong pressures on him to stand firm. Although he is likely later this year to be reappointed as regulator, his first five-year term of office has attracted mixed reviews. In recent months they have been mostly unfavourable. His decision in February to cap prices for two years in the electricity pool, the industry's wholesale trading market, is viewed increasingly in the industry, not least by the distribution companies, as a temporary fix which has weakened the image he seeks as a promoter of free markets. But most of the recent wrath has come from consumer organisations which say he has allowed distributors to make far too much money at the expense of electricity users. With this review Prof Littlechild has a chance to put that right. The companies say prices for all but the biggest consumers of electricity have fallen in real terms, a claim disputed by consumer groups who argue it depends on which date you choose for the start of privatisation. Even the power companies agree privately that a clampdown is both inevitable and justified. All have cut costs far more effectively than they persuaded the government was possible before privatisation. The result has been profit, dividend and share price rises few investors could have dreamed of when they bought into the companies in 1990. In curbing what consumer organisations describe as a bonanza, Prof Littlechild will devise a formula which will restrict directly the companies' prices rather than profits, although they too will almost certainly fall as a result. He believes that capping profits would encourage complacency. Capping prices forces companies to become more efficient since that becomes their route to increasing profitability. The existing regulatory regime allows companies to raise distribution charges annually by up to 2.5 percentage points above the rate of inflation. As well as revising this so that the companies will have to cut real prices by up to 4 per cent, Prof Littlechild has served notice that he intends to change the form of price control. The main task of the review, he says, is to assess what expenditure is needed in each company's distribution business, decide on an appropriate level of revenue and propose controls accordingly. The existing system relates allowed revenue to the number of electricity units sold. But Offer also intends to introduce allowances for the number of customers served, as well as a fixed element. This may be a better reflection of distribution costs, but it raises a series of questions about fair treatment. Some analysts believe that Prof Littlechild's suggestion in last week's letter to allow revenues of Pounds 30m for each regional company to cover the fixed element would penalise companies with relatively few customers such as Manweb and Swalec. Earlier indications were that he might allow Pounds 60m for the fixed amount. The fewer allowable revenues he allocates to the fixed element, the more he is likely to allow for the number of customers. So companies with fewer customers are likely to be penalised. In setting price caps, Prof Littlechild is also likely to attempt to penalise companies he believes have cut costs the least. But assessing efficiency is notoriously difficult, with each company tending to claim it is ahead of the rest. Perhaps the biggest arguments prior to July will surround Prof Littlechild's assumptions on appropriate rates of return on assets to help formulate price caps. The 6 per cent he suggested in last week's letters seems reasonable compared with similar industries such as gas and water. Throughout the discussions Prof Littlechild will be lobbied hard by consumer groups arguing that profits and dividends growth will remain high even if he takes the toughest approach possible. Most analysts believe that although profits will inevitably be affected by the review, particularly next year, the companies' dividend cover and their scope for further efficiency improvements are such that they can continue increasing dividend payments well above the market average in the next few years. The power companies will therefore have to think long and hard before going to the MMC. Nonetheless electricity company executives have shown time and again, not least in their pre-privatisation victories on price controls, that they are negotiators par excellence and can be relied upon to drive a hard bargain.

0,FT944-17667 ,"FT944-17667 _AN-EJGDBAA4FT 941007   FT  07 OCT 94 / India puts priority onpower supply boost: Without it, ministers see their hopes of economic growth as doomed      By STEFAN WAGSTYL   The electricity situation 'is rather grim and the prospects are also rather grim,' says Mr N K P Salve, India's power minister, talking about the country's power shortages. Right on cue, the lights and the air-conditioning in his ministry go off and do not come on again for the next half hour. Mr Salve puts a brave face on his discomfort in the sweltering heat, saying: 'If there is load-shedding it should be first in the ministry'. Better power management has so far this year spared Delhi the extended breakdowns it suffered in 1993 but sporadic cuts are just as frequent, even in the power minister's office. The only remedy is a sustained expansion of generating and transmission capacity, combined with more efficient use of the existing network. 'We must carry on with the struggle not only to increase capacity but improve transmission and distribution,' says Mr Salve, mopping the sweat from his brow. From the outset, Mr P V Narasimha Rao's government has put a high priority on improving power supplies. Ministers recognise that without electricity, hopes of promoting economic growth through liberalisation are doomed. Because of the squeeze on public spending, the government has welcomed private investment into the state-dominated industry. However, since power plants take years to plan and build, privately-funded plants are unlikely to make a significant contribution until the next century. Mr Salve says government planners in the early 1990s estimated that India would need to boost its generating capacity of 70,000MW by 48,000MW in 1992-97 to meet expected demand increases. Because of financial constraints, the target for the five years was cut to 30,500MW. Mr Salve says the total increase will now be less than 20,000MW, including 3,000MW of privately-owned extra capacity. Shortages in early 1997 will be about 14-15 per cent of normal requirements and 28-30 per cent of peak demand, about the same level as today, says Mr Salve. 'That's why I say the prospects are grim.' Mr Salve spends much of his time promoting private investment in the industry as the only way to secure the long-term future. His officials say binding contracts for the first four new private-sector schemes could be signed in the next few months. Potential investors, including foreign investors, say this is optimistic, given the hurdles they face. Partly the problems are due to bureaucratic barriers and partly to the fact that private-sector power projects are new in the developing world, so there are few precedents. Mr Salve says that despite liberalisation, investors still require 15-17 separate clearances. Also, responsibility for power is shared between Delhi and India's constituent states, some of which are slow to welcome private investors, he says. But, pointing out that 75 schemes have attracted interest from private investors, including foreign groups, Mr Salve adds: 'If companies are responding, it's because they find the Indian atmosphere congenial'. If increasing generating capacity is hard work, improving the efficiency of the transmission and distribution system is even more difficult, mainly because distribution is in the hands of the states. Mr Salve says state politicians have forced state electricity boards to operate 'imprudently', distributing free or low-cost power to farmers and other favoured consumers. 'This very pernicious system' has landed the electricity boards with mounting losses: Rs50bn (Pounds 1.03bn) in the year to March 1994, up from Rs34bn three years ago, before economic reforms began. But there is some progress. Late last year, state power ministers finally agreed to charge farmers a minimum of Rs0.50 a unit for electricity. This is still far below cost but establishes the principle that consumers pay. Mr Salve says 17 of the 26 state electricity boards have introduced the new charge. States which have yet to reform include Uttar Pradesh, the most populous, and Punjab, the largest agricultural producer. The position is so poor that the World Bank, the biggest foreign source of finance for Indian power, has this year withheld Dollars 750m (Pounds 500m) in planned loans because of the slowness in reforming electricity boards. Another of Mr Salve's headaches is that state electricity boards buy much of their power from the centrally-run National Thermal Power Corporation but consistently fail to pay their dues. The arrears, totalling Rs30bn, have become so alarming that Delhi took extreme action to recover some of the money - by taking it out of the grants paid by the government to state administrations. It was the third time Delhi has had to pre-empt funds since 1991. Mr Salve says: 'I hope it's the last time. We must accelerate the spread of economic reform into the states.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE STATE ELECTRICITY BOARDS, 1991-95 (Rs bn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1991-92    1992-93   1993-94   1994-95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross Subsidy on Sales               74         92       107       126 to agriculture                       59         74        83        96 to domestic consumers                13         16        21        27 inter-state                           2          2         2         3 Subventions received from    state governments                 20         19        21        21 Surplus generaged by    0sales to other sectors           22         26        37        44 Uncovered subsidies                   -         47        49        61 Memo Item Gross subsidy on sales (percentage of GDP)                 1.2        1.3      1.31       1.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: Subsidies are defined as the difference between tariffs that would enable the SEBs to cover their variable costs and tariffs actually charged.

A partnership between Tractebel, the Belgian power conglomerate, and Associated Energy Supply (AES), the US power company, is likely to buy two more stations. The fourth will probably go to a management buyout team. The sale of the stations will be an important step in the privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), the electricity generator and supplier. A draft order providing the legislative basis for NEI's privatisation was passed in the Commons last night. NIE's four power stations will be sold as individual units. The company's electricity supply business will remain intact and will be sold to the public in November. British Gas is expected to buy Ballylumford, Northern Ireland's largest power station. AES, which has invested in a new power station in Kent, and Tractebel are expected to buy Kilroot, the newest station, and the old Belfast West station. The fourth, Coolkeeragh, will probably be bought by management. There will initially be no electricity pool - wholesale market - in Northern Ireland and the purchasers of the four stations will receive 15-year contracts to supply NIE. They will, however, still compete with each other through a bidding system. Another power station is likely to be built after NIE next month invites bidders to extend the life of existing stations or provide an alternative. A Labour government would not seek to return a privatised Northern Ireland Electricity to public ownership, Mr James Marshall, a frontbench spokesman, told the Commons last night.

Mr Helm, a consultant to the energy industry, has added his voice to growing calls for the reform of regulation. 'We've given regulators enormous discretion over the utilities without the appropriate accountability,' he said. He called for the merger of the gas and electricity industry regulators Ofgas and Offer, as the two industries were now so interdependent. Mr Helm, speaking at the launch of the group's utility index, which tracks the performance of UK utilities, said there should be considerable restraints placed on the powers of the regulators. 'Regulatory behaviour and uncertainty over regulation is increasingly a cost to the utilities. Investors need protection from regulators using their discriminatory powers,' he said. Mr Helm stressed that the problem for regulators was that prices to customers which were set at privatisation - for supplying gas, electricity and water and providing telecommunications services - were often too low to encourage competing companies into the market. 'Regulators face the inconsistency of the need for high prices on the one hand to encourage competition, but the pressure to keep prices low on the other hand to protect consumers.' The utility index provides a record of the financial performance of the utilities, weighting them by the size of their core utility business and excluding their diversified interests. The consultants believe it will be a useful tool for regulators and investors. Mr John Dorken, deputy director of Ofgas, said he did not feel the need for greater co-ordination with Offer. 'They are separate industries with some interactions, but those are not so great as to imply the need for a single regulator.' Professor Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of Offer, agrees with Ofgas that regulation should be separate for both industries.

0,FT922-8315 ,"FT922-8315 _AN-CENCNAAMFT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (1): From public to private - Many countries are privatising or restructuring their electricity industries. But none has yet rivalled the radical nature of the reforms in Britain, and EC efforts to encourage more cross-frontier competition have so far made little headway      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   ELECTRICITY industries round the world are being restructured. But they are not, contrary to the predictions of Mr John Wakeham, Britain's former energy secretary, following the UK privatisation pattern. Nor is Europe moving towards the kind of free electricity market set up in Britain. UK privatisation itself has been a mixed success. Some analysts, such as Mr Andrew Johns of National Utilities Services, (NUS) are enthusiastic. 'It has enabled consumers to negotiate individual deals,' he says. 'There is no doubt that it has changed the face of electricity purchasing completely.' Most observers agree that privatisation has made the electricity industry leaner and meaner, and although it is too early to say whether it has brought prices down, most consumers appear to be better off. 'It has removed forever the CEGB mentality where you had engineers running the industry for engineers, and the government handing them a blank cheque,' says a financial consultant to the industry. 'The consumer now has a certain transparency when the CEGB was one of the most opaque organisations,' says Mr Gordon MacKerron of Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU). 'They now have a clear idea what nuclear costs, and have an incentive to develop new technologies such as renewable energy, which has moved ahead fast. Cross subsidies are more difficult - you can't have blatant political fixes for big consumers. 'It is also good to have gas-fired plant - although the craze for gas has gone too far. The CEGB's strategic planning function was pretty Stalinist - we would have just had more gigantic coal and nuclear plants.' But the market has detractors - and not only the large customers who have lost their government subsidies under the new regime. MPs on the Commons energy committee, and the electricity industry watchdog, Offer, are both concerned about whether enough competition is emerging in electricity generation. Meanwhile, other European countries are showing few signs of following Britain down the privatisation road. The EC itself has made efforts to introduce more competition, and to make the basis of electricity pricing more open, or transparent. But draft directives aimed at liberalising the electricity market have so far made little progress. In particular, several European countries including France and the Netherlands, are resisting efforts to introduce 'third party access' or TPA, which would open up national monopolies, allowing European suppliers to supply European customers across borders. This is mainly because of the many large public sector European utilities, which resist any encroachment on their protected franchises. There are also logistical problems with introducing cross border trading of electricity, such as establishing who pays for capital investment in the grid systems. If a German company's purchase of power from a UK generator means lines need to be reinforced to carry the extra electricity - who pays for the work? There would also have to be some equivalent of the UK 'pool' which acts as a central clearing and settlement agency for all deals. A Spanish supplier who is paid on contract by an Italian purchaser but fails to generate needs to settle up with the Italian national supplier who actually supplies. The chances of European countries adopting the UK 'pool' or wholesale market in electricity are small, most observers say, not least because the pool itself seems increasingly peripheral (some say unnecessary) to the UK market. But they will probably begin to unbundle their accounts, splitting generation from distribution and supply, to give more transparent pricing. Even if TPA does not develop across borders for some time, there will be more competition in supply within domestic markets. There has also been more of a trend towards restructuring than to privatisation. One group of European countries is still resisting any real change. France, Italy and Germany have not restructured their industries, and are broadly opposed to EC attempts to open their electricity markets. Belgium, which previously had three private companies, now has a private monopoly, Electrabel, over which the state has more control. It too, is opposed to radical market reform. Spain is more ambivalent. The country's utilities have been restructured: the biggest private electricity companies, Iberduero and Hidrol, merged to form Iberdrola, while Endesa, the state-owned company, has taken over two other utilities. Some shares have been issued in Endesa. However, Spain's enthusiasm for privatisation or for TPA is muted. Three countries making more significant moves towards a competitive market in electricity are Norway, Sweden, and Portugal. Portugal has invited private sector bids to build new power stations, notably a new oil-fired station north of Lisbon. The UK's PowerGen and National Power are among the international companies bidding for the business. The Portuguese electricity utility, Electricidade de Portugal, is also being restructured, and 'corporatised,' and will later be split into six separate companies. Some private capital may be injected into these companies later. In Sweden, meanwhile, the government has committed itself to introducing a free electricity market with full TPA by 1994. It has created a new Swedish National Grid, which may be partly sold off, but there are no firm plans for privatising Vattenfall, the dominant state-owned utility. The Norwegian system is perhaps the closest to the UK market, although no privatisation has taken place. Early this year, Norway began a radical restructuring of the electricity industry, which comprises the publicly-owned utility, Statkraft, as well as a number of privately and publicly owned electricity companies. Companies will be able to compete to supply customers, and will have open access to the electricity grid. Statkraft was recently split into two parts, a generating company, and a grid management company, giving the generating side more commercial freedom. Norway already has a spot market for surplus electricity, and it is thought that electricity contracts may be traded in the near future. Privatisation, for most European countries, is a political issue. If they are against it, it is often because their large public utilities are part of the framework of government. But in Asia, where electricity industries are also being restructured, privatisation is primarily an economic issue. In South East Asia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia plan to inject private sector capital into their cash-starved utilities. 'In the developing countries, privatisation is viewed primarily as a mechanism for raising funds,' says Mr Andrew Barnett, who heads Sussex University's Developing Country Group. 'There is a massive requirement for electricity, and a shortage of funding.' Some South East Asian countries, he says, have even had to resort to export credit finance, which is unsuitable for infrastructure projects. Privatisation will not necessarily mean utilities become more efficient, Mr Barnett says. 'Competition in generation is a good thing, but in developing countries it can mean a huge proliferation of small scale diesel generators which are efficient only in the narrowest sense.' Developing countries, he says, may experience considerable conflict between government policy on electricity, (for instance its fuel policy), the utility's plans, and the financier's requirements. That is also true where World Bank financing is concerned, he believes. The Bank has tended to encourage privatisation, but may come into conflict with what the state wants. Nevertheless, several Asian countries now plan partial privatisation of their electricity industries. Malaysia recently sold off 22.8 per cent of the capital of Tenaga Nasional, the state-owned electricity monopoly, which was 'corporatised' in 1990. The company is likely to be restructured further in the near future. In Thailand, meanwhile, EGAT, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, is still state-owned. However, the government will sell shares in three power stations which were recently set up as separate subsidiaries. Thailand is also one of many Asian countries including India, Pakistan, Malaysia and even China inviting private sectors to tender to build and operate new power stations. This has become a widespread practice in Asia. 'The impetus for privatisation may have come from the UK,' says Dr Tony Wheeler, manager at Ewbank Preece, an engineering consultancy which advises governments on restructuring electricity industries. 'The World Bank has jumped on the bandwagon too. These countries really need to raise capital - for instance Pakistan can only borrow enough to build one power station - and they need 10.' The country has long planned foreign investment in the power station it plans on the coast near Karachi, but has made little progress in agreeing a deal that suits all parties. Although the South East Asian electricity systems are typically modern and so in fairly good condition, Mr Wheeler believes bringing in private capital could help the countries become more efficient. 'Pakistan has 165,000 staff to sell 10,000MW - that does not look good for the efficiency of the organisation.' In South America, too, privatisation is underway. Argentina's aggressive privatisation programme led to the sale of Central Nuevo, a generating company created from the state-owned electricity monopoly Segba. The company is now owned by two privatised Chilean power companies, Chilgener, and Chilectra, which outbid European and US companies to win a 60 per cent stake in the company. Argentina plans to sell the whole of the electricity industry. Chile itself has already privatised its electricity industry: Endesa, Chile's largest electricity business, is one of the country's most profitable private sector companies. Although Mexico expects to keep the electricity utility in the public sector, it has invited private sector companies to bid to build electricity plant. A few other developed countries, notably Australia and New Zealand, are making some moves towards electricity privatisation. But this is unlikely to be in the near future, or to follow the UK model.

0,FT924-6079 ,"FT924-6079 _AN-CKXBJABOFT 921124   FT  24 NOV 92 / Gas power plans scaled back      By MICHAEL SMITH   PLANS FOR the construction of eight gas-fired power stations in England and Wales have been abandoned or delayed in moves that will ease fears that the electricity market will be heavily oversupplied in the mid 1990s. The National Grid, which manages the electricity system, said yesterday that of 28 stations for which it had agreed connection plans earlier in the year, four had been cancelled and another four deferred. Disclosures of the delays and cancellations come amid the government's review of energy policy, prompted by British Coal's pit closure plan. Displacement of coal-fired power stations by gas-fired facilities has been one of the main factors in the decline of British Coal's market. But capacity figures from National Grid do not hold much comfort for British Coal. They still suggest an oversupplied market which, with present energy policy trends, will not need large amounts more coal than British Coal already expects to sell. National Grid's figures, published with its interim results, confirm an increase in the share of the electricity market held by the nuclear industry. Nuclear Electric's share in the first half of this year was 21.4 per cent, compared with 18.5 per cent in 1991-92. Separately, the environmental group Greenpeace urged the government to close Magnox nuclear power stations after publishing an analysis which, it said, showed that a levy on electricity consumers was being used to support the facilities' losses. Nuclear Electric, due to give evidence in the House of Commons on the issue today, responded that electricity generated by the Magnoxes was the cheapest in the system in 'avoidable' terms. Their early closure would not save any of the inescapable liabilities. The cancellation and delay of the eight Combined-Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power stations, with a capacity of 6,000MW, will have been influenced by the possibility that permission for gas-fired projects will become less likely after the energy review. National Grid said that the new gas-fired projects already completed or under construction suggested that plant margin - that is, the surplus of capacity over peak demand - would be 32 per cent by 1996-97. That compares with 22 per cent that could be expected in a typical system. It is, however, far below the 60 per cent figure suggested earlier this year, when National Grid included all stations of which it had been notified but which do not necessarily have planning consent or contracts for gas supplies. In all, National Grid knows of 22,876MW of capacity that could be produced by CCGT projects, but only 10,000 MW of that is totally committed. The Greenpeace report, based on its interpretation of Nuclear Electric's accounts, says that only 14 per cent of the Pounds 1.2bn levy notionally funds the cost of future decommissioning. Even then, it says, there is no decommissioning fund, so no money has been set aside to deal with liabilities. Monktonhall colliery, near Edinburgh, is to supply 3,000 tonnes of coal a month to ScottishPower for four months for the nearby Cockenzie power station. The pit is leased by more than 120 former British Coal miners. National Grid results, Page 24  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

The latest North Sea Report from County NatWest WoodMac's oil services consultancy, which includes a detailed analysis of the 'dash for gas', emphasises that the government has limited room for manoeuvre in its forthcoming energy review. It warns that the review has come 'three years too late'. Several new gas developments rely on power-generating contracts and might have to be cancelled if the contracts are not fulfilled, the report says. That has important implications for gas producers, for thousands of jobs in the offshore construction and services industry, and for producers' confidence in the North Sea as an investment area. The consultancy says that 16 gas-fired stations have secured contracts for gas supplies and obtained government consent. With a total generating capacity of 9,800 megawatts, they are likely to play a significant part in basic electricity generation in the UK by 1995. A further three power stations, with a total capacity of 4,200MW, have secured gas supplies but not government consent. They may not now be given consent after the opposition to the government's plans to close coal mines. One of them is the plant at Connah's Quay, Clwyd, owned by PowerGen, the privatised electricity generator. It is due to receive gas from the Hamilton and Hamilton North fields in the Irish Sea. The cancellation of the Pounds 400m-Pounds 500m plant would also throw into question the Pounds 500m development of the Hamilton fields. North Sea fields whose economics depend largely on gas-fired generating projects are Caister, Everest/ Lomond, Lancelot/Guinevere/ Excalibur, Orwell and Pickerill. The government may force generators to use more coal. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is also carrying out an investigation into gas generation contracts to ensure that regional electricity companies are buying the cheapest power. If those moves affect the amount of gas that can be taken by gas-fired power stations, the report warns, that might either make the fields uneconomic to develop or force producers to put gas prices up to a level that would make gas-fired power uncompetitive.

The offer of power at 2.3p per unit plus an adjustment for inflation, 5 per cent below the previous price of 2.425p, follows a warning this week by Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, that it would monitor Nuclear Electric after customers accused the company of withholding power to force up the price. Nuclear Electric cut its prices by just over 1 per cent and then a further 3 per cent earlier this month when Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, was understood to have been concerned about its influence on the market. Although National Power and PowerGen, the privatised electricity generators, are bigger than Nuclear Electric, contracts put into place at privatisation mean they have to sell most of their power to domestic consumers until March 31 next year. This has left Nuclear Electric dominating the industrial market and setting a benchmark power price. But Nuclear Electric said its latest price-cuts decision was purely commercial. 'We have always challenged the view that we were squeezing the market,' said Mr Gerald Cavalier, the company's marketing and sales manager. 'We are committed to act commercially, despite having one big shareholder.' He said the latest price would not satisfy the large industrial customers which received government subsidies before privatisation, and want prices of 1.9p to 2.2p. Nuclear Electric is unlikely to sell much power at the latest price - the cut comes too late for many consumers whose contracts came up for renewal last week.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

Reporting the state-owned nuclear generator's latest six-monthly results, he said Nuclear Electric 'has been able to point to clear evidence that we are making nuclear power in this country a commercial success.' Yesterday's results come as Nuclear Electric is fighting suggestions that it should be cut back to make more room in the energy market for coal. The crisis over pit closures and the government's review of energy policy have raised questions about the level of financial support that Nuclear Electric receives. But Mr Collier emphasised yesterday that nuclear power can compete in the free market, and has environmental benefits when compared with fossil fuels. In the six months to September, Nuclear Electric made an operating profit of Pounds 255m, an increase of 21 per cent. That included income of Pounds 632m from the controversial levy on electricity bills to help Nuclear Electric finance the heavy decommissioning costs of its nuclear plant. Dr Bob Hawley, the chief executive, stressed that the levy was not a subsidy, but cover for liabilities NE had inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board. He said the company was well on its way towards its target of making a profit before levy income by 1995. In the six months, NE increased electricity output by 7 per cent, and its revenue from electricity generation by 20 per cent to Pounds 618m. Improved productivity had also reduced unit costs. Further cost reductions would be implemented to cut staff from 12,500 to 9,000 by 1995.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "
0,FT944-6740 ,"FT944-6740 _AN-EK1C5AE9FT 941128   FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (9): Where there is a will .. - Jane Martinson sees ingenuity at work in the UK, US and France      By JANE MARTINSON   When a full-time energy manager was appointed at Leeds General Infirmary in northern England last year he found a number of targets for his efficiency drive. A year earlier the hospital, which spends an average of Pounds 1.65m a year on energy, received a 'poor' rating when judged by environment department guidelines on energy efficiency. Marcus Tunaley, recently-appointed energy officer at the infirmary, says: 'An environment audit on total energy consumption in one wing was one of the worst I've ever seen.' Faced with a National Health Service commitment to cut energy consumption by 15 per cent over the next five years, the hospital is one of a number managed by NHS trusts to have committed 10 per cent of its annual energy bill to efficiency measures. Some Pounds 165,000 will be spent in Leeds over each of the next four years. The current efficiency measures range from aluminium-clad radiators to updating the outdated building management system. The old system, which controls heating and lighting, was unable to adapt to changing needs. 'The old system provided heat to the hospital 24 hours a day,' says Tunaley. 'We wanted it to work when it was needed.' Most measures have focused on the large Clarendon wing of the hospital built in the early 1970s before the oil crisis encouraged energy savings. 'It was quite obvious that this wing, lovely as it is, was built when fuel was cheap,' says Tunaley. A 'deep plan' building with many windowless rooms, some 40 per cent of its electricity is used for air conditioning. Frequency inverters and air quality sensors, which enable the conditioning system to respond to natural changes in temperature, will save 80 per cent of the electricity used for the air conditioning alone, says Tunaley. With the new system the conditioning system works hardest at busy times of the day, in the canteen at lunchtime for example. Other savings have resulted from fitting ionic fuel technology to old boilers (with an energy saving of 8 per cent) and the installation of high-frequency fluorescent tubes (with a possible electricity saving of 30 per cent). Environmental concerns are one reason for the hospital's efficiency measures but the main reason is to save money. 'Efficiency measures represent a good return on your investment,' he says. 'They are accepted as a good way to save money.' The saving also makes sense in the face of the expected increase in gas prices next year, says Tunaley. He believes that the end of cheap 'interruptible' gas to large consumers because of market liberalisation could result in the price of gas going up by 25 per cent. The hospital uses gas to generate electricity in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant. The deregulation of the energy market in the UK has encouraged some large users to use CHP plants to generate their own power and enhance the security of their energy supply. The plants can cut the loss of fuel in energy production by using the heat from electricity generation for further energy purposes. The chemicals manufacturing arm of Zeneca, the biosciences group, is to install two CHP plants to supply 23.5MW for its Huddersfield and Grangemouth sites in the UK. The new Pounds 10.6m plant at Huddersfield, to provide the steam and electricity used in the manufacturing process, aims to save an estimated Pounds 2.5m a year in energy costs. Environmental legislation has encouraged the new energy contract. Two of the plant's boilers, which will be phased out under the new scheme, are over 30 years old and do not include pollution-abatement measures. Bob Thompson, Zeneca spokesman, said: 'This equipment needs replacing because of our desire to improve our environmental performance and also because if we don't we will not meet environmental legislation which is coming into force in the next few years.' The new plant would enable the company to keep ahead of controls on carbon dioxide emissions for example. The plant currently burns some 90,000 tonnes of coal a year. In Europe and the US companies have been keen to encourage energy efficiency to comply with legislation - following government commitments at the Rio earth summit to bring carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000 - and to enhance their public image. Electricity companies in the US, for example, entered into a voluntary agreement, called the Climate Challenge, with the Department of Energy earlier this year. The initiative, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gases, was a direct response to a proposed tax on the number of British Thermal Units (the common measure of heating energy) last year. Pacific Gas  Electricity, the largest power utility in the US and a party to the agreement, has allocated Dollars 2bn to customer energy efficiency programmes in the 1990s. With this investment the company hopes energy bills will be cut by more than Dollars 2bn net by 2000. Last year more than Dollars 186m was spent on some 50 programmes, resulting in a saving of 491m kwh of electricity. More than 600,000 customers participated in energy efficiency initiatives last year. For one scheme last year the company paid Dollars 30,000 to replace 150-watt incandescent traffic signals with energy-saving 25-watt light emitting diodes (LEDs) in the city of Davis. In spite of these efforts, however, the company failed to meet its 1993 targets on energy efficiency, partly, it claims because of reorganisation and the loss of 3,000 jobs. In France, the state gas company Gaz de France has a team dedicated to encouraging energy efficiency particularly through the installation of combined heat and power plants. Jean-Pierre Roncato, head of the cogeneration development mission, says that by using CHP plants 85 per cent of the gas used in generation can be recovered and used for both electricity and heating. This year the company has started 30 CHP projects compared with just four in 1991. At the same time it is installing boilers with high-energy conversion capabilities. 'Being fuel efficient is a strategic idea for us,' says Roncato. 'It's important as far as our image is concerned to supply an efficient product which uses natural gas.' Up to 75 per cent of France's energy needs is supplied by nuclear electricity. Gaz de France supplies only a fraction of the country's total energy but is hoping that by stressing fuel efficiency - and by offering price warranties to allay fears of a gas price rise - it can increase its share of the market.

The state-owned nuclear generator for England and Wales attributed some of the cuts to a recent decision by the industry regulator to cap prices in the wholesale electricity pool, which it said could depress 1995-96 profits by up to Pounds 200m. It said it had to compete against private-sector generators. These have cut staff by more than half since privatisation four years ago. The planned cuts will lead to a provision in the company's 1993-94 accounts. The company could not say what the provisions would be, but more than Pounds 150m seems likely. This will partly offset the effect of a sharply improved operating performance, where losses have been reduced to Pounds 224m from Pounds 564m in 1992-93 - excluding the effects of the nuclear levy. The job losses are the latest in a series in the nuclear industry. Last month British Nuclear Fuels said it intended to cut 2,000 of the 7,000 jobs at its Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria in the next five years. Nuclear Electric has already cut nearly 5,000 from its 14,200 total of four years ago. Yesterday's announcement came three days after the company called for ministers to privatise it as it published a submission to the government's nuclear review. Union leaders said yesterday that in cutting so many jobs the company was trying to show that it could be as tough as the electricity companies, which were privatised four years ago. Mr Mike Jeram, head of electricity at the Unison public services and utilities union, said: 'Workers seem to be the victims of a vicious circle of job cuts in which power companies vie with each other to see who can shed the most amount of labour.' Mr Danny Carrigan, national officer of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said he was astounded at the scale of the cut. In a letter to staff yesterday Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear electric chief executive, said the company had to continue to reduce costs following the pool price cap. He said: 'We need to refocus our efforts and look carefully at all costs in order to make good some of this loss and to achieve our goal of being the lowest-cost generator.' The company said it had to compete against private-sector generators. Nuclear Electric could only secure its long-term future by achieving the same kind of cost reductions and efficiency improvements as them. Nuclear Electric faces a delay of several weeks in the start-up of the Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk, David Green writes. The company said it would lose more than Pounds 500,000 a day in revenue from electricity sales because of the delay, which has been caused by a further round of public consultation over radioactive discharges from the power station. The station is nearing completion within its budget of Pounds 2.03bn. The new consultation exercise was made necessary after a High Court ruling concerning the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria. The Inspectorate of Pollution said yesterday that the formal period for responses to the discharge application had ended but it would be weeks before they were assessed.

The deal is among the first local packages to be concluded among the 19 main employers in the privatised industry. The first was at PowerGen, the generator, where 6,500 employees agreed to harmonised terms and conditions, single-table bargaining and increasingly flexible working. The last national pay settlement in the electricity supply industry was negotiated this year, with a 5.5 per cent settlement for 1992-93. Employers then gave 12 months' notice of their intention to negotiate locally next year. The retail business, ES Retail, was created earlier this year with the merger of the retail and appliance servicing businesses of Southern Electric and Eastern Electricity. The new company, which began trading in April, has about 230 retail outlets across the south and east of England. Mr Paul O'Shea, southern district officer for Nalgo, the public services union, said acceptance of the package was a recognition of the bad trading conditions into which the recession had forced the sector. Of the 1,391 Nalgo members balloted, 78 per cent accepted the agreement, which took nearly a year to negotiate. Its terms include a freeze on staff pay, a reduction in holiday entitlement and a more flexible working week. Mr Derrick Burch, chairman of Nalgo's southern district electricity committee, said staff had been told that, in order to survive, the new company needed to restructure itself and its salaries in line with the competition.

It has oil, gas, coal and a large choice of well-watered Andean valleys with hydro-electric potential. Its 8,600MW of electricity generating capacity should more than meet local demand. In spite of all this, power cuts averaging six hours a day have plagued the country since April, knocking at least 1 per cent off economic growth this year and damaging badly the government of President Cesar Gaviria. Guerrilla attacks on power facilities, labour problems and a six-month drought from last December all contributed to the electricity shortage. The main cause howeverwas financial and administrative chaos in the electricity companies. A government-appointed commission concluded that 80 per cent of the rationing could have been avoided with proper planning, information and maintenance. Now, the sector faces radical restructuring. Colombia is over-dependent on hydro-electric power. Thermal plants contribute barely 22 per cent of the country's generating capacity, and at the critical moment only about half of this was operable. The government says that reservoirs were down to 54 per cent of capacity at the start of the drought and the six regional electricity companies had delayed bringing the thermal plants into service in an attempt to keep costs down. Things look unlikely to improve much soon. The reservoirs, now at an average 37 per cent of capacity, will start the dry season in December considerably emptier than last year. The rainfall problem has been exacerbated by deforestation and failure to manage the watersheds. Power rationing will probably continue at least until April 1993. Many of the sector's problems stem from the policies of the 1970s and early 1980s, when the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank were deeply involved. The two banks loaned Dollars 3.6bn to the electricity companies under government guarantee, equivalent to some 80 per cent of the capital invested in expanding power supplies. Generating capacity quadrupled, the number of subscribers tripled, and the sector's debt grew to more than Dollars 5bn. 'The banks - they share responsibility for all this,' said Mr Rudolf Hommes, the finance minister. Unusually, the World Bank agrees. The World Bank evaluation, concluded in 1991, of its role in the Colombian power sector found many faults. It found a lack of vision and flexibility, inconsistencies between sectoral policies and macro-economic policy, laxity on quality control and performance standards. Furthermore, lending terms changed abruptly in the late 1970s, so that capital repayments started before hydro-electric plants came into operation. Exchange risks were never discussed and rapid currency devaluation in the mid-1980s expanded the companies' debt burdens. The World Bank and the government argued throughout over tariffs; the rates still average out at 75 per cent of cost, with many residential users receiving 50 per cent subsidies. The biggest embarrassment has been the ill-starred El Guavio project, north-east of Bogota, five years overdue and absurdly over-budget at Dollars 2.5bn. The World Bank admits that when El Guavio was approved in 1981, the wisdom of such big, expensive schemes should have been questioned. The geological risks of tunnelling through the eastern Andean mountains were also known - and proven during 10 years of construction. If El Guavio had come on line as originally planned, rationing would not have been necessary. As it is, the attorney-general's office is investigating some 30 cases of negligence and irregularities in connection with the project. Landslides, financial bottlenecks, land purchase problems, contractual irregularities and bad management contributed to the delays. After tortuous negotiations, the IADB has approved a Dollars 150m loan for El Guavio and the national grid, a sum that will be matched by the government, which will issue bonds to raise the funds. The government is also taking over the debts of the bankrupt electricity companies and recapitalising them. The aim is to give the companies more independence; they could eventually bring in private investors. The government's plans also include a programme to boost gas production and distribution to homes. Residential consumption accounts for 50 per cent of demand in Colombia, since electricity is widely used for cooking and heating. Mr Hommes also plans to reduce subsidies and make them transparent, and to cut the high electricity losses. Twenty-one per cent of electricity is lost or stolen, because of billing problems and piracy which follow from inadequate distribution equipment and practices. The emergency programme this year included repairs to thermal plants, the construction of a link to Venezuela, speeding up El Guavio and bringing into operation floating power-stations. Urra 1, a 340MW hydro scheme, near the Caribbean coast, is also being built. However, the programme is not going smoothly. The contract for the floating power stations has been rescinded after the first barge, supposed to deliver 20MW, generated only a fraction of this after weeks of delay. Meanwhile, electrical engineers are warning that El Guavio will not start up until mid-1993, behind even its most recent schedule. For the longer-term, the National Social and Economic Council, the government's policy making body, has approved a new 2,500MW expansion plan, and legislation to restructure the electricity sector is going through congress. The expansion plan, with an estimated Dollars 2.7bn cost, raises the share of thermal power to 30 per cent, outlines many smaller, more flexible projects, and stresses distribution, neglected in the past. The multilateral banks are expected to resume lending to Colombia for some of these schemes. However, financing the expansion plan is proving difficult and there could be rationing again in 1995 and 2002 if the projects fall behind. On top of that, the measures only partly address the long-standing lack of a coherent energy framework with clear objectives.  The Financial Times   International Page 8  "

Environmental groups in Malaysia are angry at their  government's decision to go ahead with the Bakun hydroelectric  dam project in Sarawak, the country's easterly state.    Pergau is a tiddler in comparison, costing around 450  million  pounds and supplying about 600MW [MegaWatts] of electricity to  Malaysian consumers. But Friends of the Earth [FoE] Malaysia  says Bakun will cost 30.6 billion Malaysian ringgits (more than  7 billion pounds) and be able to supply about 16,000MW of power  within 10 years.    The dam will be on the Rajang river in north-west Sarawak,  where about 5,000 people of the Kenyah, Kayan, Lahanen, Ukit and  Penan tribes, living in communal houses, could be uprooted.    Nearly 275 square miles of forested land will be flooded as  a  result of the scheme, but FoE says the large reservoir to be  built could also trap sediment that would silt up the dam and  shorten its working life.    Mohamed Mahathir, the Malaysian premier, claims the dam is  vital for the country's energy needs. Launching the project, he  admitted it could destroy some trees and animals and displace  natives, ""but to get the desired achievement of well-being of  the people later on, some price has to be paid now.""    The Malaysian government says it has conducted studies that  show the economic gains of the project far outweigh the adverse  environmental impact. But Friends of the Earth says the  Government is relying on selling electricity to neighbouring  countries to make the dam pay.    It is concerned about the `viability and safety' of a  planned  submarine cable, yet to be built, that would transmit  electricity from Sarawak to mainland Asia, 400 miles away.    The cable would be the longest of its kind in the world, and  there is a `complete lack of experience' of laying such a cable  and of continuously transmitting large amounts of power, says  FoE.    Ironically, in June 1990, the government resolved to scrap  the Bakun project, but Dr Mahathir said its changed decision  proved `we care for the environment... Malaysia has made a big  sacrifice for the environment.'     "

By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER      NEW ORLEANS      A scientific satellite to be launched next year will carry electronic circuits  made from high-temperature superconductors for the first tests of the materials  in space, researchers said Monday at a meeting of the American Assn. for the  Advancement of Science.    Scientists hope that the superconductors, whose existence was first reported in  January, 1987, could reduce the weight of many electronic devices and, thus,  the cost of putting them in orbit, but it is first necessary to see how well  they survive in the hostile environment of Earth orbit.    In a daylong seminar here on the high-temperature superconductors, which carry  electricity without any loss because of resistance, scientists also said that  they are much more enthusiastic now about the commercial development of the  materials than they were a year ago, and that the first commercial uses could  appear within three to five years. The superconductors could also have a  previously unsuspected impact on the microwave electronics industry, they said.    Surprisingly, researchers agreed, Japan has not taken the lead in developing  the superconductors that had been expected. Japanese and American investment in  the new technology has been about the same, roughly $250 million a year, and  well ahead of other countries' spending. But in the United States, two-thirds  of the funds have come from the government, while in Japan two-thirds have come  from industry.    While most Japanese companies are working on only one particular type of  superconductor material because they think it is the most promising, they could  have a major advantage if it proves to be most effective.    But if another type of material proves better, said Edward J. Mead of E. I. du  Pont de Nemours & Co., ""they could all go marching off the edge of the  cliff together, like a bunch of lemmings.""    The new high-temperature superconductors were discovered at an IBM Corp.  research laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland, a feat for which the inventors won  the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics. Previous superconductors, which were either  metals or alloys, had lost all resistance to the flow of electricity only at  temperatures near absolute zero, roughly minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit.    But the new materials, ceramics containing copper oxides and certain other  metals, were superconducting at around minus 400 degrees and, within a year,  researchers led by physicist PauW. Chu of the University of Houston and others,  had raised the minimum temperature for superconductivity to minus 285 degrees  Fahrenheit.    The significance of this achievement was that it made possible cooling with  inexpensive liquid nitrogen rather than the much more expensive liquid helium  used with previous superconductors. Researchers predicted a vast array of new  applications for the materials, including magnetically levitated trains,  long-distance transmission of electricity and exceptionally fast  supercomputers.    But researchers encountered major difficulties. The superconductors could carry  only limited amounts of electricity and, because they are brittle ceramics,  cannot readily be fabricated into wires. By a year ago, the superconductivity  community had become very discouraged about the prospects for commercializing  the technology.    They are regaining their enthusiasm, however. ""We've entered a period of  consolidation and the progress has been really tremendous,"" Chu said Monday.  One of the most important developments, he said, was the ability to achieve  high current-carrying capacity in thin films of the ceramic superconductors.    These thin films can be used to produce electronic devices, such as the  superconducting quantum interference devices, or SQUIDS, recently perfected by  IBM. SQUIDS are very sensitive detectors of electromagnetic radiation, and Chu  predicted that the new SQUIDS could be marketed in as little as three years.    The new SQUIDS could have major applications in prospecting for petroleum and  metal ores, Chu said. Researchers inject an electrical charge into the ground  and look for telltale minute residual electrical currents. SQUIDS are now used  for such purposes, but the requirement for liquid-helium cooling makes them too  cumbersome for routine use.    No cooling at all might be needed for superconducting electronic devices used  in satellites as long as they were shielded from direct sunlight. Four  companies, including Du Pont, are producing superconducting electronic devices,  such as capacitors and filters, that will be carried on a Naval Research  Laboratory satellite to be launched sometime in 1991, he said.    Another potential new application for the materials is the production of  microwave communications and radar devices.    Although the commercial market for superconducting microwave components would  be only about $5 million by 1995, Mead said, that technology could be  particularly valuable to the military. Conventional microwave radars divert a  significant amount of energy into what are known as side lobes -- emissions at  a 90-degree angle to the main radar beam. ""It is these lobes that an enemy  locks on for detection and jamming,"" Mead said. The use of superconductors  reduces the side lobes substantially.    But all the panelists agreed that it will be well into the next decade before  high-temperature superconductors are used for large magnets, electricity  transmission and similar applications.    ""This is a marathon, not a sprint,"" Mead said.

Although little more than Pounds 200m has been committed so far by the electricity companies they have plans for projects in the US, Portugal and Germany. The electricity, water and gas companies are following the lead of BT, the telecommunications group which was privatised in 1984. Its international plans, which have met with mixed success, culminated in June with its Pounds 2.88bn purchase of a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the US long-distance carrier. However, the international push by the former nationalised corporations may raise doubts about their ability to manage overseas operations and prompt calls for tighter regulation of their international activities. Ofgas, the gas regulator, wants British Gas's international operations included in its remit. Ofwat the water industry regulator, commenting on the water companies' expansion abroad, said: 'We have been doing a lot of work to prevent cross-subsidisation - money from customers' bills being used to finance this expansion.' The electricity companies' move is being led by National Power which expects to invest up to Pounds 1bn overseas by the year 2000 in projects valued up to Pounds 15bn. It recently spent Dollars 160m on Tevco, which owns power plants in the south-east of the US. It expects between 10 and 20 per cent of its earnings could be generated abroad by the year 2000. The National Grid, which operates the transmission system in England and Wales, plans to invest up to Pounds 370m overseas in the next five years. It has already spent Pounds 23m as one of a consortium which has taken over the Argentinian transmission system. Midland Electricity has indicated to the City that it is prepared to commit up to Pounds 200m in overseas investments. International expansion is a large component in British Gas's plans, in the light of commercial and legal challenges to its dominance of the UK market. Since privatisation in 1986 British Gas has spent more than Pounds 1.1bn on foreign exploration and production assets.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-11548 ,"FT942-11548 _AN-EEED1ADEFT 940505   FT  05 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Energy efficiency targets not ambitious enough      From Dr EOIN LEES   Sir, Your article 'All eyes on efficiency' (April 27) questioned whether the regional electricity companies (RECs) can be serious about saving energy if profits are tied to volume sales. The Energy Saving Trust, in its response to the Offer consultation paper, Electricity distribution: price control, reliability and customer service, believes the director-general should adopt a more ambitious approach to promoting efficiency in the distribution business than is the case under the current price control mechanism. In recent years, inter-fuel competition has stimulated the electricity industry to develop many energy-efficient solutions, reflecting the fact that it is only through developing new efficient electro-technologies that the electricity companies can compete with other fuels which are generally cheaper. But, in practice, technological development has been mainly directed at high demand users in the commercial and industrial sectors. It is for these reasons that the Energy Saving Trust recommended to Offer that it should treat low-demand customers (less than 100kW) differently from those of high demand, by making a more significant reduction apply in the volume sales component of the supply price control formula. The trust proposes a three-factor price formula, based on the number of customers, fixed costs and volume. A significant reduction in the existing volume sales component, coupled with some degree of compensation to the RECs for the energy savings attained, would increase the incentive to the RECs to invest in demand-side management measures. In order to achieve widespread benefits to the broadest range of customer types, we believe the RECs should receive an allowance within the distribution price control for investment in demand-side measures. This amount (Pounds 40m in 1995-96, Pounds 90m in 1996-97, Pounds 125m in 1997-98 and beyond) would initially be raised from low-demand users of the distribution system, who would of course also receive the benefits of the subsequent investment. On a practical level, the trust is already working with the RECs on a number of energy efficiency schemes aimed at domestic consumers and small businesses. All will provide considerable benefits to the customer and the environment.

In 1993, Latvia imported 181.9 million lats in goods from  Russia, or 28.5 percent of the total import volume.    From Germany, Latvia imported 63.7 million lats in goods, or  10 percent of the total import. From Lithuania and Sweden,  Latvia bought 61.2 million lats and 33.8 million lats in goods,  or 9.6 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively. Latvia bought  26.5 million lats in goods from Belarus, which is 4.1 percent of  its total import.    The list of Latvia's imports was topped by energy and fuel  resources which made up 45.3 percent of the total import volume.  From the import, diesel fuel was 12.8 percent, gasoline was 8.7  percent, crude oil -- 7.8 percent, natural gas -- 8.1 percent  and electricity -- 3.7 percent.    Latvia also bought land transportation vehicles (8.9  percent)  and mechanical equipment (2.9 percent), basically, from Russia  and Germany.    The trade analysis evidences that re-exports constitute  large  part of the country's 1993 export.    Mineral fuel and oil products made up 13.9 percent of the  year's exports. From this, 8.4 percent was diesel fuel and jet  engine fuel -- 2.1 percent.    The majority of these goods, or 48.3 percent, were sent to  the Netherlands. Sweden received 17.4 percent of  Latvia-exported fuel and oil products.    The electricity and natural gas exports were respective 0.7  percent and 0.3 percent of the total export volume. All  electricity and gas that Latvia sent Russia was part of its  supplies to the Russian defense forces, according to the  statistical reports.    An important export position (8.8 percent) is occupied by  timber and timber products, ferrous metals (7.7 percent) and  buses (5.3 percent). Timber was mainly sent Great Britain,  which received 31.6 percent of Latvia's timber export, Sweden  (21.1 percent) and Finland (13.1 percent).

In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, he said: 'Britain is the only major country in Europe where the economy is recovering. But that is a cause only for subdued celebration since more than half our trade is with other EC countries.' Mr Clarke voiced concern that in the past year exporters had raised their prices by 10 per cent while inflation was less than 2 per cent and wage increases at a historic low. The rise could not reflect cost pressures at home. He said: 'It provides a vivid reminder that British management, no doubt under shareholder pressure, always tends to prefer return to volume when competing in overseas markets. 'If our recovery is to be strong and sustained, we need to export as well as consume. And if our recovery is to be a job-creating recovery, we must do everything in our power to maintain our competitive advantage and to expand our share of world trade.' Mr Clarke said he doubted whether the recovery would lead to a sharp upturn and a period of rapid growth. His view was that much of Europe was likely to see an expansion that was steady, but slow. 'The challenge will be to sustain it. The nineties will not be an easy decade in which to earn a living.' Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the conference that companies that wanted to generate their own electricity would no longer need a supply licence. He said the decision was evidence of the government's determination to deregulate. 'Like competitiveness, deregulation has no end date. There is always more to do,' he said. The electricity decision removes a requirement that companies generating electricity for their own use need a licence if they consume less than 51 per cent of the output themselves.

0,FT933-6043 ,"FT933-6043 _AN-DH4CVADVFT 930831   FT  31 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Pressure to switch from appliances - A look at allegations that power companies subsidise their retail arms      By MICHAEL SMITH   COMPANIES in any other industrial sector would have been tempted to call it a day. Year after year UK electricity companies and their pre-privatisation predecessors have struggled to make significant profits on their retailing operations, and some have recorded losses. Yet still most of them persevere. Now their competitors, including Dixons and Kingfisher, are trying to force a re-think. They say the retail results of the regional electricity companies and the Scottish power companies have been exaggerated and have demanded an investigation. At their prompting, Offer, the electricity industry regulator and the Office of Fair Trading are looking at whether power companies cross subsidise their retail operations from other businesses and obstruct fair trade. If the inquiries confirm this is the case, more electricity companies may follow the lead of London Electricity and South Wales Electricity which have ended or are ending their direct involvement in retailing. Whatever the profitability, power company retailing is big business. With more than 1,100 shops, electricity groups collectively own the second largest group of electrical goods outlets in the UK after Dixons, which also owns the Currys chain. Their market share is about 13 per cent. Such a presence is not common internationally. In neither France nor the US do power distributors feel the need to sell goods in high street shops. The retailing tradition in the UK stems in part from an industry culture which has promoted increases in electricity volume sales as the main aim of the power industry. 'The logic is that the more appliances are sold, the more electricity volumes will rise,' says one power company executive. Retailing has also grown alongside customer service facilities which customers use to make complaints and pay their bills. Almost every power company shop in the UK has a services counter, and they are highly valued by customers. That is one source of complaint from rival retailers. They believe that in many cases the customer services units do not contribute a fair share of the rent of the showroom they occupy. More serious, they say, are the cross subsidies from the recs' main businesses to their retailing arms. 'The problem is that many shops are not being charged fully for the services they use,' says one rival company executive. 'Rents are more realistic than they were in the late 1980s when we estimate the regional boards (electricity companies predecessors before privatisation) were charged a third of the market rate. 'But most recs are still not charging their retail operations fully, if at all, for the capital used in special promotions. That is why their shops can offer so much interest free credit.' Not so, say the regional companies. Seeboard is typical in its response. 'We negotiate with electrical manufacturers for supporting promotions just like any other retailer,' says Mr John Weight, retailing head. 'One hundred per cent of costs associated with Seeboard's business are charged to the business.' If the recs are robust in their defence of the way they apportion costs for their shops, few are able to declare retail profits with pride. Norweb, serving the north west of England, is generally considered the most impressive retailer, and last year made operating profits of Pounds 6m from the business, on turnover of Pounds 139m, against operating profits in the company as a whole of Pounds 155m. It is planning significant expansion from its 88 stores. Other companies are less bullish. Most declared operating profits for last year on retailing, in contrast to the previous year when most recorded losses. But the amounts were small - typical examples were East Midlands' Pounds 200,000 and Manweb's Pounds 500,000 - and some lost money, including Sweb which declared losses of Pounds 1.9m. In addition, several companies made significant provisions for restructuring which wiped out any profits. So why persist? One answer is that the companies have taken action aimed at significantly improving retailing performance. Since the break-up of national collective bargaining last year, most power companies have negotiated deals with retailing staff which either freeze or reduce wages. Several companies have also merged their retailing business with other recs and are seeking to improve service and transform the dowdy image of the rec stores by hiring specialist retailers. The new alliances include East Midlands and Yorkshire in one unit and Eastern, Southern and Midlands in another. Another factor in keeping stores open is the fear of customer reaction to closure plans. 'If we were starting again we would not go into retailing but there is more work in closing one shop than there is in re-organising our entire company,' one power company chief executive says. He adds: 'Closures get the chambers of commerce and local business up in arms. We closed one branch four years ago and we are still getting petitions. 'There is also the complication that you still have to provide some kind of a high street presence for people who want to pay bills. We do not have the direct debit culture of the US.' For these reasons, most recs believe that the decisions of Offer and the OFT will make only marginal difference to the number of high street stores. They also point out that if cross subsidisation was found and the regulatory authorities order change, the effect on the overall businesses of each company would be minimal since it would simply transfer profitability from one business arm to another. Competitors are unconvinced. According to one: 'If the power company businesses become as transparent as they should be, shareholders will be able to see what is happening and the pressure to get out of retailing will intensify.'

The Watertown, Massachusetts company has produced prototype multi-stranded conductors that can withstand the rigours of bending and strain that would be faced in commercial use. Previous prototype cables degraded when the cables were bent or coiled. Special characteristics of the wires making up the cable provide resistance to strain. Each wire is a composite of up to 10,000 internal filaments - microscopic superconducting elements- which run through the wire.

It will provide stark proof, if any were needed, of the scale by which the government has botched the privatisation of UK gas and electricity. Far from opening the industry up to the forces of competition, we have seen uneven bargaining in the marketplace. At the same time a conflict has developed between short- and long-term factors, commercial interests and strategic priorities for the nation. Having served on the committees for the gas and electricity bills as well as on the trade and industry committee I have seen the government plough on with measures which distorted the market and led inevitably to the present mess. The nation was understandably outraged and confused at the sudden announcement on October 19 that 31 pits were to close and 31,000 miners and tens of thousands of other workers faced immediate dole. Three questions arose. How had this come about? Was there a cheaper way of spending taxpayers money than financing redundancy and unemployment? Why were we abandoning, perhaps irretrievably, such a large amount of our indigenous coal reserves? To see how this arose it is necessary to look back into the government's privatisation programme. British Gas fought successfully to be privatised as a monopoly, despite strenuous argument that it should be broken up for a genuine market to develop. The company was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as soon as it was privatised because of its dominance in the industrial market. Ever since, Sir James McKinnon, the director of Ofgas, the industry regulator, has been battling to open up a genuine market for gas. The opportunity to achieve this has been offered by the advent in the electricity industry of combined-cycle gas turbine generation. Eighteen months after gas privatisation, Cecil Parkinson, then secretary for energy, told parliament he would not repeat the mistakes of gas privatisation and would break up the industry. Yet his approach at the outset was timid, and once it emerged that high costs and uncertainties over reprocessing and decommissioning made nuclear power unsaleable, he was left with a generating duopoly - National Power and PowerGen. The regional electricity distributors, faced with two generators which owned all the coal-fired power stations, were desperate to move into generation to give them something with which to bargain. The dash for gas was on. The coal industry was squeezed out of the market, and the generators refused to be locked into major long-term coal contracts. British Coal, faced with its own privatisation pressures, had no choice but to shut down pits. The main market for coal is electricity supply. It does not have the flexibility of oil and gas. Faced with new gas technology, a subsidised and capacity-protected nuclear industry, subsidised French electricity, rising imports of cheaper coal and environmental constraints, sharp decline was inevitable. Yet the industry is responding with new technology and changing working practices. Its own forecasts and the assessment of independent experts all say they can achieve world market prices within three to five years. However, if the abrupt market change is allowed to work through, Britain will not have the pits to meet the potential capacity, much of which will be taken up by imports. With opening or re-opening a pit costing about Pounds 400m, reserves abandoned now will be lost forever. Had the government liberalised the gas and electricity markets before privatisation, much of the present debacle could have been avoided. A generation ago there was a dash for oil that has left a succession of white elephants - under-utilised oil-fired power stations. The gas stations are unlikely to suffer that fate. But we desperately need a regime that promotes genuine competition against a background that will secure a strategic balance of a sensible and flexible fuel mix, the best use of our indigenous reserves of all fuels and minimal long-term dependence on imports. The committee has had to address a serious short-term crisis produced by ill-thought-out measures. British coal faces a strong challenge, but I believe we have created a breathing space to address all these issues without destroying confidence in any sector.

0,FT941-10176 ,"FT941-10176 _AN-EBJCNAFZFT 940210   FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bayernwerk taps energy opportunities in the east - The west German power group plans a DM5bn investment in Thuringia      By JUDY DEMPSEY   The Treuhand privatisation agency has sold the remainder of eastern Germany's regional utilities to Bayernwerk, west Germany's third-largest electricity company. Bayernwerk, which has acquired majority stakes in three utilities in the eastern state of Thuringia, will invest more than DM5bn (Dollars 2.9bn) over the next five years and guarantee several thousand jobs. The sale follows separate acquisitions by RWE Energie, the country's largest utility company, and PreussenElektra, the electricity division of Veba, the energy-based conglomerate which together will invest more than DM5.5bn and secure another 8,000-plus jobs. The significance of these acquisitions is that they finally open up east Germany to large investments in the electricity sector. These are expected to exceed DM40bn by the end of the decade. More importantly, the sale ends a bitter three-year-old property rights dispute in which eastern Germany's 164 municipalities had unsuccessfully tried to claim the assets of the region's 15 utility companies with the aim of opening up the sector to genuine competition. At issue in the dispute was the Stromvertrag, or Electricity Contract negotiated by the then east and west German governments in August 1990. It stipulated that only 49 per cent of eastern Germany's 15 regional utilities could be owned by the municipalities with the remaining 51 per cent divided among RWE, Preussen-Elektra, Bayernwerk, and west Germany's five smaller utilities which would modernise the utilities. However, as a means of underwriting these investments, the Stromvertrag stipulated that the regional municipalities must buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag over the next 20 years. Veag is a monopoly structure: the Stromvertrag gave RWE, PreussenElektra, and Bayernwerk a 75 per cent stake in Veag, with the remaining 25 per cent divided among the five smaller west German utilities. Veag, which controls the region's high-voltage grid, is being privatised by the Treuhand to these companies. In spite of the large investment commitments, 'the principle weakness of the Stromvertrag is the way it stifles competition in eastern Germany's energy sector', an energy expert and adviser to the Treuhand said. Veba defends the Stromvertrag on the grounds that the two German governments negotiated the deal as a means of securing a future for brown coal, or lignite which fuels eastern Germany's utilities. However, the municipalities have argued that west German utilities have established a monopoly in the east's energy sector, stifling competition as a result. Eastern Germany's municipalities, which retain the right to generate or buy from elsewhere 30 per cent of their energy needs, have tried to fight back. Several cities, including Potsdam, have opted for gas to circumvent the monopoly structure and enter the lucrative energy sector. At the same time, outsiders can take a stake in the remaining 49 per cent stake of the regional utilities. But even they are locked into the Stromvertrag: the utilities must buy 70 of their energy from Veag. Yet common to all the players in eastern Germany's energy sector is the need for customers. Before German unification, natural gas accounted for less than 10 per cent of primary consumption in eastern Germany, while electricity, fuelled by brown coal, accounted for more than 87 per cent. Energy consumption has fallen 60 per cent since 1990, with brown coal/electricity bearing the brunt, following the collapse of the region's manufacturing base. The concerns facing western German utilities centre on whether there will be a sufficient growth in electricity sales in eastern Germany to justify their large investment programme, and whether gas is set to become a leading player which would undermine the careful architecture of the Stromvertrag. Veba is confident that PreussenElektra will reap the benefits of its recent acquisition. 'I don't see any danger for our investment. The Stromvertrag guarantees us energy sales,' the company said. It added that politicians would put pressure on east German cities to buy electricity instead of gas to protect miners' jobs. Veba's confidence has been further lifted by the prospect that even if energy consumption shows few signs of a pick-up in eastern Germany, PreussenElektra and the other west German utilities can resort to Union pour la Coordination de la Production du Transport d'Electricite, or UPCD. This means that energy generated in eastern Germany, unlike pre-unification days, can be sold to other European Union countries as part of the UPCD arrangement. The Veag management is connecting high voltage grid lines to the eastern and western German networks to secure sales across Germany and to EU countries. 'You can see why our investments and acquisitions in eastern Germany are an opportunity of a life-time,' added Veba.

London's increase reflects the adoption of a policy which makes it the first regional power company to state an aim to pay a third of the total dividend at the halfway stage. Other electricity distributors tend to aim for 30 per cent. Analysts increased their dividend forecasts for the full year marginally to about 22.2p. The shares rose initially but closed the day unchanged at 644p. In the six months to September 30, London made pre-tax profits of Pounds 69.9m (Dollars 104.5m), against Pounds 52m, restated to take in the effects of the new coal contracts.

His announcement came in a report stating that customers are not adequately protected by the present system. The report about constrained-on plant - extra generating plant required only infrequently to boost supplies with electricity charged at premium rates - identifies possible cost-cutting measures. They include greater investment in the network to reduce shortages in supplies, the introduction of voluntary demand-reduction schemes by industry, and a possible change in the pattern of ownership of generating plant. Prof Littlechild also accepts the recommendation of the Commons energy committee that he should consider by 1995 at the latest whether the leading generators should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'Their prices and profits will be relevant in making this decision and in the timing of it,' he writes in the report. The share price of PowerGen fell 6p to 280p and National Power was down 4p at 269p. The regulator is unhappy about the way some generating stations, the constrained-on plants, are allowed to charge high rates in return for stabilising supplies. They operate outside the normal power bidding system and can be much more profitable when required. The report, which follows an Offer report last December on electricity pool prices, says payments for constrained-on plants in 1991-92 amounted to more than Pounds 200m, an increase of more than 70 per cent on the previous year. The report focuses on 14 National Power and PowerGen stations that each received payments of Pounds 10m or more. Five - Fawley and Didcot for National Power, Ferrybridge B, Hams Hall and Castle Donington for PowerGen - received more than Pounds 30m each. Most of the stations were older and less fuel-efficient coal-fired plants, although the report finds that some large, modern oil-fired plants had also bid high prices when transmission constraints were active and there was a sharp demand for electricity. Prof Littlechild says of the present system: 'It does not provide adequate protection for customers. 'In a competitive market, customers should not have to rely on generators adopting self-imposed codes of conduct to limit their bidding.' National Power said its policy was to recover each station's costs plus a reasonable contribution to overheads and profits. 'We have adopted a clear and consistent policy not to exploit our position with regard to our constrained-on plant,' it said. Report on Constrained-on Plant.

0,FT921-8566 ,"FT921-8566 _AN-CBQCLACOFT 920217   FT  17 FEB 92 / Monday Interview: A thinker as well as a doer - Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator      By DAVID LASCELLES   One year after the UK privatised its electricity industry, much of the debate about its future takes place in a large, 15th-floor office overlooking central Birmingham. It is occupied by a lightly built man with a russet, gnome-like beard who seldom smiles, and whose every word sounds so carefully chosen that it might have been uttered by a judge. And, in a way, a judge he is. Professor Stephen Littlechild is the director-general of electricity supply  -the man charged with the statutory duty of promoting competition in the electricity industry. The grand set of titles is no accident. He is both a regulator and an academic: a thinker and a doer. Anyone requesting a copy of his curriculum vitae is asked whether they want the long version or the short one. The long one consists of 11 pages packed with details of his degrees, fellowships, appointments, consultancies and publications. The latter range from a weighty Elements of Telecommunications Economics (in Japanese) to treatises on aircraft landing fees, smoking and daffodil prices. But the short version contains the central points. Since 1975, as Professor of Commerce at Birmingham University (from which he is currently on leave of absence), Prof Littlechild has been one of the leading academics on regulation issues. He advised the UK government on the regulatory regime for British Telecom and the water industry, and was a member of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for six years. Most significantly, he invented the formula that governs the amount by which the electricity industry can raise its prices each year. His credentials for the electricity supply job were impeccable. What this version does not say is that Prof Littlechild is also a great believer in market forces, and as such was in tune with the 1980s when he was appointed. But he resents any suggestion that he is a product of the Thatcher years. 'The belief in the advantages of competition in satisfying the needs of customers and making companies work efficiently is centuries old,' he says. 'In many respects this is a fundamental part of our civilisation.' So what influenced his views? 'I've always had a belief in freedom of choice, in a free society.' Some people might see a contradiction between this philosophy and the wielding of regulatory power over one of the UK's largest and most complex industries. But Prof Littlechild sees a clear role for himself. Electricity was not privatised without flaws: there is insufficient competition in power generation; all sorts of barriers still prevent free competition among suppliers; and the prices of power sources like coal and nuclear are wildly distorted. The regulator has to maintain the momentum of change by opening the floodgates of competition, while ensuring the lights stay on. Since last autumn, Prof Littlechild has issued a string of pronouncements and decisions, many of them dozens of pages long. He criticised the two companies that dominate the generating business for playing games with electricity prices, and threatened them with a monopoly referral if they did not mend their ways. He reduced some of the barriers holding back competition, and he ensured that householders had rebates after being overcharged by local electricity companies. 'I believe in market forces, but it is too simplistic to say that they will solve all the problems,' he admits. One of his worries is that the socially disadvantaged can become the victims rather than the beneficiaries of competition. So he has been tough with the electricity suppliers over disconnections, for example, when bills are not paid. He also has his doubts whether market disciplines will push the power industry into caring for the environment; this led him to pen another lengthy paper proposing a new regime to encourage energy efficiency - by adding what he calls an 'e' factor to the price formula. This flurry of activity has not made him popular with the industry. This may be the natural lot of the regulator. But electricity executives also complain about the torrent of paper that streams out of Birmingham. They accuse Prof Littlechild of academic remoteness, of being more interested in producing learned treatises than in addressing the hard realities of the business world. He looks slightly offended at this. 'I don't think that I'm unduly academic. I try to lay out what the issues are. I try to explain my thinking and get a response. I think I have a good dialogue with the industry.' His biggest immediate challenge will be to decide what to do about the generating industry in England and Wales, where the two descendants of the old Central Electricity Generating Board, National Power and PowerGen, have three quarters of the market between them. In spite of his monopoly referral threat, Prof Littlechild is keen not to cause upheaval at this early stage, because 'I want to see if I can work with the industry I have inherited'. He also studiously avoids accusing the generators outright of price gouging, presumably to prevent bringing the monopoly issue to a head just yet. But he also wants to give his price formula time to work. It was designed to force electricity companies to keep price rises below the rate of inflation, and therefore cut costs. The companies will only do this if they know the formula will apply for several years, he argues. The first price review is not due to get under way until 1994. In this respect, Prof Littlechild has been much less aggressive than his colleagues regulating the gas and water industries, who have provoked vigorous clashes with the companies in their charge. Further ahead, Prof Littlechild is already planning the introduction of competition down to the grass roots of the UK electricity market - the private home. He has a vision of each household buying its electricity not just from its local distributor, but from any company it chooses. 'I do believe it is both possible and desirable for competition at the domestic level. I look forward to a situation where the domestic customer can look in the Yellow Pages for a supplier of electricity like a supplier of oil.' Power companies would compete not just on price but on levels of service, availability of credit, types of billing and so on. Electricity would be sold using sophisticated tariffs giving householders all sorts of options as to how and when they draw their power. This brave new world would be based on new-fangled metering technology which Prof Littlechild has closely researched. For about Pounds 50-Pounds 60, he believes, people will be able to buy a device to measure how much electricity is used and apportion it to the various suppliers chosen by the household. It will probably be linked by radio to the supplier, which will then know exactly how much power it is supplying at any given moment. His ideas about metering, laid out in a recent paper, have aroused interest in consumer organisations, but attracted a scornful response from much of the industry which doubts that ordinary householders want such a sophisticated level of service. But Prof Littlechild argues that the industry will have to go down this route as competition spreads. 'The future is going to be different, and this is what people want,' he says. 'The UK would be pioneering in providing this service. A sensible timescale would be to look for full competition by the year 1998.' Prof Littlechild was greatly encouraged by the recent energy directive from Brussels which will throw open national electricity and gas markets to competition from the rest of the European Community. It closely parallels what he is trying to do with UK electricity and will therefore fit comfortably with the future as he sees it. Continental countries, many of them still dominated by state-owned power monopolies, will have a far tougher time. But Prof Littlechild's musings about the future could be rudely interrupted in a few weeks' time if a UK election produces a change of government. Although technically an independent regulator, the director of electricity supply is appointed by the energy secretary, and there has been some speculation that Prof Littlechild's free market leanings could cost him his job under a Labour administration. He views the prospect calmly. 'A change of government shouldn't have any effect,' he says. 'I don't anticipate a major problem.' PERSONAL FILE 1943 Born August 27.

0,FT942-2256 ,"FT942-2256 _AN-EFTD4AFVFT 940620   FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (4): Forward from 1935 - Deregulation knocks at Germany's door      By JUDY DEMPSEY   When Germany takes over the presidency of the European Union on July 1, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the country's economics minister, will try to place the liberalisation and deregulation of Germany's energy sector high on the agenda. But the chances for pushing through any deregulation of the sector before Germany's federal elections next October are slim. Mr Rexrodt conceded as much during the recent congress of the Free Democrats, the junior partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union-led coalition. 'I really do not expect to get these measures through until after the election,' said Mr Rexrodt. Mr Rexrodt had already set out his plans for a new energy law in a bill issued last October. It sets out to replace a law which has been on the statute books since 1935. Its aim is to allow Third Party Access (TPA)throughout the electricity - and gas - sector. Among other things, it states that operators of the electricity grid, upon whom third parties are dependent for transportation, must not unreasonably hinder those seeking contracts for TPA. However, any refusal to grant TPA is permitted if the capacity for TPA is insufficient, if no appropriate compensation for TAP is offered, or if the secure supplies to other customers of the operators of the lines is deemed impossible through TPA. Over the past few months, opposition to the Rexrodt paper has hardened. The economics ministry itself is split. Mr Dieter von Wurzen, a state secretary, is opposed to TPA on the grounds that it should be based on reciprocity by other European Union countries, while Mr Johnann Eekhoff, a state secretary and Mr Martin Cronenberg, an energy expert at the ministry, are anxious to push through liberalisation. The response from the environment ministry has been lukewarm. Officials argue that the draft law does not go far enough in introducing environmental improvements. But it is the reaction from industry which holds the key to the success or failure of any plans by the federal government to deregulate the energy sector. The umbrella body for big industrial energy users (Verband der Industriellen Energie und Kraftwirtschaft, or VIK) has welcomed the proposals. This is understandable. The organisation's current president is the chemicals sector, including BASF, one of Germany's largest chemical groups, which has long campaigned for cheaper electricity and gas prices. 'The electricity and gas prices for industry in Germany are between 30 and 40 per cent, and in some extreme cases, 100 per cent higher than in other European countries,' a VIK paper recently noted, adding that the industry requires greater competition. Indeed, unlike some other European Union countries, Germany has no single formal regulatory body overseeing electricity pricing. Distribution companies - that is, the regional utilities - must agree their tariffs with local municipalities, which in many cases, own part of the distributors. Tariffs are normally based on the operational costs of the distributors. Despite the high cost of energy, analysts at the German association of German gas and water users (BGW) continue to oppose many aspects of the Rexrodt proposals. A recent paper issued by BGW argued that the introduction of TPA and the abolition of the principle of exclusive service areas will create 'inequality of opportunity'. It added that foreign gas companies would be able to supply the German market while foreign markets would remain inaccessible to German gas businesses. It added that TPA would lead to the expropriation of private investment and, more importantly, the obligation to connect customers and guarantee supply could no longer be met. The BGW's views have been reinforced by the association of municipal undertakings (Verband kommunaler Unternehmen, or VKU). Under present legislation, the municipalities have the exclusive right to issue concession contracts. If TPA were introduced, revenues earned from these concessionary payments would be reduced. As it stands, the municipalities receive about DM5bn each year in concession payments which help to finance public services. Yet the Rexrodt plan would give the municipalities the right to choose which utilities supply its customers, or even take over the supply themselves by buying the distribution grid. However, Germany's large utility companies, which are grouped under the VDEW, the trade association which represents them, would perhaps lose out. Currently, they enjoy the principle of demarcation, which effectively amounts to a monopolistic structure. The trade unions, particularly IG Bergbau und Energie, which represents the mining and energy workers, also oppose the Rexrodt paper because social services on the municipal level would be cut, and TPA and greater competition could undermine Germany's heavily subsidised hard coal industry. German coal prices are considerably higher than world coal prices. The latter cost about DM80 a tonne, but electricty companies in Germany pay DM280 per tonne for German coal in order to protect the industry. The electricity utilities are allowed to collect a levy from the consumer, called the Kohlpfennig, which helps to compensate them for using the high cost of coal. Despite this opposition, there is a growing consensus that eventually Germany must open up the energy sector. For one thing, the Kohlpfennig is supposed to be reduced or even phased out by 1996. In addition, many concession rights for towns and cities expire by 1996, raising the prospect of much greater competition in these sphere. As an energy expert at BGW explained, 'we are already allowing in foreigners. If we could get reciprocity, we would move ahead. But we cannot go it alone. But we know we are under pressure.'

The company, which prides itself on its environmental policies, is committed to producing the equivalent of its UK energy needs through wind power. The farm at Bryn Titli, near Rhayader, will have 22 wind turbines of 37-metre diameter on 30-metre towers. It will generate enough electricity to supply more than 7,000 homes.

Northern Ireland Electricity, which is set to become a public limited company at the end of March, with possible flotation towards the end of the year, lost its Yorkshire-born chief executive Tony Hadfield who was lured to Newcastle last October as the new managing director of Northern Electric. NIE has now found a replacement in 41-year-old Ulsterman Patrick Haren (below left), who has been in Dublin in recent years as new business investment director of the Electricity Supply Board in the Republic. As NIE battles its way between the competition-minded department of economic development and an array of Ulster politicians fearful of job losses and fighting to defend the 'public sector ethic', it is far from clear quite what sort of organisation Haren will head from March 31. Meanwhile, economist Geoffrey Horton (below right) is to become director general of the province's electricity regulator which is designed to come into being on April 1. Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator in England and Wales, had declined the northern Ireland post saying his workload was too heavy. The Northern Irish Offer will be a separate entity, but with close links enabling it to tap into the experience of the longer established regulator. Horton himself will be based in Birmingham, spending perhaps two days a week in the province. Horton, who is 40, has also been working part-time as a consultant to the National Economic Research Associates although he will give this up when he takes on Northern Ireland. He previously worked at the Department of Energy and played a significant part in the re-organisation and privatisation of the electricity industry in England and Wales, as well as being involved in setting up the regulatory regime for Northern Ireland.

The transaction, starting in 1997, marks a further diversification of supplies for the energy-dependent Italians. It is the first direct liquefied natural gas deal between a big European electricity utility and an energy producing country. ENEL will buy 3.7bn cubic metres of gas a year from a new plant being built by Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas, a Nigerian government-owned company in which Shell, Agip and Elf are also shareholders. Smaller quantities of gas will also be supplied to utilities in Spain, France and the US. The price ENEL will pay will be indexed to that of crude and refined oil, as well as coal, but the value of the contract is expected to amount to L500bn a year. Once the liquefied gas arrives in Italy, it will be processed at a new facility at Montalto di Castro in the central Lazio region. The plant will supply a 3,300 MW power station to be built nearby. ENEL currently uses 6-7bn cu m of natural gas a year, but expects consumption to rise to 20-25bn cu m by the year 2000 after a number of deals are completed. Around 6bn cu m of Algerian gas will be supplied via an undersea pipeline being built by the Italian state-owned SNAM group, while a further 1.5bn cu m will be imported in liquid form. Meanwhile, talks are under way with Norway to supply 3-4bn cu m, while further supplies may come from Qatar. The new contracts should help to overcome the uncertainty surrounding plans to import 4bn cu m of gas from Russia. Italy uses around 50bn cu m of natural gas to generate electricity and for domestic purposes, 60 per cent of which comes from Algeria and Russia. Future consumption is expected to rise to 80bn cu m, three-quarters of it imported.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Southern's shares ended with a gain of 6p to 756p. But Northern Electric, SWEB and Seeboard were among the day's strongest performers as they became the focus of bid speculation. Southern's profits were up 20 per cent to Pounds 106.8m pre-tax on the back of strong demand and continuing cost reductions. Turnover was down as regulatory pressures impacted on electricity prices. Earnings per share improved to 29.69p (24.8p). The interim dividend goes up by 24 per cent to 8.3p  - well below increases announced by other recs during the current reporting season. But Southern was one of only two recs which did not make dividend-enhacing share buy-backs this year. Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, said Southern's region 'has performed well', with units distributed up 3.7 per cent. Growth was especially strong in the industrial and residential sectors. The non-electricity businesses lifted profits by 10.7 per cent, reflecting strength in the contracting and cable-laying operations. But retailing lost money, as did the newly formed gas supply business which Southern said it was viewing with caution. Controllable costs were down 5.6 per cent and manpower down 12 per cent. Southern is now ahead of its job reduction target, but still aims to shed 1,200 of its 4,200 jobs by 2000. Southern has already announced a price freeze and rebates which it said yesterday would bring total savings passed on to customers since privatisation to Pounds 112m. COMMENT Insofar as the market was able to concentrate amid the bid excitement, these were seen as a solid set of figures, confirming Southern's position as one of the sector's soundest, if most conservative, members. The relatively low dividend increase is caused partly by Southern's decision not to buy back any shares, at least until the tax uncertainties of the National Grid sale are out of the way. The shares yield about the sector average, which suggests that Southern's performance inspires respect if not excitement. But the appointment of a managing director yesterday with specific responsibility to find a replacement for Grid earnings also suggests welcome long-sightedness.   Companies:-  Southern Electric.

The sector did not forsake its main feature,  reliability, in the past year, which was very difficult for  power industry personnel.    Professor Anatoliy Dyakov, the head of the new power company  ""YeES [Unified Energy System of Russia], called last year a  peculiar test of maturity for the company. Having converted the  enterprises of the sector to joint-stock operations, the new  company restructured the system of management in the electric  power sector of Russia while preserving in the process its main  advantage--the unity of the power system. It is precisely owing  to this that, in the environment of an economic crisis, the  generation of electricity fell by as little as 5.5 percent last  year.    However, difficulties entailed by changes in the system of  management have become secondary compared to daily concerns.  Nonpayments by consumers of electricity have exceeded the 4  trillion-ruble mark and have in essence left the industry  without the funds to develop, despite it being necessary for the  electric power industry to commission 8-9 million kilowatts of  capacity annually in order to replace worn-out generators. It is  fitting to recall that in one-half of the power stations of  Russia the service life of the equipment has ended completely.    Financial difficulties were exacerbated by problems in  supplying the thermal stations with fuel, in particular coal.  Thus, at a number of stations in the Urals region fuel reserves  came to just over 60 percent of the 1992 level, and at power  stations of the Far East--just 30 percent.    The plan for 1994 is to reduce coal production by 50-60  million tonnes, which will primarily deal a painful blow  specifically to the electric power sector. After all, most of  Russia's 600 thermal stations use coal as their primary fuel.    The absence or clearly inadequate reserves of fuel pose the  threat of stoppages at quite a number of nuclear power stations.    In addition to the startup of new power units at the Pskov,  Nizhnevartovsk, St. Petersburg, and a number of power plants in  the Far East, the plan is to partially offset the potential loss  in electricity generation by using more advanced technologies  for fuel combustion and better energy-saving measures. For  example, the use of more up-to-date installations for gas  combustion will make it possible to boost electricity production  by 10-15 percent, with the volume of fuel used remaining the  same.    Nonetheless, Anatoliy Dyakov believes that the electric  power  sector has now approached the danger line beyond which its  stable operation may be disrupted. A tangle of nonpayments and  the absence of internal funds rob the power industry personnel  of the opportunity to acquire even the most necessary items for  repairs: metal, wire, and welding electrodes. In the opinion of  the representatives of regional power associations, this year's  repair campaign is in jeopardy. This is fraught with the danger  of consumers failing to receive the necessary quantities of heat  and light.    A way out of this complex situation is found in a search for  a mechanism to eliminate consumer nonpayments. Part of the  outline for solving this difficult problem has already emerged.  In particular, it is proposed to switch to a system of bills of  exchange for mutual settlements between the consumers and  producers of electricity. A draft for using bank bills of  exchange as payment documents has already been developed by the  Russian joint-stock company YeES of Russia together with an  underwriting syndicate and the Russian Brokerage House. A  mechanism for solving the nonpayments problem on a broad scale  may come along if the project is successfully carried out.     "

Where do they get their information? Who do they listen to? World production of hard coal has grown from less than 2,800m tonnes in 1980 to more than 3,500m tonnes in 1992. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe forecast is for world hard coal demand to rise to 4,300m tonnes by the year 2010. Some forecasts predict that by then coal will once again take precedence over oil as the largest single source of commercially traded energy. Many developing countries see coal as the most readily available and plentiful fuel for the generation of the increased electricity that accompanies the earliest stages of an improved standard of living. It is perhaps even more significant that the world's most dynamic economies around the Pacific Rim all plan to increase the use of coal. Official plans for Japan, Korea, and Taiwan all forecast a continuing growth in the use of coal for power generation. The latest forecast by Japan's Electric Power Development Company sees coal's share of Japan's energy mix doubling over the next decade as 26 new coal-fired power stations come on stream. Steam coal demand for electricity generation in Japan is seen as rising from 31m tonnes in 1992 to around 74m tonnes annually by the year 2002. Few countries are more environmentally conscious than Japan. Huge investments continue to be made in coal-fired power stations using the technologies already available to ensure that coal can be burnt more efficiently and in an environmentally acceptable way. Across the world economies with a good track record in backing winners are backing coal. It would appear that almost every country with prospects for significant economic growth sees coal as a prime fuel to generate the electricity without which no country can provide the improving standard of living that their people expect.

0,FT941-14664 ,"FT941-14664 _AN-EASC7AEHFT 940119   FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: How to distribute the cash mountains - A poser facing the regional electricity companies      By MICHAEL SMITH   It is the kind of predicament which most companies can only dream of. Some of Britain's electricity distributors have so much money that they do not know what to do with it. This week Eastern Electricity, one of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales, has shown one way by starting to buy back some of the shares issued when it was privatised, along with the other 11, three years ago. This will reduce the company's cash pile, Pounds 90m and growing, and increase the earnings of the shares which remain in issue. It also pleased the City which yesterday marked up the company's and the sector's shares. Further, and more radical, balance sheet restructuring in the sector is inevitable as companies get to grips with the welcome but complex problems presented by generating far more profit and cash than the government imagined at flotation. At the end of this financial year in March, several of the companies will be cash positive and the sector as a whole may have net cash. Changes from April 1995 in regulatory controls covering their distribution businesses may dent the growth but some analysts believe that, even if the changes are radical, the companies will continue to generate cash for at least several years. Hoarding it would be inefficient. Utility companies with strong, predictable and safe earnings can afford to have, and would benefit from, higher debt than most companies. Debt should be even more attractive in times of low interest rates. 'Many of the recs are over-capitalised,' says one analyst. 'Put simply the cost of the equity is about 8 per cent, if you assume yield of 4 per cent and about 4 per cent for real dividend growth. The cost of debt in the market would be about 7 per cent.' Mr Bob Turgoose, a partner with Price Waterhouse and a specialist in the electricity sector, says creating large cash piles is unlikely to be welcomed by shareholders. 'The recs would begin to look like banks and that is not what investors have bought shares in them for. 'Providing the companies can invest the money well they will get better returns elsewhere. Electricity companies could lift their gearing levels considerably without anyone batting an eyelid.' The recs' rude financial health stems in part from their unexpected progress in cutting staff and costs but also from the relatively generous terms on which they were floated by the government. 'The more complicated a business the better chance it had in the privatisation process,' says Mr Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett. 'Thus electricity fared far better than water.' Although Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, has signalled he will considerably tighten price controls in the forthcoming review, there are doubts about how tough he can be. 'There is strength in numbers,' says Mr Hawkins. 'There will be huge debates about whether he is treating all the recs fairly but Prof Littlechild would have bigger problems still if he also adopted a strict approach. 'But to stop positive cash flows he is going to have to be pretty vicious. Most of the companies have a fair amount tucked away in their back pockets for future cost reductions.' Even if the review results in the distribution cash flow drying up, some analysts believe the recs could still be cash positive overall, in part because of likely improvements to the supply businesses' debt collection processes. The recs have two main options for dealing with their cash surpluses. The first is to take the familiar but dangerous path of diversification. Finding areas for investment will not be easy. Difficulties experienced by some of the water companies in diversifying have left the market wary. Among utilities, investors tend to favour the cautious. Most of the recs have entered or are looking at the gas supply business following the government's opening up of that market. Some, including Midlands Electricity, are looking at investing in generation projects abroad but the opportunities are limited and commitments so far are minimal. 'The problem with cash piles is that they increase pressure to buy something you may later regret,' says one chief executive. The second option is to pay back some of the cash to shareholders. Share buy-backs are the most obvious route. So far East Midlands, which has permission to buy 5 per cent of its stock, and Swalec are the only companies to have shareholder approval, and several recs are likely to ask for shareholder approval at annual meetings later this year. A simpler payback method would be to increase dividends to shareholders. That could be achieved by lifting the increases by even more in real terms than the 6 per cent or so minimal a year that analysts are expecting post-1995. But this has its dangers, especially as the next general election approaches and the chances of a victorious Labour party imposing a windfall profits tax on electricity companies increases. Some rec executives are therefore beginning to consider privately a large, one-off dividend. Unlike Ofwat, the water regulator, Prof Littlechild has raised no objections to high dividend increases. However, none of the companies are likely to do anything radical before Prof Littlechild completes his distribution review. Even Eastern appears to be merely testing the water, having bought less than 1 per cent of its shares.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

The government has given National Grid approval in principle for a Pounds 200m plan to erect 400,000-volt powerlines through 50 miles of Cleveland and North Yorkshire, but no work can start unless it has landowners' and occupiers' consent to the installation of new pylons and lines. The upgrading, requiring 240 pylons, each 150ft high, has provoked opposition and the formation of a pressure group, Revolt - Rural England Versus Overhead Lines Transmission. In return for way-leaves - the licence required to erect pylons and overhead lines - NGC has offered annual site rental payments of about Pounds 80 per pylon, plus - as a incentive to prompt agreement - one-off sums of Pounds 300 per pylon and Pounds 200 for overhead lines. In spite of this it has obtained by voluntary means only 25 of the 138 way-leaves it needs. Now it wishes to resort to compulsion. The result is a seven-week programme of hearings, starting today in Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, and moving later to North Yorkshire. At these hearings independent Department of Trade and Industry inspectors will weigh the conflicting views of NGC and the way-leave refusers. One of those refusing way-leave is Mr David Dugdale, a farmer and Revolt member. He said: 'The general feeling is there's no semblance of any sort of national need or national good about this proposed route. It's purely related to private gain by shareholders and senior executives of the electricity companies.' NGC insists upgrading is critically important to allow transmission of more, cheaply generated electricity from gas, hydro and nuclear stations. The protestors' objections include the pylons' visual impact and the hindrance they create for modern farming methods. There is also deep unease about the possible link between electro-magnetic fields and cancer. NGC, which is funding research into this, said that while a possible connection existed with childhood leukaemia, the National Radiological Protection Board had not issued any precautionary guidelines on electro-magnetic fields and high-voltage transmission. Mr Dugdale and other NGC opponents insist that potential risk should not be ignored. 'It must be a policy of prudent avoidance,' he said.   Companies:-  National Grid Holdings.

The company is spending Pounds 10m to take full ownership of the 360MW Peterborough power plant, of which it already has 50 per cent. It has also reached agreement to buy part of the output of the Schooner gas field in the North Sea. The investments in the 340MW King's Lynn station, which it will wholly own, and the Peterborough plant will give Eastern about 2 per cent of the electricity generation market. The projects could take gearing to about 30 per cent in 1995-96, although this may vary depending on how Eastern finances them. The company is currently cash neutral. Eastern said yesterday that following completion of the King's Lynn station at the end of 1996, the gross assets of its generation division would be about Pounds 450m. It expects King's Lynn and Peterborough to contribute about Pounds 40m to pre-tax profits in 1997. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 177m. The King's Lynn project is a further disappointment for the coal industry following an announcement last week by a group of companies, including Midlands Electricity, that they are building a 750MW power station on Humberside. The King's Lynn power station, to be built by Siemens, is likely to displace about 1m tonnes of coal a year. Mr Doug Swinden, group strategy director, said that the project would provide a good return on the investment even if the price in the electricity wholesale pool were to remain at current levels. The peak effect of the station on group gearing would be 12 per cent in 1995-96 and this would then fall because of the station's cash generation. The acquisition of 50 per cent of Peterborough from Hawker Siddeley Management, a BTR subsidiary, will bring Pounds 175m of non-recourse debt on to the group's balance sheet. It will increase gearing by 21 percentage points in 1994-95. Peterborough made operating profits of Pounds 3.9m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 840,000 in the six months to March after starting full operation in December. Eastern expects to buy about Pounds 200m of gas from the Schooner field from Shell and Esso over the nine years from the autumn 1996.   Companies:-  Eastern Electricity.

The bureau has also set up a special working group to raise  foreign capital.    Officials with the bureau said investors from Germany,  Sweden, Australia, France, Britain, Canada, the United States  and Hong Kong show strong interest in investing in Hunan's power  industry.    The New Xiangtan Power Station is expected to cooperate with  investors from Sweden, and a German company is negotiating with  the bureau for construction of the Wangcheng Power Plant.    Last year, TIME Engineering Berhad, a member of the  Malaysian  Renong Group, signed a contract with Lianyuan city to construct  a 250-megawatt coal-fired power station in the city.    Total investment for that project was put at $230 million.    Wu Haichun, general manager of the province's Power Industry  Corp, admitted that Hunan has one of the country's worst  shortages of electricity, but he promised that the province will  make big progress this year. By the end of 1993, the province  had installed capacity of 6.58 million kilowatts, double the  figure in 1980.    However, its per capita consumption of electricity is only  60  per cent of the national average.    Wu said that from l994 to 2000, the province plans to  install  another 9 million kilowatts of capacity, of which 7 million will  be thermal and 2 million hydropower.    But to do that, Hunan needs 30 billion yuan ($3.45 billion).    Wu said the province will use various methods to raise the  capital.    To expand the government's fund for electrical investment,  the province is expected to raise electricity prices this year.    It also plans to raise money from the securities market by  converting power enterprises into shareholding companies.    Hunan Huayin Power Co Ltd, the province's first shareholding  power company, was established last year and is expected to go  public.    The company has issued shares worth 288 million yuan ($33  million), and most of the money raised will be used to renovate  the Zhuzhou Power Plant.    The province also plans to invest 2.75 billion yuan ($315  million) in electrical construction this year, compared with  1.71 billion yuan ($191 million) last year.     "

The report, brought forward deliberately to coincide with the debate about the future of coal, marks a serious setback for the coal lobby as it fights the threat from competing fuels, mainly gas. But the report's chief conclusions were rejected by the power generation industry. Mr Colin Webster, commercial director of National Power, said he was 'utterly amazed' by Prof Littlechild's findings, which he described as 'a nonsense and tendentious'. He said: 'We believe he has done his calculations quite wrongly.' Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, the second largest generator sent a letter to Prof Littlechild accusing him of putting together a rushed report which failed to reflect the true position of the industry. An official said: 'He seems to have conducted an analysis based on a wide margin of error.' British Coal, which has claimed that it is being unfairly squeezed out of the market by the 'dash for gas', said: 'It has to be of concern to the regulator that a large generation company is questioning his analysis.' Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, said the report failed to take full account of fuel costs or the danger of overcapacity in gas-fired plant. The Department of Trade and Industry said it would take account of Prof Littlechild's conclusions but declined any detailed comment. Prof Littlechild's main finding was that electricity companies had not breached their duty to buy electricity as economically as possible in signing gas-based deals. But to reach this conclusion he had to calculate the relative contract price of different fuels. He gave these yesterday as 3.2p a kilowatt hour for coal, 3p for nuclear and 2.7p-3p for gas. National Power said the correct figure for coal was 2.72p. Prof Littlechild's report was welcomed by the electricity distribution industry, whose members were relieved by his conclusion that they had purchased power economically. Gas producers also supported the report as evidence that the UK's gas lobby is being heard. 'Frankly, it's very helpful,' said Mr Tony Craven-Walker, chief executive of Monument Oil and Gas. Monumentis involved in a Pounds 2bn project to develop four oil and gas fields in the Liverpool Bay area which is dependent on PowerGen getting approval for its Connah's Quay gas-fired power station. A British Gas official said: 'It's interesting that this is a preliminary report and we'll look forward to further findings at the end of January.'

0,FT933-7095 ,"FT933-7095 _AN-DHXDHACUFT 930824   FT  24 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Wind farms generate storm (2) - David Lascelles' article on the future of wind energy, published on August 19, provoked a large number of letters, both for and against the development of wind power. Here is a selection      From Dr I D MAYS, Dr D LINDLEY and Mr M TRINNICK   Sir, Anybody reading David Lascelles' article on wind farms can be in no doubt about his personal views on the development of wind energy. Regrettably, he rests his case largely on the basis of erroneous information. He claims that the recent decision to allow construction of a wind farm at Four Burrows in Cornwall is the fourth instance where the environment secretary has pushed through a wind farm against the wishes of people who live nearby. This is quite wrong. The other three projects referred to the secretary of state - Ovenden Moor, Kirby Moor and Cemmaes - were approved by local planning committees. The government decided that a wider examination in public should be undertaken. At Four Burrows the inquiry ensued when the planning committee rejected the advice of its professional planning officers to grant permission. The technology is certainly not, as Mr Lascelles argues 'a long way from commercial operation'. Let us be clear on energy costs. On sites having only a modest wind speed, the cost of wind-generated electricity over a typical 20-year plant life is about 6.5p per unit, and is coming down. On windier sites such as are found in parts of Scotland, the price can be substantially lower. Comparing this, on the same accounting basis, with the prices for electricity from new conventional power stations, we have coal at about 4.5p/unit, combined cycle gas at 2.6p/unit and nuclear at at least 7p/unit. As things are at present, wind is not the cheapest. But the costs quoted here for conventional power projects do not include the external environmental and social costs that they incur. Evidence presented to the Commons energy committee last year showed that external costs added about 0.75p/unit for combined cycle gas and 2p/unit for coal and nuclear. Wind, which requires no fuel to be won or transported, produces no carbon dioxide or other atmospheric pollution and has no legacy for future generations. It does not suffer from the associated external costs. It is competitive with coal and cheaper than nuclear. Mr Lascelles seeks to belittle the significant contribution that wind energy can make to our energy needs. The UK has vast wind assets, almost half Europe's wind resource. This is equivalent to more than double our current electricity demand. Taking account of its fluctuating nature, siting constraints, and integrating it into a practical and flexible system it is reasonable to expect that wind energy could supply 10-20 per cent of our electricity early in the next century and provide valuable diversity of supply. And what of land usage? To generate 10 per cent of our electricity from the wind would require wind farms extending over 1,200 sq km (not 4,000). This is only 0.3 per cent of the UK land area and because wind turbines occupy less than 1 per cent of the area in which they are sited, the actual land usage would be only 12 sq km. In the other 1,188 sq km, cows could still safely graze and crops ripen around and below the turbines. Of course, the main environmental advantage of wind is that it is a clean energy source. Were the policy, planning and regulatory frameworks to allow us to achieve the 10 per cent tomorrow, the immedIate benefit would be to avoid pumping 30m tonnes of carbon dioxide, 30,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide and 60,000 tonnes of nitrous oxide into the atmosphere each year and without the long-term safety commitment the nuclear industry has yet to face. Mr Lascelles might not like wind farms, but the evidence of independent public opinion surveys shows that less than 10 per cent of the general public, including those living around wind farms, do not like them. The substantial majority are in favour. What they are not is uneconomic or unnecessary.

0,FT924-7459 ,"FT924-7459 _AN-CKRA9AAAFT 921117   FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Apprehension as season starts - Michael Smith details the dilemma facing electricity companies      By MICHAEL SMITH   IN ANY other industry it would be a cause for celebration. Britain's electricity companies, however, view with apprehension the start today of a results season that will see all of them declare healthy profits - most substantially higher than last year. 'Unless we declare no increases in profits and say we are reducing the salaries of our chairmen, we are bound to get flack,' reflects the financial director of one of England and Wales's 12 regional electricity companies. In the two years since privatisation, the sector has weathered attacks over the size of profits seen by critics as the product of feather-bedding introduced by the government to make the companies' shares attractive. The interim results to be declared by the two generators, the two Scottish companies and the 12 regional electricity companies (RECs) in England and Wales over the next month will be closely scrutinised because of the government's energy policy review. The RECs are vulnerable to attack because of their role in the so-called 'dash for gas'. This has seen some join ventures that will lessen the need for coal-fired generation, contributing to British Coal's decision, now under review, to close 31 pits and shed 30,000 jobs. Although these results will tell us nothing about the economic viability of gas-fired power stations, the RECs will come under strong pressure at results meetings to justify their claims that customers will not suffer. High profits would increase the suspicion that companies are too heavily biased towards serving the interests of their shareholders rather than customers. Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, has launched a long-term review of industry pricing, and the latest results could affect his thinking. The industry can at least comfort itself with the likelihood that pre-tax profits will have risen less steeply than they did for the first post-privatisation full-year results six months ago. The RECs then recorded an average rise of more than 50 per cent. A figure closer to 20 per cent is likely this time, still leaving room for critics' attacks. The profit out-turns, however, will have only limited value. Electricity use is highly seasonal and some companies first-half profits will be less than a tenth of the yearly out-turn. In addition, the post-privatisation restructuring of the industry and the recession leave plenty of scope for companies to make exceptional provisions and thus reduce the headline profit total. Political pressure may also affect some companies' dividend decisions. High increases run the risk of antagonising politicians and the electricity regulator at a time when critical decisions are being made about the industry's future. Dividend cover is high and most companies are likely to reason that abandoning the policy of strong dividend growth, albeit temporarily, would lead to a loss of shareholder loyalty. Most analysts expect National Power, PowerGen and the Scottish companies to increase dividends by 10 per cent or more, and the RECs by an average of about 12 per cent. National Power starts off the season today with expectations of between Pounds 209m and Pounds 236m at the pre-tax level, against Pounds 202m last time. PowerGen will show a less impressive headline growth tomorrow - analysts expect Pounds 100m against last year's Pounds 97m - largely because of accounting procedures leading to a heavier proportion of profits being reported in the second half. With the generators' income and costs relatively easy to predict because of long-term contracts with British Coal and the RECs, the City will focus on what progress the companies are making with cost cutting, in particular staffing reductions. Profit growth is also assured for the RECs. They enjoy inflation-plus pricing formulae, cost reductions through rationalisation and the likely rise in distribution business which provides more than 80 per cent of profits. Volume growth is likely to have continued, perhaps by about 1 per cent. Demand is high despite the recession; householders are reluctant to cut back on heating and ventilation while the cuts in industry have been partially offset by retailers staying open longer. The recession may have taken a higher toll on some non-core activities, including retailing which made profits for only two RECs last year. In the long term, however, these are sideshows for most companies compared with the potential profits or losses that will accrue from the combined cycle gas turbine power stations most of the RECs are building. Should Prof Littlechild find next month that electricity from some of the proposed stations is likely to cost consumers more than their coal-fired equivalents, company shares will take a far bigger hit than anything which is likely to come out of the interim results.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             POWER PROFITS                        poundsm interim pre-tax  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   92-93*        91-92         % change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Midlands                         27         24.7              9.3 Eastern                               22         15.4             42.8 London                                17         14.5             17.2 Manweb                                34         27.5             23.6 Midlands                              31           27             14.8 National Power                       226          202             11.9 Northern                              35           26             34.6 Norweb                                36         33.4              7.8 PowerGen                              99           97              2.1 Scottish Hydro                        48           27             77.8 Scottish Power                        94         81.9             14.8 Seeboard                              10            6             66.7 South Wales                           25         20.7             20.7 South Western                         16         13.6             17.6 Southern                              14         13.7              2.2 Yorkshire                             43         33.1             29.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Forecast by SG Warburg Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

Briquettes will cost 1,250 leva/tonne (about $22 at the current  exchange rate), up from 660 leva/tonne, until October 1, when  price ceilings will be introduced for solid fuels.    Other prices were fixed as follows: brown coal from 995 to  1,116 leva/tonne; cleaned brown coal from 1,312 to 1,318  leva/tonne; and lignite coal 632 to 809 leva/tonne.    The decree sets maximum mercantile additions for local coal  at 210 leva/tonne; local briquettes 150 leva/tonne, and imported  coal and briquettes 210 leva/tonne.    It was agreed that value added tax [VAT], introduced on  April  1, should not apply to fixed prices, Nikita Shervashidze,  chairman of the Power Engineering Committee, said after the  government meeting. That is why the government will allocate  2,038 million leva to compensate the electricity supply industry  for losses resulting from the imposition of VAT. In his view,  this financial support is designed to tide the energy sector  over until the introduction of prices and rate schedules that  will allow it to become self-supporting. Power engineering  companies estimate their losses at 2,000 million leva, while  other sectors owe the energy sector some 14,000 million leva,  according to statistics of the Power Engineering Committee.    Heating prices for industrial consumption were also  increased. Suppliers can fix prices according to their  production costs.    The decree envisages sanctions against managers of  enterprises that are behind with their payments. They must pay  their electricity and gas bills before wages are paid to  employees. Those breaking the regulations will be fined up to  10,000 leva.    No agreement was reached with the Finance Ministry on the  enforcement of Council of Ministers' Decree No. 77, under which  payments to the exchequer must precede the payment of wages.  The finance minister and the chairman of the Power Engineering  Committee were assigned to find mutually acceptable solutions.  The introduction of new pricing methods in power engineering is  the key to a lasting solution to its problems. Such a  methodology has been drawn up and will be submitted to the  government for approval. Shervashidze declined to cite new fuel  and electricity prices. He said they would be formed along  market economy principles, depending on the economic situation  and the dollar exchange rate, but mechanisms to cushion the  effect on low-income groups would also be introduced.

This compared with Pounds 15m on Pounds 433.5m in 1992 and Pounds 44.1m on Pounds 403.6m in 1991. But the prospectus warns that comparisons are misleading because of the restructuring of the Northern Ireland electricity industry that occurred in 1992. Restructuring costs also accounted for the low result in 1992. The bulk of the 1993 result came from the transmission and distribution business which contributed Pounds 49.3m. But the company made a Pounds 5.1m loss on its appliance retailing business. In its latest financial year, NIE paid a total dividend of Pounds 16.5m. The directors say that they intend to adopt a 'progressive' dividend policy which, all being well, should produce an increase in real terms. The pathfinder reveals that the government will be taking Pounds 70m of the Pounds 85m of cash currently in NIE's balance sheet as repayment for earlier injections into the company. The government, which will retain a special non-voting share, will also have the right to half of any capital gains on asset sales made by the company over a ten-year period. The NIE issue, which is expected to value the company at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m, will be priced on June 3. Applications for shares must be in by 10am on June 16. The basis of allocation will be announced on June 21 and dealings are expected to commence at the same time. The government is hoping that up to two thirds of the shares will be bought by retail investors. People who register by June 1 will be entitled to one free share for every ten they hold for three years. NIE customers will have the alternative option of electricity vouchers. Over 600,000 people have registered so far. Payment for the shares will be in two instalments, the first on application and the second on June 28 1994. NIE is the last of the state-owned non-nuclear electricity companies to be privatised. Unlike regional companies in England and Wales, it is also in the transmission business, and it has a different regulator.   Companies:-  Northern Ireland Electricity.

Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs identified Norweb, which covers the north-west, as the worst offender when leading Labour's unsuccessful attempts to insert provisions in the Competition and Service (Utilities) Bill for improved consumer safeguards. He said the consumer bodies for the water and telecommunications industries were ineffective and urged the government to make the consumer protection arrangements in the gas industry the model for all the privatised utilities. He said the consumer bodies in the electricity sector were too closely associated with the Office of Electricity Regulation and often resembled 'toothless watchdogs' unable to command action. Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, rejected Labour's view that there should be a clear distinction between consumer bodies and the regulator for the utility concerned. He said: 'In order to have effective regulation you have to have one person or one body which can make a decision.' Commenting on the performance of the privatised electricity companies, Mr Redwood acknowledged that they had done well 'against the background of firm price regulation and control'. He expressed full confidence in the ability of all the regulators to settle complaints on the basis of fair judgment. The Bill was given an unopposed third reading and now goes to the House of Lords. The separation of the British Gas pipe network from its sales and marketing operations and creation of regional gas companies by the end of the decade, were proposed yesterday by the Liberal Democrats. Legislation forcing British Gas to lose 60 per cent of its industrial market share by 1997 was also suggested by Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment spokesman.

The Action Group on Northern Ireland Electricity Prices, which includes many of the larger industries in the province, says the tariff will mean increases of 15 per cent to 20 per cent, in addition to the 18 per cent price differential which exists between Northern Ireland and the mainland. Mr Michael Oliver, manager of Blue Circle's Northern Ireland operations, said: 'We're incensed by this. We cannot understand it in a recession. It can only mean that we shall have to lay people off.' Mr Oliver said he was taking the matter up with the government. The new tariff was approved by Offer, the electricity regulator, as part of the approach to the privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity in November. It was designed to give NIE a sufficient rate of return to reflect the higher cost of power in the province. Electricity has traditionally been more expensive in Northern Ireland because of the shortage of locally produced fuels and its heavy dependence on imported oil. The new pricing formula will, however, oblige NIE to raise its prices at less than the rate of inflation in future. The province's Department of Economic Development said the new tariff would be introduced gradually and would not result in price rises for all consumers. It said some companies, which it declined to name, might see prices fall. Following the sale of Northern Ireland's four power generators earlier this year the forthcoming privatisation will consist of Northern Ireland's power distribution network. It will be sold in one piece and the intention is to introduce more competition in time by linking the province's grid to those of the Irish republic and Scotland.

Sir, Whatever the bullying tactics of mineworkers in the past, it can't make sense to more than halve what remains of the industry. In an island as crowded and as short of natural resources as ours, it is perverse to neglect what we have. Political pundits, electricity generators, shirt-sleeved traders and teenage scribblers justify the prospect by telling us what any fool knows, namely that you can buy fuel cheaply from offshore sources at present. I hope that somebody is considering whether this is still likely to be true in one, five and 20 years' time. Closing mines is not an easily reversible process and I hope we know where our energy will come from if South African coal mines fall into chaos or something blows our oil and gas rigs out of the sea. Quite apart from such strategic risks, there is the mundane consideration that further devaluations of the pound can soon change today's bargain into tomorrow's extortionate price. Such weakening of the currency will be accelerated if we damage the balance of payments by importing yet more of our raw materials. It might be wrong to think that the electricity generators have all this at the front of their minds in deciding what amount of coal to buy in the UK and hence what proportion of the mines will be closed. They have more immediate concerns than this and they know that, in the ultimate, no conceivable UK government can allow electricity generators to founder completely. That is why it was a mistake to privatise them. If one of them takes a short cut to a cost saving, the other will have to do likewise. We can all see short cuts but who can save us from short sight?

0,FT924-946 ,"FT924-946 _AN-CLUB4ACGFT 921221   FT  21 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK Electricity   National Power and PowerGen may view last week's report from the regulator on electricity pool prices as something of a victory. But after a torrid few weeks at the hands of both the regulator and the market, they have reason to be grateful for small mercies. That Professor Littlechild stopped short of suggesting collusion to achieve higher prices is a relief. The conclusion that pool prices are still below the level required to cover the generators' costs should equally take the wind out of complaints from big energy users. Yet the generators can hardly welcome the regulator's pointed reminder that they have too much market power. Although National Power and PowerGen have been cleared of actual misdemeanour, the jury is still out on the wider issue of whether enough competition can be introduced into the generation market to make the current structure acceptable. The decision turns on the impact of independent power producers in limiting the power of the duopoly. That extends beyond the electricity pool. The terms of five-year contracts offered to the regional electricity companies and backed by deals with British Coal are already under Professor Littlechild's microscope. Given the public and political interest, one can hardly believe National Power and PowerGen will allow themselves to be found guilty of abusing market power in this area either. But with the Professor talking of imposing regulation on the generators as an alternative to a Monopolies and Mergers Commission reference, the scope for interference has barely diminished.

Mr Friedhelm Gieske called instead for rapid political agreement on a permitted working life of 35-40 years for the present generation of reactors to give the electricity industry a reliable planning framework for investments. At the same time he warned that failure to allow a new prototype extra-safe reactor to be built in Germany would prevent the country from helping to raise safety standards throughout the world. 'We are inclined to be far more conscious of the risks than we are of the opportunities,' he said. 'If we carry on like this, I am afraid Germany will be gravely weakened as an industrial location.' He was speaking just before negotiations seeking an energy consensus between the government and opposition failed because of disagreement over the long-term nuclear option. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, and Gerhard Schroder, Lower Saxony premier, said they would not be continued in the same form because positions were irreconcilable. In an attempt to head off any rapid move to abandon nuclear energy completely, as proposed by the opposition Social Democratic (SPD) and Green parties, Mr Gieske said that a standstill would be a sensible decision. 'I can personally live very well with a moratorium of several years,' he told RWE's annual news conference. 'This would give us a pause for thought, for a complete rethink.' He said the SPD decision to reject a compromise negotiated by Mr Schroder and Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, was inexplicable. 'That is why I believe that in the short term we will not reach a consensus,' he said. 'But as long as there is still talking, I will not give up hope.' RWE, the largest of Germany's big three electricity utilities, is the least dependent on nuclear energy. But Mr Gieske's paramount demand is for a decision which will simply provide long-term planning certainty. On the issue of nuclear waste reprocessing, the other immediate question needing a political decision, Mr Dietmar Kuhnt, chief executive of RWE Energie, said the company had no plans to pull out of its British and French contracts. Although direct disposal was under political consideration, preceded by 'long-term interim storage' of high-level radioactive waste, such a solution was still illegal.

0,FT911-1013 ,"FT911-1013 _AN-BEIBNAAUFT 910509   FT  09 MAY 91 / Scots power sale takes key step      By JAMES BUXTON   WITH the momentum of a prospectus as big asa telephone directory dropping, the long-awaited privatisation of the two Scottish electricity companies moved towards its crucial phase yesterday. For months, the biggest doubt about the flotation concerned the possibility that the government might call a general election before it could be completed in mid June. Political setbacks for the Conservatives over the past few weeks have virtually eliminated that risk. Although Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, was careful yesterday not to pre-empt the right of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to choose the election date, he expressed the hope that there would be 'no impediment to a successful sale'. The flotation of ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric will complete the privatisation of the electricity industry in Great Britain. Ulster's power industry is to be sold next year. It will also bring to the Stock Exchange two electricity companies that, unlike the generators and regional electricity companies in England, have the appeal of being vertically integrated. They generate, transmit and distribute electricity. Apart from being easier to understand, especially for foreign investors accustomed to it, the vertically integrated structure of the electricity utility makes for more balanced businesses than those of the English companies. ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric can relate their generation activities to established customer markets. Although the two companies compete for large industrial customers with a consumption over 1MW, they also share a balanced mix of generating plant, thanks to pre-privatisation asset swaps and a network of generating contracts between them, as well as supply arrangements with the state-owned Scottish Nuclear. Together they benefit from the substantial past over-investment in generating plant in Scotland, which will make new spending on generating plant unnecessary. As a result, the government is floating them with highly geared debt-to-equity ratios of 51 per cent for Scottish Power and 43 per cent for Scottish Hydro-Electric. That gives them a big surplus of relatively inexpensive power for export to England. to It will become even cheaper when gas from the Miller field in the North Sea comes on stream for Hydro-Electric next year. However the scope for exports is limited by the relatively small size of the interconnector, the power transmission lines linking Scotland with England. Plans to double its size will not come fully into effect until 1995. The flotation is part of the government's policy of increasing share ownership in Scotland, where it has hitherto been relatively low. The incentives for individual investors to apply for shares are biased towards customers of the two companies who need only make a first instalment payment of Pounds 100 and may apply for their own company's shares only. Other individual investors must buy a package of the two companies's shares, likely to be in a ratio of 2 1/2 Scottish Power shares to one share in Hydro-Electric, and make a down payment of Pounds 300. The exact proportions of the package will be fixed when the offer price is decided and the companies go on sales on May 30. The offer is not being underwritten. Instead, the government is following the successful practice applied in February with the English generators and carrying out a book-building exercise among institutions to assess demand at varying prices. It will also market the shares to institutions in Japan, the US, Canada and continental Europe, who are expected to take not more than 15 to 20 per cent of the offer.

Smith, a former general manager of Thorn Lighting who joined ScottishPower in 1990, takes up his new post as chief executive of Fletcher Challenge's utility sector at the end of the month. New Zealand, like Britain, has been deregulating its energy industry and Smith has been given the job of developing Fletcher Challenge's utility operations in New Zealand and globally. Fletcher Challenge grew rapidly during the 1980s but its dependence on cyclical capital intensive industries, such as forest products and oil and gas, has caused problems and it has been selling off assets in order to reduce its gearing. It sold majority control of its New Zealand natural gas utility two years ago. However, the company's fortunes have been recovering and it is understood to be keen to take advantage of the opportunities thrown up by the privatisation of the local electricity business. Smith, who has a marketing background, has been responsible for developing ScottishPower's non-regulated businesses which include CaledonianGas, retail, and electrical contracting. ScottishPower's core business is looking after a large part of Scotland's electricity supply but it has more than doubled its retail outlets, to 155, since privatisation and expanded into supplying natural gas and is moving into telecommunications. Although Smith is said to have done a good job developing ScottishPower's non-core businesses, he was not thought to be the front-runner to take over from Ian Preston, who has headed ScottishPower since before privatisation and is expected to retire next year. Duncan Whyte, a 47-year-old Scot running the core electricity business, is thought to be the most likely internal candidate. Smith said yesterday that thoughts of succession at ScottishPower had not prompted his decision to move to Fletcher Challenge. It is understood that he was partly swayed by family reasons. He is married to an Indonesian and spent six years in that country in the 1970s with Voluntary Service Overseas, Mobil Oil, the Ford Foundation and the World Bank.

0,FT911-3413 ,"FT911-3413 _AN-BDYBFAAFFT 910425   FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (7): New image for state monolith - France, EdF      By WILLIAM DAWKINS      PARIS   THE FRENCH state-owned power utility, Electricite de France is striving to break away from its past as a relic of central industrial control. The group's independent-minded managers are acutely conscious that EdF stands out in a world where governments are tending to withdraw from public utilities. They want to change that image, to help EdF advance in the export markets it sorely needs. After the privatisation and break-up of Britain's electricity industry, EdF is left as the only electricity monopoly in Europe responsible for all of its system, from power generation through to the distribution to customers. It is this strong central organisation, under the continued control of the Industry Ministry, which has allowed EdF to pursue a consistent pro-nuclear investment policy since France's decision to build its own nuclear energy source in the wake of the 1973 oil price crisis. This has left France today more dependent on nuclear power than any country in the world. EdF draws more than 80 per cent of its electricity from its 57 reactors, providing the cheapest electrical power of any European Community country apart from Denmark, a significant advantage for French industry. Yet the French nuclear power programme has been criticised as over-ambitious, having produced a surplus of seven to eight reactors, according to one official report. It attracts sporadic criticism from France's vocal but surprisingly disorganised environmental lobby, although not enough to cast serious doubt on France's nuclear consensus. For these and purely technical reasons, EdF does not plan to increase its proportional dependence on this source of energy, say officials. While the state has reduced its influence on EdF's decisions, as it has across France's nationalised industries, the utility's top managers are beginning to see government control - especially on pricing - as a hindrance to their bid to strengthen EdF as the EC's biggest energy exporter. EdF's cross-border energy sales rose 8 per cent last year to 46.5bn kWh or 12 per cent of the total and the group wishes to raise exports to near 20 per cent of the total by the end of the decade. At the same time, the group aims to play a significant part in the replacement of ageing reactors in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Over the past two years, EdF has delivered a computerised reactor safety monitoring system to the Soviet Union and opened negotiations for joint ventures to build reactors in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It also looks set to emerge in the next few months as the main foreign company to be allocated a stake in eastern Germany's electricity supply industry. The export drive is partly designed to help mop up EdF's nuclear surplus, but also to help run down the FFr226.1bn (Pounds 22.3bn) debt load that EdF has built up as a result of the nuclear programme, and to earn the cash needed to update some of the older reactors. Already, the French utility's international ambitions have caused anxiety in politically influential German coal-producing regions, worried about the threat of cheap imported nuclear electricity accelerating job losses in the mines. And in Britain, EdF's attempts to sell excess power at advantageous rates to industrial customers in France have attracted competitors' suspicion. Mr Jean Bergougnoux, EdF's managing director, points out that it is hard to persuade EC competition authorities that he is not dumping electricity when his government runs a pricing policy that squeezes EdF's profits. 'A company like EdF must have balanced accounts if it is to be perceived as a fair competitor,' he says. In theory, EdF's contract with the Paris government obliges it to hold price rises at 1.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. Yet in practice, the government has, until recently, tended to hold rates lower than that, with the result that EdF has made losses for six out of the past 11 years. The powerful Finance Ministry argues that cheap power helps curb inflation and so supports the value of the franc, an idea which provokes the derision of Mr Pierre Delaporte, EdF's sometimes outspoken chairman. 'If we were convinced that the delay in allowing us to raise our tariffs was necessary to keep the franc safe on the international foreign exchange markets, we would gladly sacrifice on the altar of the fatherland, but we do not believe it for a moment,' he said recently. However, in February, EdF received the go-ahead to increase prices by 2.2 per cent, as against the 2.8 per cent general inflation rate forecast for 1991 - a rise greeted as 'moderate' by Mr Delaporte. Certainly, EdF is gradually beginning to look more like a commercially fair competitor than a state monolith. It is now 10 years since it last received a subsidy from the government. EdF even managed to produce a profit in 1990, partly thanks to an increase in exports and also reflecting the first fruits of a plan to cut costs by FFr1bn. Mr Bergougnoux believes that it is only a matter of time before the rigours of EC competition law force the government to give him a freer hand on prices. As he pointed out in a recent interview: 'European competition will in the end have its effect. Brussels will remind the government that the electricity market will conform to competition rules.'

Based on the ""three  steps"" idea of comrade [Deng] Xiaoping, if we want to build  China up to ""near the economic levels of developed countries,""  besides other conditions, we must have guarantees of energy  resources. Thus, on the basis of China's concrete conditions we  must consider China's energy resource development strategy.    China's characteristics are 1) a large population, and 2)  low  energy resource consumption levels. At present, each person in  the developed countries consumes an average of more than 5 tons  of standard coal a year (the United States has already surpassed  10 tons), whereas China's total energy resource consumption in  1992 was about 1.1 billion tons of standard coal, which when  divided by our population of 1.1 billion gives a per capita  figure of about 1 ton of standard coal. Coal accounts for about  three-fourths of the energy resources we consume.    If an economy is to develop and people's lives are to be  improved, then per capita energy resource consumption must  certainly increase. However, this increase must be restricted by  various factors such as resource and environmental restrictions,  and so on. In another 50 to 60 years, when China's economy  approaches the levels of the developed countries, our population  will have grown to about 1.5 billion. At that time, even if we  do not attain a per capita energy resource consumption of 5 tons  of standard coal but will only reach 3 tons, China's total  energy resource consumption would be 4.5 billion tons of  standard coal. In the present situation in which China only  consumes 1.1 billion tons of standard coal a year, China's  atmospheric discharges of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, carbon  dioxide, and other pollutants have already approached the  amounts discharged in the United States, the world leader. It is  very hard to envisage that in several decades China will be  producing, transporting, and burning several billion tons of  coal because of the serious impact this would have on China's  economy and the atmosphere and environment.    Today, we all live on the earth which we all depend on for  our existence, energy resource development strategies and  policies have now crossed over national boundaries, and they can  affect not just the existence and development of the people of  one's own country but have a worldwide impact as well. Thus,  when we are studying China's energy resource development  strategy, we must look at balancing demand, resources, finances,  and other conditions, and we must strive to maintain equilibrium  among energy resource production and consumption and the ecology  and environment.    Based on this principle, I feel that besides the need to  accelerate the development of conventional energy resources in  the short term, China's energy resource development strategy  should focus on two areas. First, we must adopt important  measures to increase energy resource utilization efficiency, use  our present 1.1 billion tons of standard coal properly, and use  strategy to focus on energy conservation. Second, we must  develop non-polluting renewable energy resources, especially  hydropower, bioenergy, wind energy, and solar energy.    I. Conserve Energy Resources, Increase Energy Resource  Utilization Efficiency    The efficiency of energy resource utilization in China is  rather low at present with an overall efficiency of only about  30 percent, our energy consumption per unit GNP is 6 to 10 times  higher than in the advanced countries, and our energy  consumption to produce a unit of product is 50 to 100 percent  higher than in foreign countries. There is considerable  potential for using our present energy resources well. Thus,  conservation of energy resources is an important national policy  of our country and should be adhered to for a long time. We must  establish laws and regulations regarding energy resource  utilization. In production and consumption, we must make  conserving energy and improving energy resource utilization  efficiency an important standard for checking.    1. We must make macro readjustments in the industrial  structure and product mix and energetically develop those  industries and products with low energy consumption and high  product value. Several large energy-producing provinces (such as  Shanxi and Heilongjiang) in China's interior have energy  consumption per unit of product value more than five times  higher than economically developed provinces along the coast  (such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang), and two of the main reasons are  the significant differences in their industrial structures and  product mixes.    2. We must require that newly-built enterprises and  restaurants, hospitals, schools, residences, and so on conform  to new energy resource consumption standards, have specialized  personnel to conduct energy conservation inspections of these  designs, and not approve the construction of those that do not  meet the standards. We certainly cannot build those that do not  conform to energy conservation standards at the time they are  being built and that will require technical upgrading for energy  conservation after they are placed into use. Rational energy  consumption standards should be formulated for all new  energy-consuming products that go into production such as water  pumps, blowers, electric motors, refrigerators, televisions,  washing machines, and so on, and they should be strictly  examined and we should not permit the production of those that  fail to meet requirements. Those products that are already in  production should attain energy consumption standards within a  limited period of time.    3. We must focus on energy conservation and reducing  consumption in all industries.    In the electric power industry, for example, the average  amount of coal consumed to supply electricity per kWh of power  from thermal power plants in 1992 in China was 420 grams of  standard coal. This was 10 grams lower than in 1990, but it is  just 320 grams in advanced countries like Japan, Italy, and  others, and in the former Soviet Union, because they developed a  large number of heat and power cogeneration plants, the amount  of coal consumed to supply electricity is even lower, just 310  grams per kWh. The former Ministry of Energy Resources pointed  out that the amount of coal consumed to supply electricity in  China's thermal power plants should be reduced from 430 grams in  1990 to 360 grams in 2000, a reduction of 70 grams. At that  time, thermal power in China will generate 1 trillion kWh of  electricity, so this could conserve about 140 million tons of  coal. The 360 gram index is not so high as to be unattainable.  Shitongkou No. 2 Power Plant, imported and built by the Huaneng  Company, has two 600MW generators that only consume 300  grams/kWh to supply electricity. If all of China attained this  level by the 2020s and projecting China's thermal power output  then at 3 trillion kWh, this could conserve 400 million tons of  coal.    The state should formulate a series of policies to spur  energy conservation in the electric power industry. The most  important among them is raising depreciation rates in the  electric power industry to ensure that a power plant's  depreciation capital over 15 years is sufficient to enable it to  replace its equipment. In addition, we must strengthen power  plant management and demand energy conservation results in  management. Enterprises that manufacture power generation  equipment should continually improve design and manufacturing  levels and reduce coal consumption in the power generation  equipment they produce to less than 300 grams within 10 to 20  years.    In another example, developing centralized heat supplies and  heat and power cogeneration is an effective way to raise energy  resource utilization efficiency and conserve energy resources.  China has over 500,000 industrial boilers and heating boilers  that burn up over 400 million tons of coal a year, and each year  we must add small boilers with over 10,000 tons of steam output.  Because the capacity of these boilers is too small, it is very  difficult to achieve automatic coal loading for burning and it  is very hard to attain the design thermal efficiency levels of  large and medium-sized boilers (over 90 percent). The result is  high energy consumption and low thermal efficiency which, added  to the great difficulty in carrying out dust removal in small  boilers, also results in substantial pollution. Even more  regrettable is that because they have users of heat, they  already had good conditions for creating energy conservation and  reducing coal consumption in thermal power plants, but they have  not really been utilized. Currently, the thermal efficiency in  thermal power plants is only about 35 percent, and the main  reason is the presence of unavoidable ""cold-end losses"" in which  nearly 60 percent of the heat energy is discharged into the  atmosphere. If they had users of this heat, they could recover  and utilize these losses to supply heat, which would greatly  increase the overall thermal efficiency. This was what the  former Soviet Union did.    Implementing centralized heat supplies can turn scattered  small boilers into large and medium-sized boilers, which can  raise automatic operating levels, improve boiler efficiency, and  raise dust removal levels. Having larger boilers means higher  steam parameters, and the steam can first be used to generate  electricity and then the steam that generated the electricity  can be supplied to heat users, which means heat and power  cogeneration plants. Calculated and actual results show that  adopting this type of upgrading measure can conserve one-half of  the energy resources. The State Planning Commission's Energy  Conservation Investment Company has conducted experiments at  several sites nationwide with substantial benefits. Dandongbei  Chemical Fiber Plant, for example, replaced over 50 scattered  small boilers with three 70-t powdered coal boilers and replaced  nearly 30 small smokestacks with a large smokestack fitted with  electrical dust removal, and it installed two 12MW back  pressure-type steam turbine generators. This small cogeneration  plant burns the coal from its former 50-plus scattered small  boilers to supply heat and generate an additional 24MW of  electricity, and it can conserve about 50,000 tons of coal a  year while at the same time solving the region's long-term  atmospheric pollution problems.    Experts in China and foreign countries feel that heat and  power cogeneration is an effective energy conservation measure.  The United States originally had not extended cogeneration, but  to raise energy resource utilization efficiency during the  Carter administration it formulated encouragement policies.  Substantial advances in heat and power cogeneration in the  United States during the past 10 years have raised the overall  efficiency of energy resource utilization. To encourage and  support the large number of scattered heat supply small boilers  China now has in upgrading to centralized heat supply and  cogeneration plants to produce both heat and power, the State  should formulate several policies such as having the State  provide more than one-half of the loans for independently built  small cogeneration plants in the investment per kW of installed  generating capacity, allowing the surplus power that is  generated to be sold to power grids at the same price as thermal  power, allowing small cogeneration plants to not participate in  grid peak regulation, and so on.    In summary, there is great potential for using our existing  energy resources well and raising energy resource utilization  efficiency to conserve energy resources. Above, I discussed  examples in two areas, but there are many other large energy  consumers such as the metallurgical industry, chemical industry,  construction materials industry, construction industry, and  others where there is great potential that could be exploited in  the area of raising energy resource utilization efficiency. For  example, the electricity used for lighting in China currently  uses large numbers of incandescent lights, whereas new types of  energy-saving lights can conserve more than 80 percent of the  electricity compared to incandescent lights. If we used new  types of electrical light sources, the amount of electricity  that China would conserve in one year would be equivalent to  adding 20,000MW in installed generating capacity! In another  example, the world's developed and relatively developed  countries all use hollow-core bricks in their structures, which  can conserve electricity by 30 to 40 percent, whereas China  still uses solid-core bricks. For this type of broad-ranging and  mature energy-saving technology, the State should certainly make  the decision to use legislation to extend them and engage in  administrative intervention when necessary.    Conserving energy is a matter for all of us. We must  establish and raise all people's energy conservation  consciousness. Energy conservation should not result in  inconvenience in people's lives but should instead use  improvement of energy resource utilization efficiency and the  establishment of energy-saving industries, an energy-saving  economy, and an energy-saving society to consume the least  possible amount of energy resources to produce the greatest  possible amount of material wealth to make people's lives even  more convenient and attractive.    Conserving energy requires substantial capital inputs. In  the  overall calculation, however, the investment to conserve 1-t of  standard coal is more economical than new construction. The  state should set aside a portion of investments from its  investments in energy resource capital construction for use in  energy conservation. It should also focus on energy conservation  in its technical upgrading investments.    II. We Must Energetically Develop Non-Polluting and  Renewable New Energy Resources    1. Make a major effort to develop hydropower    China has over 600,000MW of theoretical hydropower resource  reserves with 378,000MW that could be developed and used.  Currently, we have developed only 40,680MW and even though we  plan to place 4,000MW into operation during 1993 the extent of  development and utilization is still far from adequate. Thus, we  must accelerate the pace of hydropower construction, adapt to  local conditions, and move forward with large, medium-sized, and  small hydropower stations. First of all, there should be  attraction in policies to give everyone the initiative to invest  in developing hydropower. We must speed up preparatory work,  accelerate the pace of construction, and shorten construction  schedules. In the management system, we must establish the  corresponding development companies based on river basins (such  as the Qing Jiang Development Company) and provide them with  policy support such as permitting the recovery and reloaning of  state investments, etc., to enable them to achieve rolling  development.    2. Extend bioenergy resources    China formerly led the world in developing biogas but  because  of the effects of the small-scale agricultural economy, with  each household building its own small pit, the gas production  efficiency is low and the intensity of labor is great, so they  have developed slowly. Holland's recent experience in building  large biogas pits on cattle farms and using heating and mixing  technology can increase gas output by a factor of three and  produce gas year-round, with the biogas being used to generate  electricity. We should adopt advanced technology, increase the  scale and mechanization levels of biogas construction, and  achieve industrialized production.    China produces over 600 million tons of crop straw each  year.  The current direction is ammoniation of straw, utilizing the  vitamins and proteins in the straw to raise cattle, sheep, and  hogs, and using livestock wastes as a biogas raw material to  produce biogas. Biogas production only utilizes the carbon and  hydrogen contained in the straw, while the dregs retain the  nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other elements in the  straw. This could be an important strategic measure in  development of the rural economy, and I propose that the State  might as well work on ""straw engineering."" There is also  abundant grass, stalks, leaves, organic wastes, and so on that  can be used as raw material for producing biogas.    Developing new types of biogas pits is an important way to  provide energy resources to rural areas and they can be  developed by adapting to local conditions in cities and  townships. This is a good arrangement for dealing with excrement  and garbage in an energy-saving society. Moreover, enterprises  that generate organic residues and waste liquids can establish  new types of high efficiency biogas pits to obtain energy  resources and improve the environment.    Another way to utilize bioenergy is using agricultural  products to produce alcohol, and some countries are now  conducting experiments. There are also prospects for using wood  chips, bagasse, fruits, tubers, and so on to produce alcohol for  use as an automobile fuel.    3. Make major efforts to develop wind energy    Wind energy is one of China's big advantages. Tests done  over  many years by meteorological stations indicate that China has  over 400,000MW of usable wind energy, distributed mostly along  the coast and in the wind energy belt running from Xinjiang  through Inner Mongolia to northeast China.    Wind-powered electricity generation is simple and does not  pollute the environment. It is receiving attention in a growing  number of countries like the United States, England, Denmark,  Holland, India, and other countries where it has developed very  rapidly in recent years. China has worked on small (200 to 300  W) wind-powered generators for several years and now has a  foundation. We have now extended more than 100,000 units which  have partially solved the electricity supply problems for  lighting and television of grasslands pastoralists with very  good results. However, China's development and utilization of  wind energy as a proportion of our energy resource consumption  is miniscule, and we should develop it quickly to gradually turn  it into a force in our energy resources.    Currently, the main problem in energetically extending  wind-powered electricity generation is that the technology for  large and medium-sized wind-powered generators in China is not  mature and our equipment must rely on imports, so manufacturing  costs are high. We must import internationally mature technology  such as large wind-powered generators with unit capacities of  200 to 400 kW and organize large batch domestic production. It  is entirely possible to reduce the manufacturing costs per unit  kW to the present level for hydropower construction. All  countries of the world have adopted preferential policies for  developing wind energy such as tax exemptions, allowing the  electricity that is generated to be supplied to grids, providing  electricity prices that permit repayment of the principal and  interest, and so on, and China should do this too.    4. Develop and utilize solar energy    Solar energy is a very clean energy resource. It can be said  that China is also very rich in solar energy. China's average  annual sunshine time is more than 2,600 hours, and some regions  (such as northwest China and Tibet) have sunshine times of more  than 3,000 hours. It we use it to generate electricity, we could  generate it for as many hours as hydropower does on the average  in China. There is still no scientific figure for the usable  amount of solar energy that China has, but it certainly is  greater than hydropower and wind energy.    During the past several years China has made many advances  in  the area of utilizing solar energy, mainly in the areas of  building greenhouses to produce vegetables and using solar  energy to produce hot water, but we only have a few trial  projects to use solar energy to generate electricity.    Foreign countries have done a great deal of research and  experimental work in recent years on utilizing solar energy to  generate electricity and they have made significant advances and  substantially reduced the costs of power generation. They have  progressed from monocrystalline to polycrystalline silicon and  developed from polycrystalline silicon to non-crystalline  silicon and recently have also developed to crystal plated film,  and the photovoltaic conversion efficiency has risen from a few  percent to over 10 percent. Now the total investment cost has  dropped to $1,000-plus per kW. As the technology advances,  developing solar-powered electricity generation in large amounts  will become a possibility. In this field, we should organize  scientific research forces, closely track advanced steps in the  world, and prepare to make solar energy an important force in  China's energy resources.    We should also do some research and experimental work in the  areas of using solar energy for structural heating and supplying  residential hot water. We should further improve utilization  efficiency and solve the technical problems of using solar  energy during the winter.    5. Develop hydrogen energy and other renewable energy  resources    There are huge reserves of hydrogen. All countries in the  world are now doing research on ways to economically produce  hydrogen. Chemical methods can be used to produce hydrogen, and  solar energy and surplus hydropower can be used to produce  hydrogen. Breakthroughs in this area could provide us with clean  and huge reserves of hydrogen. China should also undertake  research in this area.    Geothermal resources are relatively abundant in many  locations in China, and ways to further develop and utilize them  in a planned manner should receive our attention.    There is also tidal energy, wave energy, and so on that can  be developed and utilized in adaptation to local conditions.    6. Accelerate the development of nuclear power    It should be said that nuclear power is also a clean energy  resource. The world has now completed 424 nuclear power reactors  and the safety problems and technology that worry people have  now been guaranteed. Moreover, new types of nuclear power plants  are now being developed that can be made even safer. In coastal  regions, if we fail to develop nuclear power in the long term I  fear that we will be unable to solve their power supply problems  in economic development.    Because purchasing nuclear power equipment from foreign  countries is expensive (the investment in the two 900MW  generators at Daya Bay is more than $4.1 billion), we will be  able to develop it on a larger scale when we can do our own  manufacturing. Nuclear power has made progress in China in  recent years, but for various reasons the progress is too slow  and Korea, which does not have the machinery industry that China  does, has caught up with us.    In summary, a correct energy resource development strategy  will affect China's economic development and affect the lives of  every one of our citizens. I hope that experts in this area can  all participate in research and discussion on China's energy  resource development strategy, draw on collective wisdom and  absorb all useful ideas to form correct policies, and include  them in the state's economic and social development strategy and  programs so that all industries, all departments, and all  regions can implement them.

The Noffo, as it is known, obliges electricity companies to buy some of their power from generation sources other than coal, oil or gas, and it finances the extra cost by imposing a levy, currently 10 per cent, on electricity bills. Although the greatest proportion of the levy goes to the nuclear power industry, about Pounds 20m a year is available to support 'green' energy. The money is allocated through a combination of competitive bidding by applicants and ministerial judgments. By all accounts, the new Noffo round will be heavily oversubscribed. Applicants are proposing a variety of projects ranging from solar and tidal power to landfill gas and coppicing. But the most numerous contenders by far are wind farms. In the past, the subsidy has been seen as a benign element in a worthy environmental cause. But this time it coincides with an upsurge of public concern about the proliferation of wind farms in some of the country's most beautiful landscapes. The allocation of contracts will therefore be subject to close public scrutiny. Contrary to the impression environmentalists would like to convey, the case for renewable energy is not very strong. There is no shortage of energy (the UK's oil and gas reserves continue to grow, and output is about to set new records), and there is little domestic technology to protect. The environmental argument carries some weight, but far greater gains could be achieved by raising the performance of existing plant than by encouraging uneconomic green projects. An efficiency gain of only 3 per cent in energy use would save more electricity than could be produced from all the renewable energy sources likely to be up and running by the year 2000 - and would avoid the visual blight of much green power. Unfortunately, Noffo money can only be spent on renewables. There is some consolation in the fact that the system of competitive bidding is a spur to efficiency. But since the government sees Noffo as a talisman of its commitment to environmental matters, there is doubt about the rigour with which it vets the projects which come before it. The only justification for subsidising any power project, renewable or otherwise, is if it can stand on its own feet within an acceptable time frame. The taxpayer owes no favours to green power.

The delay would jeopardise the development of four offshore oil and gas fields which are to supply the station. Any move against gas would spark a storm of protest and possibly legal actions against the government, which has previously shown strong support for diversification out of coal-fired electricity. The government is struggling to find a way of preserving enough of the 31 threatened coal mines to satisfy backbenchers. Difficulties in negotiations with the main power generators appear to have prompted Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to reassess previously rejected options for expanding the market for domestic coal. These include restricting the operation of new gas-fired power stations and tinkering with arrangements under which Britain imports nuclear-generated electricity from France. The government's problems have delayed publication of a white paper on the subject, which was originally due to appear last month. The cabinet committee dealing with coal is understood not to be meeting for the time being. Whitehall sources say the government has decided that it will allow PowerGen, the electricity generator, to go ahead with the Connah's Quay project. But it may want a two-year delay in construction, initially planned to start this year. This would mean that the plant would start producing electricity in 1998, when the coal contracts now under discussion expire. Connah's Quay will have the capacity to produce 1,350 MW, the equivalent of 4m tonnes of coal a year. PowerGen has told the government that a delay would be unacceptable to it and to Hamilton Oil and Gas, Monument and Lasmo, developers of the Liverpool Bay oil and gas field which will supply Connah's Quay. Mr Charles Howson, external affairs manager at Hamilton, said a two-year delay could 'jeopardise the whole economics of the project'. The project's partners have invested more than Pounds 70m in preparing for development of the offshore fields. The project would create some 4,000 jobs in the depressed north Wales area. Mr Tony Craven-Walker, managing director of Monument, said government interference in the project would place a question mark over the economics of oil and gas investment in the UK. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, has promised to raise the matter with Mr Heseltine following repeated requests from Mr Barry Porter, Tory MP for Wirral South.

Mr George Squair, chairman, said that the rebate and recommended 17 per cent dividend increase 'provide evidence that privatisation can bring benefits to shareholders and customers alike'. Seeboard's pre-tax profits for the year ending March 31 were Pounds 98.4m, up 45 per cent from the Pounds 67.8m given in the pro forma accounts for last year's privatisation. This amounted to earnings per share of 53.5p, up from 36.5p. The company's mainstream business continued to grow despite the recession. Electricity distributed rose by 1.4 per cent, and the average tariff increase amounted to 1.9 per cent. The distribution business made a profit of Pounds 91.5m, up from Pounds 64.2m. Controllable costs were reduced by 3.6 per cent. The supply business made a profit of Pounds 4.3m, down from Pounds 7.2m because of the squeeze on margins. Seeboard has regained 31 large industrial customers in its area, but Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive, stressed that Seeboard only accepted business in this market if it was profitable. The non-regulated businesses saw their contribution fall from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 2m because of the recession. Retailing turnover was up 11 per cent to more than Pounds 50m, and electrical contracting work rose to Pounds 26m, up 15 per cent. Seeboard is also expanding into the power generation and gas distribution business. Seeboard's dividend increase is the largest so far proposed in this round of electricity results. The final pay-out will be 12.25p making a total dividend of 17.25p. Dividend cover increased from 2.5 to 3.1. Mr Ellis said the result pointed to an underlying growth in the business of about 1 per cent. Mr Squair, who will be succeeded by Sir Keith Stuart in September, said: 'Seeboard has come through the testing initial period which followed flotation with flying colours.' COMMENT The Pounds 10 rebate - which will cost Seeboard about Pounds 20m - will be seen as a stunt to deflect attention from high profits and the most handsome dividend increase seen in the sector so far. But the real reason is the regulatory system which requires regional electricity companies to set their tariffs on the basis of forecasts of costs rather than past history, and Seeboard overestimated them. Even so, this is one of the best electricity company results to date, showing underlying growth and a well covered dividend. The stock market seemed to think Seeboard's concern for its customers is good for business: the share price rose a few pence to 330p where the yield is 5 per cent, one of the lowest in the sector.

0,FT922-14927 ,"FT922-14927 _AN-CDCA8AEXFT 920403   FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Approaches to the future from opposite poles  -The Issues, Energy      By DAVID LASCELLES   ENTIRE government departments are seldom at risk during elections. But the Department of Energy's future depends on next week's poll. The Tories have threatened to wind the department up for good and all if they win, believing it has outlived its usefulness. Labour will keep the department because they think there is still much to be done on the energy front. This shows how far apart the main parties are on energy. The Tories are committed to creating a free market in power and fuel which will remove any need for a central bureaucracy. They have handed the gas and electricity industries over to Sid. If they survive to see through their planned early sell-off of British Coal, all that will be left in state ownership is the nuclear power industry, which is due for review in 1994. But the story is not as close to its end as the Tories suggest. Recently there has been growing reaction to the consequences of privatisation, in particular the near-monopolies in power generation and gas and the strong influence they have on energy prices. A future Tory government could face pressure to break these organisations up further. Allied to this is the question of whether the regulators are proving effective enough in keeping the utilities up to the mark. The Tories are promising to attack anti-competitive behaviour 'with vigour' and introduce new legislation to deal with cartels. Labour intends to take a more interventionist line. Much of its policy is based on the party's commitment to saving the coal industry which it sees playing a key role in a national energy policy. This would mean guaranteeing a price for coal supplies and banning coal imports, which would save jobs but might also entail higher electricity bills. Although Labour has given up any idea of renationalising the electricity industry it would 'restore public control' of National Grid in order to reassert government power over electricity supplies. But it is not clear quite what this means. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, seems to have backed off from a commitment to renationalise the grid. Labour would try to husband North Sea oil and gas reserves by measures to encourage more efficient recovery from undersea wells, and put a brake on the 'dash for gas' which is leading to the construction of a wave of possibly unnecessary gas-fired stations. One of the biggest areas of uncertainty is nuclear power. The Tories are being cautiously non-committal. Their manifesto stresses 'safe and economical nuclear power', with safeguards for the management of nuclear waste. Labour would complete the one nuclear station still under construction - Sizewell B in Suffolk - but would build no more and would allow the industry to wither away. The Liberal Democrats take the strongest line. They would stop Sizewell immediately and phase out all nuclear power by 2020. They also support proposals for an EC energy tax - something that neither the Tories nor Labour are keen on. If the Lib Dems got the energy portfolio in a coalition government they could have quite an impact. Whichever party wins, we shall be hearing much more about energy efficiency, both to save fuel and to spare the environment. The Tories will set up an independent energy savings trust to promote energy efficiency, and there may also be new building regulations to improve energy use. Labour goes one better: it will set up two new agencies, one for energy efficiency, one for renewable energy. But it will also require gas and electricity companies to play a leading role in promoting insulation and energy saving.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "
0,FT923-4433 ,"FT923-4433 _AN-CIGBWACHFT 920907   FT  07 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Nukes and taxes      SUBSIDIES AND distortion are deeply rooted in energy markets   the legacy of attempts by successive governments to promote particular types of fuel. The nuclear levy is one of the most costly such distortions, and it was right of Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to draw attention to it last week. At Pounds 1.3bn a year, it amounts to a large hidden tax on electricity consumers in England and Wales, and puts a questionable burden on industry. But it is not so easy to argue that it should be abolished. Virtually all of it goes to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company which operates the 12 nuclear power stations in England and Wales. The money will pay for the decommissioning of stations when they come to the end of their lives. The essential question is whether decommissioning costs are a legacy of bygone policies and should therefore be borne by the government and so by all taxpayers or whether they should be treated as a direct production cost of electricity for which the present-day consumer should pay. It is evident that the Treasury will not rush to replace a levy which few people even know about with a more open tax, so reform will be resisted in that quarter. Furthermore, there are already plans to phase the levy out by 1997, so there is a case for leaving existing arrangements undisturbed. But there are other considerations, not least the imminent privatisation of British Coal. The ending of effective subsidies to the coal mining industry through artificial long-term coal contract prices will leave Nuclear Electric with very special advantages which are hard to justify. Aside from the levy, NE enjoys priority access to supplying the electricity grid because nuclear generators cannot be switched on and off as easily as other sources. Far better to draw a line under old policies and reconstitute Nuclear Electric in such a way that it can operate as a free-standing commercial enterprise. This would entail making a distinction between the declining Magnox power stations which Nuclear Electric inherited and those which form part of its new commercial strategy. The cost of decommissioning the former would be borne by the exchequer, the latter out of NE's operating profits, which are growing. Proposals for new nuclear stations would be assessed economically on the basis of all their costs, including decommissioning. Aside from creating a more level playing field in the energy market, this arrangement would also shape the right setting for a government review of the nuclear power industry in 1994. Scottish Nuclear, which owns Scotland's two nuclear power stations, does not benefit from the levy. The sooner Nuclear Electric can be viewed as a commercial rather than a subsidised concern, the more likely that sensible decisions about the longer-term prospects for nuclear power can be made.

0,FT924-10768 ,"FT924-10768 _AN-CJ2B8ADUFT 921029   FT  29 OCT 92 / Leading Article: In search of an energy policy   IN ITS panicked response to the furore over its plans to close 31 coal mines, the government has opened what amounts to a review of its entire energy policy. Simultaneously, the Commons trade and industry committee will also conduct an equally wide-ranging inquiry of its own. Both these investigations are intended to be complete by the end of the year, a timescale which can only be described as optimistic, given the variety of views they will have to consider. The threat to 30,000 miners' jobs has stimulated calls, some from surprising political quarters, for what amounts to a planned economy in energy. So far, the government has made a poor fist of setting out the market-led alternative. It would be helpful if the committee and the government were to establish a few ground rules. The first should be that there is no question of going back to state ownership of the gas and electricity industries. No one should forget that it was under state control that Britain made a series of unforced blunders about nuclear energy, about overall capacity in electricity generation and in coal, whose future was repeatedly misjudged. This is not to say that the privatised alternative provides a complete answer. Privatisation of both gas and electricity was badly executed, resulting in a private monopoly in gas, now the subject of a monopolies commission investigation, and a duopoly in national electric power generation, buttressed by regional monopolies in supply. Even those who believe that these problems are best addressed by increasing competition must acknowledge that they will always fall far short of perfect markets. Gas and electricity will probably always need a regulator. The immediate cause of the coal debacle, apart from the presentational errors, is the fact that gas and electricity regulation has not evolved rapidly enough for anyone to be confident that generators are making economically optimal decisions in favour of gas-fired power stations. Since, in addition, electricity consumers are required to subsidise nuclear power and other non-fossil fuels, it is clear that the case against the 31 coalmines has been inadequately made. This is so even though it is also true that there is no commercially viable market for the threatened pits' output if the national generators wish to slash their coal-burn in new contracts from next April. Mr Heseltine has revealed that he considered intervening in these contract negotiations to require higher coal consumption but that this was against the law. This is not a law the government would be wise to change so long as it wishes to retain credibility for its privatisation strategy. What is clear, however, is that the regulatory mechanism in these industries, especially in electricity, is not yet working sufficiently well for people to be confident that prices and investments are being decided in as rational a fashion as is possible. Only when regulation of this quality has been achieved will customers and shareholders know whether they are being treated fairly and the generators themselves have a sound basis for determining their fuel purchase and investment strategies. Also, without such information, government will be unable to calculate the cost of subsidising any given fuel, for social, technological or environmental reasons. It would be sensible for both inquiries to focus upon this complex but essential matter.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "

Today, I want to talk about an  issue that has no relation to day-to-day politics. Democracy  does not just mean a war to secure power. The country has  witnessed enough of the tussle for power. The people are fed up  with this tussle. That is why the people elected a popular  government in the most free and fair elections in the history of  the nation. The people voted in favor of political stability,  and they want to see changes in their lives. They want  prosperity for their children. God willing, your government will  provide this prosperity.    There were people who forgot the poor masses in the tussle  for power. This could not continue for long. The country was  faced with severe difficulties when we assumed office. We took  the steps to speedily overcome these difficulties. Political  independence is incomplete if the economic difficulties remain  unsolved. We have to work for the people's economic stability  so as to maintain our political independence. We have to make  our people satisfied and prosperous.    It is not possible to bring about economic prosperity merely  by the government wishing to do so. It cannot be realized by  merely providing a legal infrastructure. It cannot be possible  merely through deregulation. A strong infrastructure needs to  be built to achieve this objective, and the most important  component of this infrastructure is energy. The Water and Power  Development Authority [WAPDA] is practicing power-load shedding  due to the deficit in power generation during the last few  years. Fifteen or 16 years ago, people did not even know what  load-shedding was. Now, it has become a routine affair. There  are power outages for several hours daily in cities and  villages. In rural areas, sometimes there is no power for  several days. Factories have been closed in urban areas due to  the lack of power, thereby leading to lower industrial  production. In rural areas, the irrigation tube wells cannot be  operated due to load-shedding, thereby affecting agricultural  output.    On the one hand, there was no increase in power production  during the past few years, while on the other, demand kept  increasing by 12 percent annually. The country is currently  facing a deficit of nearly 2,000 megawatts of power. Urgent  steps are needed to meet the demand for power and to stop the  load-shedding. If we fail to do so, then it will shatter all  our dreams of economic development and we will be lost in a  blind alley.    Incorrect policies of the past are the main reasons behind  this serious crisis. Special attention was paid to power  production during the first tenure of the popular government.  Work was going on with full speed on huge hydroelectric and  thermal power projects to meet the increasing demand. There  were the big projects such as the Mangla and Tarbela power  plants and the Guddu thermal power station. This doubled  electric production within the short period of five years.  Attention from these developmental activities was diverted when  Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's elected democratic  government was toppled. Work on oil and gas exploration came to  a standstill. No new hydroelectric power projects were started.  The result was that the country faced an acute power shortage  after 1982 and the whole country kept sinking in the darkness.    When we assumed office the last time in 1988, we  wholeheartedly tried to deal with this situation. We designated  billions of rupees in the budget for the power sector and  started a number of new projects. We concluded agreements with  France and the PRC to set up nuclear power plants. We tried to  mobilize resources for power and oil and gas production with the  cooperation of the private sector, and in December 1989 we  concluded an initial agreement on the Hab project. The popular  government was relieved of office by a conspiracy in August  1990. The agreement with France on the nuclear power plant also  ended as soon as the new government took over and no progress  could be made on the Hub project. Projects were started based  on the wrong priorities. The delay of only three years in  executing these projects has caused a loss of 35 billion rupees  to the national exchequer.    Wrong priorities resulted in great deterioration of the  energy situation. Immediately after coming to power, I decided  to set up a task force on energy to deal with the situation. In  addition, I have taken some more important rapid steps without  waiting for the recommendations of the task force. They include  the decision to launch the Ghazi-Barotha hydroelectric power  project costing more than 70 billion rupees and the Hab project  in the private sector at a cost of more than 50 billion rupees.  The swift government action in making decisions can be  understood from the fact that the heads of delegations from 45  international banks, which provide financial assistance to the  Hab project, said that the progress achieved within two weeks is  greater than that of the past three years.    Now, the task force on energy has submitted its  recommendations for a new energy policy and the federal cabinet  has approved them. This is the first time in the history of  Pakistan that the government has formulated an integrated  policy. Under this policy, there will be balance in the  development of the oil, gas, coal, and hydroelectric sectors.  Over the next five years, more than 700 billion rupees will be  needed for power generation and oil and gas exploration. The  government can invest 330 billion rupees of this, but we will  have to find the remainder through private sector investment.  In order to create interest in power generation and oil and gas  exploration within the private sector, we are announcing some  major incentives.    The government has decided to purchase electricity from  private investors at the rate of 6.5 cents per kilowatt. This  price is the most attractive in the entire region, which will  provide a great incentive to the private sector in power  generation. Investors who complete power plants within three  years will receive a special premium. This concession is to  encourage private investors to complete power plants as soon as  possible. Power projects have been totally exempted from  surcharges on education and flood relief. The import license  fee has also been completely waived. Until now, the private  sector was hesitant to invest in power generation projects as  they took a considerable amount of time to enter into various  agreements with the government. Your government has  standardized all these conditions. Now private investors will  have no difficulty in signing agreements with the government.  In a like manner, these incentives will certainly draw the  attention of foreign investors.    The situation now is that without taking revolutionary and  drastic steps, it is impossible to overcome power outages. This  crisis cannot be overcome simply by starting up new power  projects. In addition to this, we should also strictly control  waste, theft, and the nonproductive of electricity. We will  launch a major program of demand regulation [preceding two words  in English]. Under this program, the waste of electricity will  be reduced. The pilferers will be identified through computers  and legislation will be enacted under which they will be liable  for imprisonment up to five years and heavy penalties.    A five-year plan has been prepared for this purpose. Under  this plan, consumers will be provided with a new kind of meter.  The consumers will be encouraged to use fluorescent lights  rather than incandescent bulbs. It will not only greatly reduce  electricity bills for consumers, but also immensely reduce the  load on the WAPDA systems. In order to reduce the demand for  electricity in the evenings, a new scheme has been prepared.  Under this scheme, the electricity tariff will be calculated  according to the amount of time a consumer uses electricity. A  process of providing off-peak [preceding word in English] power  to tube wells will begin. All these measures will reduce  government expenditure on electricity generation by 11.5 billion  rupees annually. At the same time, the difference in the demand  and supply of electricity will be reduced to a point where  load-shedding will be nominal, God willing, in three years.    Likewise, in order to slow the excessive consumption of oil  in the transportation sector, some steps of fundamental  importance also have been proposed. Currently, oil imports are  45 billion rupees annually and the bill increases by 10 percent  every year. More than half of this fuel is used in  transportation. During the past few years, emphasis was placed  on importing new and old motor vehicles instead of trains, large  buses, and mass transit facilities which caused an unrestrained  increase in the consumption of oil, besides creating serious  traffic and pollution problems. We have, therefore, decided to  develop such means of transportation, especially in major  cities, which will reduce the level of pollution and traffic  congestion on streets and also slow the undue consumption of  oil. About 90,000 new engineers, technicians, and skilled  workers will be required to translate all these programs into  action, which will in turn create new avenues of employment.  Some long-term policies have also been prepared for the  development of the energy sector, which include construction of  hydroelectric and coal-operated power plants, local manufacture  of generators and transmission equipment, and accessories.    Dear brothers and sisters, the people's government has come  into power by virtue of your votes and blessings. We have to  fulfill your dreams and aspirations. When there is no light in  a poor man's house, when factories are closed due to the lack of  electricity and gas, the movement of the glittering yellow taxis  on the six-lane highways cannot be described as the sign of  development. The days of amusing the nation with games and  pageantries are over. Now is the time for hard work and wise  decisions. We must not waste this opportunity, otherwise, in  the words of the poet Iqbal, may God forbid, our story will fail  to be recorded in the annals of history. Let us make  whole-hearted and sincere efforts for the success of the new  energy policy, so that our dreams of development and progress  within five to seven years are fulfilled with Pakistan entering  the 21st century as a strong country and our hard-working people  sharing equally the fruits of development, God willing. Long  Live Pakistan.     "

Like most other plants recently opened or under construction in the UK, Rye House generates electricity from gas. The arrival of combined-cycle gas stations is one of the main factors in the decline in demand for coal and the subsequent pit closures. PowerGen alone has a programme to build 3,000MW of combined-cycle gas turbine plants. Rye House, built at a cost of Pounds 240m, provides about 700MW. The company has already opened a plant in Killingholme, Humberside, and a third station, at Deeside, north Wales, is due to open in 1996. Both PowerGen and National Power, the other large generator, point to reduced carbon dioxide and sulphur emissions as an incentive to build gas stations. Electricity privatisation critics say generators also want to obstruct independent companies from generating power from gas.

Coal is falling from fashion - and production is down - in most European countries as concerns grow about the effects on the environment of the sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide it emits when burned. Some power generators such as those in the UK are turning to gas as an alternative fuel source for power generation and others will follow their lead as international pollution standards are tightened. But that may provide a relatively short-term solution. Whereas there are plentiful supplies of coal worldwide, there is less certainty about gas, as its price is likely to rise. In any case, some countries have limited access to gas. With the building of nuclear plants politically difficult they want to maximise the possibilities for coal. Clean coal technologies such as those used in the Elcogas project at Puertollano, 200 km south of Madrid, is one way of doing this. Elcogas is a joint venture between 11 European power and engineering companies - Endesa of Spain and four other Spanish power groups (53 per cent of the equity), Electricite de France (29 per cent), Electricidade de Portugal (4 per cent), Enel of Italy (4 per cent), National Power of the UK (4 per cent) and technology suppliers Babcock Wilcox Siemens and Krupp Koppers - to build what they say is the world's largest and most advanced clean coal power generation project. It will use a technology known as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle. Under this, coal is pulverised to a fine powder and then passed into a pressure vessel where it reacts with oxygen to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Unwanted components are washed out of the gas which is then used to generate electricity in a combined cycle turbine of the type behind the growth of gas in power generation in recent years. The technology enables coal of any quality to be used for electricity generation at efficiencies of about 45 per cent, compared with about 40 per cent at an existing large coal-fired power station. In addition it will remove 99 per cent of the coal's sulphur and refine it to a high level of purity so that it can be sold for use in the chemical industry. According to the project participants, it produces only a quarter of the emissions of oxides of nitrogen and 15 per cent of the dust emissions of a conventional UK coal-fired plant fitted with dust control burners. The companies recently signed the financial deal that will secure the development of the Pounds 450m plant; construction is already under way. The plant will start operating in 1996, fuelled initially by natural gas but by coal in the following year. IGCC is more expensive than most other technologies, which means it is a long way from being commercially attractive in markets such as the UK which have moved a considerable way down the competition road. National Power says that taking into account both capital and fuel costs, a unit of power could be produced from an IGCC plant in the UK at 5.2p. That compares with 4p for a unit from a new coal-fired plant filled with emmission control equipment and 2.7p from a combined cycle gas turbine plant of the type the company operates in the UK. But from National Power's and other participants' point of view, the beauty of Elcogas is that it is extremely unlikely to lose them money. One reason is that the project has received a subsidy of about Pounds 50m from the European Union's Thermie fund to promote clean combustion technologies for coal and other solid fuels. But the main bonus of Elcogas is that the Spanish electricity system, encouraged by a government keen to find a use for Spanish coal, guarantees a financial return for the project, provided it produces the expected amount of electricity. There is little to suggest that production expectations will not be met since the IGCC technology has been successfully tested at other, if smaller, plants run by the petroleum industry. Shell has been at the forefront of IGCC technology and it is showing its confidence in it by building a large plant in the Netherlands. Carlos Lopez-Cacicedo, National Power's director of research and engineering, said his company had considered a number of clean coal technology schemes but that none had provided Elcogas's combination of low risk and advanced technology. 'This is the best technology which exists and we can be confident of getting a return on our investment, even if it is modest,' he said. Lopez-Cacicedo said it was unlikely that IGCC could become fully competitive in the short term but tightening environmental controls and pressure on gas prices beyond the turn of the century could change this position. 'It could just be coal's way back into the power generation market in the early part of the next century.'   Companies:-  Elcogas.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

Under one option companies that failed to meet such targets might be forced to charge lower prices for their electricity or suffer restrictions on the returns they are allowed to make. In the shorter term, companies that did not achieve adequate results in the specific area of home insulation might be threatened with sanctions including the loss of their licences. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, said: 'We will need to look in great detail at how we best benefit the customers and save energy by changing the operational and financial regime.' Labour is studying attempts by US regulators in Wisconsin and elsewhere to encourage energy conservation. In 1987, state regulators offered the Wisconsin Electric Power Company an additional return if it could cut demand by a stipulated amount over two years. In a continuation of the programme a further return was offered in ex-change for fresh reductions. Wisconsin also offered consumers both rebates for purchasing energy efficient appliances and incentives for turning in old, inefficient ones. Labour is committed to prioritising a 'hugely in-creased' programme of energy conservation and efficiency. It has pledged to establish new commissions for the main utilities which will have greater powers than the current regulatory bodies. Scare stories about the threat of global warming could wreck moves to curb more serious pollution risks, an academic warned yesterday. Professor David Bowen, director of the Institute of Earth Studies at University College of Wales, said it was unrealistic for politicians, the public and the media to think global warming was happening now. 'Great harm had been done . . . it is regrettable that global warming was ever identified as the key issue,' he said. 'Far more important is the pollution of the atmosphere, oceans, rivers and countryside, about which scientists and policy makers must agree policies urgently.'  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Officials at Thyssen, the largest steel group in Germany, said the decision was purely political and would run against the European Union's efforts to reduce overcapacity in the European steel industry. Klockner-Werke decided yesterday to sell 75 per cent of its integrated steel mill in Bremen for a symbolic DM1 each to four local companies. These include Hiberg, a state-owned holding company, the Bremer Vulkan shipyards, Hegemann, a company manufacturing shipping equipment and the city's electricity utility. The Bremen government plans to keep the loss-making steel mill open with its current crude steel capacity of around 3m tonnes. It will privatise part of the profitable electricity utility to raise funds and inject DM200m in the steel mill.

0,FT942-10006 ,"FT942-10006 _AN-EELCZAF0FT 940512   FT  12 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany wrestles with energy puzzle - The problems posed by deregulation plans      By JUDY DEMPSEY   After introducing virtual monopoly structures in eastern Germany's gas and electricity sector, western Germany's utilities are now embarking on another task: finding ways to protect their position against plans by the federal government in Bonn and the European Union to deregulate the energy sector. Yesterday the EU's working party on energy met to prepare a draft paper on deregulation of the energy sector, which is expected to be presented on May 25. At the same time, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics ministry, is planning to use the German presidency, starting on July 1, to open up Germany's energy sector to more competition. Mr Rexrodt has already outlined his proposals for the revision of energy policy and cartel legislation. They include the abolition of voluntary demarcation agreements and franchise agreements with utilities and local authorities; the introduction of third party access to gas grids; and cost transparency. One of his aims is to make Germany more attractive to investors. But this would also mean eventually phasing out the Kohlpfennig, a levy paid by western German customers to the electricity companies to subsidise the coal industry. At the moment, the Kohlpfennig subsidises German coal by about DM200 (Pounds 80) a tonne to keep out coal imports, which cost about DM80 a tonne. As a result electricity prices for German industry are among the highest in Europe. Yet Mr Rexrodt, especially in an election year, cannot scrap the Kohlpfennig, which would threaten 100,000 mining jobs. So far, Mr Rexrodt's proposals for deregulation have been sharply criticised by the opposition Social Democrats and the country's powerful energy sector. Mr Martin Weyand, head of the energy department at BGW, Germany's association for Gas and Water, says they are flawed for several reasons. 'There is no reciprocity,' he argues, adding that foreign companies would be able to supply the German market but German suppliers would not have access to foreign markets. The BGW also believes that long-term supply contracts with high take-or-pay obligations would be replaced by short-term contracts, which would not guarantee secure supplies. It argues too that the obligation to connect customers and guarantee supply would no longer be met. And finally, the BGW says it is not clear how private investors, who built the grids in the first place, would be compensated for the use of their property and services. Yet the BGW and the German utilities, including RWE and PreussenElektra, recognise that the debate over de-regulation of the energy sector is now firmly on the agenda in Bonn, and in Brussels. The question is how the utilities will be able to maintain a position giving them exclusive demarcation rights on distribution and supply. 'The Rexrodt paper could backfire,' says one energy expert. 'If a company wanted to switch to another electricity supplier, in most cases the new supplier would have to supply through the network owned by the regional distributor and original supplier. The fees would be high. The company might end up even paying more.' Yet recent examples in eastern Germany have shown that foreign competitors can co-exist with domestic distributors without disrupting supplies, and at the same time give the consumer more price flexibility. A case in point is the Anglo-American consortium headed by Britain's PowerGen and NRG of the US, which recently bought a 44 per cent stake in a power generating plant owned by VKR, a subsidiary of PreussenElektra in Schkopau, near Leipzig. Another example is Wintershall, the gas division of BASF, the chemicals group, which is investing DM5bn in building new pipelines across Germany. 'We are in here for the long term,' says Mr Herbert Detharding, chairman of Wintershall. 'We are slowly denting the monopoly and introducing competition. And everybody knows there's room for competition in this country.' But Germany's established utilities still don't see the reason to compete.

0,FT931-9375 ,"FT931-9375 _AN-DBNAHABJFT 930213   FT  13 FEB 93 / Feasibility of coal plans doubted      By MICHAEL SMITH   THE GOVERNMENT'S prob-lems in ending the public furore over pit closures deepened yesterday as British Coal said it doubted the feasibility of any plan which did not tackle planned growth in nuclear and gas-fired power. The company's said even the recommendations of a Commons select committee, generally considered to be more favourable to coal than measures the government is contemplating, could result in a nil increase in the market for coal after five years. A draft of the government's white paper on energy proposes slowing the planned run-down of coal stocks, cutting output from opencast mines and using subsidies to halt growth in imports. British Coal would not comment in detail on the proposals, but remarks by Mr Neil Clarke, its chairman, suggest a strong belief that they do not go far enough. He said the company's problems could not be solved simply by using subsidies to deter coal imports while the growth in gas and nuclear power continued. The draft white paper makes little if any provision for capping nuclear and gas power. Mr Clarke said: 'The market for electricity is not elastic.' If a greater role was to be found for coal then it was a question of what fuel would give way, he added. 'We risk storing up problems if we rely too much on maintaining coal stocks to sustain production rather than on switching away from other fuels,' he argued. 'Careful consideration should also be given to the business consequences of any artificial cap on the competitive coal from opencast mines.' Mr Clarke added that ordering power stations using orimulsion - an imported fuel - to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment was unlikely to stop use of the fuel. The select committee report has been interpreted as seeking to create a market for at least an extra 16m tonnes of coal a year. But, in its response to the committee's findings, British Coal said its proposals would increase the market by 8m tonnes at most, and possibly not at all. British Coal said the report: Overstated the likely level of coal imports in 1997-98 by 16m tonnes. This was important because any subsidy would be directed at replacing imports. Understated gas burn by the equivalent of 3m tonnes. Assumed total fuel used to generate electricity would be equal to 5m more tonnes of coal than was likely. The company wants the government to explore using new gas stations at less than base-load capacity in the electricity system, delay the commissioning of the Sizewell B nuclear station and not extend the lives of magnox nuclear stations.

Whitehall is understood to have last week told Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of the Mersey Barrage Company, that it would provide no further cash. The barrage would not qualify for public funds to subsidise the cost of its electricity. Shareholders will meet in Liverpool today to decide whether to try to keep the 10-year-old project alive with an injection of Pounds 14m. About Pounds 7m has been spent so far by the public and private sector. Supporters of the project say Whitehall's decision raises questions about the government's commitment to environmentally friendly power generation. The government is likely to have been swayed by the project's high energy costs and by shippers who use the three Mersey ports of Liverpool, Garston and Manchester Ship Canal. They fear the project would threaten navigation of the estuary. A feasibility study is being carried out on the project. Although studies are incomplete their general findings are already known. Environmentalists have mixed feelings. They favour renewable sources of energy but are worried about the environmental impact of such big schemes. The decision whether to subsidise the barrage went to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The government wants to shelve the scheme for later consideration, but supporters say this would kill the project off because its design teams - numbering up to 40 people - could not be easily reassembled. Shareholders include Alfred McAlpine, Allied Steel  Wire, Barclays Bank, BICC, Blue Circle, Costain, Ocean Marine, Rolls-Royce Engineering, Royal Insurance, Shell, Tarmac and Trafalgar House. Local shareholders are represented by Littlewoods, Mersey Docks, Manweb, Trinity International and Liverpool University. The crucial issue for funding the barrage is the price that could be charged for the electricity generated. This needed to be about 7p per unit, of which 4p would be offset by the non-fossil fuel levy. A price of 3p per unit would only allow about 40 per cent of building costs to be raised from the private sector. The barrage was expected to have a capacity of 700MW, enough for three-quarters of Liverpool's needs. It would also have been a substantial contribution to the legal obligation of Manweb, the electricity supplier, to take 20 per cent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources. David Lascelles writes: The Department of Trade would not comment on the state of the project last night. Last year it authorised 122 renewable energy projects with a total capacity of 472MW. These ranged from landfill gas plants producing electricity at 5.7p a megawatt to windmills producing power for 11p. The Mersey Barrage is by far the largest renewable energy scheme close to going ahead. If it were approved, it would take the government past its target of 1,000MW of new capacity by the year 2000.

Circumstances in the US increasingly favour the electric car. Air quality laws in California and Massachusetts now demand that 'zero-emission' vehicles comprise 2 per cent of total sales in the car market by 1998. Electric cars are the only vehicles to meet such standards so far. Other states are considering similar laws. Yet the big three car manufacturers - Ford, Chrysler and General Motors - have complained bitterly during the last few months that a deadline of 1998 is unrealistic and that environmental benefits from the vehicles are ill-defined. Several environmental organisations have concurred. In April, a leaked report by the US Environmental Protection Agency questioned the air quality improvements from battery-operated cars, lending credence to electric car critics. 'Electric vehicles will not have a positive environmental benefit across the country,' says Stephen Burrington, a lawyer with environmental advocacy group the Conservation Law Foundation. Many ecologists complain that the term 'zero-emission' vehicle is wishful thinking when applied to electric cars. The emissions are still there, they argue, whether they emanate from the electric power plant or from the car itself. According to the EPA report, switching to electric vehicles may not always improve air quality as these cars increase electricity consumption. Benefits are, therefore, uneven. Regions relying on 'cleaner' electricity sources, such as nuclear and hydro-electric plants and natural gas, for their energy will probably fare better than regions depending on more traditional power sources such as oil and coal. 'The switch to electric vehicles could be disastrous for a state like Kentucky, which still gets a lot of its electricity from coal,' says Robert Russell, a lawyer for the Conservation Law Foundation. Most people involved in the debate agree that electric car use in California would almost certainly improve air quality there. 'California is an exception, first because it has so many clean energy sources such as wind power, and second because its electricity sources are separated by mountains from the cities which have air quality problems, like Los Angeles,' says Reginald Modlin, Chrysler's manager of environmental energy affairs. There the consensus stops. The EPA and NESCAUM, the north-eastern air quality organisation, believe the north-east of the country, which generates much of its energy through nuclear power, could also benefit from electric vehicles. The car industry disagrees. 'Our studies show that the north-east would not get any improvement in air quality with a switch to electric vehicles,' says Modlin. John Williams, chairman of the US Advanced Battery Consortium at General Motors, also points out that electric cars are less efficient in the north-east than they are in California. 'The cold in the north-east hurts our range,' he explains. 'We can get 70-90 miles in moderate temperatures, but only 30 miles in freezing conditions.' Enthusiasts say that studies questioning environmental benefits assume a lower efficiency than they should for electric cars. 'Old gas-burning cars normally see a dramatic increase in emissions as they get older,' says William Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. 'Electric cars don't see this deterioration. After 100,000 miles of driving, they are pretty much the same as brand new in terms of emissions.' Some environmentalists believe electric vehicle efficiency is over-estimated. 'Getting the energy from the power source to storage, from the storage to the car, is extremely inefficient,' says Burrington. Environmental improvements may largely depend on how strictly emissions from electricity sources are controlled. California's rigid pollution standards mean that it would reap more benefits than other states. In the long run, moreover, it may be easier to limit pollution from the electric plants than from individual cars. Emissions, however, are only part of the overall impact, say environmentalists. 'Even if the sources are cleaner, if electric use increases, it can cause ecological problems,' says Thomas Caffrey, an engineer with the EPA. 'There are other environmental problems involved with sources like hydro-electric and nuclear. Hydro-electric power has been very much criticised lately for what it can do to fish and other water species.' Russell contends, moreover, that the issue cannot be studied on a region-to-region basis. 'Cars are marketed widely and cross state boundaries readily, so we need to look at this on a federal level.' Environmentalists also worry that electric cars will encourage Americans to be complacent about their driving habits. 'What we need is an overall reduction in car use in this country,' says Burrington. Despite the criticism, electric cars seem poised to represent part of the car market by 1998. Car manufacturers say they can meet the state-imposed deadlines, although battery technology cannot yet offer the vehicles at competitive prices. The air-quality boards for California and the north-eastern states say they will forge ahead with plans to encourage electric car use. 'With the smog problems we face in California, we have no choice,' says Sessa. 'We have to look at alternatives like electric vehicles. They may not be perfect, but they're certainly an improvement over what we have.'   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

The stamps will be sold at the discounted price through social-work offices in Tayside region, where the SNP won control from Labour in May. The SNP says the scheme will mitigate the increase in fuel bills caused by the imposition of value added tax. Hydro-Electric said it sold the stamps at a 3 per cent discount to shops for resale and had also sold them to the charity Age Concern. It said, however, that it had only had preliminary talks with Tayside. During the regional council election campaign the SNP promised to pay Pounds 10 a year to low-income families, those on benefit, the elderly and those with disabilities in councils where it took control. When it won the Tayside and Grampian regions, however, it learnt that it did not have the legal power to make the payments. It says the only cost to council taxpayers will be that of administering the scheme. It hopes to arrange a similar one with British Gas.   Companies:-  Hydro-Electric.     National Grid.

Ever since the government offered 21 per cent of the state-run utility to the Korean public in 1989, investors have considered Kepco, the largest capitalisation on the Seoul stock market, a safe, but boring, investment. All that changed in August when the government announced its intention to allow foreigners to acquire up to 8 per cent of Kepco. That unleashed frantic demand for the shares as domestic investors anticipated a surge of foreign buying orders. Kepco shares rose from a low of Won9,200 (Dollars 11.70) in August to Won20,600 yesterday, after hitting a peak of Won25,300 on November 24, the first day Kepco was opened to foreign investors. Kepco now accounts for 17.5 per cent of the capitalisation of the Seoul exchange against the 10 per cent share it previously claimed. Kepco has a healthy financial structure. Annual net earnings have grown at 17 per cent on average during the past five years, although this masks profit declines in 1989 and 1990. Last year, it reported net profits of Won719bn, an increase of 18.6 per cent, on sales of Won5,702bn. Analysts expect a 20 per cent profit rise this year. Kepco's dividend yield of 4 per cent is high by national standards. This reflects its relatively low debt/equity ratio of 90 per cent in a country where most companies have debt/equity ratios of 200 to 300 per cent. Interest in Kepco has been particularly strong among foreign fund managers because its large capitalisation makes it one of the few stocks on the Seoul exchange in which a single investment of several million dollars can be made without exceeding the strict limits on foreign ownership. However, investors will be watching closely the impact of the company's construction programme, which will more than double generating capacity from 19,851MW to 47,655MW by 2001. Kepco is being forced to build new power facilities because its reserve capacity of electricity has shrunk from a surplus of 72.3 per cent to only about 5 per cent in just five years. The slim reserve capacity means that Kepco can barely meet electricity demand during peak periods. The shortage has forced the government to introduce energy conservation measures. The electricity shortage was ironically of the government's own making. Confronted with surplus capacity in the mid-1980s, the government encouraged consumption by cutting rates as part of an anti-inflation policy. But demand, which has risen by an average annual rate of 13 per cent since 1987, exceeded expectations. Growth in electricity is expected to average around 9 per cent until 1997 since Korea's per capita power consumption remains low compared to other countries. Demand growth is expected to slow down thereafter to between 4.5 and 6 per cent. To meet short-term increases in demand, Kepco is building eight liquefied natural gas and 25 coal-fired facilities, which can be constructed relatively quickly. But the centrepiece of Kepco's expansion programme is the construction of nine nuclear plants, to be commissioned between 1995 and 2001, in addition to the nine it already operates. South Korea is one of the few countries in the world expanding nuclear capacity. It is also one of the world's biggest users of nuclear power, which provided 47.5 per cent of electricity generated in Korea last year. Although there is growing public criticism about nuclear power, the government prefers it as the fundamental supplier of electricity because it does not want resource-poor Korea to become dependent on foreign fuel sources. Officials also say that nuclear plants are the cheapest source of electricity in terms of cost per megawatt of energy generated, although they are costly to construct. The nuclear plants are expected to be built by Korean Heavy Industries and Construction, with four of the reactors supplied by ABB Combustion Engineering and two by Atomic Energy of Canada. Kepco plans to spend Won5,000bn annually over the next 10 years on the construction programme, which will also include improving its transmission and distribution system. The group is hoping to finance the expansion programme through annual rate increases of around 5 per cent in addition to loans from the state banks at preferential rates. Kepco will also borrow funds abroad through bond issues, including Dollars 300m it raised through a Yankee bond issue in June. No plans have been mentioned so far of raising funds through new share issues. Jardine Fleming predicts that the increased borrowings will raise Kepco's debt/equity ratio to almost 130 per cent by 1995 but estimates that annual earnings growth can be maintained at 20 per cent. Other analysts are more cautious, and all agree that net earnings will not rise much above 5 per cent next year as capital costs start to bite into profits.  The Financial Times   London Page 29  "

Sour gas contains a significant amount of hydrogen sulphide and is normally unsuitable for household use. The 40MW to 50MW power station will generate enough power to provide electricity for a town of 15,000 people. Although small by comparison with other electricity plants, the station will underline the growing use of gas in power generation and the problems that causes for coal. The station is being built at Knapton in the Vale of Pickering between Scarborough and York. The gas - about 10m cubic feet daily - is being supplied by contract from Kelt UK in association with Edinburgh Oil and Gas, Marinex Exploration and Tullow Exploration. Output from the station will be connected to the national grid through Northern Electric's high-voltage system. The Department of Trade and Industry has granted planning permission for the project.

0,FT932-8620 ,"FT932-8620 _AN-DERDAAESFT 930518   FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Temptation of a safe, but undynamic investment / A look at Northern Ireland Electricity, whose pathfinder prospectus is published today      By MICHAEL SMITH   IMAGINE a company which was guaranteed fixed revenues on the bulk of its most profitable business, regardless of whether sales volumes went up or down. Investors looking for a safe, if undynamic, home for their funds would be sorely tempted to buy into it. Next month they will be given the opportunity when the government sells off Northern Ireland Electricity, the last non-nuclear power company to remain in the UK public sector, for between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m. The guarantee of income stems from a regulatory regime which is among several factors setting NIE apart from the other electricity companies in the United Kingdom. The differences - good and bad - will come under close examination in the next week or so as the more than 400,000 people and institutions who have registered an interest in the flotation decide whether to buy shares. A pathfinder prospectus on the sale will be published today. Northern Ireland Electricity is what remains of the province's state electricity company following the disposal last year of four power stations to trade buyers for about Pounds 350m. Like the 12 regional electricity companies (recs) in England and Wales it enjoys a monopoly to distribute power in the area it serves. Unlike them, it also transmits the power, a function that in England and Wales is undertaken by the National Grid. In theory NIE could face more competition than the recs in supplying electricity - that is buying it from generators and selling it on - but so far only one company, Northern Electric, has applied for a supply licence. NIE's penetration among the province's 1.5m population is much more limited than is that of the regional companies in England and Wales because oil and coal supply 81 per cent of the fuels market. This gives the company headroom for volume expansion, particularly as there is as yet no competition from gas and the population is relatively young and consumer goods oriented. But the most significant difference between NIE and the regional electricity companies is in the way they are regulated. The Northern Ireland electricity system is not linked to that in Great Britain, or indeed the Irish Republic, and it is regulated separately. Whereas the recs are negotiating with Ofer, their regulator, on changes to formulae influencing supply profits and will soon discuss the more lucrative distribution business, NIE's formulae for the next four years are already established. Dr Patrick Haren, chief executive, says this gives NIE more certainty. 'We are further down the track,' he says, pointing to the widespread belief that the reviews in England and Wales will follow examples set in the NIE regulation. The most significant formula is that governing transmission and distribution, which provides more than 80 per cent of company operating profits. In an attempt to encourage energy conservation, Mr Geoff Horton, the Northern Ireland regulator, has introduced a system whereby he regulates revenues rather than price per unit. Three quarters of total revenues are allowed to grow in real terms by 3.5 per cent annually but, for this three quarters, volume growth does not affect income. If volume growth exceeds expectations NIE must reduce prices in the following year, but if volume growth falls short NIE can increase tariffs. The effect is a highly secure revenue stream. Although this provides stability, it limits the advantages accruing from stronger volume growth than on the mainland. In addition it may take away an incentive for management to market aggressively, skills which may be needed later in the decade if British Gas decides to compete in the market on completion of a pipeline from the mainland. Dr Haren says the advantage of the regulatory regime is that NIE must concentrate on costs to generate increased profits in transmission and distribution. 'Recs can allow the economy to drive volume sales and profits. We have to be vigorous about cost management.' Jobs are an obvious target. In the last three years NIE has cut about 8 per cent of its workforce which now stands at about 3,700, but NIE still has six employees per thousand customers compared to the recs' 3.6. Although this is partly explained by the wide geographic base of NIE's operation, it leaves scope for further reductions as the company adopts the more rigorous practices of the private sector. The City believes that Dr Haren is well qualified to lead the management in this period of change. Still only 42, he joined NIE from the Electricity Supply Board in Eire where he started as an engineer, but later switched to finance. Generally, the management at NIE is perceived as well balanced in age and experience. 'They may not set the world alight but they are comparable with that at most recs and better than some,' says one analyst. In spite of inherent advantages they have at NIE, managers face two main challenges, one resulting from high capital expenditure needed over the next few years, the other from the political problems in Northern Ireland. Problems associated with terrorism can be exaggerated. As Hoare Govett points out, the government practice is to replace assets in Northern Ireland which are damaged through terrorism. None the less terrorism has been and remains a threat; the headquarters of the NIE was bombed in the 1970s and the interconnector with Eire was severed following terrorist action. Even if any attack on NIE had no impact on NIE's finances, it would be unlikely to leave the share price unscathed. The other inherent problem at NIE stems from the province's remoteness and the age of the transmission system, half of which dates from the 1950s or earlier. NIE is likely to have to pay Pounds 110m for an interconnector to Scotland which is planned for mid-1990s. Even without allowing for interconnector costs, Hoare Govett estimates capital expenditure to rise to Pounds 125m by 1995-6 from last year's Pounds 57m and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, NIE's financial adviser, says gearing could reach 65 per cent by 1996-7. However, Hoare Govett believes real dividend growth should be similar to the recs in the long term.   Companies:-  Northern Ireland Electricity.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT944-13395 ,"FT944-13395 _AN-EJ0D9AG4FT 941027   FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (12): Shortages seem likely to persist / A look at the problems of the energy sector      By FRANCIS GHILES   Power shortages are nothing new in Morocco. Nor, for that matter, are power cuts. Throughout the 1980s, however, power cuts affected factories and were all but invisible to the public at large. In the autumn of 1992 the cuts took a turn for the worse. The National Electricity Office (ONE), which has a monopoly of electricity generation, and the municipal distribution companies (Regies) were forced to cut off customers, often entire industrial zones, and stop television programmes between 2pm and 6pm. Such cuts hit the country's industrial production and undermined the arguments put forward by senior officials keen to attract foreign investment to the kingdom. The immediate cause of the cuts was a drought. Hydroelectricity usually accounts for 15 per cent of all electricity in Morocco, but its share two years ago was cut to 4 per cent. However, the root causes of the persistent shortages are more deep-seated. They include a substantial build-up of unpaid bills and debts throughout the sector; a lack of autonomy from government ministries which discourages management initiative; a lack of co-ordination among the enterprises within the sector; the absence of an economically sound approach to tariff regulation and finally the lack of a clear legal code and regulatory system. The sheer size of unpaid bills underlines the problem. As of March 1993, ONE clients were approximately Dollars 500m in arrears. Of that amount the Regies owed ONE about two-thirds. In turn, the Regies were owed substantial amounts by their customers, mainly in the public sector. Though ONE has for 40 years had a monopoly on the production of electricity, it has never been able to manage existing and potential demand, because of political interference. In particular, ONE has had no influence on price setting, tariffs and distribution. Tariffs do not properly reflect economic costs. This explains, for instance, why peak demand represents 180 per cent of base demand and lasts only five hours every day. Low tension electricity is sold more cheaply than high tension electricity, even though it is more expensive to produce. Industrial users subsidise domestic ones. One half of all purchases of electricity are conducted through local Regies, which are jointly controlled by local authorities and local representatives of the state. The results are predictable. Funds and appointments have long been mismanaged. In some areas of Morocco such as Tetuan ONE and local authorities competed to build power lines and then fought for clients who could not afford to plug into the available power because the cost of doing so was set so high by the local authorities. The drought was thus, in the words of one senior Moroccan official, 'akin to knocking a paralytic to the ground'. The panic buying of nine gas turbines at a total cost of Dollars 300m has enabled ONE to produce an extra 300 megawatts but running costs are three times those of a coal-fired power station. Gas turbines, designed to run on diesel for short periods, have been running continuously. So there has been inadequate time to do daily maintenance or clean the residue of the heavy diesel fuel from the turbines which have sometimes broken down. Installing new capacity in a hurry may solve the problem in the short term but senior officials accept that it will do little to avoid shortages at a later stage. Demand is growing at about 7 per cent per annum, but it must be reduced in a systematic way, notably by discouraging it at peak times through special tariffs, encouraging energy efficiency and building new capacity. The constraints imposed in recent years on spending have pushed the government into looking, for the first time, at the idea of private investment in electricity generation. There are three keys to a successful policy apart from new men - the leadership of ONE was changed at a stroke last March. 1 Morocco must allow for a rise in demand for electricity and double its present generating capacity to around 5,000 megawatts by the year 2000. 2 ONE, which has a heavy public service obligation and is handicapped compared to potential private investors, must be allowed a freer hand. 3 A clear legal code for regulating the sector and the predictable and sound caucus of rules governing tariffs must be adopted, which will allow ONE to address the needs of a modern economy. There are three ways in which power generation can be increased, all of which are now being pursued. The first is to sub-contract primary power generation to private companies. This is being done at Jorf Lasfar, south of Casablanca, where tenders have gone out for the management of two existing coal fuelled stations which produce 600 megawatts and the building of two new ones which will produce an equivalent amount of electricity. Leading western groups such as ABB, AES-GE, Els, Endesa, National Power and Bechtel are competing for a contract which over a 10-year period is worth Dollars 1.4bn. The second source of energy will be the transit fee in gas that Morocco will collect from the Maghreb Europe Pipeline (GME) which will carry gas from Algeria to Spain and Portugal. Construction has just begun. Gas from this pipeline will fuel two combined cycle plants, due to be built in Kenitra and Mohamedia, which will produce 300 megawatts each. Electricity interconnections with Algeria, which allow Morocco to purchase up to 150 megawatts, already exist. By 1996 the planned interconnection with Spain will enable Morocco to purchase 300 megawatts, a figure which will rise to 600 by the year 2000. Recasting the institutional framework is the third challenge Morocco faces. Political involvement at all levels reduces management autonomy and effectiveness. Some examples illustrate the problem. ONE's investment plan is developed and financed in a way which reflects immediate problems facing the government. Financial constraints have led to a preference for bilateral aid financing rather than commercial credits, which in turn leads to delays in realising projects. ONE must pay import taxes which amount to 50 per cent of the import value of fuel; in Tunisia and the Iberian peninsula such taxes amount to 1.5 per cent or nothing respectively. Individual electricity boards have a social role, thus connecting customers is sometimes driven by political and social pressures rather than by the pursuit of commercial gain. Privatising local boards could well provide an answer. Tariffs must reflect economic costs, be adjusted to inflation and not penalise industry. Two-part tariffs for low voltage must be introduced, and more sensitive tariffs for all customers are a must. Such changes, some Moroccans argue, are difficult to introduce because of metering problems. All customers paying a peak tariff would need a new meter. Also, there is the problem of explaining to customers why there is a peak tariff. Changing bulk supply tariffs will be difficult politically if it entails a change from the previous 'no win no lose' policy. It is, however, fair to point out that the crisis of 1992 opened people's eyes. Those now in charge of the sector - Mr Abdellatif Guerraoi at the Ministry of Energy and Mines and Mr Driss Benhima, the new head of ONE - are able hands-on operators. They know, as do their colleagues in government, that the number of households in the countryside which receive electricity must be pushed up above the current level of 30 per cent and that efforts to promote the activities of local entrepreneurs and attract foreign investment will come to little if there is no power to back up such activities.

The indictment, returned in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, charged  Ernest P. Lampert, 49, with 15 counts of mail fraud. It detailed a scheme that  prosecutors contend promised investors federal income-tax credits and rising  income from the sale of electricity and thermal energy created by Lampert's  companies.    Lampert operated a Ponzi scheme, using funds from new investors to pay off  earlier investors, according to the indictment.    If convicted, Lampert could be sentenced to a maximum of 75 years in prison and  fined $1.2 million, U.S. Atty. Joseph P. Russoniello said.    Lampert was president of a company named United Energy Corp., based in Foster  City, Calif., that sold devices called ""solar energy modules,"" prosecutors  said. The modules were sold to provide tax credits and income from the sale of  electricity and thermal energy, they said.    Investors were invited to install their modules at solar farms owned by another  Lampert company, Renewable Power Co., in Borrego Springs, Barstow and Davis,  prosecutors said.

In  this regard, he called upon government organizations, especially  companies, in addition to citizens and [foreign] residents, to  respond to the need to conserve the utilization of electrical  apparatuses.    Al-Zamil, in a meeting with journalists the day before  yesterday after he signed a contract with the Middle East  Engineering and Development Corporation dealing with expanding  the Tabuk power plant, said that the total amount of electricity  consumed in Saudi Arabia last year was 15,000 megawatts, whereas  the total amount produced was 18,000 megawatts, with 2,500  megawatts being produced by desalinization plants on the Red Sea  and the Persian Gulf.    The minister emphasized that the abundance in the  electricity  produced does not mean that there is an abundance of electricity  available for all areas of the country. He indicated that  electricity production and utilization differ from area to area  and that ""this is why there remains an urgent need to conserve  consumption, especially in the areas where the demand is  particularly heavy.""    Wasteful Consumption    He said: ""There is at least a 20 percent waste in  consumption."" In this regard, he said that the ministry will  cooperate with the General Electricity Organization to implement  an integrated program for the conservation of power consumption,  in accordance with measures that are in effect in various  nations of the world.    Al-Zamil expects that, during the next three months, a  contract will be signed for constructing the ninth power plant,  between Riyadh and al-Qasim, which will serve the central area  of the country in addition to the capital city of Riyadh. He  said that the bids submitted by the companies are being studied  right now.    Sources expect the General Electric Corporation to play a  role in the construction of the new plant. The lowest bid for  the construction of the plant was 3 billion riyals [SR] ($800  million).    In addition to this, he announced plans for the expansion of  power plants in the following cities in the northern area:  al-Jawf, 'Ar'ar, Rafha, and al-Qurayyat. In this regard, he said  that one of the options being considered in this sector was the  possibility of setting up a unified power company in this area.    The Saudi minister of industry and electricity, together  with  Engineer Mahmud Tibah, the head of the General Electricity  Organization, signed a contract for the expansion of the Tabuk  power plant with Mr. 'Abdallah al-'Utayshan [name as  transliterated], chairman of the board of the Middle East  Engineering and Development Company, Ltd. (MEEDCO). The value of  the contract, which is to be implemented within 24 months, is  SR230 million.    Expansion Details    Al-Zamil mentioned that the contract includes the  construction of two power units having a total capacity of 120  megawatts. The contract also includes provision of all the other  requirements pertaining to technical support, spare parts, and  maintenance. Also included is the mechanical [engineering] work  pertaining to the fuel system, fire fighting, the compressed air  system, and the necessary mechanical hoisting apparatuses.  Likewise, the contract includes the electrical [engineering]  work pertaining to the main transformers and generators, the  civil [engineering] work pertaining to expansion and laying out  of roads, a water purification system, cable lines, and also the  training of Saudi technical engineers and an insurance engineer  for the project.    He said that the contract was one of the important things  being done in the northern area (Tabuk), in view of the steady  increase in the work being undertaken as a result of the  industrial and agricultural development and population increase  taking place in the area.    MEEDCO, which won the contract, was founded in 1978 with a  capital of SR10 million. The chairman of the board, 'Abdallah  al-'Utayshan, contributed 51 percent of this amount, and 49  percent was furnished by the South Korean firm Hyundai.    The company began its activity in the field of construction  by implementing the Ministry of Defense's housing project in the  Tabuk area. Then the company switched over to the field of  electricity. At the present time it is implementing contracts  for the expansion of three substations that are part of the  Riyadh electrical system, in addition to a contract involving  the Bani Malik Station in the area of Jizan.

These mountains of ash are sombre monuments to Estonia's oil shale industry and the environmental damage it has inflicted on the area over the past 70 years. Ecological questions are less peripheral than they were under Soviet rule, but the newly independent state is being forced to restructure its energy sector in the face of mounting economic costs. Thanks to oil shale, Estonia enjoys a measure of self-sufficiency rare among former Soviet republics. The fossil fuel covers half the country's energy needs, including all electricity demand, according to the International Monetary Fund. Worryingly, however, output has been falling - from the equivalent of 5m tonnes of oil in 1990 to 4.22m tonnes in 1992. The drop would be even more marked but for sustained electricity exports to Latvia. Age and inefficiency are the chief culprits at all three levels of production: mining, retorting and upgrading. Estonia's only natural resource, the oil-bearing rock, is mined at three open pits and two underground mines near Kohtla Jarve, an hour's drive east of Tallinn, the capital. Since the 1920s, plants have turned the fossil fuel source into liquid fuel and electricity by retorting, or heating, and then upgrading. Because of high costs, the mines are not extracting fast enough to meet demand. Imported explosives are too expensive, accounting for a full third of all costs associated with oil shale production. Little can be done about that, but the consultancy Arthur D. Little said in a recent study that costs could be reduced by buying new machinery and selecting mining sites more wisely. The retorting operations, using ancient gas-generators, also desperately need new equipment to improve efficiency. Normally, state-owed enterprises would be privatised to do this, but the retorts are not hot items. 'They're awful. Nobody will buy it,' says Mr Jaan Uustalu, of the Estonian ministry of economics. Instead the government plans to sell off subsidised divisions at two of the three chemical factories, such as the ammonia and urea producing operations, and keep profitable production of shale oil, the fuel product, in state hands for another ten to 15 years. Shale oil production at present fails to meet its profit potential, reckoned at around Dollars 60m a year, because the other divisions eat the money. Kivioli and Kohtla Jarve, the two plants, also face staff reductions. The larger Kohtla Jarve plant, with 3,500 employees, would ideally have to lay off half the employees to be profitable, according to Mr Uustalu. Kivioli is starting to move into the black after recently cutting its workforce from 2,500 to 1,100. The small plant's advantages are illustrative: it operates 400 tonne retorts, rather than the 1,000 tonne units used at Kohtla Jarve, to get better yields and higher quality of shale oil and to use less energy. The broader economic question, hotly debated in Estonia, revolves around price. Since spring producers have pressed for a rise in the state-set lump oil shale price, which is below cash flow minimums needed by the mines. The government did raise the price from EKr36 to EKr45 a tonne on October 21, but only after pressure from Eesti Energia, the state electricity company. Mr Uustalu estimates that, to reflect true cost, the price must go up to EKr65 per tonne. But the government fears this might stoke inflation. The latest increase electricity raised costs by some 27 per cent, compared with an inflation rate of just 5.6 per cent. The processing factories are also worried. Arthur D Little found Kivioli could afford to buy oil shale at prices up to EKr110.5 a tonne but Kohtla Jarve would be forced into bankruptcy if the price was set at EKr65 a tonne. At current low prices, however, the industry as a whole suffers. Declining output hurts lucrative exports: on the world market, shale oil fetches Dollars 75 a tonne, raised to Dollars 105 a tonne in Rotterdam by the inclusion of transport costs. More importantly, if mined and processed correctly, oil shale could help make up for the drop in Russian oil imports by supplying at least a quarter of domestic fuel needs, up from below 20 per cent today. Last year Finland helped the country through the tough winter with a 100,000-tonne delivery of heating oil, but Estonia needs a more fecund domestic fuel industry. Western governments are equally, if not more, worried about the high environmental cost. Oil shale mining has left a legacy of pollution around Kohtla Jarve with an estimated 350m tonnes of untreated water pumped out of the mines annually. The Purtse River is biologically dead and local bathers recount coming out of area streams covered with black ash. The large ash mounds are another a problem: they have a 10 per cent organic content, which slowly leaks out. Finland allotted FMr37.4m (Dollars 6.5m) last year to help ease environmental problems in Estonia, oil shale pollution chief among them. But no active cleaning operation is under way. 'Everyone's there looking at it and thinking about it. The hotels are happy"", comments an Estonian government official. The last, less discussed, alternative would leave the oil shale in the ground until the price went up or a less costly way was found to develop Estonia's unique resource. But few in Tallinn can afford such patience.   Countries:-  EEZ  Estonia, East Europe.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.     P1321 Natural Gas Liquids.

The proposed Pounds 80m windfarm would comprise more than 250 wind turbines, each 170ft high, with the capacity to feed up to 80 megawatts into the national grid. Power stations of 50MW or above are the planning responsibility of the DTI, rather than local authorities. The three square mile site, believed by TriGen to be the windiest in England, is 1,500ft above sea level, and is owned by Forest Enterprise, the Forestry Commission's estate management arm. TriGen expects average output to be between 20MW and 30MW. The electricity would go on power lines to a substation at the Royal Air Force's Spadeadam base in Cumbria. The project needs planning permission as well as a subsidy under the UK government's non-fossil fuel obligation scheme, which requires electricity companies to buy some energy generated from renewable sources. TriGen Windpower intends to bid for subsidy in the next tranche of schemes, expected later this year. It hopes to have the windfarm operational by the end of 1995.   Companies:-  TriGen Windpower.

How do you  explain this situation?    [Syrota] It is not true to say that the nuclear sector is  losing momentum. Installed nuclear power continues to rise,  even if it is rising less quickly than in the past decade.  Moreover, a not inconsiderable number of countries have nuclear  programs in development, especially in the Far East: Japan,  South Korea, Taiwan, etc. However, they are not the only ones.  We must not forget China, which has a formidable number of  nuclear facilities to be built. Recently, Ukraine decided to  terminate construction work on its VVER [water-cooled  water-moderated] plants (with a design similar to reactors used  in the West), which had been halted after the Chernobyl  accident. In fact, it is the building of new electricity  production facilities that is being victimized by overequipping  and overly poor growth in economic activity. The nuclear sector  is doing rather better than the others. Thus, for Japan, the  United States, western Germany, and France taken all together,  two-thirds of installed power between 1983 and 1992 was nuclear.    [Rochard] Perhaps, but virtually all new electricity plants  built in the world in the last few years have been coal or gas  plants. For more than 10 years, the United States has not begun  construction of a new nuclear plant, and if it acquired  additional nuclear capacity, it stems from projects that were  begun 15 or even 20 years ago.    [Syrota] Of course, but that simply means, as you say, that  the growth in electricity production in all of the  industrialized countries is losing momentum. To get back to the  COGEMA results, I think that they are good, but we must be able  to do better. Our ambition is to reach 3.5 percent net  profitability in the coming years. The situation of our  ""mining"" activity is better than before, but it is still far  from satisfactory. As for the reprocessing branch, activity  will increase in the coming years, and this should be reflected  in the results. COGEMA's advantage is that its market does not  depend much on the current economic climate. However, the poor  growth in electricity consumption is slowing the construction of  new plants, which will make our sales more difficult in the long  term in a market with slowing growth.    [Rochard] COGEMA is active in plutonium recycling. Are you  not expecting a halt to be put to this under pressure from the  United States, which does not have a civilian plutonium  industry, and with the excuse of combating proliferation? Japan  has recently frozen its reprocessing program in this way.    [Syrota] I do not agree with your analysis: Let us look at  the most recent events. In Great Britain, the Thorp  reprocessing plant has just been put into service, despite  protests and actions taken in courts by antinuclear activists.  If there was intervention, it was not effective. I prefer to  think that there was not any.    Another example can be found in Belgium. This is a very  interesting case, because Belgium's percentage of electricity of  nuclear origin is very high, almost as high as in France. In  addition, Belgium was the first country in the world to  manufacture MOX fuel (a fuel in which plutonium replaces  enriched uranium as the fissile material). For more than 20  years, the fuel has been produced under conditions which are  satisfactory from all points of view. As we recently began  reprocessing their used fuel in our UP3 plant in La Hague,  Belgian electricity industries asked their government for  authorization to load their reactors with MOX fuel by recycling  their plutonium. The government said yes provided that  Parliament approved it. So an in-depth debate was held in which  the issues of reprocessing and nuclear energy in general were  raised. The Belgian Parliament voted by a very large majority in  favor of using MOX, as well as in favor of pursuing reprocessing  contracts. There, too, reason won the day.    As for Japan, it has not frozen its reprocessing program at  all. So what has happened? Every five years Japan reviews its  long-term energy program. It then makes adjustments based on  the most recent economic situation and new prospects. The fast  breeder reactor to follow in the footsteps of Monju will be  built, but later than planned, with a delay of some 10 years.  However, it is interesting to point out that the Monju fast  breeder reactor, which is the same size as Phenix, is currently  being started up. The Japanese are developing fast breeder  reactor technologies because they think that they will be of  interest in coming decades and play an important role in the  future electronuclear sector. Similarly, they have begun  construction of the Rokkashomura reprocessing plant, which is  comparable to the UP3 plant in La Hague, with a capacity of 800  tonnes per year. Compared to us, the Japanese are lagging  behind in this domain, but they are catching up and it seems to  me that their ambitions in the nuclear sector are still just as  strong.    [Rochard] So in your opinion, Japan is not calling its  nuclear program into question, and while it may be slowing down,  it is only doing so to adapt to demand?    [Syrota] Exactly. I can confirm this for you, following a  two-week trip I made to Japan a month ago, during which I met  not only electricity industrialists, but also Mr. Eda, the  minister in charge of nuclear power.    [Rochard] Do you think that China will begin building new  nuclear plants?    [Syrota] I do not see how China can do without them. China's  economy is growing rapidly, at more than 10 percent per year.  Today, its main source of energy is low-grade coal used under  poor conditions. With a per capita income that is still low,  China is already one of the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide  in the world. I heard the reknown scientist Georges Charpak  [Nobel Prize winner] explain on television that the Chinese  would have to give priority to developing their nuclear industry.    [Rochard] The plutonium industry in itself bears the risk of  nuclear arms proliferation. Do you not think that this risk is  greater than the advantages linked to reprocessing?    [Syrota] Surely not. Atomic bombs can be made without  plutonium: remember Hiroshima. So how are proliferation  problems shaping up? There is currently a lot of talk about  North Korea. Before that, it was Iraq, Pakistan, India, South  Africa, Israel, and a few others. How did these countries try  to get or how did they get the bomb? In two ways. Some tried  to produce military-quality uranium, while others tried to  produce military-quality plutonium. In the first instance, it  was via an illegal uranium enrichment facility. That is what  the Iraqis and South Africans did, undoubtedly with the help of  foreign technologies. Plutonium-based proliferation requires  under-irradiated fuel which must be discreetly removed from a  nuclear reactor, and the plutonium must be separated from it in  a secret reprocessing facility.    This is the important point: The only way to make  military-quality plutonium, i.e., virtually pure fissile  plutonium, is to have under-irradiated fuel available. If the  fuel remains in the reactor for a long time, secondary reactions  take place and the plutonium contains an ever increasing  proportion of non-fissile isotopes. It then becomes unsuitable  for use in bombs. Electricity companies are trying to obtain  the greatest amount of electricity possible with their fuel for  obvious economic reasons, even though the plutonium separated  from these used fuels contains a lot of nonfissile plutonium.  Moreover, electronuclear fuel reprocessing operations are under  international control and they do not lie at the origin of any  examples of known proliferation.    [Rochard] The Nonproliferation Treaty is to be renegotiated  in 1995. What can be done to ensure that it is effective?    [Syrota] We must not miss the target. The problem to be  solved is the control of illegal activities. Experience has  shown that the International Atomic Energy Agency does not have  problems controlling countries like France, Japan, or Great  Britain, but does have problems trying to see what it wants in  more suspect countries. I would reiterate that North Korea and  Iraq signed the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]. We must  do what is necessary so that the Agency can better control the  reactors most likely to easily produce under-irradiated fuels,  better detect illegal programs, and better supervise transfers  of sensitive technology.    To this can be added a new problem: that of supervising  military-quality uranium and plutonium from the upcoming  dismantling of American and Russian weapons. One way of  resolving this is to use this plutonium and uranium to produce  electricity. Highly enriched uranium just needs to be diluted  to make it into nuclear fuel. As for plutonium, it can be used  to make MOX fuel because, whereas electronuclear plutonium is  not suitable for making bombs, military-quality plutonium can,  conversely, be used for electricity generation, and that is the  most ecological way of destroying it. Unfortunately, the  Americans, who are the first to be interested, do not have the  appropriate industrial solutions.    [Rochard] Are you pleased with the decision to restart  Superphenix as a research reactor, although this reactor was  initially designed to make nuclear fuel ""come full circle"" and  burn plutonium?    [Syrota] Fast breeder reactors can be justified by the fact  that as they use plutonium, they make even more of it by  transforming, at the same time, non-fissile uranium 238 into  fissile plutonium 239. So this is one way of using natural  uranium completely: The fast breeder reactor produces 40 to 50  times as much energy with the same quantity of uranium as a  light-water reactor. Superphenix was designed with a view to an  upcoming shortage of uranium, and was made to run optimally on  this basis. I am convinced that there will not be a shortage of  uranium for a very long time. However, this does not mean that  there is no interest in fast neutron reactors for the future,  because fast neutron reactors have another advantage: They are  capable of destroying atoms in the plutonium family (actinides)  and they destroy plutonium's nonfissile isotopes much better  than light-water reactors. This is one of the reasons why it is  useful to put the Superphenix back into service.    [Rochard] Does Superphenix still constitute a major loss?    [Syrota] It required a very heavy investment which, like any  other prototype, will not become profitable as such. Since the  investment was made, the choice was either to put a halt to the  program and lose everything, or to do what was decided.    [Rochard] After the Cadarache accident, Brice Lalonde  denounced the inadequate safety demands, especially as regards  those ""sites which are beginning to age badly."" Is there really  a problem?    [Syrota] Extremely rigorous examinations are carried out to  inspect the aging of facilities. The nuclear industry  experiences the same problems as any other activity, be it  chemicals, steelmaking, oil production, etc. However, our  industry is subjected to far more meticulous supervision by the  authorities: Nuclear operators undertake a vast number of checks  and spend a lot of money to maintain their facilities and  replace parts that need replacing. That is why, in my opinion,  nuclear power should be reserved for those countries which know  how to manage advanced technologies and who have the financial  resources to do so. As far as developing countries are  concerned, we may well fear that they will skimp on maintenance  and safety requirements. We must not build nuclear plants just  anywhere in the world.    [Rochard] Does China meet these requirements?    [Syrota] China needs nuclear resources so much that it will  have to meet these requirements. With the growth rate of its  economy, it should have the necessary resources and not succumb  to the temptation to make the savings which I fear.    [Rochard] Given the state of the nuclear sector in eastern  Europe, the world is still sitting on a powder keg. Where do we  really stand?    [Syrota] The main risk is Chernobyl-type plants in general,  and Chernobyl in particular. They can be shut down. To do  this, there is a solution which is technically simple: To save  energy. Energy consumption in the countries of eastern Europe  is so high because energy is virtually free there. If energy  were billed at its true price, consumption would drop and there  would no longer be any need for dangerous plants.    [Rochard] What is the impact of the freeze on nuclear  testing  for COGEMA?    [Syrota] COGEMA makes material for military use, but the  trials themselves have very little impact on our order book. We  no longer have any orders for military plutonium, which was  produced in Marcoule, and orders for military uranium are also  going to stop, but we do not know when. This is what worries  our employees in Pierrelatte but, in any case, the plant will  not shut down before the end of 1995, and it would not be until  the second half of 1996 that employment problems would crop up.    [Rochard] Since you became the head of COGEMA in 1988, you  have said that you would like to see more capital participation.  You were talking more about financial establishments. Since  then, Total has become your shareholder. Are you looking for  other partners? Is the banking-insurance profile still up to  date?    [Syrota] My answer to both those questions is yes. There are  several types of potential partners for COGEMA: financial  investors interested in the long-term regular profitability of  our business; industrialists with whom we can develop synergies  in our areas of activity, which is the case with Total; and,  lastly, commercial partners. Here, we have electricity  producers, especially those who do not have a nuclear fuel  industry in their country. I definitely hope that something  will happen in the next few months, but we cannot say anything  until the agreements have been signed and all the go-aheads have  been given.     "

Analysts have been taking an increasingly optimistic view on how much the Electricity Regulator (Offer) will order the Recs to cut distribution costs, which make up about a quarter of electricity bills. From a staggering 30 per cent in May the general belief now is that Offer will order a 15 per cent one-off cut followed by price caps of 2 to 3 per cent below inflation for the next five years. The review could reduce household bills by 4 per cent and is being carried out to redress the generosity of the terms at privatisation. City optimism has been fuelled partly by the recent lenient attitude of the water regulator and analysts believe that if their predictions are correct the Recs will be able to generate real dividend growth of 5 to 6 per cent a year.

'In developing countries, the poor use kerosene or candles rather than electricity for lighting, they rely on private vendors or public standpipes rather than in-house connections for water supply, and they are infrequently served by sewerage systems,' the bank notes in its annual world development report. In Ivory Coast, the bank found that among the richest 20 per cent of the population, 62 per cent had access to public water supplies, 57 per cent to sewers and 75 per cent to electricity. Among the poorest 20 per cent, only 2 per cent had access to public water, 3 per cent to sewers and 13 per cent to electricity. Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, says that 1bn people in the developing world have no access to clean water and 2bn no access to electricity. Infrastructure investments have often failed to provide needed services, he says, and the emphasis must now move from building more power plants and waterpipes to making sure that existing infrastructure is properly maintained and efficiently operated. 'Basic issues such as efficiency, maintenance and cost recovery have been too often neglected,' he says. The bank found that infrastructure subsidies in Bangladesh were six times as large to the rich as to the poor. Even though the poor usually consume water and use sanitation more than they do electricity or telephone services, the bank found that the richest 20 per cent received 1.3 times as much subsidy for water and sewer services as the poor in Costa Rica, 1.5 times as much in Chile and 2.8 times as much in the Dominican Republic. The report recommends restructuring subsidies so that they reach the poor more effectively: increasing block tariffs, for example, where a particularly low 'lifeline' rate is charged for the first part of consumption, perhaps 25 to 50 litres a person a day in water supply, and higher rates for additional blocks. 'This block tariff links price to volume and it is more efficient at reaching the poor,' the report says. An even more useful approach can be to subsidise access to infrastructure, rather than its price. Heavy initial connection charges are particularly burdensome to the poorest sections of the population, and countries such as Colombia have successfully targeted poorer households with subsidised connection charges for water mains.

The announcement yesterday came shortly after Mobil had said it would cancel its plans for a 300MW station on Canvey Island, Essex. Completion of the Barking project follows months of controversy which began when both Thames Power and Mobil last March contested a decision by British Gas to increase the price of gas to power stations by 35 per cent. The disputes were settled in September when British Gas offered both projects special deals, provoking charges of preferential treatment. The Thames Power project, due to start generating electricity next year, is one of only a few independent power station projects announced since the privatisation of the electricity industry which is likely to start up before 1995.

Mr Clarke said that the large role foreseen for coal in this week's World Energy Council report on the future of energy supplies meant that greater emphasis should be given to clean-coal technology. The higher costs of the non-fossil fuel obligation are met by a 10 per cent levy on electricity bills which produces about Pounds 1.3bn a year. The WEC report said coal was among the world's most plentiful energy resources, and that it would play an important role in long-term energy supplies. It estimated that future investment in world coal projects would account for 13 per cent of energy investment. This would secure a market share in excess of 20 per cent. Mr Clarke said commitments to build coal-fired power stations in the west and in developing countries suggested that coal was seen as the fuel of the future. However, the proposed privatisation of British Coal would restrict its ability to take an adequate part in developing long-term technologies.   Companies:-  British Coal Corp.

0,FT932-4517 ,"FT932-4517 _AN-DFICHABRFT 930609   FT  09 JUN 93 / British Coal to cut 3,000 white-collar jobs      By MICHAEL SMITH   BRITISH COAL warned for the first time yesterday that some of the 12 pits reprieved in March were at risk as it announced plans to cut half the 6,000 white-collar jobs at the corporation. The warning by Mr Neil Clarke, chairman, came as the National Grid predicted a stark decline in coal's input into electricity making and National Power, the generator, announced the closure of Thorpe Marsh, the coal-fired station in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, with 200 job losses. In his gloomiest prognosis yet of British Coal's prospects, Mr Clarke said he feared the electricity generators did not wish to buy any more coal, 'certainly not until the autumn'. The fate of most of the 12 reprieved pits depends on the generators making extra purchases. Mr Clarke said that with the growth in gas and with the preferred position of nuclear power 'the prospects for substantial additional sales are less optimistic than I would like'. Speaking to the annual conference of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in Weymouth, Dorset, Mr Clarke said that 'unless we are competitive, the consequence will effectively be the closure of more pits'. A cut of about 3,000 of the white-collar staff would be necessary to reduce the burden on the 31 remaining collieries, he said. Talks will be held about the job losses during the next few weeks but they will be spread across the country and will involve all grades, including senior managers. Mr Neil Greatrex, UDM president, said it was clear that the government was running British Coal. 'The white-collar job losses ought to include senior people at British Coal because they have let miners and the country down.' Meanwhile Mr David Jefferies, National Grid chairman, speaking at the announcement of his company's annual results in London, said that coal's share of the electricity market could be less than 50 per cent by 1997-98, compared with the current total of more than 70 per cent. With 10,000MW of combined cycle gas turbine plant already built or under construction, gas's share, which was almost nil this time last year, could reach 25 per cent. Nuclear Electric's share increased from 18.5 per cent to 21.6 per cent last year, and could be 25 per cent after the completion next year of Sizewell B. Emphasising the threat to British Coal's future, National Power said the 1,100MW coal-fired Thorpe Marsh plant would cease production at the end of March because it could 'no longer find room in the market place'. The company expects redundancies to be voluntary. It recently announced plans to close 2,000MW to 3,000MW of capacity during the next two to three years.

Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said it was 'deeply unfair' for the better off to avoid a tax obligation, which millions of others had to shoulder, by paying for gas and electricity supplies in advance. Mr Smith told MPs that the prime minister had revealed 'the Tory attitude to tax in a nutshell'. This consisted of 'loopholes for the better off and everyone else has to pay in full'. In ill-tempered exchanges Mr Major accused Labour of getting up to its 'old tricks' by telling people how to spend their own money. He said the Labour leader had chosen not to mention the Pounds 2.5bn over three years which the government had earmarked to help compensate the less well-off for higher fuel bills. The Labour leader's attack came just a day after Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, accused gas and electricity companies of depriving the government of millions of pounds in potential revenue by allowing customers to pay for future consumption before the introduction of 8 per cent VAT on fuel on April 1.

0,FT911-4211 ,"FT911-4211 _AN-BDTALAB5FT 910420   FT  20 APR 91 / Finance  The Family: It pays to be Scottish      By CLARE PEARSON   CUSTOMERS OF Scottish Power and Hydro Electric should be smiling this week following the announcement of the shareholder incentives for the flotation of the two Scottish electricity companies. Advisers have put together a package for customers which is closely modelled on the generous deal available when the English and Welsh regional electricity companies (Recs) were sold last autumn. Other UK investors have not been forgotten. But they stand to get only a relatively measly 1-for-20 share bonus if they hold shares bought in the offer until June 30 1994. By contrast, customers of Scottish Power and Hydro Electric can opt for money off their electricity bills in respect of holdings in their own company as well as a share bonus in the other. Customers can choose whether to plump for a package comprising shares in both companies or just buy shares in their own, while other investors will be able only to buy the package. Details of the incentives are as follows: Non-customers: the 1-for-20 share bonus, up to a maximum of 150 shares. Customers who apply for shares only in their own company: The choice of either Pounds 18 worth of electricity vouchers for every 100 shares allocated, up to a maximum of Pounds 270 worth of vouchers, OR a 1-for-10 share bonus, up to a maximum of 300 bonus shares. Customers who apply for the package: the choice of vouchers or bonus shares in their own company and, on their allocation in the other company, a 1-for-20 share bonus up to the non-customer maximum. As in the Recs' sale, customers who opt for vouchers will also benefit from getting their first one before Christmas - ahead of having to pay the second instalment on their shares, due in May 1992. Since it looks as if the record date for the dividend is likely to fall before then too, that gives local investors the prospect of an attractive first-year return. Minimum investment levels were also announced this week, and these too reflect the government's determination to attract as much local investment as possible. For customers buying shares in only their local company, the minimum first payment has been set at a modest Pounds 100. But those customers applying for the package will have to pay Pounds 300, the same as non-customers. Payment for the shares will be in three instalments. The fully-paid share price will be revealed next month, but the fully-paid minimums are being indicated at Pounds 250 and Pounds 750. Remember that you will only become eligible for incentives if you register with the Electricity Share Information Office (tel: 041-414-1414). As far as customers are concerned, registration guarantees preferential allocations in the event of oversubscription - and if the current level of interest is maintained, that will be very important. Registrations have already reached 2m, which means that the flotation is level-pegging with last November's Recs' sale, in which allocations were scaled down greatly. Non-customers who register are not being guaranteed preferential treatment although they may get some priority over other members of the public.

0,FT921-16618 ,"FT921-16618 _AN-CABA3AA3FT 920102   FT  02 JAN 92 / Letter: Electricity generators are manipulating the market      From ANDREW COOK   Sir, Your readers may have had difficulty understanding Mr John Baker's letter justifying peaks in the pool electricity prices (Letters, December 2). I suggest this is because he is trying to defend the indefensible. The facts are these. There is 58,000 MW of generating capacity in the UK. Normally in the order of 54,000 MW is available for use. As the peak afternoon period approaches, the generators are inexplicably withdrawing capacity, reducing available capacity to nearer 52,000 MW. Obviously, as in any market, if you reduce supplies when demand is rising, the price shoots up. This is precisely what the generators are doing - reducing available capacity at a time when demand goes up. There is firm evidence to support these allegations. On Tuesday December 3 the late afternoon pool price reached 19.15p per unit, the highest ever recorded. The regional electricity companies confirm that there were no unseasonably high demands and temperatures were generally above the seasonal norm. However, available capacity was reduced to 1,200 MW below the November maximum when it should have been increased in line with the normal onset of winter. More importantly, however, maximum available capacity was 52,733 MW compared with 57,060 MW for the equivalent day in 1990 (Tuesday December 4). It is quite clear from these figures that the generators are manipulating the market in a way that cannot have been anticipated when the pricing formulae that accompanied privatisation were drawn up. This is manifestly against the consumers' interests and cannot be condoned. It is also quite unrealistic to introduce such spurious arguments as a need to attract new generators into the industry. In effect, this amounts to depreciating generating plant on a replacement cost basis. There are few manufacturers who do not wish they were able to adopt this practice and pass on the cost to their customers. In the real world, the market simply does not allow such accounting techniques to be passed on in the selling prices. These real-world market-place rules should apply equally to the electricity generators. Andrew Cook, chairman, William Cook Plc, Parkway Avenue, Sheffield S9 4WA.

The Carbon II plant was to be sold for Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) to a consortium 49 per cent owned by Mission Energy, a subsidiary of Southern California Edison, and 51 per cent owned by Mexico's Grupo Acerero del Norte and Organizacion Autrey. It was to be the first privately-owned electricity plant in Mexico. However, US environmentalists complained that pollution from the plant would blow over the border into the Big Bend National Park in Texas, and demanded that smokestack scrubbers be fitted at a cost of about Dollars 300m. Such scrubbers are demanded by US law, but not by Mexico. Mr John Bryson, chief executive of Southern California Edison, said in a statement issued by Mexico's energy ministry that circumstances were not favourable to conclude the deal. The problems over the plant have highlighted growing pressure on Mexico to upgrade environmental regulations to the levels in the US even though this is not required by Mexican law.

[Portal] Good evening.    [Rodriguez] After the first question, which I will be  asking,  these other reporters will ask questions: Osvaldo Rodriguez,  from JUVENTUD REBELDE and who covers the basic industry sector;  Maribel Acosta, from NTV; and Susana Lee, from GRANMA newspaper.    As everyone knows, Minister Portal's presence responds to  the  problem of electrical power generation. I would like to ask  Minister Portal about the current situation with the generation  of electricity.    [Portal] I believe I should start by saying that we are  going  to explain the situation with Cuba's electric system objectively  and clearly. We must point out that this is the greatest, or one  of the greatest problems that Cuba currently has. In other  words, it is this situation that we are going to explain.    There are solution to our problems, but there are no  miracles. I wanted to make that clear. The solution not only  involves the workers and engineers of the electric industry; it  involves general population. I believe it would be prudent to  give our explanation to the population based on this fact. We  appreciate the opportunity to bring this to the people directly.    Having said this, we can begin our discussion. I am going to  use some graphs. The first point we wanted to explain is the  composition and origin of electric generation in Cuba. I believe  this is important for two reasons. Our system has 3,132  megawatts. Of the generation of those 3,132 megawatts, 66  percent is by equipment from the former Soviet Union and  Czechoslovakia; 34 percent of that generation is by equipment  obtained from capitalist countries.    There are two things that I would like to point out, the  first being that 86 percent of all the machinery and plants that  we have were built after the triumph of the Revolution.  Approximately 80 percent of today's installed capacity was built  in the last 25 years or less.    [Rodriguez] That is 80 percent.    [Portal] Right. In other words, only about 14 percent was  inherited from the capitalist period. This is very important. I  believe this gives us a sense of security. The national electric  system is relatively young, strong, and powerful in its  generating capacity and in the network of the national electric  system. We believe that this gives us a sense of sureness of  overcoming the special period. This is an area where I know  there have been doubts and concern. The facts give us this  practical information.    The second point I want to make is that 66 percent of the  electric generation is by equipment obtained from the Soviet  Union and Czechoslovakia. These two countries have ceased to  exist. I want to point out that in addition to the material  guarantees that came from those countries, favorable financial  conditions, obtaining spare parts and machinery, etc., there is  a certain technological dependency. It is not a true dependency  but a technological dependency. The turbines, generators,  boilers, pumps, etc. were obtained from those countries. This  was interrupted in the last three years and we have had to face  this situation boldly, supported, as can be expected, by the  technical force that we have.    From the very beginning of the Revolution our industry has  been blessed in that sense. We have always had highly qualified  technicians, engineers, and workers. There are things that  we....[changes thought] This is the second time that our workers  have had to take care of our old capitalist plants and solve  millions of problems. This is the second time we face this  situation, but under different conditions. This time we are  facing them with a greater infrastructure.    That is the reason I wanted to point this out. We can  overcome that technological dependency. We can do this in two  ways: There can be relations with the countries that inherited  the companies and factories that supplied this equipment, and we  can obtain materials and resources from other countries to keep  them in operation.    Undoubtedly, three years of interrupted supplies, spare  parts, and resources is a reality. Speaking from an objective  point of view, this is what has been happening. This is 66  percent of the generation, not including the networks. These are  the two elements that I wanted to point out in this information.    I also want to mention another subject we would like to  discuss, right at the beginning. It has to do with the nation's  heavy crude oil. This does not mean it is the only crude oil the  country has, or will have in the future. This is what we have  today, and its production can be increased.    The importance of national crude oil in generating  electricity cannot be underestimated, especially over the past  three years: 1992, 1993, and this year, 1994. The nation's crude  oil had to be used in an immediate or urgent manner as a source  of generating electricity for the country. The country must be  aware of this. In 1989, as is well known, we imported 13 million  tons of oil. This import was reduced almost abruptly. In 1990,  we imported 10.4 million tons, almost three million tons less.  In 1991, we imported 8.6 million tons; and in 1992, we imported  only 6 million tons. This has been thoroughly explained by  several comrades several times. We must understand the country's  situation, with that fuel cut in half in two or three years.    This is the first reason for using national crude oil in the  thermoelectric plants. That is, this was not a superficial or  easy decision. It was a daring and well-considered decision. The  national crude oil, which has a percentage of brimstone --  probably 6 percent or a little more -- because of its viscosity,  requires a tremendous effort to extract, handle, and transport  in ships or on Transport Ministry trains, etc., especially for  its consumption in thermoelectric plants. This implies a  tremendous effort and decision by the Revolution, a decision  adopted by us the technicians, the engineers. We made the  decision to use the national crude oil at a time when we were  practically hopeless, unable to generate electricity the country  needed.    The country was able to show this last year, namely in July  and August. The country generated practically 70 percent of its  overall electricity at that time with the national crude oil.  That is, two or three thermoelectric plants could face the  deficit situation and continue generating electricity. This  year, 30 percent of the electricity is generated with national  crude oil. We hope to maintain this. It is an important amount  -- 835,000 tons. We can say that if we were to import the fuel  oil, it would take approximately $60 million, considering fuel  oil's current prices. This decision has provided utilities  amounting to approximately $30 million, or a gross $35 million.  Today this money does not exist. We do not have it, considering  the country's financial situation, et cetera. So, we feel that  this is the main cause.    To further explain this phenomenon, we must add that the  thermoelectric plants are not being destroyed by the national  crude oil; that is, the turbines -- generators of the  thermoelectric plants -- fuel-pumping systems, cooling and  automatic systems, which are important parts amounting to 70  percent of thermoelectric plants, are not being destroyed by  this crude oil.    The gas pipelines of a thermoelectric plant suffer when the  petroleum is burned. When combustion takes place, the gas goes  through the gas piping system and the corrosion level increases.  We know this is so, but measures are being adopted to solve this  problem. The shop being built to enamel the surface through  which the gas passes will be finished this month. This will  ensure that the metal will have the same lifespan as before, or  perhaps longer. We will probably use additives to reduce  corrosion. There is a way of fighting corrosion and of  assimilating a product. If the country today has this product,  and if today we use 30 percent, perhaps we could achieve 40, 50,  or 60 percent within 15 or 20 years, generating our own  electricity with national fuel. This is very important. We  cannot make any real projections because we do not know the  country's capacity, considering the difficulties it has to  confront, such as the blockade and current harrassment. It is  important to generate part of our electricity by using our own  fuel, a national fuel. And this fuel is much better than coal.    The national crude oil has twice the burning capacity of a  ton of coal. That is, a ton of crude oil is equivalent to two  tons of coal. The same thing happened in the United States and  in Europe when they experienced a situation similar to ours --  for different reasons -- during the early 1970's, when they were  forced to adapt their thermoelectric plants to consume coal in a  relatively short period of time -- a year and a half, two years,  three years -- after the coal supplies had been severed some 20  years earlier. We did not need to do this. We had a guaranteed  supply of fuel, although we think this decision was necessary  and inevitable.    Not all our thermoelectric plants are burning national  crude oil. This should be clearly explained to the people. Of  our overall capacity, of our 3,123 megawatts, only 40 percent of  the plants are burning national crude oil. The Rente and the  Mariel thermoelectric plants are essentially burning crude oil,  and a total of 1,000 megawatts are produced between the two.  There is another plant in Santa Cruz del Norte that has one unit  operating, while a second is being repaired. A third unit is  sitting right on top of a petroleum deposit. This unit  represents a tremendous savings for the country. That is, part  of that petroleum is consumed right there. It is a tremendous  economic factor.    Now, if you add up the numbers, you will say: But how is it  possible that if national petroleum can be a savings factor for  the country, no money, resources, or currency have yet been  obtained to invest in this area? Besides, we are not talking  about tens of millions of dollars -- which during another time  might have been a small amount -- but a small amount to offset  this situation and to keep up the maintenance work. Well, these  resources simply do not exist. This problem was discussed last  year at the National Assembly [of the People's Government]  [ANPP]. It was very well outlined by one deputy who is a  director of one of our thermoelectric plants, and who discussed  the financial situation very thoroughly. He correctly reported  that some $18 million was necessary to try to face the  maintenance work. I had the responsibility of explaining to this  comrade that this year, we do not have a cent for that purpose.  We have difficulties with medicines and with food, and that we  must try to resist for at least another year before talking  about thermoelectric plants. Then, by the end of the year, we  managed to collect some $2 million from the income the country  is beginning to receive. You know the country is receiving some  income in dollars from certain activities. Well, this was  possible and allowed us to repair the thermoelectric plant unit  in Matanzas, and one unit in Cienfuegos. We are beginning to  reverse the situation, to increase the available installed  capacity. We managed to reach 36 percent when the Matanzas plant  stopped operating by the end of the year, and things have been  recovering gradually. I will try to explain the solutions we  found this year; that is, I will explain the measures we are  adopting and the possible solutions.    Well, Hector, I only wanted to make things clear concerning  the national crude oil. This phenomenon is imposed on national  life, but we are satisfied, we are happy. That is, we cannot  just take the negative side of the issue. Of course there are  people who want to see things negatively. Well, they might do  so, especially the people abroad who want to see our country  completely destroyed. But we are not going to allow this.    We are producing electricity with a fuel we did not dream of  some 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. For five years, we have  been using it to generate electricity, to generate 30 percent of  the electricity we are consuming. So how can we Cubans be misled  by this? This problem is going to be solved. We are going to  assimilate it as it was assimilated in other countries by using  coal, which is even more difficult. Imagine using coal as fuel  for our thermoelectric plants. Imagine the dirt, the handling of  it, the ashes, the tragedy that coal would cause. Crude oil can  be assimilated much more easily. We have assimilated it with  very little investment, namely for the purchase of pumps, etc.,  given the viscosity of the crude oil. When the time comes, these  plants will require maintenance. Well, this is a subject that  had to be discussed....    [Rodriguez, interrupting] Yes, this is a subject that is  discussed continuously.    [Portal] I think this talk was necessary, given the  prevailing confusion and the people's concern over this problem.  Some people say that we are destroying the thermoelectric  plants, etc. As I have just explained, some of these plants are  almost 20 years old, and we are taking good care of them. That  is, we cannot allow something that is good for the country to be  damaged. This is the manner in which we are working. But this  does not include all thermoelectric plants. Part of these plants  have nothing to do with this.    Now I would like to discuss the practical side of the  national power system [SEN]. I want to refer specifically to  1989. I think it is important to go back to that year, when we  managed to obtain 77.7 percent of the available capacity of the  entire electricity generation system, as well as 23.3 percent,  which was kept for maintenance, breakdowns, and limitations. We  must explain that electricity is generated all 365 days of the  year, and around the clock. It is obvious that part of that  capacity will be under repair or maintenance, and this requires  discipline. The SEN has been conceived this way. There is an  established discipline concerning the thermoelectric plants for  shutdowns and maintenance. A shutdown can be short or long,  depending on the needs. There are some units manufactured in the  1960's, namely those manufactured by the Soviet Union and  Czechoslovakia. These plants will require 90 or 120 days to be  repaired. The ones we have in Cienfuegos, which were made by the  Japanese Hitachi Company require 60 or 70 days, depending on the  work that must be done. The unit in Matanzas, for instance,  required only 27 days. Well, some time was saved there. In  short, part of the plants will need time for maintenance.    This is what we mean by 77.7 percent of available capacity,  and 23.3 of maintenance. This percentage was comparable to the  most developed countries in the world in 1989. For instance, the  Yankees have 80 percent, while we have 77.7 percent of the  available capacity. And this has been consolidated. We have  achieved this thanks to our workers and technicians. They have  consolidated this percentage.    The breakdown percentage at this moment has reached 50  percent. That is, breakdowns, maintenance, failures, and  limitations amount to a total of 50 percent. The idea of  limitation of a thermoelectric plant has to do with the ashes,  the dregs, the dirtiness, et cetera, which reduce the potential  capacity. That is, from 100 megawatts it drops to 95 megawatts.  We keep it that way, because to clean a plant, it must be  paralyzed. Moreover, a small breakdown or a leak still allows  operation for some days, but its generating capacity necessarily  drops. This is called limitation.    We must also refer to the breakdowns in the system, such as  the breakdown of a boiler pipeline, a steam pipe, et cetera.  This will demand a shutdown because to repair this damage, the  plant must be cooled down. Now, why has this generation capacity  been aggravated? This is the key issue. There are four essential  causes:    The first cause is the suspension of the supply of spare  parts by those two countries I mentioned before. This supply  stopped three years ago. This is an important cause. And it is  the truth. We have managed to survive with our reserves. We did  have some extra spare parts in our stores, in the steel  industry, and in other investments. That is, this is a problem,  and without any drop in generation, we kept these plants  operating until the middle of last year. That is, we managed to  resist in 1990, 1991, 1992, and half of last year. And besides,  in addition to these problems we were also short of fuel. But  this year we have this fuel, and so the difficulties are being  overcome.    Despite the blackouts, our people have achieved a discipline  that is unique. It is unique because the people have fulfilled  the family home plan. At least 90 percent of Cuban families  managed to save electricity. A large percentage has fulfilled  the plan, while a small percentage, perhaps 8 or 9 percent,  failed to fulfill this plan, not saving energy. More than 90  percent did fulfill it. This is unprecedented. Not even the  Yankees achieved this when they ran out of fuel. During the  Carter administration, when they ran out of fuel, a set of  measures were adopted, such as teaching the women to boil water,  et cetera. That is, they adopted very serious and drastic  measures at that time. But with the electricity problem here, we  have surpassed them with the set of measures we adopted. We are  sorry that such measures had to be adopted, but to return to our  point, this phenomenen was the first cause. And we have overcome  this. And people ask: well, why has this solution been found  only now? No, this is not a recent solution. The use of the  national oil was not adopted overnight, and the manner in which  the country had to face the shortage of spare parts and  materials did not emerge overnight either. Nothing has been  improvised. Everything has been done calmly, with intelligence  and serenity. We had to postpone the maintenance of some plants  in order to meet some demands. This is the second cause.    That is, the maintenance timetable was the second cause. A  thermoelectric plant, such as that of Matanzas, needed to be  repaired. And this plant had to keep operating for a year or six  months without maintenance, while the spare parts were prepared.  The parts were taken to the shops to be repaired. This demands  discipline, and this discipline is broken when there are no  spare parts or the necessary material.    The third cause, which to my opinion is the most important,  has to do with the country's difficult financial situation. We  are aware of the sugar industry situation, that is, the sugar  deficit. We are aware of the nickel industry which is also  experiencing a drop in prices, and a drop in the production  capacity of our nickel industry. It has abruptly lost its  market. The socialist countries used to buy 70 percent of our  nickel, but in 1992 these countries did not purchase any nickel  at all. They purchased no nickel whatsoever in 1992.    [Rodriguez] And was there a need to look for new markets?    [Portal] Yes. Today we are selling nickel to 96 countries.  We  must not take this as a setback because depending on a single  country for the sale of our products was beneficial, correct, et  cetera. But today our comrades from foreign trade have managed  to reach other markets. Today, our nickel has a market, while  prices are increasing.    Now we need to recover our plants. We are looking for  financial support to recover these plants. When you lose a  market and lose your client, you stop having an income. And when  you stop having an income, if no one grants you a loan -- and  today no one is granting loans to the country -- the  international bank does not grant loans, the World Bank does not  grant loans, no one is granting loans to the country -- this is  one of the few countries in the world to which no one is  granting loans.    But this does not mean that we are begging for money. We  have  a sugar harvest and we have nickel. But I am not going to refer  to the nickel issue because we have already solved that. What we  were unable to solve in the two previous years is being solved  by those who invest in and trust the country, the Revolution,  and our people. We are already receiving capital for the nickel  to solve this problem. Guaranteed by what? By the nickel our  workers are going to produce. That is not the objective of the  [word indistinct].    The third cause: the lack of hard currency and financing.  This is solved only by producing, and by intelligently seeking  sources for financing and markets for our product. That is the  third cause that I wished to explain.    There is a fourth cause, which is the domestic crude. It is  true that in the boilers, the increase in maintenance by 40  percent is caused by the use of the heavy crude oil. We should  not stop... [changes thought] As I explained at the beginning,  my explanation would be objective and clear, not advisory. These  are the four causes that have prevented us from keeping this  23-percent maintenance level.    We have not dreamed -- nor does the country need to -- of  achieving this 23 percent. But today, we cannot provide any  currency to achieve another 23 percent in two years. This is not  possible. But having only 50 percent of available capacity has  created this situation of not being able to meet current  demands, or an important part of the demand. We must begin  recovering that capacity that has been lost. We are going to  explain this further later.    In sum, industry has something we call the ABC factor. It  has  an ""A,"" a ""B,"" and a ""C"". The ""A"" represents the labor force,  the man, his discipline and productivity. The ""B"" implies  ensuring material provisions, its financing; and ""C"" represents  the maintenance and repair work.    If ""B"" fails -- that is, the material provision insurance  and  the financing, et cetera, -- the repair and maintenance work  also fails. The men, represented by ""A,"" have faced this. I have  to say that when a man is working in a thermoelectric plant and  he sees a problem, a leak, some difficulty, or a need for repair  -- which he used to do with discipline but now is unable to do  for lack of resources -- then discipline, productivity, and the  labor force are affected. The energy industry has failed -- that  is, the part of it that cannot be disregarded in any industry --  has failed. And I am going to further explain the solutions the  country has found to reverse this situation.    But as I was saying, we cannot work miracles. No solution  will be found in 15 days, one month, two months, or three  months. No, it cannot be, and I have to explain this clearly to  prevent any confusion or doubts. This is very important. The  people will rest assured when they are aware of the decisions  made.    [Rodriguez] Is this a gradual recovery?    [Portal] Yes. It is a gradual recovery, a gradual and  important recovery, and this will be explained in the solutions  found.    Now, to conclude this first topic, because I must speak  briefly about the issue of consumption in the introduction, I  wanted to discuss the capacity available for this year -- in  other words, from the 50 or 45 percent that we have available  for April. The average for the first quarter was 50 percent. In  April, we had to take a Japanese unit out of service, which was  one of the most efficient units in Cienfuegos' system. I believe  it would be good to explain this:    It was one of the better units in our system. A few hours  before the youth day celebrations began, we were analyzing the  problems. There had been vibrations in the turbines and problems  with the boiler. The repairs would require us to shut down the  unit for seven days. Our comrades recommended that we shut down  the plant, so we shut it down. Everytime this happens, we are  going to act accordingly. The population must understand that  despite the pressure, tension, and numerous difficulties that we  may have, we will always have to act in that manner because of  professionalism and discipline. We will not give the order to  keep a unit in operation so that we later end up with greater  problems.    That unit I was talking about has already been restarted. As  a matter of fact, in April or May, that plant should have  already reached its maximum designed capacity. That unit is  already about 15 years old and we are sure it will run well  during April and May, until we complete the harvest and other  activities. If there are problems and we do not shut it down, we  could have a difficult situation.    That is why in April, our capacity dropped to 44 percent. By  December, we should be at 60 percent. What are we doing and what  do we have to do to reach 60 percent? We will have to provide  maintenance and repairs to 1,800 megawatts of those that are  currently installed. This is a high percentage; almost 60  percent of all the generating plants, but it can be done.    I brought information with me about how the installed  capacity in each one of the main thermoelectric plants will  behave. I believe it is useful...it is correct. This lists the  contribution that each thermoelectric plant must make. It is on  the graph and can be explained, right?    [Rodriguez] Yes, because we are also broadcasting through  Radio Rebelde.    [Portal] Oh, okay. The Mariel generating plant, which is  currently operating at 39 percent of its capacity, will end the  year with 58 percent of its capacity. The plant in Santa Cruz,  which is operating at 40 percent of its capacity, will end the  year with 80 percent of its capacity, with the two units of 100  [not further specified] that it currently has in operation. In  the solutions, we are going to provide more interesting  information on that generating plant.    Havana City -- the link that is generated in Havana City,  which is composed of Talla Piedra, Regla, and Frank Pais -- is  where the oldest units are concentrated. They are the units of  highest specific consumption -- 400 grams per kilowatt. The  original idea was to keep those units as reserves in the  national electric system. Today, we propose to restore their  installed capacity. Forces from the Ministry of Construction,  government and party leadership in Havana, as well as our  comrades, believe it possible to restore those plants and bring  the capital to 53 percent of its available capacity, which is  almost 136 megawatts, by the end of the year.    We are being conservative in giving these figures. They have  planned to do even more. They have even set the goal of  recovering another plant called the Frank Pais, which is also in  the capital and which has two generating units. Here we have two  blocks, imported from Czechoslovakia. The rest are from the  capitalist era.    The Matanzas generating plant is currently at 100 percent of  its capacity and will close the year with 100 percent. Here I  want to pause and say that in September we will close that plant  to do an overhaul.    [Rodriguez] For how many days?    [Portal] They figure it will be approximately 27 or 30 days.  We may be able to do it in less. By that time, in September or  October, we should have repaired other units, to minimize the  effect. In Cienfuegos, we currently have 92 percent and should  end the year with 52 percent. Why? Because, in December, when  the Matanzas plant is back in operation -- we must take into  account the sugar harvest and the consumption -- the large unit  of Cienfuegos will be taken offline until the first few days of  January.    What about Nuevitas? Nuevitas does not burn domestic crude  oil. They are Czechoslovakian units -- three of 125 megawatts,  and three of 64 megawatts. As you can see, it is at 32 percent  of its capacity. It is one of the places most affected. Those  plants have different problems of a technical and material  nature. Our goal is to bring Nuevitas to 50 percent by December.  There is a chance we will be able to do better, but there are  some factors we must consider. We prefer to be conservative.    The Rente power plant in Santiago de Cuba is currently at 33  percent of its capacity, and they should end December with 60  percent. The people in Santiago de Cuba are sure they will be  able to accomplish this, reaching 300 megawatts. As you can see,  we currently have 1,378 megawatts; and we should reach 1995 with  1,890 megawatts. That is more than 500 megawatts more by the end  of the year. With that capacity, we can eliminate the power  outages during the day, for example, which affect the economy  and the population. We should have a schedule of power outages  that is more reasonable for the population.    For this purpose, I am going to explain the measures being  adopted, and the guarantees. That is, this is not an explanation  without a basis. This explanation has a basis that I will  explain when I get to explaining the solutions.    What I have to explain concerning consumption is brief, but  perhaps it is the most difficult and most complex aspect. We  will need the people's participation for this. It is as folows:    This year, electricity consumption is increasing. It is a  modest increase, of close to 6 percent, but an increase that  began last year when generation began to drop. That is, this  6-percent increase is not something... [changes thought] There  is part of the economy being reactivated.    Now, Cuban families have consumed 14 percent more  electricity  during this quarter as compared to the previous year.    [Rodriguez] Is this a 14-percent increase?    [Portal] Yes, an increase of 14 percent, despite the  blackouts and interruptions in the energy supply. This is  essentially due to the use of electric stoves. This can be  clearly seen at 1200 [local time], for instance, when generation  increases by 300 megawatts more than last year. And at 2000  [local time], generation increases by 350 megawatts. There is a  percentage of families who are very much linked to the use of  liquefied gas, processed gas, and kerosene [luz brillante]  nationwide, but today they are cooking on electric stoves of  many types, even homemade stoves. This has created a situation  that aggravates the matter.    I was explaining that this is the most complex issue because  we cannot say that the liquefied gas or the kerosene shortage  will be solved immediately because we cannot say that we have  the currency necessary to solve this problem. We cannot yet say  that we have the necessary resources. The same thing can be said  about the other fuels. An aggravation of the fuel shortage would  also aggravate our situation. I must objectively say, and  clearly explain to the people that this increase in consumption  cannot be met, not even by improving the thermoelectric plants  or the electrical network. And today we cannot ask the people to  give up that way of cooking because there is no other, better  way. But to the extent that we can manage to restore the supply  of liquefied gas and of kerosene, this situation must be  reversed.    [Rodriguez] Then we must stop using the electric stoves.    [Portal] Yes, we must stop using electric stoves. This is  nothing new. That is, the country has not really foreseen this  during this period or during this century. In the first place,  the country does not have the necessary thermoelectric plants  for that. That is, out of two million inhabitants, one million  are using electricity for cooking, and there is no  thermoelectric plant that can guarantee this. We must return to  the past.    The same thing happens with the electricity network. In a  block or a zone where you live, some 10, 15, or 20 percent of  the families might be using electricity for cooking. Well, that  transformer at that pole will not resist, that cable will not  resist long enough, nor will the internal electrical  installations in homes take this increase in consumption. This  is a very complex problem, and I wanted to explain this  situation, stemming from the increase in electricity  consumption. We must try to recover the supply of liquefied gas,  the gas that is sold on the street [passage indistinct].    In the future, when we can make investments in the sugar  mills and the situation with the special period is a bit more  favorable, we will have to think about gas, which also requires  a specific infrastructure.    But regarding electricity, it will be impossible for the  Cuban population to use electricity to cook over the next 10 to  15 years without nuclear reactors or anything else. We are going  to have no alternative but to ask for the population's  cooperation and discipline. In other words, as we.... [changes  thought] Furthermore, there are all types of stoves. You can  figure it out for yourselves. There are stoves with coils that  consume 1 kilowatt of electricity. Cuba has 2.7 million  families. Just 100,000 families using these stoves could consume  100 megawatts.    And 200,000 families will consume 200 megawatts; 300,000  families will consume 300 megawatts. That is what the Matanzas  thermoelectric plant generates. Then 500,000 families will  consume 500 megawatts, but there is no way to cope with this.  Today there is no way to cope with this. You have seen that the  peak demand... [changes thought] And not seeking to justify the  explanation or to change the thought, I do not want to refer to  other increases in energy consumption. But in the television  schedule, for instance, we know that there are illegal  installations being made, so if the use of television is  increased, this will also increase consumption.    There are other things increasing the consumption of  electricity. The most significant of all is the electric stove.  This should not be. It can affect other activities that are  vital to the economy. The population itself suffers because  someone who has this type of stove causes an outage for three or  four other families. In other words, in just three or four  hours, the situation becomes complicated and one part of the  population affects another. That is, the outages get off  schedule. This is a phenomenon that I wanted to explain.    [Rodriguez] Mr. Minister, I believe the Cuban population  prefers cooking with gas rather than with electricity. I believe  they will cooperate, especially since they prefer to cook with  other types of....    [Portal, interrupting] Yes, but 70 percent of the population  cooks with kerosene [luzbrillante]. At this point, the  population cannot stop cooking with kerosene. When the  Revolution triumphed, half the population was cooking with wood  and coal -- 52 percent of the population.    [Hector Rodriguez] Fifty-two percent?    [Portal] Yes, they used wood and coal. The use of kerosene  and gas increased, and the living standard improved.  Nevertheless, this is not the best fuel to use. As you have  already mentioned, gas is much better.    To begin discussing solutions, I wanted to explain that the  electricity we have.... [changes thought] It has been repeatedly  explained that electricity is not stored, but instead, is  generated at the moment. The population can see that as the  power plants generate electricity, the energy is immediately  consumed.    In the past, we always had back-up power plants generating  at  lower capacity. As soon as there were problems, their capacity  was increased. All it took was anywhere between 1 and 10  minutes. It was very fast. We do not have this today. When a  generating unit is taken offline, there is an immediate outage  or interruption that cannot be announced in advance because it  is practically instantaneous. The country and the population  suffer very much because of this, and the situation will not be  solved immediately because of the problem we have with  generating capacity.    The other thing that is very clear is that our system is set  up like other systems in other parts of the world: It does not  take away electricity, but supplies electricity. In other words,  the electrical networks are to supply. We have made several  changes and small investments to isolate certain services from  the normal circuits. These are hospitals; economic activities  important for the country; the tourism industry, to a certain  extent; and the sugar mills.    But here in Havana City, approximately 30 percent of the  families practically never have power outages, such as in Habana  Vieja, where it would be technologically impossible. There are  other parts of Centro Habana and parts of Vedado, where it would  also be impossible. There are also circuits associated with a  pediatric hospital, the Hermanos Almeijeiras, and the Calixto  Garcia, where it is very difficult to isolate the families. What  happens is that families not on those circuits suffer longer  outages.    In July and August of 1993, we agreed that during times of  difficulty, especially here in the capital, and in the rest of  the provinces they also do this.... [changes thought] I believe  I should explain that there are several provinces that, despite  last year's improvement, have had anywhere from 12 to 16 hours  of outages a day for many days, weeks, months. In other words,  what happened in the capital for 15 days [as heard] is similar  to the rest of the country. The rest of the country has been  facing a very serious situation.    Because of the concentration level that exists in the  capital, where approximately 2 million people live, and because  of the problems we have been having, we always try to prioritize  the capital. But at this moment, at the height of the sugar  harvest, when not producing sugar, or the plan being affected by  power outages would be a hard blow to our country, we must  guarantee the energy needed for all exportable activities: the  sugar harvest, the nickel industry, the tobacco harvest, for  which electricity is used to dry the leaves. There have even  been outages in this area. We have had to make an extra effort  to prevent outages for that industry. We must preserve those  activities. I believe the population must agree with this  because we are defending the population and the country when we  act in this manner.    It is true that not everyone has a relative in the  hospital, but we cannot become uneasy, nervous, or tense and  take the energy away from a pediatric hospital, or another  important hospital where there are sick people, or people having  surgery.    I mention this because there have been incidents in various  places. Some malicious people believe that the electric service  will be restored through that type of pressure. I can assure you  of two things: First, we act with professionalism in this and  are convinced it is the way we must behave. When the power is  interrupted in a place.... [changes thought] Secondly, we act  with conviction. We are defending this like the majority of the  population. That is one thing that cannot be changed. In other  words, the fact that one acts with conviction in not affecting  hospitals, water management systems, or cold storage centers  which cannot be changed.    So, they can do what they want, but we.... [changes thought]  Our people must trust that we will continue to act that way.    [Rodriguez] That is fair.    [Portal] Do not worry about that. There are comrades who  have  been mistaken, but with much dignity and authority, we are going  to continue acting that way.    There are no privileges or anything like that in relation to  the outages. Banish the idea. If there are things that are  considered unjust, they must be reported and we will act on  them. In other words, we do not accept that type of behavior  from our comrades. I wanted to make that very clear.    Well, let us talk about material guarantees and their  financing. This year, we already have financing for some $3  million in resources, which are arriving. We are talking about  steel, special tubing, electrodes [electrodos], and gaskets.  Part of this is already arriving. Apart from this, there is  another $7 million which will be progressively allocated  throughout the year. Between the two, there is $10 million  destined for the generation of electricity.    It is not something reaching 70 or 80 percent, but  sufficient  to meet what the country has set as an objective. I already  explained that $2 million was provided last year, and that this  year, there is $10 million. This is five times more than last  year. But we must administer this money. This money is not  administered by any bureaucratic apparatus, but by the same  comrades who are conducting the maintenance work and who make  the decisions on what must be purchased now and what must be  purchased later. In this manner, the country has thus progressed  a great deal. That is, we have improved this part of the  administration. These people who must decide on what to buy are  people with experience, knowledge, and training.    Second measure: the preparation and implementation of the  maintenance and repair works I already explained. I want to add  that this will affect practically 60 percent of the installed  capacity today: that is, 1,800 megawatts.    This is very important because it will give more reliability  to the system. That is, if we are today putting into operation a  thermoelectric plant that experienced a breakdown in the  pipeline or some kind of leak, well, when this plant is repaired  and maintained, this plant gains more reliability, and thus  there will be fewer blackouts [words indistinct] and for this  reason I mention this as a second measure. This graph is  intended to increase the reliability, not only a percentage of  [passage indistinct] and the maintenance workers.    This means that our government officials have adopted an  exceptional measure concerning the thermoelectric plants and the  maintenance shops. The workers will also receive special  incentives, especially those who are directly involved,  beginning with the top engineer of a thermoelectric plant, that  man who plays the role of a director. I am referring to the top  engineer and all those under him. I am referring to that man who  is there on Saturday and on Sunday; that man who has a family,  and has the same needs in his home as any other Cuban citizen;  that man in charge of that shift, the plant operators who work  Saturdays and Sundays.    In our current situation, these comrades are continuously  submitted to a tremendous workload and pressure. Imagine working  Saturdays, Sunday nights, early morning. They also have to pick  up other workers so the plant may be working at top level to  improve the situation. This is the prevailing situation.    We have been talking to other workers, to other colleagues  from other ministries, and everyone agrees with the measures  adopted in the electricity area, because we know that the  harvest is being carried out under very difficult conditions by  workers in the sugar industry, which is our main industry. We  are aware of the workers' situation in this area. I am certain  that those workers are in agreement with measures adopted in the  thermoelectric plants because they know that workers here are  also working like them, 365 days a year.    I wish to add that those workers would agree with the  incentives to be given to the workers of the thermoelectric  plants because they are aware of the difficult conditions under  which they are working. These incentives, which will be in food,  et cetera, will be rigorously implemented.    We already have the first experience. It has to do with  discipline. To achieve the incentive that will be established,  the worker must have zero absence.    [Rodriguez] Zero absence?    [Portal] Yes, zero absence, and that includes tardiness. No  tardiness will be allowed. This also goes for sickness, because  if during the month a comrade gets sick and is taken to the  hospital or is treated at home, well, it must be justified. But  that is not enough. I say this because the sick leave rate is  very high, and it does not justify absenteeism. To achieve the  incentives, the worker must have zero absence.    The Basic Industry Ministry has special infirmaries for  those  workers with some kind of problem. That is, we have  professionalism and morale, and a revolutionary health system.  We take care of any worker who might get sick. If he needs help  at home, we go to his house to help him. But that is as far as  we can go. That is, this system of giving incentives will be  very strict.    [Rodriguez] These incentives are not for all, just for the  best, for those who fulfill their jobs.    [Portal] Yes, for the good workers. Well, I am talking about  discipline. And the other aspect I would like to mention is the  fulfillment of what I have just explained; that is, the  availability factor of thermoelectric plants, the fulfillment of  the repair and maintenance work. Listen, most of our workers are  well-disciplined. They are not worried about this. But I have to  say it because it must be clear to all sectors that this is an  exceptional decision, and that the country has made this  decision, together with the workers, and it aims at obtaining a  result. Otherwise, it will just be a mess. And it will not be  that way. If the country and the Revolution must trust someone,  the workers from the electricity area are the first to be  trusted.    This second measure looks more like an incentive because the  country and society want to recognize the role played by the  workers. I think this will yield a result. Yesterday, the  directors of the thermoelectric plants, the union leaders, and  our comrades have ratified the conditions under which this  incentive will be granted. We think that within the next few  days it will be implemented, especially during the first days of  May.    The other matter I wanted to discuss is that related to the  support given to the thermoelectric plants. The country's  constructive capacity is strong, and the Ministry of  Construction is supporting the repair and maintenance work both  in Santiago de Cuba and in Mariel, as well as in Nuevitas. That  is, to the extent that the resources arrive, the country will  have more possibilities for facing this problem. The SIME  [Steelworking Industry] is doing the same.    Concerning the consumption of electricity, both in state  organizations and in the homes, I just wanted to say the  following: We have to be very strict concerning production in  the most effective companies. This is being done by all  ministries. The electricity received must be used well. All the  unimportant areas must be eliminated, such as air conditioners.  These must be eliminated. That is, consumption must be minimal.  During these difficult months, we must try to use it as little  as possible.    Now, let me refer to the prioritized organizations, the  hospitals, the hotels, some industries, [changes thought] well,  there are industries that finance their own fuel and give away  their dollars; these are not prioritized industries. Several of  our comrades have traveled abroad. We have visited some  countries and were able to see what happens in hotels at dawn or  in the evening -- all lights and systems are extinguished. Well,  I do not want to [words indistinct]. The organizations are  already working in making a thorough control or inspection, or  whatever might be necessary, to prevent the electricity from  being misused at a given time of day. We must adopt these  measures now more than ever. This will be indispensable over the  next few months.    A new system is being prepared in the capital, which is more  complex. It is a disconnection system that will be implemented  when a thermoelectric plant unexpectedly stops operating. That  is, there will be a system to regulate the level of electricity  supply to help us regulate consumption. That is, if 30 percent  of the overall capacity is to be released, well, that is what we  are going to do. We are working on this.    Finally, I also want to mention something I consider  important, that there are two thermoelectric plants under  construction. One in Holguin, specifically in Felton. Both were  made by Czechoslovakia. But the company that had supplied them  has fulfilled its commitment. In previous years when we had a  serious fuel shortage that also affected the nickel plant  located in the same province, these units helped guarantee the  supply of energy. And we expect to finish the first unit by the  end of the year.    [Rodriguez] The one in Felton.    [Portal] Yes, in Felton. This unit can produce 250  megawatts.  In Santiago de Cuba the Rente plant has not been able to  stabilize the generation of more than 200 megawatts during the  entire year. You can thus imagine the significance of generating  250 megawatts by the end of the year in the eastern region,  starting in Las Tunas. More than 3.6 million Cubans live in this  area, that is, 35 percent of our population. This means that  electricity generation in this territory will be improved, and  this will also improve the supply of electricity in the western  region because there will be no more need to extend electricity  supply toward the eastern region. This is to take place by the  end of the year, and is not something that will take place right  now. But I wanted to tell you that we are receiving resources  little by little. The work has not been suspended and the  workers are prepared to continue. I believe this is objective  information given by the provincial government, the party, the  Construction Ministry, and the workers' contingent. This can  really be achieved, and perhaps 18 or 24 months later we will  have the second unit. That means 500 megawatts. That is, if the  overall system generates 3,000 megawatts, 500 megawatts  represent almost 15 percent, between 12 and 15 percent.    There is another 100-megawatt unit, unit number 11 of the  Soviet- made 100-megawatt plants. In the eastern part of Havana  there are five 200-megawatt units. There are three 100-megwatt  and five 200-megawatt units. The five 200-megawatt units are no  longer operating and will not be repaired. They are part of  other aspirations, of other levels of development which we will  not reach. But that 100-megawatt unit is very important. As I  explained before, it is sitting on an oil deposit. Thus, some  350 new megawatts will be generated by the end of the year. This  is almost 12 percent. This is a unit that will also improve the  country's generation, by almost 12 percent of the overall  production. And when the other 250-megawatt unit begins  operating, it will increase by another percentage point. If we  generate 500 or 600 megawatts in the east, that is almost 20  percent of the overall system. But this is still under  construction; this is what we wanted to explain in this  introduction.    [Rodriguez] Very well, minister. Let us now give the floor  to  our guests, the reporters. I do not know whether to begin from  the left or the right. I think Maribel wants to speak. Maribel  Acosta is from Radio Rebelde.    [Acosta] The explanation has been very broad, and we wanted  to get into details. According to your explanation, the energy  crisis we are experiencing today is caused by the thermoelectric  plants and not by the petroleum crisis. You also said that the  use of Cuban crude oil was relatively safe, that is, that the  maintenance problem existed with or without the use of the Cuban  petroleum, so you did not proscribe the use of the Cuban oil.  You also mentioned a maintenance timetable which will be  implemented soon, and that this must lead the country to reach a  generating capacity of 60 percent by the end of the year. My  question is this: How long or when will the current blackouts be  reduced? After such a long time, how will this situation,  specifically the situation of the blackouts, be reversed?    [Portal] Maribel, this situation is affecting the entire  country. The situation in the capital today is what the  provinces have been experiencing for many months. This has been  a lengthy period. The situation prevailing over the past 15 days  because of the breakdown of the Cespedes thermoelectric plant,  which I already explained, and because of other failures here in  the capital, I cannot say is exceptional. This situation has  been affecting the entire country, but here in the capital the  situation is worse because of the situation of services,  overpopulation, the tall buildings...[changes thought] that is,  we are well aware of this situation; even the water supply was  affected at a given moment. That is, this is a very difficult  situation.    Then, the generation of electricity has not been restricted  to 15 hours. That is, it has been improving because it was  dropped to nine and eight hours. But I want to explain this  because in your question you mentioned the fuel issue, and we  cannot say that there will be no difficulties with fuel. We will  have difficult moments throughout the year, and it is possible  that we may have a fuel shortage. We must be prepared not only  to include the available capacity but to face any difficulty.    For this reason I was explaining the measures that will be  adopted. I explained in the beginning that this is not possible.  I explained in the beginning that we are going to seek  solutions, not miracles. We do not think blackouts will be  solved in a short period of time. It is not possible, not even  by generating more electricity or producing more fuel, because  today we are generating a certain amount of electricity; we  cannot generate, just overnight, the same amount of electricity  we used to generate some three years ago. The country does not  have enough currency to say that the blackouts will end in one,  two, three, or five months. The timetable of repairs, Maribel,  is being fulfilled. That is, the Matanzas [plant] was paralyzed  in September and we are already beginning to recover our  capacity. I said that when the Matanzas [plant] stopped  operating, generating capacity was approximately 36 percent; now  we have between 44 and 45 percent, and it must keep increasing  to stabilize at 50 percent by July or August. Then it must keep  increasing to reach 60 percent. Do you understand this?    [Acosta] And what would this 60 percent represent as far as  the blackouts?    [Portal] Well, concerning electricity generation, we believe  that by increasing generation to 60 percent by the end of the  year, the blackouts during the day will be eliminated. That is  my belief. The blackouts that take place at night...[changes  thought] well, there must be other reasons. But I do not want to  give you the idea that there will be no problem with fuel, that  everything has been stabilized, etc. No. The problems I have  mentioned concerning financing...[changes thought] the nickel  production and not even the sugar industry will be sufficient to  solve this problem. I want to remind you that we started the  blackouts in late 1989 and throughout 1990. That is, we had to  start blackouts because it was impossible to avoid them, even by  importing 6 million tons of petroleum, and much less with the  1.2 million tons we will have this year. We hope for a little  more.    [Rodriguez] Of national crude oil?    [Portal] Yes, national crude oil. If we did not have the  national crude, Maribel, I could not have told you this story.    [Rodriguez] That is, if we speak in sports terms, we have  saved the game. It has saved our game. Susana Lee, your turn to  ask.    [Lee] Minister, you have already answered a number of  questions we and some listeners wanted to ask. Nevertheless, I  want to ask you something about electricity bills. With so many  blackouts, the bills have also been increased. This is one  question, on electricity bills. Moreover, in the workers'  parliaments which were held recently, many people proposed  raising the electricity rate as a way to streamline the economy.  What is the truth about this, or what are your ideas about it?    [Portal] On this issue, I am forced to say that Cuba is one  of the countries where people pay their electricity bills with  greater discipline. I must say this, now that you ask me this  question about bills. This shows that our people....[changes  thought] We have 2.5 million families who must pay for the  electricity they use. And today the family's debt for  electricity is less than [words indistinct]. This is only one  example. The same thing happens with the state. This is the  largest organization in the country and it has a billing system  different from other state organizations, but it is a system  that works. Now that you have asked the question, I want to  convey my appreciation for that discipline, which has not been  lost.    [Rodriguez] Does everyone pay electricity bills?    [Portal] Yes, everyone does. It is true that some bills are  collected at the house, but bills can also be paid in one of our  units, at the banks, or at the post office. There are easy ways  to pay these bills, but the people....[changes thought] Well, in  some provinces payments have been delayed, but have been  recovered and the discipline has not been lost.    The electricity rate per family has increased 14 percent  despite the blackouts. It is obvious, Susana, that when the  blackouts are restored -- and I thank you for asking this  question because it gives me the opportunity to explain this --  when we restore the electricity supply, it surges into the  system, the refrigerator, the television set, the lights, etc.;  everything is turned on, and the discipline which has been  excellent is lost. When one gets used to cooking with  electricity, it is impossible to consume less electricity, even  when there are blackouts at the time for cooking, when  electricity is in heavy demand. For this reason I think there is  an increase in the electricity bills, and of course the people  worry about this situation. But part of the energy is recovered  despite the blackout. Of course, television programs are not  recovered. But the iron and the refrigerator do recover some of  the energy. That is, part of the energy is recovered. This has  been demonstrated, and the electric meters record it and it must  be paid. That must be the cause of the increase.    The other question is also important. Many capitalist  countries, especially those in which the consumer society  supposedly tends to increase expenditures, have performed  calculations and reached the conclusion that they save more or  obtain more benefits from increasing the utility rates, although  this might favor savings, than from building new thermoelectric  plants and increasing the generating capacity. This is true in  the United States and other countries. Our rates are fixed: nine  cents, regardless of whether consumption is higher or lower.  Most countries have already been replacing this system  gradually: the greater the consumption, the higher....[changes  thought] This is just the opposite of what prevailed here after  the Revolution, when the greater the consumption, the lower the  payment. This has been changing. Now, what is our conclusion?    No decision has been made on this; neither can I talk about  rates. But we have analyzed the following: Forty-two percent of  the Cuban population consumes up to 100 kwh of electricity. And  this consumption is approximately 25, or between 25 and 30  [percent], of the overall energy in the residential sphere. That  is almost half of the population.    [Rodriguez] It is 42 percent.    [Portal] Now, whom does that figure represent? That figure  represents low-income families. We have this well calculated.  There are the retired people, low-income workers, this or that,  workers in general, etc. Well, one proposal is that the rate  should be fixed for that part of the population. The rate that  is valid today should be maintained. And this rate is up to nine  pesos monthly. This is one idea.    Then, those families that consume between 100 and 300 kw  must  pay that rate up to the first 100 kw; above 100 kw, they must  pay a different rate.    [Rodriguez] After 100 kw, the rate should be higher.    [Portal] Yes. If you double the price per kilowatt/hour to  20  pesos, to give an example, you are stimulating people not to  consume over 100 kw. You know that today it is forbidden to  consume over 300 kw. This is included in the plan, even though  the use of electric stoves and so forth complicates it. But we  will never authorize a consumption higher than 300 kw, even when  this is stabilized. We will penalize consumption above 300 kw,  and you know what the punishment will be: The electricity will  be shut off for 10 days the first time, then for 30 days. This  has been done several times. This has created discipline. This  is a preliminary idea I am giving you, Susana.    [Rodriguez] And are you and the ministry studying this  possibility?    [Portal] Yes. Well, other organizations are charged with  studying how much is collected through this channel. But as we  have been taught, electricity conservation is very important for  us, not electricity sales. The problem is not to collect more  but to prevent people from consuming more. And electricity rates  cannot be liberated because in that case, a person who obtains  money through several channels will be free to consume  electricity. This will not be allowed. The plan must be  maintained. This is the idea, Susana, and it seems to be  accepted by most of the people. And if some of the people do not  agree, well, we will have to raise the price above 100 kw and  impose a very strong punishment.    [Rodriguez] The idea is to stimulate electricity  conservation.    [Portal] That is the idea.    [Rodriguez] Osvaldo?    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Minister, I want to return to the  subject  that most irritates people: the blackouts. You answered a  question on why some zones are affected by blackouts while  others are not, especially those priority zones such as  hospitals, hotels, tourist centers, water pumping systems, and  refrigeration plants. But some people think that blackouts are  more frequent in their zones than in others and imagine that the  frequency is lower in other provinces. Also, we have received  calls here in the studio and are still receiving messages from  our viewers stating that service is often interrupted,  especially at night. It was mentioned that Revolution Square  tonight was affected by intermittent blackouts. The lights were  on and off several times tonight. People also asked why the ball  games are played at night when we are facing this situation. Why  aren't the games shifted to the daytime? Perhaps Hector  Rodriguez will help you answer this question. But, in general, I  would like you to expand a little more on the outlook for  improvement of the thermoelectric plants, on the outlook for  blackouts and whether they save oil, because this is another  point often asked by the people. Because, as you said, when the  lights go back on, normally the refrigerators start working,  everyone turns their equipment on, and consumption rises.    [Lee] I would like to add something to this: People have  also  asked about the zones not affected by blackouts in  municipalities with underground power lines. Many television  viewers have asked about this. Those people fear that the lines  could develop problems because they are so old; they want to  know what solutions there may be for the underground lines.    [Hector Rodriguez] That is like asking me...    [Portal, interrupting] Very well. There are circuits that  are  cut off. Not all circuits have the same load, the same number of  houses, or the same economic objective. That is the fact.    The instructions given to our comrades is to try to be as  fair as possible, that the blackouts be as equal as possible for  all. If the blackout is for six hours, then it will be six hours  for all. And if it is for four hours, then four hours for all.  There may be some guidelines that are not being fulfilled during  this period, but we are trying to fulfill them as much as  possible. We are also trying to maintain the best discipline in  this area.    But concerning the fact that we are being unfair with this  or  that circuit, and that anyone can reach that conclusion, I have  my doubts. I find it very difficult. We are controlling this  continuously, and the control is in effect. We are always trying  to control everything, especially when there are complaints. And  people are really zealous about this. Perhaps on some circuits  the blackouts are a little bit longer, an hour or half-hour  more, because of the load affecting that circuit.    Since consumption and generation are simultaneous, measures  are adopted to include 50 megawatts more to this or that  circuit. Then the capital must choose the circuits and  distribute power gradually. If there is one circuit with a load  of 25 megawatts, or two circuits with 25 megawatts each, or one  circuit with 30 and another with 20 megawatts, and there is  another circuit with 10 megawatts, the circuit with 10 megawatts  will wait, and the others will be added to a little more, and  the following day a little more will be given to this and to  another circuit, until the national power system says: Now you  can add another load. This happens everyday. That is, the  additional charge cannot be added instantly. It must be  established gradually. So this is not and will not be exact. It  is not possible.    And there are people who have been doing this for more than  three years. This has been approved. The people know that when  electricity generation was rather stable -- which we hope to  recover by the end the year -- there was discipline. The  disconnection hours were well established. This was an  achievement, and I am certain that this will be restored to the  extent that the conditions improve.    Now, connection or disconnection is usually the consequence  of the overload on the circuits. This is a fact which I tried to  explain, especially concerning the most complicated problems  such as electric stoves, the overload on circuits, etc. I tried  to explain this because when a transformer is overloaded, there  is no way to solve it. And the light is turned on and off, on  and off, and transformers cannot take this for a long time like  a switch that is just turned on and off.    You must have seen also that tree pruning has begun. A tree  branch can also cause a problem to a circuit or to a  transformer. But this is not the essential thing we are  discussing today. The essential thing we are discussing today is  the overload on circuits that cannot handle a further increase.    Ball games do not consume more than what 500 families would  consume. Ball games are played in a stadium. You know that the  programming has been changed, adjusted. Most games take place  during the day, and this is a recreational activity very  important to our people, for their virtue and [word indistinct].  But concerning the playoffs that are played in the stadium...    [Hector Rodriguez, interrupting] Yes, there is only one  national stadium, and the games are played there during the day.    [Portal] Then 2.5 million families will have electricity.  And  perhaps some 1,500 families will be affected when this occurs.  Well, I think, Osvaldo, that for the time being, independently  of the critical situation we are facing, we must try to maintain  that entertainment which is very important.    [Hector Rodriguez] It is the main national entertainment.    [Portal] Yes. What was your question, Susana?    [Lee] I asked about the underground cables.    [Portal] Oh, yes. It is true that the underground network in  Habana Vieja and part of central Havana is rather old. Part of  the cables have been replaced, but the problem here is not the  cables themselves but the system. It was a very modern and  sophisticated system for that time. It automatically regulates  the voltage when there is an interruption and reestablishes it  through a different channel. I think it is too costly for Habana  Vieja, for the historical part of Havana, to have that type of  electrical system. And we must take care of it as something  precious in the capital. What we have to do in that zone, and in  all priority zones, is to demand, to be very scrupulous on  electricity conservation. Yesterday, for instance, in order to  make the distribution, we cut off the circuit; but we turned it  on again, especially since it creates problems for some  refrigeration facilities. For this reason this zone is turned  off only in difficult and unavoidable moments. The system in  this zone is expected to last several years more, and it will  because we are taking good care of it. It has not been  abandoned. But what you said is true, and we must demand a  maximum savings there, both by the state organizations and by  the people who live there.    [Hector Rodriguez] Does that answer your question, Maribel?    [Acosta] Yes, thank you. Comrade minister, you have said  that  $10 million will be invested this year in maintenance and repair  of the thermoelectric plants. What does this figure represent in  relation to the current needs? And also, in our current  relations with the former Socialist Bloc, to what extent is our  country or our technology capable of guaranteeing the technology  which you said has reached 66 percent of the thermoelectric  plants existing in the country, and are the new investments  linked to these plants?    [Portal] Yes. Well, we have $10 million. And you might ask:  What is the minimum necessary for the electrical system as a  whole? Considering the $35 million we used to receive for the  electrical network, for transformers and all the rest of the  system, the level was much higher. The needs for the  thermoelectric plants could be estimated at approximately $20  million, between $18 and $20 million. But with $10 million we  will be able to fulfill what has been established, as I have  explained. This is an important figure.    Negotiations are under way with Russian and Czech officials  to explore the possibility of obtaining some resources for these  thermoelectric plants. They have listened to our requests with  great responsibility and gravity and they are studying the  possibility of participation or economic cooperation. But this  cooperation will be financed and we must pay for it. I am not  talking about any other type of assistance. I am talking about  economic cooperation, about business. We hope this will be  resolved before the end of the year, and I think it will. But I  do not want to confirm this categorically or to create false  expectations.    There are many people in these countries who regret what has  happened to relations with our country; and there is an idea,  wish, will, to reestablish commercial relations with our country  on new foundations. And we, of course, would never refuse to do  this. Our people...[rephrases] I do not think that could have  [words indistinct].    That is possible (?in Mariel). There is certain  technological  equipment, such as a turbine, or a generator...[rephrases] There  are things that really must be taken care of by the factory that  planned them. There are very specific things that were done  there. There is a part of the thermoelectric plant that is  universal. Let us say that to do this or that [words indistinct]  you can substitute one piece of equipment by another. That is,  it is always possible to obtain a part of the equipment in  another country, if that problem exists. But, well, that  possibility does exist, and I think it only fair to say so. That  is to say: It is not an impossibility that our national  electricity system could receive a certain participation from,  do business with, this company of the two...[rephrases] of the  countries that inherited the installations, the workshops, and  factories that used to produce these (?installations).    [Hector Rodriguez] Osvaldo?.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Yes. Mr. Minister, the nation ended up  practically paralyzed last year -- its economy, its factories.  However, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year,  certain plants began operating, which I suppose has increased  the demand for electricity. You explained -- I refer once again  to the chart by which you explained the repairs to, the  maintenance of the thermoelectric plants -- how capability is to  be recovered. And I would ask you: Could the electricity system  compromise the future of our economic recovery, which certain  specialists see as being imminent?    [Portal] I can answer that categorically for you: With these  measures that have been taken, the national electricity system,  its generating capacity, is not going to constitute a brake to  development or to exiting the special period. That is why,  Osvaldito, it is good to reiterate: When I explained that 86  percent of the capacity...[rephrases] It is one of the countries  with the newest electrical installations. I do not know whether  there is any other 25 years old whose generating capacity is at  86 percent. It seems to me that very few countries (?can do  this), and that has been created over these last 30 years of  Revolution. I mean, that is a fact; understand, Osvaldo? And  that is very reassuring.    The 500 megawatts [words indistinct] plus the 100 equals 600  additional new ones. I mean: In order to pull out of the special  period over the next few years, by the end of the century, the  nation's installed capacity today, by maintaining and repairing  and everything that we have explained that we have already begun  to do and to reestablish...[rephrases] There is no doubt: The  electricity networks are powerful. The country is crossed from  east to west with 220-volt and 110-volt lines, which must also  receive maintenance. But powerful substations were established  on most of the national territory. I reaffirm what I explained a  while ago. And the generating capacity is recoverable.    Later, at some point in the future, we will have to build  new  thermoelectric plants, of course, but....[leaves sentence  unfinished]    I also want to tell you that the country  anticipated...[rephrases] for example, there are the  five...[rephrases] this one here in eastern Havana, a  thermoelectric plant which is prepared to be [words indistinct].  The one in Matanzas is ready for another to be set up beside it.  We would no longer have to build a canal to supply and drain sea  water. All the workshops and all that are already there. Felton  was planned to accommodate two more units. That is to say that  we today have -- just as was done in Mariel, which was planned  to accommodate eight units although it began with two or four or  so...[rephrases] that, today, is very important: These three  thermoelectric plants -- Felton, the one in Havana, and the one  in Matanzas -- are prepared to expand their capacities without  the necessity for big investments in civil engineering, etc. The  machines do have to be purchased; that is something we will have  to take into account in the future, if necessary. It would be  very quick work to install, to expand capacity, as developments  might require of us.    [Hector Rodriguez] Susana?    [Lee] Mr. Minister, you were speaking of oil extraction. You  were talking about the importance of the almost 900,000 tons  that are used to generate electricity. I think it would be a  good idea for you to talk to us a little about the prospects  that exist as regards oil extraction, about the work being done  in the search for oil, about the new technologies that are being  applied to increase efficiency in extraction. That is what I  would like to ask you.    [Portal] I do not know whether this might not take me off  the  topic a little. I would not be against answering,  but...[addresses moderator] if you authorize me to do so,  I....[leaves sentence unfinished]    [Hector Rodriguez] We have time.    [Portal] Will anything be left on the other topic? Can we  get  into that?    [Hector Rodriguez] The matter of generating electricity has  been exhausted.    [Acosta] Hector, fundamental concerns that we have heard  from  the population.    [Hector Rodriguez] I do not know whether the minister has  anything else.    [Portal] I have tried to explain without exhortation, with  the greatest possible objectivity, right? I would like perhaps  to comment that the electricity sector workers -- the sector  chiefs, technicians, [words indistinct] in general -- bear an  extraordinary responsibility on their shoulders.    [Hector Rodriguez] Of course.    [Portal] They have the foundation, which is what has  provided, I think, the authority, the respect for what we have  had to do over these past three or four years -- an authority  won by being one of the branches that for 25 years,  uninterruptedly, grew from year to year, without failing to grow  for a single year. And with diminishing fuel consumption from  year to year. Efficiency increased from 400 grams in 1959 to  270, through investments and so forth. That is not the work of  the electricity sector workers alone. I mean, construction  workers, the nation, the government, the Revolution all worked  on it. But that foundation was exploited, and at a level  comparable to that of the Western countries. That is important.  The nation's 95-percent electrification is something  spectacular. We know about other countries, in Asia, for  example...[changes thought] Vietnam itself, with whose  authorities we have spoken, is 35-percent electrified. In Latin  America, there are other countries...[rephrases] (?low)  countries. China itself is not electrified to the extent that we  are. They may be at 75 or 80 percent. They have areas with many  problems still, rural areas. The country is very large. It is  very difficult. We, ourselves, have 95-percent electrification.    I say this now, at the end, to give confidence that we (?are  going to solve) this problem. I mean, this is not a problem that  will be delegated to improvised people, people who...[rephrases]  No, we are really working, soberly, and there will be a response  by the electricity industry, by our workers, by everyone. I  think that the support from the Ministry of Construction, the  comrades from the (?SIME) [Steelworking Industry], and the  comrades from other forces that are going to join in, as the  resources become available to us, is also important. This gives  us great confidence, really, that the country will be able to  recover from this situation we are in.    The other subject is one that is very...    [Hector Rodriguez, interrupting] Mr. Minister, excuse me:  Before you go into (?that), a viewer has just called in and is  asking -- he seems not to be fully satisfied, even with all the  explaining -- whether the Cienfuegos CEN, the Cienfuegos Nuclear  Power Plant, will be finished, and whether this would solve the  country's electrical power problem.    [Portal] All right, then let us finish with the CEN.    [Hector Rodriguez] Then petroleum would be the last thing,  right?    [Portal] Yes. Well, we halted the CEN. We halted it. The  commander in chief himself, as you know, met with the workers  there and explained the decision, one of the most painful we  have had to make. The Russian and Cuban Governments have  confirmed their will to do everything they possibly can to  finish the CEN -- the first and second reactors -- their will,  desire, and interest. Both governments need a third partner to  participate in the Juragua CEN. The three countries would have  to share that investment, and then, logically, sell for hard  currency the energy generated at the Juragua CEN. And we would  have to pay those countries for it, for our country -- for the  portion that would correspond to it.    The country does not today have the financial means to  continue building the Juragua nuclear power plant, and we would  have to effect a business deal of that nature.    The work has been preserved. The civil engineering work for  the first reactor is finished. It is fabulous. There you have  the reactor, and part of the equipment, preserved. Over the past  two years, the country has been inspected by the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], rigorous inspections that have  helped counter propaganda campaigns abroad regarding CEN  technology and so forth. We have received the IAEA technicians;  their recommendations were that the CEN is being perfectly  preserved and that a business deal can go forward with it, that  the nuclear power plant can be continued.    If that inspection had not been positive, had there been any  doubt, I would not be talking about this. So, I mean, those are  the conditions today. The Russians, the Cuban and Russian  Government and the energy authorities of the two countries, are  today analyzing things and negotiating with a number of  international firms that have expressed an interest in the  matter.    That is very interesting. It is a complex business, as you  can well imagine. Difficult, but it would really allow us to  finish, if it is feasible and could happen.    These are very complex negotiations. Those are our  prospects,  as regards the CEN. We do not have, right now, the financial  means to continue the work ourselves, alone. That is clear, and  that is why the work was halted. And, very responsibly, both the  comrade construction workers -- who remain there -- and our  comrades who are prepared for exploitation, are there. And the  CEN could be two years away from being finished.    If it were to be set up and finished, it would mean 400  megawatts of nuclear-generated power. That is what I can tell  you regarding that matter.    [Acosta] Does the third partner already exist, Mr. Minister?    [Portal] No, and maybe if it did, I would not be able to  tell  you so, at this moment. [all chuckle] So let's go on to the oil:  In the case of the oil...    [Hector Rodriguez, interrupting] You would not be able to  tell us because they [not further identified] are so alert to  every bit of business that Cuba does, to every single thing it  might buy, so as to block it immediately, apply pressure  immediately. Would that be the reason? Obviously.    [Portal] But as regards the technology of our nuclear power  plant and all that, even serious U.S. authorities already  acknowledge that the technology of our CEN is safe, that the CEN  can be finished, that there is no problem. We have information  from very important U.S. Government authorities that have  acknowledged that there is no difficulty. That smooths out the  way for other partners to be able to...[rephrases] finish the  CEN. So, let's go on to the oil.    [Hector Rodriguez] Yes, that (?question) of Susana's is  still  floating around.    [Portal] The oil: Here, maybe we can share certain things  that could be encouraging to our population. As is known, we  divided the island up into blocs -- both land and sea, some 26  blocs -- for exploring for oil, and we have negotiated  investments by several companies in oil exploration. To a  certain extent, this is related to the energy thing, the  nation's situation and all.    Why do I say this? Because this kind of business deal is one  of the most difficult, because the foreign companies have to run  the risk -- investing, during a first stage, tens of millions of  dollars and, in a second stage, hundreds of millions of dollars!  That is: You have to put money into it. And in one way or  another, over $50 million have already been invested by these  companies in the Cuban oil business. All together, it is already  nearing $100 million in seeking, exploring for, oil.    These companies invest, and if oil is found they recover  their investment -- through a part of that oil, depending on how  much oil there is and what quality is obtained. If it is a big  deposit, and the oil is good quality, it can be as much as 90  percent for the Cuban side and 10 percent for the foreign  company. During the period of recovery of the investment, it is  to be 50-50. Once the investment is recovered, in the first few  years, once those are past, it depends on the volume and quality  of oil found.    Well, of the seven most developed countries in the world --  and I can mention the United States, Japan, the FRG [as heard],  etc. -- three are investing in petroleum exploration in Cuba.  They are France -- several companies -- Canada, and Great  Britain.    I do not think I am telling any secret in saying that Great  Britain is the main U.S. ally, a country which in its  parliamentary organizations has publicly studied its relations  with Cuba. It did so in the House of Lords. And it is  interesting to see how some British political figures and  businessmen analyze the U.S. policy on Cuba, and how they  realize that Americans have a double objective with us: a  political objective, which obviously seeks to destroy the  Revolution by all means; and an economic objective, which is to  prevent other countries from investing in our country. When the  United States decides to lift the blockade, let us say in 20 or  100 years [changes thought] or perhaps, if an important oil  deposit is found, the blockade will no longer have any effect. I  hope this will happen.    But it is quite interesting to see how these political  figures analyzed this situation and reached the conclusion that  it is important to favor the trade of the former British  colonies which have natural, historical, and economic relations  with us. They have realized that our touristic development must  be related to the touristic development of many of those islands  that live on tourism, and that this is the moment to begin. They  have taken the first step. One of their companies has already  signed a petroleum research contract. That is, there are three  [as heard] countries: France, Canada, Great Britain, and also  Sweden.    I am not talking about the U.S. Government, but about its  oil  companies, the U.S. businessmen from the petroleum sector, and  other organizations such as the mining, iron and steel, and  tourism industry areas who have expressed concern about and are  fully aware of our situation, hoping to be authorized to invest  here. They have attended the meetings we held in Canada and in  Great Britain -- that is, in London and in Calgary -- where our  comrades submitted proposals. And the great U.S. companies were  there; they obtained all the information they needed and they  are up-to-date concerning this situation. That is, they are  willing to come here, but they also have other interests; but we  can see and feel that there is great interest in this area.    There is a search for oil today everywhere in Cuba, in  different stages. In some parts we are using the seismic  exploration system, which is a mandatory step. This is because  the seismic system determines the soil structure, the age of the  earth, the geology, and the characteristics of the place which  are best for drilling. If these structures are not revealed,  then no drilling takes place. That is the first step. It is a  guiding step, but millions of dollars must be invested in that  first step. If it takes place offshore, a special vessel will be  necessary. But if it is carried out on land, well, equipment of  highly developed technology is in use in the country.    Both on land and offshore, this highly sophisticated  equipment will supplement the information -- and it is fair to  say this -- the information we have developed with the former  Soviet Union for many years. The country has been well studied.  The country has seismic information; it has information on the  geology of solid minerals and of petroleum and for this reason  this study has been very useful, and for this reason we have  made quick progress. And today we have signed contracts for  exploration of the most promising areas in the country.    Then, at the conclusion of the seismic exploration step in  some areas, it has been determined that there are seismic  structures which are similar to the seismic structures of other  countries and which offer good drilling prospects. Drilling has  begun. Well, the drilling has begun offshore, and drilling by  these companies will also begin on land within the next few days  or next week. If the prospects were not good, we would  not....[leaves sentence unfinished] Now, if this study shows  that those sedimentary rocks are from the same time period as  those in other countries where oil was found, and whether they  contain petroleum or not, a decision will be made. But Cuba has  oil; we hope to extract 1.2 million tons this year, and there  are good prospects to increase this production.    Well, this is as much as I can tell you. We have taken the  seismic step, and the drillings have begun in those places, and  our hopes are not just abstract. Our hopes are real, and the  prospects are also real.    I also want to add that if oil is found, or let us suppose  that when an oil deposit is found, we must then determine how  much petroleum is in that deposit; depending on the structure,  three or four wells more must be drilled to determine the volume  of the petroleum existing in that place. The exploitation comes  later and can take two or three years, depending on the deposit  and its characteristics. But I think it would be foolish to try  to conceal any information from the people on this problem. I  think it would be very encouraging for the people to receive any  information of this type, and we are never going to conceal such  information. I thought, therefore, that it was important to  explain this.    These companies have other tasks which will also give us an  idea of how promising the petroleum business is in Cuba. The  fact is that using the old Soviet techniques, or the old Soviet  wells, we have contracted foreign companies to exploit these  wells. For instance, a foreign company chooses a well that was  producing 30 tons, 20 tons, 15, or 10 tons, and, using more  modern technology, increases the production of that well. Some  have increased two, three, or four times more. Some have reached  production of 60, 70, or 80 tons. And they started with 20 tons.  Then this increase in oil, which Cuba was never going to have,  was divided and shared with that company. That is, the basic  production is not negotiated. That is ours. But if production is  increased by using modern technology...[changes thought] and we  have been doing this over the past few years. That is, the  petroleum activity has this potential and we can enjoy it.    I did not want to discuss this from the political point of  view; but, well, this is just a feeling I have, and I have to  say it because this is what most Cubans are feeling. In this  period, every time we sign a contract of this sort, whether on  oil, nickel, mining in general, or in the quest of precious  minerals, or in tourism, etc., with non-U.S. companies, we feel  a satisfaction, and more than a satisfaction because we have no  prejudice but an assurance that in the future we must not do  this type of business with U.S. companies alone. This would  imply compromising our economic independence for the third time  with that powerful country. And this does not seem to be what we  Cubans want. We could not avoid it if the blockade were lifted.  But only in part, because we are not rejecting any offer. If the  American people want to enjoy our beaches, etc., we are not  going to say: Do not build hotels here; don't do this or that.  It would be foolish on our part to refuse these things.    But it is good that we build our own hotels, or build them  with the Spaniards, with the Italians or the Canadians, or with  any country in the world. Well, the Americans are delaying this.  But in the future, if the blockade is lifted, part of the U.S.  tourists will have to go to those hotels. We realize -- and it  is something I was trying to convey -- we feel as if we were  winning a war of independence each time we do business with  non-American capital. This is what I was trying to say.    But we cannot deny the fact that the United States, that  powerful country, that market about which no one has any doubt  because it is a high-level market with highly developed  technology, can be attractive to us as well. This feeling is  also shared by the other companies that come here today.    I want to add that we Cubans are loyal. We are loyal. The  Cuban loyalty has been proven. We are loyal even to our African  forefathers. And serious capitalists, representatives of the  upstanding companies, also feel that when we do business with  one of these companies, we are never going to betray them, not  even when the United States decides to lift the blockade.  Neither are we going to renegotiate the business or deals we  have signed.    [Hector Rodriguez] We are serious and loyal.    [Portal] And this is the rationale of the electricity issue  to which they refer so much. You have to see what is being  published abroad, how the news is distorted and the treatment  they give to this issue. They say: The country's electricity  generating capacity has fallen apart; do not invest in this area  anymore. Here is the truth about what they are saying.    For this reason, our reporters must try to be as objective  as  possible because it is obvious that they are trying to thwart,  to discourage people. But prestigious people are arriving here  continuously. And as soon as they arrive at the airport, they  realize the problems we are facing, especially the blackouts,  the transport and food problems, etc. Well, people immediately  refer to our preparation and the possibilities of doing business  here. They refer to our loyalty and honesty in our deals. No one  has to offer $1 million to a minister, or $2 million to  negotiate this or that. There is no corruption in government  circles. Many serious people are coming here, and not just  because they like to be here.    Not in vain are we in the 19th place in the world among  countries where investments can be made with greater security.  How many are behind us; but I do not want to mention names. I  believe the press has already published this, but they can  publish it again at any time; they can do it today, because this  is something very important.    We are one of the most promising countries for investments.  This also confirms our people's decision to fight and to  overcome all our problems. They do not want to be caught in a  situation of hunger, proceeding from here to there. No. our  people do not want this. They are taking this calmly and with  intelligence.    You can see that the situation stemming from the  electricity problem is very difficult. But we are facing it and  trying to overcome it. People know that this is not going to  last forever, and that we are not going to die without having  had a chance to fight and win.    We are also accused of not making changes, of not doing this  or that, when changes were made only a few months ago. This is  perceived by the capitalists who come here. We have made  tremendous changes in the economy. A few years ago we would not  even think of making these changes. We have made changes in  agriculture, changes related to the presence of foreign capital,  and to the decriminalization of the dollar. These changes hurt  because they are often unfair, but we have made them  courageously. We can also mention the self-employment jobs,  communications with the world abroad, relations with the  community of emigres, et cetera. These are crucial decisions,  and we must consider that there are still millions of decisions  to be made, decisions that are being studied.    But the decisions that were made are serious decisions,  decisions that are very important for the country. These  decisions are not reversible, and the peasants and agricultural  workers know this. They know that over the past few months, the  state administration has been replaced by cooperatives. They  know that there are guarantees, that they have security, and  that they can work the land as much as possible because the  fruits they produce will not be taken away from them. These are  important steps, because the most common criticisms we hear are  that no measures have been adopted, that the country is idle,  that no one works. This is inadmissible. For this reason I was  saying that it is important to explain. I think it is my duty to  explain this, to share this with the people. But we cannot often  share this. Excuse me if I am taking too much of your time,  Hector.    [Rodriguez] No, on the contrary. We thank you, minister. I  only want, if you wish, minister, to read a question posed by a  listener from Havana. It says: How much has the demand increased  this year at peak-consumption hours as a result of the use of  electric stoves?    [Portal] I mentioned this when I mentioned the 350 megawatts  at peak hour, but I failed to give the percentage. The demand is  increasing 24 percent. This is a high percentage, and we cannot  cope with it.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Minister, now that you are returning to  this subject of the electric stoves at the very end of your  participation in this program, allow me to ask you something  that also worries the people. The liquefied gas and the  kerosene: When will their distribution be reestablished?    [Portal] Tremendous resources must be used to achieve this,  and I cannot give you an exact date. This is not possible to  predict. I could say May or June, but there is a timetable to  repair the Nico Lopez refinery plant. In May, we are going to  import a good amount of gas, which is produced by the [word  indistinct]. But it is impossible to tell you that we are going  to solve this problem in a short time. I am only ratifying what  I said because this is one of the most difficult, complex issues  we must solve within the next few months.    [Hector Rodriguez] The electric stove issue seems to be  crucial.    [Portal] Yes.    [Acosta] Minister, concerning the petroleum prospects you  mentioned, is there a possibility of finding light petroleum in  the country?    [Portal] That is what we are looking for. [laughs]    [Hector Rodriguez] It must show up somewhere.    [Portal] But if heavy petroleum is found, it will be  welcomed. I think I will be forced to explain that we would use  it again. Not to talk about cement, but if it can be used in  producing cement, it will be of help.    [Hector Rodriguez] Well, the minister has been with us for  almost two hours. I think his explanations were very clear and  broad. I want to thank the minister for his presence here. I  think this is the first time he has participated in this  program. I have been after him for a long time, and he has been  saying that he would be glad to join us to talk about this  crucial electricity generation issue in the country.    I want to thank him for being here with us and for all the  information he has given to the country. I think all the  information was correct and on the mark. I believe he was  consistent with everything.    I also wish to thank the reporters who participated in this  program, and who have made the presence of Basic Industry  Minister Marcos Portal on this program possible. Thank you,  Minister, and although this was your first participation, I hope  it will not be the last.    [Portal] Thank you.     "

Delayed for months because of political uncertainty in Algeria, the approval of the first tranche of finance for the project means work can begin on the Trans-Med gas pipeline, to run from Algeria to Italy. The decision follows last week's visit to Rome by Algeria's foreign minister, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, and confirms that for Italy - Algeria's largest natural gas customer - it is back to business as usual. The total cost of the project, which will increase the volume of natural gas exported to Italy from an annual figure of 14.2bn cu ft to 25bn cu ft, is estimated at Dollars 5.8bn. The pipeline will link Mazara del Vallo in Sicily to the distribution point near Bologna.

0,FT934-17063 ,"FT934-17063 _AN-DJCANAECFT 931002   FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: VAT blow for charities and schools      By BETHAN HUTTON   CHARITIES and schools face having to pay value-aded tax on non-business electricity and gas bills for the first time next year, when the tax is imposed on fuel for domestic use. They could, however, benefit from a tax loophole which will also be of use to individuals. Residential homes for the elderly could also make substantial savings. Anyone with enough cash reserves can avoid the new tax simply by paying for several years' worth of fuel before the end of March next year. VAT is charged at the rate that applies at the date of invoice or payment, whichever is earlier. So, payments accepted before April 1 1994, when VAT is imposed on domestic fuel at 8 per cent, will be zero-rated and payments made before April 1 1995, when the rate is increased to 17.5 per cent, will be subject to VAT at 8 per cent. Chantrey Vellacott, the London-based accountancy firm, has calculated that a charity with annual fuel bills of Pounds 5,000 could make a net saving of Pounds 670 by paying two years' worth of bills in advance. This comes from a saving of Pounds 1,275 on VAT, less Pounds 605 in interest which would have been earned if the money had been kept on deposit at 5 per cent. Individuals could save smaller amounts, depending on their fuel consumption. Independent boarding schools and grant-maintained schools, if they have charity status, will be able to exploit the method, but independent day schools will not. This anomaly is because of the distinction between business and non-business activities. Teaching at grant- maintained schools is seen as a charitable function, so fuel used is zero-rated. Teaching at independent schools, even if they are charities, is defined as a business activity because pupils have to pay for it, so fuel is standard-rated. But fuel used to heat residential accommodation at boarding schools is zero rated at present. This means that grant-maintained schools should be able to avoid VAT by pre-paying their entire fuel bills, while boarding schools could pre-pay the portion of their bills relating to residential accommodation. According to Jeremy Bird, secretary of the Independent Schools Bursars Association, most schools are aware of the advance payment option. 'Schools will be thinking about it but, of course, to pay in advance you have to have the money. It is a cost-benefit exercise,' he says. In the same way, charities already pay VAT on fuel used for business activities (eg, shops) but non-business activities are zero-rated, so tax savings could be made by paying those bills in advance. Anyone planning to take advantage of this loophole needs to make sure their gas or electricity supplier is willing to accept advance payments rather than simply treating them as mistaken overpayments. Most electricity boards have said they are willing to co-operate in the tax avoidance exercise, but will not be publicising it or offering discounts for early payment. Payments should be accompanied by a letter to them explaining the purpose. One consideration for individuals hoping to avoid VAT in this way is how long they expect to stay in their present home. It is unlikely to be possible to transfer pre-payments between electricity and gas suppliers while maintaining the tax benefit. But charities, schools, and nursing homes, being less mobile, should not have this problem. Another group which might be able to benefit is residents of blocks of flats where heating is supplied centrally. It might be, however, that some blocks have been paying VAT wrongly on this fuel since 1990 when the tax was imposed on fuel for business use. This has yet to be clarified, though.

0,FT932-99 ,"FT932-99 _AN-DGABBAEWFT 930630   FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Seeboard increases dividend by 15.9% - Several hundred jobs to go in cost-saving exercise      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   SEEBOARD took the electricity sector's dividend increases to a new high yesterday by announcing a 15.9 per cent rise in its total pay-out, narrowly capping Northern Electric's 15.6 per cent rise announced on Monday. Seeboard will also be favouring shareholders by advancing the payment date for the final dividend by six weeks to August 23. The final is 14.3p, bringing the total for the year to March 31 to 20p. At the same time, however, the company announced that several hundred jobs would be lost in a cost-saving exercise. Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said: 'Seeboard delivered a strong performance in 1992-93 with increased profits, substantial progress in improving efficiency and positive action to reduce the cost of electricity for our customers.' Electricity prices for households and small businesses will be reduced by 3.3 per cent in September. The Hove-based company announced a 14.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from Pounds 98.4m to Pounds 112.7m. Earnings per share rose 15.9 per cent from 53.5p to 62p. The greatest part of the increase came from the supply business, where operating profit rose from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 13.3m. By contrast, the distribution business, which accounts for the bulk of earnings, was virtually unchanged at Pounds 91.9m. Units of electricity sold fell by 1.5 per cent, reflecting the recession. Other activities, which include the retailing business, made an overall surplus of Pounds 1.5m, up from Pounds 300,000. Southern Gas, the company's one-year-old gas trading venture, made a trading profit of Pounds 700,000, and now has 700 customers at 3,000 sites. Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive, said that the company was being restructured to create self-contained businesses and a smaller corporate head office at a new location in Crawley. This would reduce jobs by 500-600, on top of the 500 which the company has already shed since privatisation. 'There is a major cultural change going through the company to put the focus on profits, results and shareholder value,' he said. COMMENT Although the generous dividend helped boost the share price by 10p to 520p, the market was just as pleased by Seeboard's aggressive attitude towards costs. Its aim of being the industry's most efficient member puts it in a good position to deal with whatever comes out of Offer's pricing reviews. Management also took a conservative line on diversification yesterday, promising not to be tempted by its low gearing to undertake exotic ventures. At last night's close, the shares yielded just under 5 per cent, the lowest in the sector, confirming Seeboard's place as the market's favourite REC, but analysts warned that the early dividend payment could cause some disruptions.

0,FT922-8298 ,"FT922-8298 _AN-CENCNAA3FT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (18): When profit comes before policy - UK utilities face energy efficiency dilemma      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   A FEW years ago, Walt Patterson and his wife halved their electricity bill by replacing all their lights with low energy lamps. 'It was a pretty sizeable investment - about Pounds 10-Pounds 12 per light. But after two to three years we have already recovered that,' he says. Few householders are as enlightened as Mr Patterson, an energy specialist who was one of the first to preach the environmental gospel. But if only more of us would replace our lamps, the savings in national energy consumption would be 'spectacular', says Mr Patterson. 'If people caught on how much they could save, just for lighting, the regional electricity companies would be very worried. Their sales would drop like a stone.' There, he says, is the rub. The regional electricity companies which supply domestic customers are not promoting energy efficiency products because their profits depend primarily on selling more electricity, not helping customers to save it. Brenda Boardman, at Oxford University's Environmental Change Unit, agrees. 'At the moment, the regulation governing the regional electricity companies is structured around them being utilities, and being on a growth curve by selling more units,' she says. 'I want them to become energy service companies, selling warmth and lighting rather than units of electricity,' she says. This would mean the companies would consider insulating homes and installing low energy lighting as alternatives to supplying more power. There is, she says, enormous scope for saving. 'Say your fridge uses 100 units of energy. The average new fridge will use 90, a saving of around 10 per cent. If you are well informed, and buy the best fridge on the UK market you will be down to 43. And if you buy the best fridge anywhere on the world market, you will be down to 19 - a saving of 80 per cent.' The super-efficient fridge, moreover, will not necessarily be more expensive. There is no correlation between the capital cost of a fridge, and its efficiency. What Ms Boardman, Mr Patterson and many others advocate is 'least cost planning,' also called 'demand side management'. Briefly, this means meeting the country's energy needs by energy conservation measures whenever that is cheaper than building new power stations. At the moment, there is very little demand side management in Britain. The legislation brought in when the electricity industry was privatised two years ago, has no provision for demand side management, except that the regional electricity companies must promote energy efficiency. 'That means leaflets, which is a minor point,' says Ms Boardman. 'Most just give general advice like 'insulation is good,' whereas what's often needed is household specific advice and money.' And, she points out, the government has been unclear about its objectives, failing to distinguish clearly whether it wants to reduce demand, promote energy efficiency, (getting more from each unit of energy), or simply cut the carbon dioxide emissions which result from burning fossil fuels and cause global warming by any possible means. Privatisation, she suggests, may have made demand side planning a less easy option, because when the government controlled the industry it could decide whether to opt for supplying more power, or managing demand. 'Before, the government could, for instance, have considered giving Pounds 1bn to the Department of the Environment to spend on insulation, rather than building new power stations. Now, industry has to be able to compare those options.' One of the strongest arguments why demand side management will not work in the UK electricity industry now is that it is not 'vertically integrated'. Privatisation split the electricity generators - who build most power stations and are the primary suppliers of power - from the regional electricity companies - who sell it to meet customers' demand. This means there is no longer one integrated company which can compare a 'supply side' option, like building a new power station, with a 'demand side' option, like insulating more homes. Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, made this point in a brief examination of least cost planning in an energy efficiency review produced last year. This argues that what the regional electricity companies do will not affect the generators' decision to build or not to build new plant, and that the regional companies would have to recoup the cost of investing in demand-management programmes by putting up their prices. 'The question in the UK is, what is the incentive for regional electricity companies to promote energy savings?' says Mr Tony Boreman, at Offer. At the moment, there are two main reasons why the companies actually have a disincentive to promote energy saving. First, if they invest in installing low energy lights in domestic homes, for example, they cannot pass the cost on to customers. By contrast, they can charge customers for the cost of buying more power. Second, the companies have a relatively stable cost base, which means that more unit sales mean more profits. This means that even if they could recover the costs of putting the lighting in, they would lose out because the new lights would consume fewer units of electricity. This has not completely deterred regional companies from investing in energy efficiency - competition from gas has encouraged them to use energy efficiency as a marketing tool, especially when it comes to selling industry electrical solutions to problems. 'It is in the interest of the industry to keep customers away from gas,' says Mr Simon Roberts, energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth. 'But in the small business and domestic market there is no incentive to save energy. It is not happening in existing homes.' What is needed, he says, is real incentives, and penalties for companies that do not encourage demand management. Mr Tim Wolfe, at the Association for the Conservation of Energy (ACE), believes a system could be introduced in the UK. 'There has been lots of opposition from the Conservative party in the UK, saying it is not appropriate because our industry is not vertically integrated. I don't believe that matters.' Others agree. Firstly, the regional companies do have some avoidable supply-side costs - such as spending on sub-stations or upgrading their local networks - which they can offset against managing demand. Second, points out Mr Wolfe, they can be given an incentive to invest in demand management. So far, Offer has suggested the possibility of introducing an 'E factor,' as the gas industry did last year. This 'E factor' would be added to the regulatory formulas that govern how much the regional electricity companies can increase electricity prices to customers. It would allow the cost of approved energy saving programmes to be reflected in the electricity price. But this, Mr Wolfe believes, is not enough. 'Say a programme costs Pounds 5m, and saves the company Pounds 7m in the cost of buying more power - they have already made Pounds 2m. But they might have lost Pounds 2.5m in revenues from the power they would have sold. We believe they should be allowed to recover that Pounds 2.5m. Not the Pounds 5m the programme cost - just the Pounds 2.5m.' An E factor which allows the companies to recoup the costs of energy saving programmes would encourage them to spend on programmes, but not save energy, he says. But an E factor which allowed them to recoup lost revenues would encourage them to spend less on the programme, and save units. 'This is a fundamental issue, and one I don't believe Offer will meet head on.' Brenda Boardman agrees. 'At the moment there is a double disincentive - no pass through of costs, and no profit except by selling more units.' 'There should also be a greater emphasis on planning,' suggests Mr Wolfe. 'Offer could require the regional companies to put forward energy plans every two years, or could set the companies targets.' Most important, say all advocates of least cost planning, is to change the regulation governing the regional electricity companies, so that their profits are not directly linked to higher sales. 'If their costs were unit-sensitive, but not their profits, then instead of advertising at you to buy things, they would be discouraging you, because it would cost them more,' says one commentator. Offer has asked for comments on its energy efficiency document before June, and may then move to implement some form of E factor. It is unlikely, however, that it will be enough to get the regional companies installing low energy lights and fridges.  The Financial Times   London Page XI  "

The sale follows last month's successful flotation of YPF, the national oil company, and last year's privatisation of the federally-held gas and electricity companies. In just 15 months, Argentina's energy privatisations have raised more than Dollars 6.65bn. The government split Hidronor into three parts, selling each as a separate unit. Three international consortia paid Dollars 474.6m in cash and took on a further Dollars 631.1m in financial liabilities from the government. Hidronor's dams have been transferred as 30-year concessions. The sale last week of El Chocon, the largest of the dams, for Dollars 519.3m to a consortium led by Endesa of Chile, was particularly significant. Argentina and Chile have long been fierce rivals. El Chocon is located close to the Chilean border in the southern Andes and is a large source of electricity for Argentina. Last year, Endesa acquired generating and distribution companies in greater Buenos Aires. A consortium headed by Southern Electric of the US paid Dollars 393.5m for the Alicura dam. Another consortium comprising Dominion Energy, also of the US, and Louis Dreyfus, the international commodity trader, paid Dollars 192.9m for the smaller Cerros Colorados dam.

Mr Jones was launching a highly critical report on the government's approach to energy efficiency. The committee report blasted government conservation initiatives as being 'neither a sufficiently comprehensive nor an adequately funded programme of action'. It is unlikely to be swayed by Mr Kenneth Clarke's move in the Budget to increase funds available to p+ensioners for energy saving measures. The UK government has set a target for arresting the growth in its carbon emissions and even reducing them from 170m tonnes in 1991 to 160m tonnes by the end of the decade. Around half of this target is due to be met by energy efficiency. But the select committee was very sceptical that these targets could be achieved. In addition, the committee called on the government to establish a rolling programme of emission reduction targets beyond 2000 since carbon outflows are expected to increase significantly at the end of the decade. Government should also lead by example, the committee stressed. It criticised the government for having few clear targets on cutting energy use by its own departments - Whitehall's energy consumption actually rose last year. One of the key problems highlighted by the committee's report is the lack of funding available for some government plans such as the Energy Saving Trust which has been set a target of cutting out 2.5m tonnes of carbon emitted by 2000. The trust told the committee it would need Pounds 1.5bn to meet its objectives, but this year it is expected to spend Pounds 5m-Pounds 6m. In the year since it was set up, the trust has initiated four programmes for saving energy including offering grants to households for the installation of gas condensing boilers and setting up energy advice centres, but these have so far been fairly minor measures. Funding has come so far from British Gas and the electricity companies which are allowed to pass it through to consumers on their bills. Mr Colin Myerscough, director of the government's energy efficiency office, says a big contribution should come from further changes in the electricity pricing formula. He is predicting a spend of Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m for the trust by the end of the decade. But this depends on whether gas and electricity regulators go along with the idea - the MPs pointed out that valuable time was being spent by trust officials negotiating funding with the gas and electricity regulators. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, acknowledged that the trust's targets were 'extremely challenging,' and that it would only be able to achieve them with support from regulators and utilities. Another critique of financing plans for the trust rests on the part played by consumers. Households are likely to be put off investing in making their homes energy efficient in order to save money on fuel bills when they have to pay a general levy for energy efficiency. Mr Myerscough admits there will be a period in the mid-1990s when consumers are paying around 1 to 2 per cent more for their fuel because of energy efficiency provisions. 'That's pretty rough, but after that, benefits will start to kick in,' he claims. If the trust achieves savings of 2.5m tonnes of carbon as planned, that represents Pounds 1bn off household energy bills. However, there is little public enthusiasm over the Government's decision to levy Value Added Tax on energy bills. Although the energy efficiency office believes the imposition of VAT will encourage conservation, Mr Myerscough says the public concern over it 'highlights the difficulties of using the price mechanism to control energy demand'. The select committee has called on the government to come up with a comprehensive programme to improve energy efficiency for low income households to counteract the effects of higher bills. While the trust has focused its attention solely on energy use by households and small businesses, MPs on the select committee want to see its influence spread to the industrial and transport sectors, where great savings could be made. The energy efficiency office has so far spearheaded the government's approach to industrial savings with various initiatives to encourage business leaders to express a commitment to conservation. One initiative, which the office has dubbed 'Getting energy efficiency out of the boiler room into the board room,' encourages senior company officials to nail their colours to the mast of conservation. 'This gets top managers thinking about energy efficiency and giving their personal commitment to it,' says Mr Myerscough. He has already signed up more than 1,600 organisations including some notable corporate heavyweights such as Sainsbury, British Sugar, Marks and Spencer, Wellcome and IBM to the programme. The government also expects to spend Pounds 1.7m this year on offering energy management advice to small businesses. So far, the office has had applications from more than 1,000 companies. One of the most important planks of the government's energy efficiency policy is a planned increase in the amount of electricity to be produced by Combined Heat and Power schemes from a current 4,000 MegaWatts to 5,000 MW. In short, although the government has some ambitious plans for combatting global warming with energy efficiency measures, funding appears to fall far short of what is required.

0,FT941-15567 ,"FT941-15567 _AN-EANDNAC1FT 940114   FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (4): Crucial decision - Coal's role      By MICHAEL SMITH   The flue gas desulphurisation units at National Power's Drax plant and PowerGen's Ratcliffe station will ensure a role for coal in the UK well into the next decade. But it will be a smaller role than in the past. The size of the coal market will depend to a large extent on how Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP), the government watchdog, enforces and interprets pollution standards, and on how that affects the ability of coal-fired stations to stay in operation. Crucial to coal's role will be whether the generators build more FGDs, either at stations which burn coal or those which burn Orimulsion, the bitumen-based fuel imported from Venezuela, and whether they hasten the so-called dash for gas-fired generation. In the late 1980s, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then the prime minister, appeared to commit the UK to building some 12,000MW of FGDs. But there seems little prospect of that now. There are even doubts aboutwhether the 8,000MW indicated by the government for England and Wales at electricity privatisation three years ago will become a reality. Mr Granville Camsey, managing director of group technology at National Power, says his company does not rule out building more coal FGDs on top of the 4,000MW being installed at Drax but he acknowledges it is unlikely. FGDs for Orimulsion seem more probable, thus further eroding coal's role. The coal lobby would be even more enraged, however, if PowerGen decided not to go ahead with FGD installation at its Ferrybridge plant. In the government's offer-for-sale document for National Power and PowerGen at privatisation, PowerGen said it had 'informed the government of its plan to install FGD equipment at 4,000MW of capacity at existing stations.' The Ratcliffe installation comprises 2,000MW but PowerGen has yet to proceed with the rest and there are doubts about whether it will. Critics say that if it does not do so, it will have broken commitments in the offer-for-sale. One argument is that the tax payer has already paid for the full 4,000MW of FGD programme because PowerGen's share price was lower than it would otherwise have been to take account of the 'commitment'. Against this, PowerGen can argue that the form of words in the sale document did not constitute a commitment and that, in any case, it could fulfil its sulphur reduction obligations by burning less sulphurous coal, mainly imported, and by building combined-cycle gas stations. Gas has undoubted environmental advantages over coal. It emits about half the carbon dioxide per unit of electricity and virtually no sulphur dioxide. What infuriates the coal lobby is that the new gas plants will replace coal stations which could have years of useful life left and could, in some cases, be even cheaper to run when fitted with FGDs. The coal lobby's explanation for the dash for gas is that regional electricity companies became involved in joint ventures to set up new generating companies because they were desperate to escape the clutches of a duopoly in PowerGen and National Power which charged them more than necessary for power. These new companies had a captive market in the regional electricity companies through long-term contracts which allowed costs to be passed on to customers. National Power and PowerGen responded, the argument goes, by building their own gas-fired stations so that they could retain market share. The coal lobby's conclusion is that the dash for gas is the result of a flawed market which will result in a waste of UK energy resources and pit closures which will close off coal supplies for ever. The generators' response is that it makes more sense to invest in gas-fired generation which is more environmentally friendly and more thermally efficient than to retrofit FGDs on to plant which has limited life. The counter-arguments are unlikely to convince the generators to build anything more than Drax, Ratcliffe - and possibly Ferrybridge and another plant at Longannet with Scottish Power funds. What then is the future for the other 22 coal-fired stations? The HMIP's role will be crucial. There is considerable uncertainty about how the inspectorate will interpret the European drive to introduce the Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost (BATNEEC) through which 'old' plant must be brought up to the standard of 'new'. The objective is that plant be upgraded by April 2001 at the latest. The coal industry fears that unless the inspectorate is flexible, it is possible that early in the new millennium there will be only two or three coal-fired power stations still running; those fitted with FGDs. That would provide sales of 15m to 20m tonnes of coal to the electricity sector which constitutes by far the largest market for coal. That in turn would provide outlets for considerably less than 10 pits, against the 22 in operation today, and that assumes that all of the coal used was sourced from the UK, a highly improbable scenario given the low sulphur content of imported coal. All of this is almost certainly too gloomy a picture. After all, PowerGen expects that by far the majority of the seven coal-fired stations it will still be operating next financial year will remain open by the end of the century. Even National Power, more pessimistic on this issue, expects to be operating at least 10 of its remaining power stations in the next millennium. But unless the market changes beyond all expectations, most of the coal-fired stations that do survive will be operating at considerably less than their capacity. The chances of coal sales to the England and Wales generators reaching anything like the 40m tonnes of this financial year are remote.   Companies:-  National Power.     PowerGen.

Presumably, Mr Baker already regrets his recent attempt to deflect criticism of the two generators, in which he urged large users to look past higher prices and examine instead the subsidy they pay to Nuclear Electric. He thereby handed them a surprisingly powerful weapon. Their threat to withhold the nuclear levy, which adds 11 per cent to their bills, is a neat way to extend an argument which appeared lost. It may be that the government will turn a blind eye and hope the problem fades as the next round of electricity contracts is signed. But there is no suggestion that the generators intend to reduce prices. The prospect that small consumers would eventually pick up the tab is uncomfortably close to the hidden subsidy to industry that privatisation was designed to end. Meanwhile, Nuclear Electric has been reminded that by any normal measure it is hopelessly uncompetitive. The question is whether there is anything more than political horse-trading to be done. The answer is almost certainly not. After all, the roots of the problem lie in the industry structure chosen by the government, which will scarcely be altered now. The generating duopoly has been putting up electricity prices much as forecast before privatisation. What was not foreseen was that large industrial customers would be in deep recession. But their attempt to appeal to the government is an implicit admission that head-on confrontation with the generators is fruitless. That explains why the generators' shares have so far been unaffected. Cautious investors are doubtless not counting on the argument disappearing altogether.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "
0,FT922-8313 ,"FT922-8313 _AN-CENCNAAOFT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (3): Wired for growth - Asia switches on to private power      By FRANK GRAY   THE private power sector is now playing an important role in electricity generation in Asia's developing countries. Relentless economic growth, and an even faster growth in electricity demand, have opened this door to the private sector. The countries most affected are Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. One reason is the high cost of adding new, efficient capacity out of national financial resources, and the perception that the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are no longer bottomless wells of concessional aid support, particularly given the demands on them from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The two Banks have made clear that developing Asia must do more on its own, and they have pressed their borrowers to boost power utility efficiency and revenues through higher electricity tariffs and reduced subsidies to customers. In Asia, their power sector lending accounts for about 20-25 per cent of all aid, but their own resources are being stretched. This was underlined recently by Mr William Thompson, ADB vice-president, operations, who said that electricity demand in the 1990s would require the addition of 300,000MW of capacity, more than double that now in place in the region's two-dozen developing countries. He noted that in spite of a 100 per cent increase in electricity use in the 1980s, Asia's per capita energy consumption was still low by global standards, and would rise sharply. Asia, with 40 per cent of the world's population, accounted for only 20 per cent of total energy use. With GDP expected to grow annually by 5.5-6 per cent over the 1990s and current account deficits worsening, increased reliance on the private sector to raise finance was required. He stressed such schemes as build-own-operate and build-operate-transfer (BOO and BOT respectively), in which the plant supplier finances the scheme through the sale of power to the state utility, essentially owning and operating the plant until all financing and profits have been recovered. The use by the World Bank of BOT in Pakistan to structure the Dollars l5bn Hab River power project, a 4 x 323MW oil-fired power station 50 km west of Karachi, is credited with convincing Islamabad to restructure its two unwieldy utilities, the Water and Power Development Authority and the Karachi Electricity Supply Company, whose total capacity is 8,000MW. Work on Hab is expected to start this summer, under a consortium of US, British, French, Italian, Saudi and Japanese companies, with delivery of the first unit in three years. Electricity would be sold by HubCo, the managing company, into the national grid. This would pay for the project costs and generate profits over 23 years before the station is turned over to Pakistani control. Pakistan is encouraging more BOT schemes and plans to hive off some of WAPDA's thermal power stations into similar BOT operations. India last year introduced laws to broaden the private power base and, in some cases, to allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of power companies. At 65,000MW, just 5 per cent of India's power comes from four private sector companies, led by the Tata Group. All of these are profitable compared with the 18 state-sector utilities, most of which are in deficit. The issue has proven so successful that the private sector now claims to be capable of adding 24,000MW of new capacity to the grid by 2000 if its proposals are approved. The I990-95 five-year plan called for 38,000MW of new capacity, but this looks like falling about 35 per cent short under state plans. If the private bids are approved, the gap between private and state electricity generation will narrow sharply. Malaysia's Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) is now seeing through the flotation of 23 per cent of its shares, the largest such flotation of a state-utility's shareholdings in Southeast Asia. At 5,000MW, TNB plans to increase capacity to nearly 8,000MW by 1995, hence the need for private capital. By comparison, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is taking a different approach. Its target is to boost capacity to 13,075MW by 1996 from 8,193MW last year. In February it amended the EGAT Act to allow the creation of wholly-owned power generating subsidiaries, whose shares can be sold. Under this scheme, it has designated three projects for mini-privatisation: the 4 x 300 MW Rayong combined-cycle power plant, the 600MW Khanom combined cycle plant; and the recently-proposed 2 x 700MW Aoi Pai coal-fired power station. The government has also endorsed the purchase by EGAT and the Metropolitan and Provincial electricity authorities (the two electricity distributors) of up to 50MW of capacity from individual private power generators operating combined-cycle plants. Uncertainty surrounds the privatisation plans of Indonesia and the Philippines. Indonesia is steering clear of BOT projects. Current installed capacity of the PLN, the state utility, is 9,000MW, all of it on Java. Indonesian energy officials say plans are to boost this to 20,000MW by 2000. Such an expansion will cost Dollars 3bn-Dollars 5bn. Indonesia hopes to offset much of this cost by encouraging more 'captive' power stations, those built to fuel company towns and self-contained industrial complexes. Government officials say 40 per cent of the additional 11,000MW of planned capacity could be developed this way. The Philippines recently refloated shares in the Manila Electric Company, which had been sequestered following the corporate shakeup of para-state companies following the fall of the Marcos regime in 1986. It has said it plans to restructure and privatise the National Power Corporation, the main utility, once the political dust has settled following this month's national elections.

A report by officials from the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Department of the Environment on a fundamental review of the trust's long-term funding is understood to be near completion. The trust was established two years ago to promote energy efficiency as part of the UK's international commitment against global warming. Its Pounds 700m budget up to the year 2000 was supposed to be funded by levies on gas and electricity consumers. But this year Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, stymied the scheme by refusing to authorise a levy on the grounds that it was a form of taxation. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, has authorised Pounds 25m a year for four years but recently declined to increase this. Among options considered by the interdepartmental review are new legislation to make it a regulator's duty to raise a sufficient levy to fund the trust in the long term. Ministers made clear yesterday that although the options would include cutting back the trust's activities, they would also explore ways of expanding its role. An early ministerial decision would allow funding measures to be included in November's Budget.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

By PETER NAVARRO, Peter Navarro is an assistant professor of economics at the  University of San Diego and the University of California, Irvine, and is the  author of a book on electric utility regulation, The Dimming of America. He was  recently honored for his work on the subject by the International Assn. of  Energy Economics. Navarro is also chairman of the group Prevent Los  Angelization Now.      The most glaring omission in the regulatory review of the proposed merger  between San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison is the  failure to compare the Edison merger with the now-abandoned merger between  SDG&E and Tucson Electric Power.    Shortly after the ink was dry on the cooperative Tucson merger, the plan was  scuttled by Edison's hostile takeover tactics. Today, under the gun of Edison  lobbyists, both the California Public Utility Commission and the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission have rejected entreaties by the city of San Diego, the  Utility Consumers Action Network and other intervenors to compare the Edison  and Tucson merger plans before passing judgment on Edison's application.    In fact, the Tucson merger is the far superior alternative, both for San  Diegans and for electricity customers in the broader Southwest region. If the  Tucson merger, rather than the Edison merger, were consummated, San Diego  electricity consumers would pay lower rates for more reliable service, and the  San Diego air basin would probably suffer far less pollution.    Electricity rates would be lower under the Tucson merger for several reasons.  First, Edison's electricity rates for all customer classes -- commercial,  industrial and residential -- are higher than SDG&E's, and the current 9%  rate gap is projected to continue over the next decade.    Because Edison is forbidden by the PUC to charge different rates to customers  in different service territories, San Diego ratepayers will see their rates  rise inexorably to Edison's much higher levels over time. Moreover, even if  Edison is allowed to temporarily lower rates for San Diego customers (as per  its public promises), our rates will inevitably climb.    In contrast, Tucson's rates are more than 20% below SDG&E's. Under the  Tucson merger, San Diego rates would either remain low or drop even further  below Edison's.    Second, Tucson affords SDG&E a more economically diverse generation mix  than the Edison merger. Ninety-four percent of Tucson's power is  coal-generated. This coal power perfectly complements SDG&E's reliance on  gas, oil and nuclear generation and provides SDG&E with a resource  diversity that is a strong buffer against future oil shocks.    In contrast, the generation synergies offered by the Edison merger are  virtually nil because Edison's resource mix is almost identical to SDG&E's.    Third, both Tucson and SDG&E are small compared to Edison, but together  they could be a potent countervailing market force to Edison's attempted  monopolization of the Southern California and Southwest electricity markets.  The resultant competitive pressures in purchased power markets would save  ratepayers throughout the region hundreds of millions of dollars.    In fact, many knowledgeable observers believe that the primary motive behind  Edison's hostile takeover was foreclosing competition in this market and  preserving its hegemony.    Beyond the rate issue, the Tucson merger provides San Diego electricity  customers with much more reliable service. Whereas SDG&E has warned that it  may run short on power by the mid-1990s, Tucson seriously overbuilt during the  '70s and '80s and has substantial power reserves that could be used by  SDG&E through the end of the century.    Moreover, Tucson possesses an excellent, under-utilitized transmission network  that would give SDG&E access to 37 additional utilities throughout the  Southwest, Midwest and Northwest.    In contrast, the only excess power that Edison has to offer SDG&E is very  high-cost generation from one of its unregulated subsidiaries, Mission Energy.  Mission Energy is a ""money pump"" formed to exploit a loophole in a federal law  designed to stimulate small power production through inflated prices. Edison  buys Mission Energy power, passes the high prices on to its ratepayers and  passes the profits from its unregulated subsidiary on to its shareholders.    The Edison merger might also significantly increase air pollution in San Diego,  while, under the Tucson merger, pollution would be reduced. As the San Diego  County Air Pollution Control District has documented, the Edison merger could  raise pollution levels significantly, ranging from 119% for carbon monoxide to  an astounding 6,947% for sulfur oxides. Edison would do this by cutting down  generation at some of its polluting plants in the Los Angeles air basin and  replacing it with generation from San Diego plants.    The Edison merger would also have several additional unwanted side effects.  They include the loss of jobs and local control, as well as reduced charitable  contributions from the resulting utility.    Last, but not least, the Edison merger would prove an unwelcome stimulant to  the ongoing ""Los Angelization"" of San Diego by provoking an equally unwelcome  ""political merger."" This merger between an Edison seeking new customers and an  already-too-powerful development industry would have as its aim continued rapid  growth.    Since the Tucson merger was abandoned, Tucson Electric Power has undergone  considerable internal controversy. Its chief executive officer resigned under  fire, the company has experienced large losses in both its unregulated holdings  and power operations, and its stock price has fallen. All of these events  suggest that there is now an even better economic opportunity for SDG&E to  pursue a cooperative merger with Tucson.    Toward that end, the San Diego City Council or Board of Supervisors should send  an emissary to Tucson to explore the reopening of merger talks.

By PETER NAVARRO, Peter Navarro is an assistant professor of economics at the  University of San Diego and the University of California, Irvine, and is the  author of a book on electric utility regulation, The Dimming of America. He was  recently honored for his work on the subject by the International Assn. of  Energy Economics. Navarro is also chairman of the group Prevent Los  Angelization Now.      The most glaring omission in the regulatory review of the proposed merger  between San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison is the  failure to compare the Edison merger with the now-abandoned merger between  SDG&E and Tucson Electric Power.    Shortly after the ink was dry on the cooperative Tucson merger, the plan was  scuttled by Edison's hostile takeover tactics. Today, under the gun of Edison  lobbyists, both the California Public Utility Commission and the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission have rejected entreaties by the city of San Diego, the  Utility Consumers Action Network and other intervenors to compare the Edison  and Tucson merger plans before passing judgment on Edison's application.    In fact, the Tucson merger is the far superior alternative, both for San  Diegans and for electricity customers in the broader Southwest region. If the  Tucson merger, rather than the Edison merger, were consummated, San Diego  electricity consumers would pay lower rates for more reliable service, and the  San Diego air basin would probably suffer far less pollution.    Electricity rates would be lower under the Tucson merger for several reasons.  First, Edison's electricity rates for all customer classes -- commercial,  industrial and residential -- are higher than SDG&E's, and the current 9%  rate gap is projected to continue over the next decade.    Because Edison is forbidden by the PUC to charge different rates to customers  in different service territories, San Diego ratepayers will see their rates  rise inexorably to Edison's much higher levels over time. Moreover, even if  Edison is allowed to temporarily lower rates for San Diego customers (as per  its public promises), our rates will inevitably climb.    In contrast, Tucson's rates are more than 20% below SDG&E's. Under the  Tucson merger, San Diego rates would either remain low or drop even further  below Edison's.    Second, Tucson affords SDG&E a more economically diverse generation mix  than the Edison merger. Ninety-four percent of Tucson's power is  coal-generated. This coal power perfectly complements SDG&E's reliance on  gas, oil and nuclear generation and provides SDG&E with a resource  diversity that is a strong buffer against future oil shocks.    In contrast, the generation synergies offered by the Edison merger are  virtually nil because Edison's resource mix is almost identical to SDG&E's.    Third, both Tucson and SDG&E are small compared to Edison, but together  they could be a potent countervailing market force to Edison's attempted  monopolization of the Southern California and Southwest electricity markets.  The resultant competitive pressures in purchased power markets would save  ratepayers throughout the region hundreds of millions of dollars.    In fact, many knowledgeable observers believe that the primary motive behind  Edison's hostile takeover was foreclosing competition in this market and  preserving its hegemony.    Beyond the rate issue, the Tucson merger provides San Diego electricity  customers with much more reliable service. Whereas SDG&E has warned that it  may run short on power by the mid-1990s, Tucson seriously overbuilt during the  '70s and '80s and has substantial power reserves that could be used by  SDG&E through the end of the century.    Moreover, Tucson possesses an excellent, under-utilitized transmission network  that would give SDG&E access to 37 additional utilities throughout the  Southwest, Midwest and Northwest.    In contrast, the only excess power that Edison has to offer SDG&E is very  high-cost generation from one of its unregulated subsidiaries, Mission Energy.  Mission Energy is a ""money pump"" formed to exploit a loophole in a federal law  designed to stimulate small power production through inflated prices. Edison  buys Mission Energy power, passes the high prices on to its ratepayers and  passes the profits from its unregulated subsidiary on to its shareholders.    The Edison merger might also significantly increase air pollution in San Diego,  while, under the Tucson merger, pollution would be reduced. As the San Diego  County Air Pollution Control District has documented, the Edison merger could  raise pollution levels significantly, ranging from 119% for carbon monoxide to  an astounding 6,947% for sulfur oxides. Edison would do this by cutting down  generation at some of its polluting plants in the Los Angeles air basin and  replacing it with generation from San Diego plants.    The Edison merger would also have several additional unwanted side effects.  They include the loss of jobs and local control, as well as reduced charitable  contributions from the resulting utility.    Last, but not least, the Edison merger would prove an unwelcome stimulant to  the ongoing ""Los Angelization"" of San Diego by provoking an equally unwelcome  ""political merger."" This merger between an Edison seeking new customers and an  already-too-powerful development industry would have as its aim continued rapid  growth.    Since the Tucson merger was abandoned, Tucson Electric Power has undergone  considerable internal controversy. Its chief executive officer resigned under  fire, the company has experienced large losses in both its unregulated holdings  and power operations, and its stock price has fallen. All of these events  suggest that there is now an even better economic opportunity for SDG&E to  pursue a cooperative merger with Tucson.    Toward that end, the San Diego City Council or Board of Supervisors should send  an emissary to Tucson to explore the reopening of merger talks. The council  should also pass a nonbinding resolution recommending that SDG&E reopen  discussions and reaffirm to both the PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission the desire to see the Tucson merger included as part of the  regulatory review.    In March, 1990, Chairman Tom Page and the SDG&E board of directors will be  free to terminate the Edison merger agreement without penalty, because of a  ""drop dead"" clause in the contract. If Mr. Page and the board would simply  discard their ""golden parachutes"" and put the interests of San Diego above  their own, there would be no obstacle to renewed discussion between Tucson and  SDG&E about a merger that is founded in common sense and mutual benefit  rather than in Edison's exploitative power play.

0,FT932-16155 ,"FT932-16155 _AN-DDGB3ADFFT 930407   FT  07 APR 93 / Personal View: Rewrite the rules for regulation      By DIETER HELM   Damaging disputes are raging in most of Britain's privatised utilities. The water companies and their regulators are arguing about the cost of environmental standards. The row between British Gas and Ofgas has not been quietened by a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. The electricity industry, its regulator and the government have reached a truce following their dispute over coal contracts. These battles illustrate an increasingly obvious point: the regulatory framework is in crisis and in urgent need of reform. In the British administrative tradition, the rules of the game (laid down in licences and legislation) are poorly defined. Director-generals are appointed with wide discretionary powers to ensure the utilities act in the public interest. General duties, such as 'promoting competition', allow regulators to interfere in virtually any aspect of the utility's business. Also, since terms such as 'competition' can be interpreted in a variety of ways, a regulator can choose which competition model he wishes to employ. The result is inevitable: unaccountable to anyone, regulators pursue their own agenda, leaving regulated companies, shareholders and customers to play a costly guessing game. Regulators not only have discretion over the interpretation of the rules; they can also change them. Almost all regulators have implicitly rejected many of the original terms of privatisations and have chiselled away at the structures of their industries. Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, has presided over a 'dash for gas' at a time of excess capacity, allowing the regional electricity companies to integrate vertically through long-term contracts. His counterpart in the water industry, Ian Byatt, rejects much of the rationale behind new environmental standards. At Ofgas, Sir James McKinnon has now decided that the gas industry should be broken up. The utilities' licences can be changed easily. The regulator proposes modifications, which the utility can accept or reject.  Rejection, however, leads to a referral to the MMC, the prospect of which is usually enough to make a utility accept a regulator's proposals. Core issues such as the closure of power stations and the accounting structure of BT are being dealt with in this way. This exploitation of discretion has meant that, contrary to its designers' intentions, UK regulation has turned out to be heavy-handed. While some discretion is desirable, a distinction should be drawn between the interpretation of licences and changes to them. The latter are fundamental. They touch on wider public interests, and should be debated publicly. The power of regulators to 'negotiate' amendments to licences without public debate should be curtailed. The licences were defined by government and sanctioned through legislation. These licences set the 'regulatory contract' between privatised companies and their customers. It is not appropriate to permit largely unaccountable regulators to alter their terms, behind closed doors. An automatic reference to the MMC, with a public consultation period, is a minimal requirement. However, reform should go further than this. A consistent set of principles for the conduct of regulation is required. In particular, these should define a common approach to setting prices. At present, each regulator chooses his own preferred method. However, it is time for a common methodology. This could be provided by a white paper on utility regulation, to complement the 1978 white paper, which still provides the framework for regulating nationalised industries. The institutional structure of regulation also needs to be reconsidered. The current system of a host of ad hoc semi-autonomous offices of regulation leads to inconsistency. An Office of Regulation should be set up, reporting to the Department of Trade and Industry. Given the present position, however, some mergers of regulators would be helpful. Offer, the electricity regulator, and Ofgas could be merged to create an Office of Energy Regulation. Likewise an Office of Transport Regulation and an Office of Communications could be set up. Measures such as a white paper on regulatory principles, a limitation on regulators' powers to modify licences without public debate, and institutional reform are essential to create a more predictable and stable climate for investment, while at the same time protecting the public from monopoly pricing. Failure to tackle the problem will continue to raise the price of investment, weaken the quality of the regulatory structure and ultimately undermine consumers' interests.

0,FT934-11222 ,"FT934-11222 _AN-DKBDEAC6FT 931102   FT  02 NOV 93 / Technology: Power to the people - The UK's National Grid has just invested in a sophisticated control network      By ANDREW FISHER   The sight of Chris Waddle missing a vital penalty at a World Cup soccer semi-final three years ago may not appear to have much to do with electricity use, but the behaviour of television viewers after England lost to Germany led to a record surge of power that night. The management of power demand is a complex task. To ensure it continues to be handled smoothly, from times of normal use to emergencies such as hurricanes, the National Grid - which distributes electricity in England and Wales - has spent Pounds 32m on a computerised energy management system it believes is the biggest and most modern in the world. Electricity demand in the area covered by the National Grid can vary between 16,000 megawatts early on a summer morning to nearly 48,000 MW on a very cold winter evening. Power consumption also rises sharply after popular TV soap operas or blockbuster films. Viewers get up after a long evening's viewing, switch on the lights and put on the kettle for a cup of tea. This is what happened after Waddle and his team-mate missed the deciding penalties at the end of one of the most exciting matches of the championship, televised from Italy. Electricity use briefly shot up by as much as 2,800 MW after the game, equivalent to the output of a very large power station. On an average day, enough electricity is used in England and Wales to keep 10m kettles boiling round the clock; in winter, the equivalent is 17m. This is what the National Grid's new system, formally opened last month after 100 days in faultless operation, is designed to manage. From the new control centre at Wokingham, Surrey, with the help of four area centres in St Albans, Birmingham, Leeds and Bristol, electricity is routed around the 7,000km of the country's transmission routes. By spending some Pounds 80m on its new control network (including the energy management system), the National Grid has streamlined its activities and closed two regional sites at Manchester and East Grinstead. It now has an array of new computers and sophisticated software capable of evolving in line with future advances in technology. The previous system dated from 1970, when the national control centre was at London's Park Street, south of the River Thames. Its Argos computers made by Ferranti of the UK - now the subject of a humiliating 1p a share bid from General Electric Company of the UK - were kept running until earlier this year, although new equipment was also added over the past two decades. 'In the early 1980s, we realised we needed to get to the next level of technology,' says John Tomlinson, system control manager. After going out to tender, National Grid narrowed the choice down to Ferranti and Minnesota-based Empros Power Systems Control, then owned by Control Data of the US but now part of Siemens, the German industrial group. Having decided on Empros, which has more than 400 energy systems installed around the world, the National Grid went to great lengths to ensure its systems would be as error-free as possible. It subjected the hardware and software to 14 different audits each. Testing was so rigorous that the test plans took up 45 feet of paper. As a result, the company believes it has a system which is as reliable as it is possible to obtain. Roger Hunter, EMS project manager, is suitably cautious, however, when he says: 'As far as we know, at the present time, there are no errors.' The system was also delivered on time and within budget, a rarity for such big computer projects. The National Grid went to such lengths to ensure both quality and robustness because it wanted a system which could do much more than its previous one. The Empros system, with its host of computers, workstations, display units and 4m lines of software code (capable of running 46 applications and 40,000 displays) is not just designed to switch energy around the grid system, including the import of power from Scotland (where distribution is handled by the generating companies) and France. It also has a far greater capacity to deal with emergencies such as freak storms or terrorist bombs. To ensure the utmost degree of fail-safe security, each centre has three big Cyber computers from Control Data for normal, stand-by and emergency use. If a disaster causes the Wokingham centre to go down, national control can be switched to St Albans which controls the London region. Here, there is a fourth Cyber, normally used for training - faults such as those caused by the 1981 blizzards have been modelled into the simulator with frightening realism - but which can be switched to run the whole grid. 'You can't have a day off while you put something right,' says Tomlinson. In the old system, this degree of integration did not exist. Nor was it able to perform advanced applications at a level far beyond the normal ones of monitoring power flows, voltage levels and other daily functions. With the Empros equipment, says Hunter, the grid system can be subjected to 'limits and capabilities never before possible.' Readouts on any aspect of the grid system can be obtained in seconds rather than minutes; 22,000 separate items of information are checked every five seconds. This vast flow of data is needed not only to update the rate of daily power flows from the privatised energy groups to the regional electricity companies (who own the National Grid), but also to deal with the unexpected. 'This system can handle the most onerous of power station conditions,' adds Hunter. The Empros system was tested to see how it would stand up to all types of use from normal demand to the impact of lightning strikes and hurricanes. Now its system is in operation, the National Grid is keen to work with Empros and Siemens, on foreign contracts. 'The whole market place is worth nearly Dollars 1bn (Pounds 714m),' says Tim Kenealy, general manager of Siemens Empros, which has a share of around 20 per cent. He sees strong possibilities in eastern Europe and other developing areas, despite scarce funds, as well as in industrialised countries wanting to update electricity distribution.

0,FT921-12659 ,"FT921-12659 _AN-CAZAFAAWFT 920125   FT  25 JAN 92 / Coal dust flies as door shuts: The recent dismissal of Malcolm Edwards      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   Several days ago, Mr Malcolm Edwards, British Coal's top marketing man, arrived in Hobart House, the company's headquarters behind Buckingham Palace, to find his office door locked. He was then told not to come to work any more, or to make any contact with the state coal company's customers. It was a sad end to 36 years in the coal industry for the man who was once a longshot tip for the chairmanship of British Coal. After a series of bitter rows with Mr Neil Clarke, the current chairman, and a lengthy legal wrangle, Mr Edwards had been sacked. The matter, however, did not stop there. This week Mr Edwards's departure was at the centre of a political storm concerning the whole future of Britain's coal industry. An influential cross-party group of MPs, led by Dr Michael Clark, the Conservative chairman of the energy committee, signed a motion expressing horror at his ousting and calling for his reinstatement. As British Coal proceeded on Tuesday to announce the loss of 1,105 jobs at four pits in West Yorkshire, the conspiracy theorists had a field day. The government, they said, had wanted Mr Edwards, an outspoken critic of its plans for the company, out of the way to smooth the path for privatisation, expected soon after the general election. The statement by Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, that Mr Edwards's dismissal was a matter for Mr Clarke, whom he fully supported, did little to quell the speculation. It is not surprising that Mr Edwards's departure arouses strong feelings. As marketing chief for the old Coal Board since 1973, he had been an articulate advocate of coal, in the energy market and in the political marketplace. Had he stayed, Mr Edwards would have been in charge of negotiations with the newly privatised electricity industry on the price and volume of the coal supplies it will take when the generators' current contracts with British Coal expire in March 1993 - and it is on the outcome of these talks that the future shape of the industry depends. Although no official explanation has been given for the falling out, it may well have come to a head in disagreements about how to handle the negotiations with the generators, National Power and PowerGen. Mr Edwards has always taken a robust approach - lashing out at rival fuels, and lately (to the apparent dismay of Mr Clarke and Mr Wakeham) lambasting the electricity generators for their decision to invest in new gas-fired stations in preference to coal. 'I fight because I believe markets are made,' he says. 'You have to persuade the buyer not to get into a jam that doesn't suit you.' The government has insisted that it will not intervene in the electricity contract negotiations, although many doubt this given the highly political nature of decisions about the future of the coal industry and the regulation of energy prices; only this month Mr Wakeham was dragged into a row between British Gas and its regulator. Nor, the government claims, will it seek to influence the generators' decision on what kind of power plant they build, for example to ensure that coal or nuclear retains a share. Mr Edwards has frequently pointed out that in spite of this free market philosophy, the government subsidises the nuclear industry through a levy on electricity consumers  - and that leaving the untested new market to decide which fuel should be used in power stations could put the coal industry out of business long term. 'If these decisions prove to be wrong, some will be quite irreversible and others only reversible at great cost to electricity consumers,' he says. His views find an echo in Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary: 'We think there's no point in formulating a coal industry based on sympathy for mines. But we believe the coal industry is in the interest of the country, we believe in husbanding the resources of the country.' Against that background, it is easy to see how Mr Edwards's outspoken approach could have embarrassed the government in the run-up to the election. He would also have objected loudly to current moves by Mr Clarke - with approval from Mr Wakeham - to negotiate a one-year contract with the electricity generators; he has always argued that British Coal needs long-term contracts for planning. Mr Edwards was not against privatisation per se. 'I think he sincerely wanted the company to be privatised,' says an old electricity industry colleague. 'But he still believed the government could force the generators to buy all their coal from British Coal - he couldn't accept the idea of the company shrinking.' Not so, Mr Edwards says. As a marketing man he realised that market share meant strength. And he has always been a vigorous advocate of cost cutting and commercial rigour. The latest round of cost-cutting was signalled on Tuesday. And with privatisation looming, it seems to be going to the heart of British Coal's empire. As the company is forced to shrink and possibly to join the private sector, there are certain to be fierce political and industrial arguments. Mr Clarke, inexperienced in the cut-throat world of nationalised industry politics, appears to have decided that quiet diplomacy is better than the Edwards megaphone.

0,FT934-3776 ,"FT934-3776 _AN-DLGD5AGSFT 931207   FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (10): Light-footed heavyweights  -David Lawson on industry's revolution      By DAVID LAWSON   Industry was once the most obvious of Britain's energy wasters. Born to plentiful coal, raised on subsidised electricity and fattened by natural gas, it should have been almost impossible to tame. Yet it is the only sector to cut demand - down a hefty 40 per cent since the 1973 oil shock and 7 per cent since the recession started. The figures were bound to shift as the economy veered away from heavy production towards service, but much of the saving can be put down to greater dedication towards cutting bills. This is understandable among users where energy is an obvious - and expensive - part of the production process. Glucose is a ubiquitous component for foods, drinks and drugs which requires a lot of heat to generate steam for extraction from grain. Tunnel Refineries in south-east London saved Pounds 1.5m a year through a series of investments in electric mechanical vapour recompression systems which recycle energy through heat pumps. Not content with this, the company called in AHS Emstar, one of the country's biggest contract energy management groups, to examine further options. This led to a Pounds 10m contract to design, finance, install and operate a new combined heat and power plant based on gas-turbine generators. The investment will reduce energy bills by around 10 per cent or more than Pounds 500,000 a year - a sweet solution to a sticky problem. Careful planning and monitoring can reduce bills up to 30 per cent, says Emstar. This can involve anything from replacement of inefficient systems to juggling with the mix of fuels. Hoover went all the way on its Merthyr Tydfil factory in South Wales. The appliance manufacturer spent Pounds 1.3m on new equipment, switched from coal and oil to gas and installed a computerised energy management system remotely monitored down a phone line. This not only cut energy bills by Pounds 750,000 a year but reduced CO emissions by more than 70 per cent, says Emstar. Cutting fuel bills has become more feasible since privatisation, with gas and electricity companies willing to tear up tariff sheets in the battle for business. Independent consultants flourish as power brokers but each supplier also has an army of engineer-salesmen touting advice. Regional electricity groups are even ranging into each others' territory to win orders. Suggestions sometimes involve cutting consumption of the very product they are selling. The logic is that less leads to more; reducing energy cost per unit will improve efficiency, which may raise overall production and end up with the customer asking for more. It is better to have a satisfied customer taking less power than one buying elsewhere. Other factors such as the environment also get drawn into the equation. Glass recycling is a popular subject as it takes this most enduring of materials out of an overloaded waste disposal system and cuts down road deliveries. United Glass at Harlow ships in sand from Surrey and Kent, limestone from Derbyshire, plus essential soda ash and mineral additives for new bottles and jars. Every tonne of old glass (cullet) saves the energy equivalent of 30 gallons of oil, says British Glass, the pressure group which co-ordinates the industry's recycling campaign. Total savings amounted to more than 7m gallons at the last count in 1988 and will now be much higher, as recycling is growing in leaps and bounds. The government is aiming for 10,000 bottle banks and a 50:50 split between new and old glass by the mid-1990s. United cut energy consumption of its recycling furnace by 17.5 per cent and raise output by a fifth by replacing oil burners with electricity power elements. The Pounds 230,000 investment could be recouped in just over a year. A lot of the work at the electricity industry's Capenhurst Research Centre is centred around similar energy-saving schemes designed to supplement efforts by users themselves. Meanwhile, British Gas is also fighting the same corner. It has helped Tioxide Europe, for instance, to switch part of a titanium dioxide pigment processing plant at Grimsby from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to natural gas. This will cut fuel bills by Pounds 1m a year and has environmental spin-offs, such as improved working conditions and the elimination of 18 tanker deliveries a week. Inco Alloys spent two years working with the British Gas Technical Consultancy Service on upgrading to extrusion press facilities at its Hereford plant. This involved building a special test furnace, which eventually proved itself against an initial idea to use electrical induction heating of metals. Energy costs have been cut by 50 per cent, saving more than Pounds 80,000 a year. Even the smallest reductions in consumption can help some users because they are so energy-intensive. Ford's Dagenham plant needs 56 megawatts of electricity - pretty much the requirements of a fair-sized town. Vauxhall introduced a computerised energy management system which cut its requirements at Luton by 6.5 per cent in three years to 29MW. The importance of such customers keeps a supplier such as Eastern Electricity constantly on its toes, helping to cut and trim. Vehicles need half-a-dozen or more coats of rust-proofer and paint, and each layer can cost up to Pounds 30 per car to dry, so even small savings are significant on a line producing thousands each year. Meanwhile, new EU emission rules are forcing changes away from solvent-based paints to water-based glosses. So Eastern Electricity took a pro-active line, doing its own research into technical and economic problems. Not all these large customers are mainstream industrialists. British Gas claims to have saved the RAF Pounds 800,000 a year through development of a long-term energy management campaign on various bases while introduction of combined heat and power units at Heathrow's cargo area and the 53-acre University Hospital of Wales cut annual energy bills by Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 350,000 respectively. Little things can also mean a lot - such as making sure your quiches are cooked properly. Farmer Giles Foods in Aylesbury was distraught that its snacks were being rejected. Tilting oven racks tipped the fillings and left unappetising burned goo along the sides. A modern electric conveyor oven stabilised the substandard quiches, added 50 per cent to sales and doubled output. Food processors are like movie doctors and midwives: they need hot water, and plenty of it, because people and plant need regular scouring. Farmer Giles found a chilling solution to further energy saving with the help of a little lateral thinking from Eastern Electricity. Refrigeration plant normally ejects the heat into the atmosphere. Now the hot gases pass through an exchanger inside water tanks, providing around 12,000 gallons for hand-washing and plant cleaning. Initial savings were expected to be Pounds 13,000 a year - a payback of less than 12 months.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9531 Housing Programs.

Tragic because, on this crowded island, hills are the last of our extensive, undeveloped places. Millions of us love and use the hills because they restore our spirits and our vitality. A folly because even the latest, 350ft high turbines only generate electricity equivalent to that used by 170 people. Yet the unreliable nature of the wind means that not one existing power station can be demolished, or even switched off, because instant back-up has to be maintained. Parliament in its now typical rush into new, half-cocked, ill-considered regulations has distorted the market and produced a situation where speculators can make a fortune while hypocritically wearing the mask of environmental rectitude. Each turbine costs about Pounds 150,000 and will go on to earn its developer Pounds 170,000 a year.

The new law also requires that utility boilers emit lower levels of NO    x     and requires that additional actions to reduce emissions be taken in regions not now in compliance with Federal ambient air quality standards for NO    x     or derivative pollutants, such as ground-level ozone. Because of these new requirements, the actual reductions in NO    x     emissions likely to result from the appliance standards are very likely to be substantially less than the estimates made prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 and contained in this document.        With respect to CO    2    , there are as yet no such regulatory constraints on national or regional emissions. However, efforts to comply with international commitments to stabilize CO    2     emissions, such as voluntary commitments by utilities and industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000, may result in constraints that are similar in nature to those for SO    2     and NO    2    . If so, the reductions in CO    2     emissions estimated to result from the standards also may not be fully realized.                    "

The report, by a group led by Engineering and Power Development Consultants, a subsidiary of Balfour Beatty, the civil engineering group, says the main potential for 'tidal stream energy' lies in the Pentland Firth, between the Scottish mainland and Orkney - where tidal currents can run at up to 12mph - and around the Channel Islands. The Pentland Firth alone could supply three times as much electricity as hydro-electric power stations, at present Britain's biggest source of renewable energy, with 1,000MW of installed capacity. Other areas with significant potential include the Bristol Channel and parts of the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland, together with smaller sites off Port-land Bill in Dorset and off Scotland's west coast. The report recommends the use of proven technology, mainly derived from offshore engineering and windpower expertise. It envisages arrays of 'tide mills' using underwater propellers with diameters of 20 metres. These would either be fixed towers tied to the seabed, dropped from sea surface floats or suspended in mid-water below wave level, using a small-scale adaptation of the technology used in 'tension-leg' oil platforms. The authors are cautious about costs, stressing that these are tentative as no tide-mills yet exist. However, they believe that some of the best Pentland Firth sites could produce power at under 10p per kilowatt. Mr Peter Fraenkel, one of the authors, says experience of other renewable energy research suggests that costs could be cut to half or less of estimates once tidemill generating sets were mass-produced. This summer his 12-strong company, IT Power, will co-operate with Scottish Nuclear and NEL - formerly the National Engineering Laboratory of East Kilbride, near Glasgow - in installing the world's first sea-current power station on an experimental basis in the Corran Narrows in Loch Linnhe, near Fort William. The 10KW unit is regarded as 'a proof of concept' experiment costing just under Pounds 200,000. Mr Fraenkel said power from sea currents was '100 per cent predictable, making it far more reliable than electricity wind energy farms or wave power sites, which produce nothing when the air or sea is calm'. The study was carried out for the DTI by Engineering and Power Development Consultants, with civil engineering consultants Binnie and Partners and builders Sir Robert McAlpine as part of the Renewable Energy Research and Development Programme managed by the Energy Technology Support Unit.

0,FT933-6464 ,"FT933-6464 _AN-DH0CBADEFT 930827   FT  27 AUG 93 / On the bandwagon: Privatisation need not mean price rises      By MICHAEL CASSELL   To the cynical consumer, the pattern looks familiar. With the government intent on privatising British Rail, leaked BR documents suggest passengers on the south-east lines face fare rises of up to 16 per cent. The move is seen as the inevitable fattening up process before BR is auctioned off. The expectation is of further, stinging fare increases. But the widely held perception that, whatever happens to the quality of service, privatisation spells bigger bills, can be wide of the mark. The debate rages over excessive profits and executive rewards in privatised utilities, the first of which, BT, has been free of the state for nearly 10 years. But the evidence suggests consumers have few grounds to complain on prices. Whether or not privatisation is responsible, businesses like BT, British Gas and, for some customers, the regional electricity companies can boast large real price reductions. Low inflation, rising competition and tough regulatory controls have played a part. The price performances of some privatised businesses may look unduly flattering, since they are being compared with large price rises in the run-up to flotation. It is impossible to say with certainty what prices would have been if suppliers had remained in state ownership, though some observers believe they would have offered a better deal to customers. The post-privatisation picture is not all wine and roses for the consumer. The most obvious bad tidings have come from the water industry, where demands for improved quality have imposed high cost burdens, likely to total Pounds 45bn, which are being passed to consumers. Many electricity users, too, have faced significant price rises, although domestic bills this year have been reduced. But UK householders' bills still compare well with others' in Europe. Of the privatised utilities, British Gas seems best at trumpet-blowing, some claim unjustifiably. It claims prices to its 18m domestic consumers have fallen by 20 per cent in real terms since privatisation in 1986, making them the cheapest in Europe. Even with the planned 17.5 per cent value-added tax rate applied, they will be at the lower end of European prices. For industrial gas users in general, the record is even better - with real reductions averaging 25 per cent since 1986. Not everyone, however, is prepared to hand a bouquet to British Gas. Mr George Yarrow, of the Regulatory Policy Research Centre, says the real fall in domestic gas prices is almost entirely due to lower prices on arrival on the beach-head. He stresses electricity prices, which rose sharply prior to privatisation in 1990, have not fallen in real terms since the sell-off. He suggests that average electricity prices were up to 25 per cent higher for domestic customers by 1992 and 19 per cent higher for industrial consumers than they would have been if earlier price trends had continued. But Prof Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, says the arrival of competition in 1990 led to big price falls for industrial users; despite rises since then, many prices remain lower in real terms than before privatisation. Big customers on interruptible gas contracts - they pay less and run the risk of having supplies temporarily cut off - benefit from some of the lowest comparable prices in Europe. Yet some, like ICI, British Steel and Blue Circle Industries are fighting to scale down price rises. Since privatisation, they have had to buy supplies daily on the spot market, whereas before they could strike their own deals with the old Central Electricity Generating Board. For BT, which in 1984 led the privatisation bandwagon, criticism of some high call charges has obscured the overall real fall in bills. But then the Post Office, too, has done well since it split away from BT in 1984. Postal tariffs will rise in November after a two-year freeze, but average letter prices have fallen by 10 per cent in real terms in the past decade. BT rates for local calls - covering a wider range than in many other countries - remain among the most costly in Europe and North America. But international call charges - subject to increasing competition from Mercury  -are among the cheapest. Transatlantic call costs are down more than 40 per cent since the BT sale. Oftel, the industry watchdog which regulates BT by monitoring a basket of its services, says overall prices have fallen in real terms by at least 25 per cent since privatisation. Domestic subscribers with 'medium-sized' bills - an average Pounds 44 a quarter - have seen a 5 per cent average reduction since 1989. Significantly, higher line rental charges - up by about 40 per cent since 1988 - have partially offset lower call charges. The water and sewerage industry has had no good news on prices since privatisation in 1989. But it claims to have to correct decades of under-investment. Average household water bills have risen by almost 37 per cent more than the RPI in the past five years. Consumer surveys by Anglian Water and Welsh Water have found that consumers will accept still higher bills to help pay for water improvement programmes. If the privatised businesses have a mixed record on prices, their future performance seems as likely to depend on the disciplines imposed by their respective regulators as on the varying degrees of marketplace competition they face. As for passengers of a privatised railway system, the expectation is that to help revive a loss-making industry in long-term decline, prices will have to rise before and after privatisation. The government says privatisation will offer more and better trains at attractive fares. In the grand tradition of railway passengers, they will have to wait to find out.

0,FT932-1866 ,"FT932-1866 _AN-DFVCUAC1FT 930622   FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (12): Once more to Sizewell - The UK nuclear sector enters a new phase of uncertainty      By MICHAEL SMITH   BRITAIN'S nuclear industry experienced an uncomfortable winter awaiting the results of the UK's coal review. It emerged intact, and arguably fortified. Now it must go under the microscope, and this time there is much more at stake. As part of the coal review the government brought forward by a year the nuclear review which it promised in 1989 when it decided, or was rather forced by the City, to keep the industry in the public sector rather than privatise it along with the rest of the electricity sector. The government is expected to publish the terms of reference within the next few months and to launch the review later in the year. Environmentalists fear that the wide-ranging debate they have long hoped for will not materialise. Nonetheless the review will set the framework and could decide whether Britain should build a Sizewell C nuclear station in succession to the Sizewell B station, in Suffolk, to be completed next year. Separately, the nuclear industry is to learn - it hopes before the start of the nuclear review - whether it can commission the Thorp nuclear processing plant in Sellafield. A second public inquiry, following the first in the 1970s, is conceivable if unlikely for the Pounds 2.8bn plant which has orders, many from overseas, worth Pounds 9bn for the first decade. Nuclear industry executives go into this period of uncertainty armed with what they feel is ample evidence of the value of nuclear power. Improved efficiency has helped Scottish Nuclear, one of the two state-owned nuclear electricity producers in the UK, to increase its output from 12.2 terawatt hours three years ago to 14.3 last year, a 25 per cent increase achieved from the same plant, and it expects 15.1 twh this year. Two years ago it cost 3.2p to generate a unit (kilowatt hour) of electricity, but that is now down to less than 3p and the target for 1994-5 is 2.5p. Meanwhile, Nuclear Electric, SN's much larger equivalent in England and Wales, has increased its share of the electricity market there to 23 per cent, up from 16 per cent in 1989-90. Staffing levels are falling fast, from 14,200 at the start of the decade to about 9,400 by next March. According to Dr Robin Jeffrey, Scottish Nuclear chief executive, one of the main tasks he and and his colleagues have to perform in the nuclear review is to tell the world that output and efficiency are going up and costs down. 'We have a successful story to tell,' he says. The environment lobby disagrees, and is pressing for the review to be more wide-ranging than the government has indicated it will be. Dr Patrick Green, a Friends of the Earth campaigner, believes ministers want to limit the review to whether the 'market' wishes to build new power stations. That means, he says, that aspects including waste management, decommissioning, financial controls and government cover for future liabilities, will be brushed aside. That is a mistake, he says. 'It is certain that before the private capital markets even begin to contemplate seriously the prospects of investment in new nuclear power stations, potential investors will want to know who will be responsible for covering risks and liabilites.' Behind this lies the belief among environmentalists that the UK is already seriously undercovered for future liabilities. FoE puts financial liability associated with the UK's existing civil nuclear installations at Pounds 30bn, nearly double industry estimates. In a recent report, The National Audit Office said taxpayers may have to pick up some of the bill for decommissioning civil nuclear facilities, notwithstanding the Pounds 1.2bn a year paid by electricity consumers for the nuclear levy created to meet decommissioning costs. One fear of Nuclear Electric is that pressure from large electricity consumers, backed by Offer, the electricity industry regulator, will lead to a reduction in the levy. However, on another issue raised in the coal review, that of whether its eight Magnox stations should be closed early, the company believes it is safe. 'Magnoxes have been examined thoroughly and we got a result,' says Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Electric chief executive. 'The government says they should keep going for as long as they are economic and we will be pressing that their lives be extended.' If it loses the case for extension, Nuclear Electric's share of the England and Wales market will start to fall in the late 1990s from its likely high of 25 per cent next year when Sizewell B comes on stream. Scottish Nuclear will also be pressing for an extension of the life of its Hunterston B advance gas cooled reactor station. For both companies, however, the crucial issue is Sizewell C: Nuclear Electric because it will build and own it; Scottish Nuclear because Sizewell C's go-ahead would increase the chances of it building a new station, Hunterston C, for commissioning around the middle of the next decade. Environmentalists and economists will mount a powerful case against Sizewell C. Nuclear building moratoriums are in place throughout Europe, often in countries with far less natural resource alternatives than the UK. Britain has an energy surfeit for the foreseeable future, and the short term advantage of gas-fired over nuclear power is overwhelming. The Pounds 3.4bn cost of building Sizewell C compares with Pounds 290m which PowerGen, a rival generator, spent on building a station with two fifths of Sizewell C's projected capacity. The nuclear industry's response also mixes environmental with economic considerations. Nuclear power is a necessary ingredient of a balanced energy policy, it says, because it has no carbon dioxide emissions and can therefore provide a future for coal, which has. Mr Hawley also argues that gas prices will rise. 'The nuclear input price is next to nothing,' he says. 'Few people deny that nuclear will be needed two decades from now.' So why not build the stations then? 'Put Sizewell C off and all project management skills will go,' says Mr Hawley. Britain would lose countless opportunities to export its technologies. In the review the government will need to consider where the money will come from. With its own resources under pressure from a growing public sector borrowing requirement, the chances are that it is likely to test the waters for private funds. The last time it tried to interest the City in nuclear power it received an unequivocal negative response, the direct cause of the nuclear review now being planned. There is little to suggest that financiers have changed their minds about a nuclear industry in the private sector with what they see as uncertain liabilities for the past.

0,FT932-7110 ,"FT932-7110 _AN-DEYCHAG8FT 930525   FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (9): Doors opened to foreign investment - China is aiming for an extra 100,000 megawatts in the 1990s      By FRANK GRAY   China's energy planners are confident they will be able to add nearly 100,000MW of power generating capacity to the grid system by the end of the decade. They are counting on accelerated inputs from foreign private sector investors to help achieve this ambitious target. According to energy officials, a total of 12,000-15,000MW of new capacity are being planned for each year for at least the next decade, the major proportion destined for the rapidly industrialising regions in southern and eastern China. Large power stations are also planned at coalfields in the interior. These will require a major extension of transmission lines to shift electricity to the industrial centres. But this adjustment in the location of some new installations will also ease the burden on China's overtaxed rail coal haulage system and gradually minimise coal supply problems at far-distant power stations. The growth, if attained, will bring China's installed capacity to 265,000MW, against the current level of approximately 165,000MW. According to Han Ying, China's vice-minister for coal, the mix will continue to be dominated by coal - some 70 per cent of China's power capacity is coal-fired. Annual coal production is expected to rise to 1.4bn tonnes per year by 2000 compared with 1.1bn tonnes last year. The closing of inefficient pits and the commercialisation of the coal-mining industry could lead to some new thermal projects using other fuel sources. Most of the balance is derived from hydroelectric power - China has Asia's biggest rivers - and preliminary work is already under way on the world's largest hydroelectric project, the 17,000MW Three Gorges scheme on the Upper Yangtse. The China Yangtse Three Gorges Project Development Corp. is now organising the bidding, which will be open to domestic and foreign contractors. First power from the complex could be on line early in the next decade. A third factor in the generating mix is nuclear. Later this year, the first half of the 1,900MW Daya Bay nuclear power project in Guangdong Province near Hong Kong will go on line, to be followed a year later by phase two. The complex is being built by a consortium of the Anglo-French GEC-Alsthom, and the French companies, Framatome, Electricite de France and Campenon Bernard. The Daya Bay complex is expected to be succeeded by another of similar size in southeast China, to be built by foreign companies, which have not yet been designated. China's first power generating reactor, a 300MW unit, went on line at Qinshan, near Shanghai, last year. The Qinshan plant is largely home-grown. A second is planned as part of a programme to add five new reactors with 3,300MW of capacity to the system by the early 2000s. All will be built in the northeast or the southeast. The long lead times for nuclear and hydroelectric mean that there are growing opportunities for non-coal thermal projects, not a significant factor at present. For example, the ABB Group recently announced a 300MW combined cycle contract on behalf of Hong Kong interests for a plant to be set up in southern China. 'The average installation time for combined cycle is 18-24 months, whereas coal stations, which normally are much larger, take 36-48 months to install,' an ABB official said. Given China's 1.1bn population and a birth rate of 17m births a year, analysts say the major challenge will be on funding infrastructure projects. The central and regional power authorities have partially dealt with this by throwing open their doors to foreign investment, not just minority holdings in joint ventures but full ownership. They appear to have accepted in principle the need to establish a commercial approach to tariff rates, without which private sector involvement in the growth programme will dry up. Mr RT Fox, vice-chairman, Kleinwort Benson merchant bank, said in Beijing recently that he was encouraged by China's flexibility. 'Ownership of a power project can vary from 100 per cent Chinese to 100 per cent foreign; the life the venture can be 10 years, 20 years or with no transfer date foreseen. . .' The private sector phenomenon stems from the success of Hong Kong's Hopewell Group, which formed two build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects in southern China, the long-completed 700MW Shajiao B scheme and the new 1,980MW Shajiao C scheme, now under construction. Under these, Hopewell and partners build the plant and sell electricity at commercial rates to the local grid, turning the project back to Chinese ownership after a decade or so of ownership. Since then, BOT and other schemes with indefinite ownership for foreign companies have flourished. In fast-growing Guangdong province, virtually all the 68,000MW of power stations to be installed over the longer term could, it is suggested, have some private sector involvement. The International Finance Corp., the private sector wing of the World Bank, has opened an office in Beijing. Sir William Ryrie, IFC vice-president, said the institution would provide Dollars 600m to help finance projects with a total cost of Dollars 3bn over the next three years. The Asian Development Bank says China's concessional rate borrowings could be as much as Dollars 1bn per year. The World Energy Council has cautioned against over-optimism, suggesting the realistic tariffs hurdle still remained formidable. As of last year, electricity shortages were about 20 per cent of prospective demand. 'A total of 32 counties remain without electricity supply, but the average electricity price paid by urban consumers is only about 3 cents per kilowatt hour, well below the cost of production.'

0,FT934-12733 ,"FT934-12733 _AN-DJYCQAFCFT 931025   FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (20): Alternating currents - Electricity faces commercial war      By QUENTIN PEEL   MR FRIEDHELM GIESKE, the tough-talking boss of mighty RWE, Germany's sixth largest industrial group, and its biggest electricity generator, does not mince his words. He does not like the sort of ideas being proposed in Brussels for more open competition in the European electricity market. He does not think they are fair. If it is going to happen, he is determined that all the operators in the EC market should face the same ground rules. 'The German electricity industry, in so far as it falls under European competition rules, must have the same operating framework, the same risks and opportunities, as the rest of the European industry,' he said recently. He does not think that is true today. The industrial price of electricity in Germany is around six pfennigs per kilowatt-hour more expensive than in France. 'Energy-intensive industry is already looking for other locations outside Germany, because of the high costs,' says Mr Thomas Klante, spokesman for RWE. The German utilities - there are more than 1,000, but the industry is dominated by the Big Three, Bayernwerk in Bavaria, PreussenElektra in Hanover, and RWE in the Ruhr - insist the reason is not their inefficiency or lack of genuine competition. They blame a series of 'special burdens' imposed on the German industry which have made it clearly uncompetitive. The first is the political uncertainty hanging over the future of nuclear power generation in Germany, where all construction of such power stations has come to a complete standstill. Nuclear power provides just 34 per cent of German electricity, compared with some 70 per cent in France. The second burden is the cost of supporting Germany's indigenous hard coal industry, whose output costs around DM275 per tonne, compared with a world market price of around DM85 per tonne. Most of the difference is made up by German consumers, who pay an ill-named 'coal penny', now amounting to a 7.5 per cent surcharge on their bills, to subsidise domestic coal. But the electricity utilities claim that, even with that cash, they still have to cross-subsidise coal-burning power stations with their cheaper nuclear power. The third burden is the very strict environmental legislation in Germany, which has imposed higher standards of pollution, health and safety than in most other EC countries. Now the German government is a prime mover for a carbon dioxide tax in the EC, which would ironically hit Germany hardest, because it burns more coal, above all soft brown coal, in its power stations. Finally there is the unique burden of rebuilding the east German power supply and distribution network, estimated to require an investment of at least DM46bn over the next 10 years. All of those issues are now on the table at an extraordinary round of negotiations between the relevant government ministers, the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), the electricity utilities, and the trade unions, to thrash out an 'energy consensus'. It is peculiarly German, unstructured, and unpredictable in its consequences. The nuclear debate, for a start, looks hopeless. The Greens, who had earned their seat at the table because they are part of ruling coalitions in at least two key state governments - Lower Saxony and Hesse - where nuclear power is generated, have walked out because they have been unable to force through its total abandonment. The SPD is divided between outright opponents of nuclear energy and cautious adherents. In the ruling coalition, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) is strongly pro-nuclear, while the rest are sympathetic but pragmatic. The irony is that the pro-nuclear and pro-coal lobbies have a strong common interest. Both sides argue that, as German coal is so expensive, the country can only afford it if it compensates with cheap nuclear power. 'We are not in competition with nuclear energy,' says Baron Alfred von Spies, head of the German coal industry federation. 'We believe in an energy mix, because it is secure in terms of supply and in terms of risk. Preserving an energy mix is the reason we can afford high subsidies for hard coal.' It is the reason the SPD is divided. Leaders from the big coal mining areas, such as Mr Johannes Rau, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, 'know that the end of nuclear power in Germany means the end of indigenous coal-mining,' says Mr Thomas Roser, director of the nuclear lobby group in Bonn, the Deutsches Atomforum. On the other hand, the power industry is divided. Bayernwerk, in the south, is heavily dependent on nuclear energy, which already accounts for about 70 per cent of its power. RWE and Preussen-Elektra, in the north, could switch to other sources: they could go for coastal power stations fired by gas or imported coal. So they are less committed. The issues on the agenda of the consensus talks are daunting. They must decide on the acceptable operating life of the 20 nuclear power plants which are working. They must decide on an acceptable way of either reprocessing or disposing of their nuclear waste. Nobody really expects them to succeed yet in deciding whether to go ahead with a new generation of N-plants. On the coal front, they must decide on a subsidy system to replace the coal penny which is acceptable both to the European Commission, and the German power industry. For once they are arguing in the same direction. The former wants absolute transparency in coal subsidies, and a plan to phase them out. The latter wants a system which will make the price of German hard coal competitive with the world market price, so they pay no hidden subsidies. The answer would appear to be some form of direct coal tax, payable to the mines. As for the environment, they must decide on the future of the carbon dioxide tax. That is fiercely opposed by the industry, above all RWE, which gets the largest portion of its power supplies from brown coal. 'If the CO2 tax is introduced here, then brown coal will be uncompetitive (with imported coal) from that moment on,' says Mr Klante. 'It is currently the only primary energy source in Germany which has been and will be available in large quantities, and which is not subsidised.' Brown coal is also the source of virtually all power generation in east Germany: 95 per cent in 1992. For the preservation of jobs in east Germany, and for its economic future, brown coal is essential. The East may yet prove to be the soft underbelly of the mighty electricity utilities' total domination of the German industry. The Big Three thought they had the market sewn up with the Stromvertrag (electricity contract) they signed with the transitional East German government, even before unification. The contract was challenged by 164 local authorities in the German constitutional court, because it restricted their rights to generate their own power supplies. The two sides have limped towards a compromise, which allows the local authorities guaranteed access to the utilities' grid. At the same time, the Treuhand privatisation agency, backed by the finance ministry in Bonn, has decided to bring foreign investors into the brown coal mining industry, instead of leaving it all to RWE's Rheinbraun. A consortium of Britain's PowerGen and NRC of the US looks set to buy Mibrag, the middle-German opencast mining operation, and, with it, access to the east German grid. So the utilities are suddenly fighting on three fronts: in Brussels, Bonn and Berlin. Mr Gieske is angry. He insists that the east German brown coal industry will only be economic as a single entity. But if the political authorities are determined to bring in outsiders, so be it. They must live with the uneconomic consequences, he says. Few who know him believe he will give in without a bit more of a fight.   Companies:-  RWE Energie.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

0,FT924-6500 ,"FT924-6500 _AN-CKTBNAF4FT 921120   FT  20 NOV 92 / Power plant switches on 'battery hen'      By ANDREW BAXTER   BRITAIN switched on to poultry power yesterday with the official opening of what is claimed to be the world's first commercial power station fuelled by chicken droppings, giving new meaning to the term 'battery hen'. The Pounds 25m power plant at Eye in Suffolk generates 12.5MW of electricity  -enough for 12,500 homes - from poultry litter: a mixture of wood shavings, straw and poultry droppings that can be burnt at very high temperatures to produce steam. The plant will use 130,000 tonnes of poultry litter a year - nearly 9 per cent of the 1.5m tons produced annually in the UK or enough to fill 25 football fields 2m deep. According to Fibropower, the London-based company that built the plant and developed the technology, chicken power is generating worldwide interest. Mr Rupert Fraser, finance director, said it could be used wherever there was sufficient density of poultry droppings. The fuel used at Eye represents the 'output' of 70m chickens. As the birds are harvested every few months, that is equivalent to a population of 12.5m birds at any one time - so the plant's output is produced at the rate of one watt per chicken. Mr Fraser emphasised that the plant used poultry litter only from broiler poultry farms, where the birds live on a bed of deep litter. This provides a regular fuel source as the chicken farmers have to clear their sheds frequently, and a consistent fuel because of supermarkets' need for uniform quality chickens. Although the process is no more efficient than a similar-sized coal-fired power station, Fibropower says that replacing a coal power station with chicken power, along with the associated handling in poultry litter, will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by two-thirds. The only significant byprod-uct is ash, which will be sold as an environmentally friendly, nitrogen-free fertiliser. The Suffolk plant was one of 75 renewable-energy projects approved in 1990 and is the largest to start operating under the non-fossil-fuel obligation of the 1989 Electricity Act. That obliges the 12 regional electricity companies to take fixed proportions of the electricity available from renewable-energy projects. Eastern Electricity has taken a minority stake in Fibropower, and has invested Pounds 2m at Eye and a larger 13.5MW chicken power plant being built at Glanford, south Humberside, by Fibrogen, a Fibropower sister company.

The division of product classes by capacity is not mentioned. Their arguments deal generally with economic and utility issues, i.e., the ability of products without an electric cord to provide heat if a power outage occurs, and the affordability of these products to lower-income people. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 6; Energen, No. 12 at 1213; and AGLC, No. 29 at 3).

(California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 4).    As stated above, the Department does not believe that the ability of gas equipment to operate during electricity outages is a utility that requires separating the existing gravity product classes into those with and without a power cord. Instead, designs that use electricity are evaluated on their economic advantages and disadvantages. The Department has kept the four product class categories as designated by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. The categories are: fan-wall, gravity-wall, room, and floor. With respect to division by capacity, the Department kept the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act divisions during the engineering analyses. The current class divisions by capacity are necessary because of the manner in which direct heating equipment is evaluated by the DOE test procedure. The energy descriptor for this equipment, the annual fuel utilization efficiency, is a function of, among other things, the pilot fraction. The pilot fraction is defined as the energy input rate to the pilot light (Q    p    ) divided by the steady-state heat input rate to the heater (Q    in    ). As the pilot fraction decreases, the annual fuel utilization efficiency will increase. For each of the four categories of direct heating equipment (fan-wall, gravity-wall, room, floor), the pilot light input rate is constant. Thus, for heaters of two different capacities within the same category and with the same steady-state efficiency, the annual fuel utilization efficiency will always be higher for the larger capacity equipment. The division of classes by capacity is required to account for this relationship between the annual fuel utilization efficiency and the pilot fraction.        Design options.     The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that gravity-type direct heating units provide a unique utility in that they operate during an electrical power outage. In addition, gravity-type equipment can be used where an external electrical source is not available. Because of these reasons, the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association argued that design options requiring electricity should not be required for floor heaters, room heaters, or gravity wall furnaces. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association No. 40 at 6).    As stated above, the Department does not believe that the ability of gas equipment to operate during electric outages is a utility that forecloses consideration of electricity-using design options for those appliances. Therefore, the Department considered, for economic justification, design options that would require electricity for gravity wall, floor, and room direct heating equipment.    With regard to electronic ignition systems, both Southern Gas Association and North Carolina Public Service Co. stated that adding an automatic ignition system and electronic controls would add significantly to the price of direct heating equipment. The Southern Gas Association said it would add $190 while North Carolina Public Service Co. stated it would add $150 to $200. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 7; North Carolina Public Service Co., No. 74 at 5). The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy said that intermittent ignition device and vent dampers should be considered separately.

The Department took into account all sources of available data when determining the cost of an electronic ignition system for direct heating equipment. Sources of data included manufacturers, suppliers, utilities, and published papers and reports. The electronic ignition design option was evaluated not only separately from any other design option, but also with other design options, including vent dampers.    The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association commented that increased insulation does not improve the energy efficiency of room heaters since this equipment is located within the heated space. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 6).    The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's comment and is not considering the increased insulation design option for room heaters or wall furnaces.

0,FT932-3059 ,"FT932-3059 _AN-DFPCDACYFT 930616   FT  16 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: The smart way to save energy - A Canadian company is showing utilities the virtues of power conservation      By STEPHEN WISENTHAL   Saving energy is generally far cheaper than building new power plant, but convincing consumers of this simple and obvious message takes effort and skilful persuasion. However, a Canadian company has taken on the task of preaching the virtues of power conservation to utilities and energy users around the world. Its scheme has attracted more than 25 utilities, from Mexico to the Czech republic, and others are expected to join soon. Power Smart began as the energy conservation initiative of British Columbia Hydro, the government-owned utility. The company spent CDollars 60m (Pounds 30.7m) developing a wide-ranging package of programmes for its own use, and then realised it could do even better if it worked with other utilities. BC Hydro found that the province's population of 3.5m was not enough to interest manufacturers to go along with its plans. They were reluctant to take the trouble to meet BC Hydro's standards for products such as energy-saving motors, low-power refrigerators or high-efficiency insulation, and then face the same process for the next utility down the road. So BC Hydro set about bringing other utilities into its scheme. It transferred its conservation expertise into a separate company - Power Smart  -two years ago. Now, most of Canada's electrical utilities have signed up, and Power Smart is optimistic about further expansion in eastern Europe, South America and the US, all areas which already have one or more members. In March, the firm signed up its second US member, American Municipal Power-Ohio (AMP-Ohio), which supplies electricity to more than 77 communities. The utilities which have joined vary widely in size. BC Hydro has a capacity of more than 10,000MW, mainly from hydroelectric dams, and supplies more than 1.3m customers. The smallest member, Caribbean Utility Company, on Grand Cayman Island, uses diesel generators with just 71MW of capacity for 12,600 customers. But they all face the same simple economics - it is nearly always cheaper to encourage users to save a kilowatt hour of electricity than it is to build the capacity to generate an extra kilowatt hour. At BC Hydro, which has low power costs, it is estimated to be five times more expensive to increase capacity than to save energy. Nor does the strictly financial cost of expanding capacity include the strains that generating electricity places on the environment. The generic term for schemes such as Power Smart is demand-side management. Once a typical programme is up and running, most of the money is returned to customers in the form of rebates, customer help lines and other types of service, says Tom Cave, Power Smart's director of energy services. Short-term financial incentives are used to overcome customers' resistance to the higher initial cost of energy-efficient equipment, but the benefits - to the customer and the utility - last much longer. And a crucial component of the programme is marketing. 'To get past the engineering barriers, you have to get people to think about conserving energy. The most powerful energy-saving technique of all is changing people's attitudes, and changing attitudes is essentially a marketing function,' says Cave. Under the umbrella of demand-side management, different utilities have widely varying goals. Utilities in developed countries usually want to discourage consumption across the board - for industrial, commercial and individual customers. In eastern Europe, on the other hand, the problem is seen as too much consumption by industrial users and not enough by residential consumers. Governments there want citizens to have refrigerators and other items which improve the quality of life, says Eric Cardey, a vice-president at Power Smart. Another important driving force behind conservation in eastern Europe is to preserve the environment. Much of the region's electricity is generated from low-grade coal, which contains up to 3.5 per cent sulphur and creates considerable pollution. Unfortunately, conservation cannot be the region's only concern. Large generating complexes were built under the communists to serve industry. Industrial demand, particularly for military production, has fallen off  - but they have to keep selling the electricity to cover the cost of running the power plants they already have. Yet governments in eastern Europe are taking a longer term view about residential consumption. 'If they don't get energy efficient now, because there is so much retrofitting and new construction taking place, they're going to miss the boat,' says Cardey. And the Czechs and Slovaks have realised the importance of marketing in achieving these goals. When they joined Power Smart, they obtained the right to use the name and logo in their advertising and access to programmes for everything from low-energy water heating and lighting to efficient air compressors and even buildings. As an indication of the sort of success they can hope for, Cardey cites the promotion of the use of energy-efficient motors in British Columbia. The motors have a higher cost, which pays for itself in 1.5 to two years through energy savings. The average market share for high-efficiency motors for manufacturing use in North America is 3 per cent. In British Columbia, that share has been increased to 75 per cent since the Power Smart programme began. Arthur Geikie, president of Power Smart, says the strength of his company's programme is that it offers a complete range of conservation plans - for residential, industrial, commercial and institutional users. Being a member of Power Smart allows small utilities to take advantage of research they could not afford, he adds. For an annual fee ranging from CDollars 10,000 for a utility with fewer than 10,000 customers to CDollars 75,000 for a million or more customers, Power Smart provides the right to use its logo in promotional materials. The utilities can also pick from a 'library' of tested and proven ideas and, perhaps just as importantly, avoid costly mistakes. Given the importance of marketing in encouraging conservation, the Power Smart brand name is seen as a key element, providing a shorthand for manufacturers and consumers to rally around. Even in non-English speaking countries such as the Czech and Slovak republics, the English language logo is used alongside a translation. The company endorses products, allowing manufacturers to use the Power Smart logo on qualifying items and making it easy for consumers to identify energy-efficient choices. A large number of Canadian suppliers are already involved. And companies such as Philips, the Dutch electrical concern, and Tungsram, the Hungarian subsidiary of General Electric of the US, are looking at certification for some of their products. Power Smart has carried out consulting work in countries, including Costa Rica, Peru, Thailand and Russia, which have little or no history of demand-side management and which it is hoped will sign up as members in the future. Utilities in developed countries have tended to be a harder market. They usually already have some kind of demand-side management in place, and it is more difficult to convince them of the benefits of banding together. Western Europe has less need for help, largely because electricity prices have been very high for a long time. 'Europeans seem to have positive attitudes already,' says Cardey. For the future, Power Smart hopes to continue expanding. It has signed up its first gas utility and hopes to add more. In the long run, Power Smart expects regions where a number of utilities have signed up, and achieved 'critical mass', to become more autonomous, sharing resources within the region with counterparts which have similar concerns. If BC Hydro, with some of the cheapest electricity in the world, can justify spending money to reduce consumption, anyone can, says Cardey.   Companies:-  Power Smart.   Countries:-  CAZ  Canada.

They would build, own and operate their own plants, the costs of which would be recovered through the sale of electricity to Taipower. The plan could be the first step in a deregulation of the sector. According to the company, 10 sites have been selected. Initially, they would only be open to Taiwan investors, although foreign investment would be a logical next step. Power plants of up to 750MW could be built on the sites. Nearly all the principal equipment would be bought from foreign suppliers. Taiwan's aggressive power expansion programme has prompted the need for private sector capital. Taipower's installed capacity is more than 19,000MW, but it intends to increase this to 30,000MW by the year 2000. Analysts say this will require an investment of at least Dollars 14bn. The state utility, which operates 56 power stations, three of them nuclear, wants to unload some of the burden of environmental responsibility on the private sector. Taiwan's environmental lobby has been active in opposing new power stations, particularly the proposed 2,300MW of nuclear capacity planned for Yenliao in northern Taiwan.

Such a switch is believed to be among the measures under consideration by MPs on the Commons trade and industry committee, which will announce proposals to boost the coal sector later this month. In a confidential memo to the committee, the DTI says: 'It would not be possible under the Electricity Act 1989 to divert the levy to other purposes such as the funding of the fitting of flue gas desulphurisation to existing coal-fired stations. 'However . . . the coal review is considering methods and costs of reducing the price of British coal by providing support to the coal industry, for example by subsidy or levy arrangements.' In the six months to last September, Nuclear Electric - the state-owned nuclear power generator - received income of Pounds 632m from the levy to help it finance the heavy decommissioning costs of its nuclear plant. That helped it to report a half-yearly operating profit of Pounds 255m. Ministers have also cast doubt on the practicality of abandoning arrangements enabling France to supply up to 6 per cent of the electricity that is sold in England and Wales. That has been suggested by some observers as another possible means of helping the domestic coal industry.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911  Electric Services.

Police said the bombs had blown up three high-voltage pylons in southern Chile. Explosive devices were also hurled against a police station and army buildings in Santiago during the black-out. No one was injured. A similar attack last week briefly cut power to the capital. Police yesterday blamed the attacks on the Manuel Rodrguez Patriotic Front, a small Marxist guerrilla group that refused to lay down its arms after Chile's return to democracy in March 1990. The group has been weakened by desertions and internal divisions, and has seemed largely inactive for most of this year. Police suspect the attacks were meant to draw attention to some 40 political prisoners in Chile. Six guerrillas have been on hunger strike for a month in protest at their prolonged captivity. Chile's political prisoners are one of the unsolved legacies of General Augusto Pinochet's 16-year dictatorship. Many have been in jail for years awaiting trial, while others were convicted in military courts on the basis of confessions extracted under torture. President Patricio Aylwin has pardoned some 300 political prisoners since he took office, but says he cannot free the remainder as they were involved in crimes of violence.

The 319 votes to 297 victory - a government majority of 22 - removed any question mark over the political career of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. A Labour amendment calling for domestic coal production to be maintained at present volumes was earlier defeated by 320 votes to 295. In both cases, the government's majority was bolstered by the support or abstentions of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs who last week won at least Pounds 10m extra help from the Northern Ireland Office for industrial electricity users in the province. Four Conservatives - Mr Bill Cash (Stafford), Mr Richard Alexander (Newark), Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (Batley and Spen) and Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) - voted against the government motion. Another 16 did not vote, of whom three - Mr Steven Day (Cheadle), Mr Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire South), and Mr Winston Churchill (Davyhulme) - were believed deliberately to have abstained. These figures compared with six votes against and five abstentions when MPs debated the government's original pit closure programme last October. In a sometimes stormy debate, Mr Heseltine used the promise of 'hundreds of millions of pounds' in subsidies to the coal industry to keep the backbench revolt below danger levels. There was 'a significant new market to go for', he told a sceptical Commons. 'We have made it clear that the best hope for British Coal is to take advantage of the opportunity we have provided.' But a series of interventions by possible rebels indicated that he had not completely calmed fears that the 12 reprieved pits might not survive for more than a year. These fears were played on by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, in a spirited plea to Tory MPs to join Labour in voting down the white paper. Today was the day for Tories who had voiced displeasure at the original pit closure announcement last October to make good the promises they had made five months ago to Britain's mining communities, Mr Cook argued. The debate came as the coal and electricity industries completed signing contracts for the sale of 160m tonnes of coal over five years, leaving the way clear for talks on extra sales aimed at saving the 12 reprieved pits. British Coal yesterday joined Mr Heseltine in admitting it could not forecast how big the extra market would be above the core contract. 'The generators and rest of electricity industry will effectively decide the future for our pits,' the company said.

Earnings from ordinary operations amounted to Sch1.28bn (Dollars 106.3m) on sales totalling Sch6.13bn. The earnings reflected an increase of 7.3 per cent over the figure for the same period a year earlier. The improvement was achieved despite a mild winter and pointed to strong results for the full year, the company said. The positive results were reflected in a 45 per cent rise in the value of EVN shares on the Vienna stock exchange, with the price of a share rising to Sch1,596 in February from Sch1,100 on September 1. The company has looked to expand its activities in central and eastern Europe and recently signed co-operation agreements with JMP and JME, two Brno-based Czech utilities, supplying natural gas and electricity respectively. This follows two earlier agreements signed with JCE, a south Bohemian electricity company, and Degaz, the Hungarian gas supply company. 'These agreements represent a preparatory step in a process which we hope will lead to EVN taking stakes in one or more of these companies,' said Mr Rudolf Gruber, EVN chairman.

The project would have been the largest renewable energy scheme in the UK. The decision follows final government refusal to help keep the project in place until the economic and political climate improved. Funding has been shared equally between public and private sectors. The barrage was expected to have a capacity of 700MW, enough for three-quarters of Liverpool's needs. It would also have created about 5,000 jobs and made a substantial contribution to the legal obligation of Manweb, the local electricity supplier, to take 20 per cent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources. The shareholders include Alfred McAlpine, Barclays Bank, BICC, Blue Circle, Costain, Ocean Marine, Rolls-Royce Engineering, Royal Insurance, Shell, Tarmac and Trafalgar House. Local shareholders are represented by Littlewoods, Mersey Docks, Manweb, Trinity International and Liverpool University. They believed they could raise about Pounds 400m, but wanted advance payments from the government's non-fossil fuel levy on consumers to fund the rest, with eventual repayments. Mr James McCormack, company secretary of Tarmac Construction and general manager of the barrage company, said yesterday: 'In years to come environmental issues will assume greater political significance.

0,FT942-9120 ,"FT942-9120 _AN-EEQDYAG2FT 940517   FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (4): Too quiet at home  -Japan's Big Three join race for East Asian orders      By RONALD AYERS   SLOW GROWTH at home is making Japan's power equipment makers turn to the high growth East Asian markets. They are led by Toshiba and Hitachi, better known for their light electronics products, and Mitsubishi, the heavy industrial group. While the electronics industry has been suffering over the last few years, both Toshiba and Hitachi have remained profitable thanks to their heavy electrical businesses. Now, however, these divisions are also in trouble as Japan's economy slows and as Japanese companies become increasingly ready to take advantage of cheaper imports. For the Japanese power equipment makers this competition reduces their margins even when they succeed in winning domestic buiness. 'Until now, the power companies have stuck with particular makers,' says Katsuro Tsujiyama, manager of the power systems marketing planning department at Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MEC), which provides generating equipment and electrical systems for power stations contracted by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). 'But this system is collapsing, partly because of pressure from America and Europe,' he says. 'It has a big effect on us. Buying abroad is cheaper and the power companies can get us to reduce our prices.' The solution they have hit on is a traditional one for Japanese companies: look abroad. However, this time they are not eyeing Europe and the US, whose markets are marred by recession and trade friction, but Asia. Countries with fast-growing economies such as Malaysia and Indonesia are still plagued by power shortages which they want to remove as soon as possible. 'We're thinking about developing countries,' says Hiroharu Takayasu, deputy manager of the overseas marketing group of MEC's power department. 'The priority market now is Hong Kong - the economy is growing and its light industry is getting bigger. China is the biggest hope for the future and Thailand has a lot of potential.' Baring Securities (Japan) reported last year that MHI's Asian sales could well rise from around 10 per cent of total parent turnover in the year ending March 31, 1993 to around 30 per cent over the next five or 10 years. The company's power equipment division increased its export ratio from 30 per cent in fiscal 1991 to 35 per cent the following year, it said. The pattern of increasing demand is similar throughout the region. First, demand comes from industrial development. Countries inviting foreign investment need a solid infrastructure, a major aspect of which is electric power to run factories. Later, consumers using the products of these factories create further demand. However, countries vary widely in how they award contracts to satisfy this. China, says MEC's Takayasu, while having the largest potential, is one of the trickiest markets. Foreigners angling for contracts have to negotiate a maze of opaque regulations and tariffs, which often vary from state to state. Thailand, on the other hand, is clear and open, making it, he says, 'the hardest in the world'. The Mitsubishi group has received an estimated Yen 30bn order for three steam turbines and generating equipment for Indonesia's Surabaya thermal power station, which will make a total of 24 steam turbines it has supplied to that country's electricity generating authority. Hitachi and Toshiba are moving in the same direction, a policy that sits well with their company-wide strategies to get into emerging consumer markets: as well as making electricity generating equipment, they also need electricity to set up consumer goods factories and to see their products being used in people's homes. Most developing countries want to develop their own equipment industries to a degree, so participating in their markets often means local joint ventures or co-operation at the technological or manufacturing level rather than exporting completed products, according to Toshiba. While India, Vietnam and the Asean nations are all attractive markets, China stands out with its vast population, double-digit economic growth and untapped natural resources. Hitachi says there are already plans there to add 15GW of new capacity annually. Two thirds of this will be in thermal plants, to take advantage of the country's abundant coal, and Hitachi announced last November a joint venture, Beijing Hitachi Huasun Control System, to make and sell control systems for thermal plants in China. In January, it set up a joint venture with Harbin Electric Machinery Works to provide engineering services for electricity plants, mainly in hydro-electric power. It hopes this company will later become a base for supplying generating equipment.   Companies:-  Toshiba Corp.     Hitachi.     Mitsubishi Corp.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

There is little prospect of rain, and reservoirs are drying into baked mud. If this continues the country could face a complete black-out by the end of April. The winter rains are late and the El Nino current off the Pacific coast appears to be upsetting normal weather patterns. But bad planning, heavy debts, corruption, budget deficits, deforestation and poor management are behind the electricity problems. Colombia's generating capacity is 8,200MW, more than adequate for normal demand levels. Despite the country's ample coal and oil reserves, 78 per cent of power comes from large, expensive hydro-electric schemes which have pushed the sector's foreign debt up to more than Dollars 5bn. To try to save on costs, electricity companies have been running down the reservoirs rather than use thermal plants at full capacity. Labour and financial problems have also delayed the maintenance of thermal power stations, while guerrilla attacks have put distribution lines out of action. The rationing aims to cut overall consumption by about a third. The government has asked industry to shut down for 10 days over Easter and to send workers on holiday.

0,FT921-10116 ,"FT921-10116 _AN-CBGA3AE8FT 920207   FT  07 FEB 92 / Domestic electricity users to get refund      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   EIGHT regional electricity companies are to return a total of Pounds 35m to their domestic customers because of overcharging last year. The money will be returned in the form of lower tariffs rather than in cash. The overcharging resulted from the sharp fall in the rate of inflation last year. Electricity companies have to announce their tariffs in advance using assumptions about the likely level of inflation. These turned out to be too high in many cases. The agreement to refund customers followed action by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of electricity supply, who regulates the industry. In October he wrote to several regional suppliers warning them that they might be overcharging, and subsequently launched an inquiry. He said yesterday: 'The companies have taken reasonable steps to share with customers some of the benefits of lower inflation, and this year's tariff increases can be expected to be below inflation. I believe that customers can regard this as a satisfactory outcome.' Four of the eight companies, London Electricity, Manweb, Seeboard and Yorkshire Electricity, have agreed to return all the excess they earned last year. But the other four argued that the terms of their operating licences allowed them to keep part of the excess to cover the sharp rise in their own costs, mainly the cost of buying electricity. This was accepted by Prof Littlechild. The four are Eastern Electricity, Northern Electric, Norweb and Southern Electric. The excesses earned by the eight companies (and the amounts they have agreed to return) are: Eastern Electricity Pounds 15m (Pounds 3m), London Electricity Pounds 4m (Pounds 4m), Manweb Pounds 2m (Pounds 2m), Northern Electric Pounds 5m (Pounds 4m), Norweb Pounds 9m (Pounds 5m), Seeboard Pounds 6m (Pounds 6m), Southern Electric Pounds 12m (Pounds 5m) and Yorkshire Electric Pounds 6m (Pounds 6m). Mr Jim Hart, Southern's commercial director, one of the companies holding back part of the excess, said that purchase costs had gone up 'quite dramatically since we made our assumptions'. But he said next year's tariff would still rise by less than the rate of inflation which Southern expects to be in the range of 4-4.5 per cent. Yorkshire, one company which is refunding all its excess, said the giveback would have only a small effect on profitability.  The Financial Times   London Page 14  "
0,FT924-10252 ,"FT924-10252 _AN-CKAABAFFFT 921031   FT  31 OCT 92 / What future for Coal?: Review sparks nuclear reaction - A nervous sector is preparing its case for survival      By DAVID LASCELLES   AS Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, tries to find more room in the energy market for coal, he is making the nuclear power industry nervous. Dogged by controversy and high costs, its members sense that the industry may be a ready candidate for scaling back, and the fact that the UK's earliest reactors are approaching the end of their lives anyway provides a convenient excuse for replacing them with coal. Also, since the nuclear industry is one of the few energy sectors left in public ownership, it is available for manipulation by the government. But the nuclear industry will fight back. Within hours of the announcement of Mr Heseltine's review, Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Electric's chief executive, was promoting its virtues. To cut nuclear power, he said, would be a 'quick fix' that would ignore the industry's long-term benefits. This week the Nuclear Forum, the industry's trade group, launched its own campaign. Nuclear's case is built largely on claiming to provide the cheapest large-scale electricity supplies in the long term. It is also environmentally friendlier than fossil fuel and could help the coal industry by offsetting heavy emissions. At present, nuclear accounts for about 20 per cent of the electricity generated in the UK, and its share is rising fast. It is produced mainly by Nuclear Electric, with 12 stations in England and Wales, and Scottish Nuclear, which has a further two plants. NE operates at a heavy loss, as it was incorporated by the government without financial provisions to decommission its nuclear reactors. The deficit is made up by a Pounds 1.3bn levy on electricity bills which is due to be phased out by 1998, although NE hopes to be making a profit before then. Scottish Nuclear has provisions and already makes a modest profit. The real question facing Mr Heseltine is whether coal has a stronger claim to subsidy than nuclear power. Although the latter claims to produce some of the cheapest electricity available, that has been challenged by its competitors. Professor Peter Jones, a consultant to Nuclear Forum, says nuclear would be able to generate power at 3p a kilowatt hour by the year 2000. Other power generators estimate that NE's costs are anywhere between 3.5p and 8p a kWh, compared with less than 3p for coal-fired power stations. They maintain that keeping nuclear going at coal's expense is vastly uneconomic. It would be more sensible to phase out the early stations rather than extend their lives, as seemed to be the government's plan until recently. Mr Hawley vigorously denies the figures. The early stations, he says, have had all their costs written off and are generating electricity at a mere 1.2p a kWh. It would be crazy, he says, to shut down such a cheap power source, particularly since that might lead to higher energy imports. The Treasury would also have to stump up decommissioning costs running into billions. It is not just a question of whether existing stations should be phased out, but also whether additional ones should be built. That is central to the nuclear industry's argument that it can become truly economic only if allowed to build many stations to achieve economies of scale. NE makes much of the fact that the only station under construction, Sizewell B in Suffolk, is ahead of schedule and on budget. Although its cost is a huge Pounds 2bn, the station should be able to generate power for 3.8p a kWh, according to Mr Hawley. If NE was allowed to build a proposed Sizewell C, the generating cost would fall below 3p. Those figures, though, are based on financing costs of 5 per cent for B and 8 per cent for C. Other power generating projects being planned in the private sector assume 12 per cent. 'Where would Nuclear Electric get money at 8 per cent?' asks a senior electricity industry executive. Mr Stephen Ogle, NE's financial control director, says finance would be available either from the government, with its new interest in large job-creating projects, or from the private sector, which, he maintains, is showing signs of overcoming its suspicions about nuclear power. Mr Heseltine's review comes too soon for nuclear power. The government had previously promised to review the industry in 1994, and both NE and Scottish Nuclear were gearing up for then: Sizewell B would be up and running, the sector's financial performance would have improved, and the environmental case might have strengthened. If nuclear does now face the axe, it will argue that it has not been given a fair chance to prove its case.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

Gordeyev: ""Energy Resources: At the End of  Their Service Life""]    [Text] The fuel and energy complex denotes not only  the ""bread of industry"" but also the heat in our homes, motor  fuel for our cars, and finally the state's main exportable  commodity. What are the prospects of the sector in the year to  come?    According to projections of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy,  the production and extraction of fuel resources in  1994 will be 5 percent below the level of last year. In the  process, the proportion of natural gas in the structure of  primary fuel and energy resources will increase to 49.5 percent,  compared to 47 percent last year.    The output of oil and gas condensate is expected  to come to 327 million tonnes in 1994, compared to 354 million  tonnes last year, of which 83.6 million tonnes will be in the  first quarter of 1994, compared to 91 million tonnes in the  first quarter of 1993. In the process, the rate of decline in  the output of oil will come to 8 percent in 1994, compared to  11.3 percent in 1993 and 14 percent in 1992.    Considerable depletion of oil reserves at the already  developed pools is the main problem of the sector. This is the  reason for the high rate of decline in the output of oil. By  now, 48 percent of the initial oil reserves has been withdrawn  from these pools.    It is only possible to prevent a drop in the output of oil  on  the condition that new pools with total reserves of about 6.5  billion tonnes are put into production in an accelerated manner.  With a view to providing incentives for such work, the  government exempted enterprises of the oil industry from the  payment of export and import duties in 1993, as well as from the  compulsory sale of foreign exchange proceeds from the delivery  of oil for export. The above preferences yielded about 1.8  trillion rubles [R] to the oil-producing enterprises. Foreign  companies were used to repair wells.    As a result of the measures taken, industrial production was  started at 27 oil pools in the first 10 months of 1993 alone,  compared to 10 pools in 1992.    In order to build on this trend, a government decision  envisions leaving up to 60 percent of oil produced by new wells  at the disposal of the sector so that proceeds from its sale  will be earmarked for upgrading, new construction projects, and  the development of new pools.    The process of forming new market structures (joint-stock  companies, oil companies, joint ventures with foreign  investment) will continue in the oil industry. In 1993 the  production of oil by these enterprises increased by a factor of  more than two compared to 1992 and reached about 12 million  tonnes. According to a projected estimate, in 1994 they will  produce on the order of 14 million tonnes.    The delivery of crude oil to oil-refining  enterprises is projected for 1994 in the amount of 226  million tonnes, of which 59 million tonnes will be in the first  quarter, that is, at a level approximating that of last year.  The output of light refinery products will increase somewhat due  to the deeper processing of the raw material, and will come to  32.2 million tonnes of gasoline, 58.1 million tonnes of diesel  fuel, and 12.5 million tonnes of jet fuel.    Low capacity utilization of the oil refineries of Russia in  primary oil processing poses a problem in the development of the  industry. Capacity utilization (excluding the enterprises of the  city of Groznyy) is expected to amount to 72 percent this year.  Some enterprises are at the critical level of capacity  utilization. These are the Saratov Oil Refinery (55 percent),  the Orsknefteorgsintez Production Association (61 percent), the  Kuybyshevnefteorgsintez Production Association (62 percent) and  the Bashneftekhimzavody Production Association (57 percent). A  further decline in the processing of products will bring about a  sharp drop in effectiveness, a growth in the costs of  production, and a deterioration in the quality of manufactured  products, which will cause additional difficulties in selling  them.    With a view to improving the effectiveness of crude oil  processing, the government has resolved to upgrade 17 out of 28  Russian oil refineries. Long-term quotas for the export of  refinery products have been allocated to these enterprises by  way of state support measures. In 1993 oil-refining enterprises  were also exempted from the compulsory sale of 50 percent of  foreign exchange proceeds and from the payment of export customs  duties.    The gas industry, which has a more reliable raw  material base, has a realistic opportunity to increase the  production of fuel and energy resources. In 1994 the output of  gas is expected to amount to 620 billion cubic meters, 165.2  billion cubic meters of which in the first quarter.    However, the failure of consumers to pay for gas consumed,  which has been continuous in recent years, has brought about a  virtual halt of construction work in the sector because of lack  of funds. By the end of 1993 the amount of arrears in payments  for gas reached 2.124 trillion rubles.    In conjunction with this, the volume of work on surface  facilities at Urengoy, Yamburg, and other fields in the  Nadym-Pur-Tazovskiy region in Tyumen Oblast has been reduced, as  well as that of the work on developing fields on the Yamal  Peninsula and the construction of main gas pipelines and their  lateral pipelines (in the first 10 months of 1993, 441  kilometers out of 6,758 kilometers planned by the enterprises  were commissioned, as were four compressor stations out of 27).    The volume of coal production in 1994 is projected  to reach 275 million tonnes, compared to 300 million tonnes in  1993.    The growth of transportation rates for freight carriage has  perceptibly promoted the shrinkage of markets for the sale of  coal both within Russia and for export. Thus, the carriage of  steam coal from the Kuznetsk area over 3,000-4,000 kilometers  within the country actually doubles its final price due to the  cost of delivery. The price of coal exceeds world prices if it  is exported over 4,000-5,000 kilometers to the port of shipment.  With a view to rectifying this situation with regard to the  Kuzbass, a decision has now been made which envisions reducing  railway tariffs by a factor of two for the export shipment of  coal, with financial assistance provided to railway  transportation enterprises and organizations.    A continuous deterioration of the pool of mines and the  growth of production costs and the danger level in mining  operations are some of the main problems of the sector. Of 270  mines, 60 percent have been in service for more than 20 years  and have not been upgraded throughout the entire period of  operation.    A shortage of financial funds exacerbated by delays in the  receipt of subsidies from the budget and consumer arrears is the  restricting factor in coal production. Work on the construction  and upgrading of 48 underground mines and strip mines has  already been suspended for this reason.    A decision to establish a fund of financial support for  coal-producing enterprises through the introduction of a special  tax has been made in order to financially stabilize the  operation of the coal industry. The monies of this fund will be  earmarked for reorganizing unpromising underground and strip  mines, implementing restructuring and development of the sector,  maintaining social facilities, and making payments under the  pay-scale agreement.    A list of unpromising underground and strip mines, with a  total coal-producing capacity of 11.2 million tonnes a year and  number of industrial and production personnel exceeding 48,000,  has been drawn up. At the first stage it is planned to close  down 11 mines with a total capacity of 2 million tonnes of coal  a year, with the number of industrial and production personnel  coming to 9,600.    In conjunction with this, a program for restructuring the  coal industry will have to be developed in 1994 and its  implementation will have to begin. The program should envision  an improvement in the competitiveness of coal production and  reorganization of unpromising underground mines and strip mines,  including a subprogram for ensuring the employment of released  miners.    The generation of electricity in 1994 is projected  in the amount of 910 billion kw-hours (in the first quarter--167  billion kw-hours), compared to 945 billion kw-hours in 1993 (in  the first quarter--277 billion kw-hours). A strained power  supply situation continues in a number of regions of Russia. An  electricity deficit in North Caucasus has been caused mainly by  a power capacity shortage in conjunction with the suspension of  the construction of the Rostov AES [nuclear power station], in  the Transbaykal area--by the failure to commission capacity at  the Kharanor Power Station, and in the Far East--by a shortage  of fossil fuels.    Consumer insolvency is the main problem of the power  industry, as in all sectors of the fuel and energy complex.    State regulation of electricity and heat rates at two  levels,  federal and regional, by the relevant energy commissions is  expected to be maintained in 1994, and the system of electricity  rates for consumers is expected to be streamlined. In the  process, the procedure in effect for settlements for electricity  with agricultural consumers should change, with the latter being  transferred to the regulated group. Rates for the  energy-intensive enterprises of the metallurgical and chemical  industries should be set by applying the 0.8 coefficient to the  level of average transfer rates for electricity for industrial  consumers in a region, and rates for research institutes and  centers of national significance which have energy-intensive  production facilities--at the average producer cost of  electricity in a region.    The commissioning of more than 1.6 million kw of new power  capacity is planned for 1994, including the Kharanor State  Regional Electric Power Station, the Komsomolsk and Tomsk Heat  and Electric Power Stations, the Kolyma Hydroelectric Power  Station, and other installations.

0,FT941-7254 ,"FT941-7254 _AN-EBYDJAE1FT 940225   FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Employment in utilities down 0.4m in decade      By DAVID GOODHART   Britain's gas, electricity, water and telecommunications industries employed between them about 900,000 people in 1983, according to Department of Employment figures. A decade of privatisation and competition later the figure had fallen to less than 500,000. This is the job-shedding context in which the announcement from British Gas must be seen. The combination of competition, altered management culture, and, at least in the case of telecommunications, changed technology, has seen a substantial increase in productivity and a jobs shake-out over the past decade in these industries. Much of the job-shedding occurred in the run up to privatisation, but the trend has continued since. British Gas employed about 90,000 people just before privatisation in 1986 and is now down to 76,000. The electricity industry in England and Wales employed 131,400 in 1990 and now employs about 110,00. Employment in the water industry has only fallen slightly from 47,000 to about 45,000. British Telecommunications has dropped most dramatically of all, from 240,000 to 155,000. Job losses have in the main been among lower skilled workers, those that remain are the better paid and higher skilled. Pay analysts say that those who remain have been receiving pay rises well above the average, often supplemented by bonuses to reform old working practices. At Southern Electric last year, such bonuses ranged between Pounds 250 and Pounds 600. Senior managers in most utilities have usually done a great deal better than that. These new costs, combined with large redundancy payments - BT paid out Pounds 1bn last financial year - means that real paybill costs for the utilities have not been falling as fast as the number of employees. But in most cases the job cuts are so large that the total paybill has still fallen significantly. The introduction of competition, deregulation and contracting out of non-core services can also help to create jobs, although not enough to match the losses. In telecommunications, for example, Mercury, the main competitor to BT, now employs 10,000 people; the two big radio telephone companies, Vodafone and Cellnet, employ, 2,500 and 1,100 respectively. Also, big price reductions have saved large users of telecommunications a lot of money which may have helped to create jobs in other parts of the business. Whatever the benefits of privatisation the effect has certainly been to reduce overall employment and to increase the gap between well paid 'core' workers and the periphery of insecure, low-paid, employees. As privatisation spreads from Britain to the rest of Europe this effect is likely to be repeated, although less dramatically. The European Commission is forcing the pace by requiring competition in telecommunications and electricity supply and this is prompting several countries to opt for privatisation. The German government is also considering introducing more competition into electricity supply. Over the past decade continental utilities have been an important source of employment stability, and even new jobs, as the manufacturing sector has shed jobs rapidly. As yesterday's announcement underlines, that has not been the case in Britain.   Companies:-  British Gas.     British Telecommunicatons.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The recession and new fuel taxes also play a part in enabling the UK to meet its commitments, Cambridge Econometrics says. The UK has pledged to bring emissions of carbon dioxide back to 1990 levels  -160m tonnes of carbon (mtC) - in the year 2000, a cut of about 6 per cent on projected levels. But the group is more pessimistic than the government about the impact of taxes on the growth in transport. It predicts that new motoring taxes will cut emissions by only 1.7 mtC, compared with the 2.5 mtC predicted by the government. It is more optimistic on the effect of value added tax on household fuel, however. It expects that it will cut 1.5 mtC from household emissions, and a further 1.7 mtC from related electricity generation. The group suggests that a carbon-energy tax of the kind proposed by the European Commission would be more environmentally effective than UK fiscal measures. The proposed European tax would hit households less hard than the imposition of value added tax on fuel, it says. The UK has opposed the tax, saying it would make industry internationally uncompetitive. UK Energy and the Environment. Cambridge Econometrics, Covent Garden, Cambridge CB1 2HS. By subscription.

Energy Minister Tim Eggar [Title as received] today set out  the Government's strategy to help key technologies such as  energy from coppice and waste, wind, solar and fuel cells become  competitive industries. The Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO)  will be the prime mechanism in achieving this. A ten year  Research, Development, Demonstration and Dissemination programme  will also help the new and renewable energy industry develop and  become internationally competitive. The programme budget for  1994/5 is 19.78 million pounds.    In a written answer to a Parliamentary Question by Julian  Brazier MP (Canterbury) Mr Eggar said: ""I have today published a  report outlining the future strategy for new and renewable  energy in the UK, and placed a copy in the Libraries of both  Houses. The report, Energy Paper 62, entitled ""New and  Renewable Energy; Future Prospects in the UK"" - is in response  to the findings of the Renewable Energy Advisory Group which  were published in December 1992.    ""Government policy is to stimulate the development of new  and  renewable energy sources wherever they have prospects of being  economically attractive and environmentally acceptable in order  to contribute to:    -- diverse, secure and sustainable energy supplies;    -- reduction in the emission of pollutants;    -- encouragement of internationally competitive industries.    ""In doing this, it will take account of what influences  business competitiveness; and it will work towards 1,500 MW  Declared Net Capacity of new electricity generating capacity  from renewable sources for the UK by 2000.    ""Energy Paper 62 sets out a market enablement strategy  where,  following assessment and technical development, the promising  electricity generating technologies are included in an initial  protected market via the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) and  the Scottish Renewables Obligation (SRO), to help them become  competitive and establish an industry. Those which become  viable can then compete equitably within the open market for  electricity supply. That initial market under NFFO arrangements  is crucial to the development of some of the key technologies,  and NFFO is becoming the prime mechanism for support of those  technologies. However, a purpose of NFFO is to stimulate a  commercial market for renewable technologies, and it is  anticipated that the resultant investment by industry could rise  to 3 billion pounds within the time frame being considered.    ""An outline of the ten year forward Research, Development,  Demonstration and Dissemination (RDDD) programme is also  presented. This work will assess and develop technologies,  remove inappropriate barriers, ensure the market is fully  informed and encourage internationally competitive industries to  develop.    ""Funding for RDDD, as provided by Government, industry  and  other sources is significant both in its size and in enabling  technologies to enter the market. Resources will be  concentrated on key technologies with good prospects of  commercial application in the coming decades - such as solar,  energy from coppice and waste, wind and fuel cells. Existing  work on Passive Solar Design will be completed over the next few  years and DTI involvement then reduced as the technology matures.    ""The Government's geothermal RD and tidal programmes  will be  closed when current commitments end. The existing work on wave  energy will be completed, but no further commitments undertaken,  as this technology has limited potential to contribute  commercially to energy supplies in the next few decades. The  emphasis on technology transfer will be maintained, in line with  the White Paper on Science, Engineering and Technology. The  programme will also be closely integrated with complementary  work supported by the European Community. The programme budget  for new and renewable energy for FY1994/95 is 19.78 million  pounds.    ""Also published today is `An Assessment of Renewable Energy  for the UK.' This report, (ETSU-R-82), which has been prepared  by the Energy Technology Support Unit, provides a technical  basis for the future strategy and summarises information  gathered by the Government's programme since its inception.  Copies of this report have also been placed in the libraries of  both Houses.'    Notes for Editors:    1. The Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation creates a premium market  by  awarding contracts to competing developers for the supply of  electricity from renewable sources of energy.    2.

The 10-odd large and  medium-sized power plants that the autonomous region has newly  built and expanded or is going to build through various  investment forms during recent years have provided broad  prospects for the local conversion of raw coal. A new pattern  of simultaneously developing coal and electricity is being  formed in the region. The past situation of mainly relying on  railways to transport coal from the north to the south and  delivering coal from the west to the east has been gradually  substituted by aerial power transmission.    Being China's second largest coal base, Inner Mongolia has  so  far formed a raw coal annual production capacity of 50 million  tonnes. However, its external transport capacity is only 30  percent of the total output. More than 50 percent of the coal  pits in the three major coal mines in the western part of the  region are forced to suspend production; the coal pits under  three bureaus and one mine in the eastern part of the region are  running under capacity, and are difficult to move ahead; and  only one-fourth of the dressed coal produced by Dongsheng and  the ""white coal"" produced by Gulaben which are famous at home  and abroad can be transported out of the region.    To this end, guided by the state strategy of shifting energy  development to the west, the regional party committee and  government have promptly readjusted the development strategy.  Secretary Wang Qun proposed the idea of ""giving priority to  developing electricity, using electricity to guarantee coal  industry and coal industry to promote power industry, and  transmitting more electricity to other localities outside the  region."" From 1988 to 1993, our region made an investment of  4.8 billion yuan to help add an installed power capacity of 1.5  million kw. A large number of major power projects were  distributed and successively initiated in selected areas where  coal resources are concentrated. The first phase of the  Fengzhen Power Plant with an installed capacity of 800,000 kw  has been completed, two power generating units of Jungar Power  Plant each with a capacity of 100,000 kw have been put into  production, the first power generating unit of Haibowan Power  Plant with a capacity of 100,000 kw has been operated for  commercial purpose, and the two power generating unit expansion  projects of Huiliuhe Power Plant each with a capacity of 50,000  kw have begun to feed the power grid. Construction of the newly  built exceptionally big Dalad Power Plant and the Haibowan and  Huolinhe Power Plants, and the two expansion projects of  Yuanbaoshan and Tongliao Power Plants is making headway. A new  pattern of simultaneously building Wuhai, Wangli, Shengli,  Baorixile, Yimin, Huolinhe, and Pingzhuang large-scale coal  production bases and developing power industry is being formed  in close connection with power development.    At present, the two leading industries of coal and  electricity are unceasingly exploring ways to seek conversion in  an effort to broaden the development path. Three kinds of local  conversions of raw coal are seen. First, the mine-run  type--coal mines run power industry and build pit-head power  stations. The first phase of the Huolinhe open-cut mine project  of building two power generating units each with a capacity of  100,000 kw is in full swing. This coal mine has already formed  an annual production capacity of 10 million tonnes and its final  goal is to have an annual capacity of producing an output of 30  million tonnes of raw coal. Second, the combined-track  type--the coal and power industries make joint efforts in  operation and combine their systems together. At present,  Yiminhe open-cut mine has already formed an annual production  capacity of 1 million tonnes; the first phase of the Yimin Power  Plant which is under construction includes the building of two  power generating units each with a capacity of 500,000 kw; and  the coal, electricity, and road projects of Jungar will all be  put into production this year. Third, the simultaneously  developed type--unified plans are adopted in coal and energy  developments to seek coordinated and simultaneous development.  The construction of Wanli mining area with a final scale of  producing 45 million tonnes of raw coal annually and the Dalad  Power Plant with an installed capacity of 5 million kw is being  carried out in a coordinated and simultaneous manner.  Construction of Shengli Coal Mine with a total scale of  producing 30 million tonnes of raw coal annually and Zhenglan  Banner Power Plant with a designed capacity of 3.6 million kw is  being planned and carried out simultaneously so that the scale  and development of these two projects will keep pace with each  other.

0,FT932-11283 ,"FT932-11283 _AN-DEECIADAFT 930505   FT  05 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Designer labels for buildings  -A voluntary standard is giving developers the chance to mark their environmental progress      By CHRIS TIGHE   Trevor Silver, director of Doxford International business park in Sunderland, northeast England, would have liked a windmill to power the landscaped water features but a payback of 15 years or more was a non-starter with the accountants. The shrubs and trees, flourishing in landscaped beds around the first phase of offices, will provide a pleasing green backdrop, but the police would have preferred more security-conscious concreted surfaces with unimpeded views. The development lacks parking space for bicycles - an omission which cost one credit on the Building Research Establishment's 'green' office rating - but letting agents are far more interested in the number of car parking spaces per square foot of office than in pedal power. While frequently lauded as a good thing, environmental ideals are not always easy to reconcile with harsher economic and social reality, especially in a recession. Compromise, as the first phase of the Pounds 125m business park illustrates, is inescapable. But the Sunderland enterprise zone development, the first to be assessed under the BRE's recently updated Environmental Assessment Method for New Offices (Breeam), nevertheless suggests there are commercial as well as ethical attractions in striving for improved environmental standards. Silver says that Akeler Holdings, Doxford International's parent company, noticed a couple of years ago that institutional investors were beginning to ask for a 'green statement' for new developments. Nobody, however, seemed to have much idea what that meant. Akeler became convinced that protecting the environment was becoming commercially, as well as morally, worthwhile. Environmental quality, it decided, would be a valuable marketing tool in promoting its planned Sunderland business park, both by attracting potential tenants and by convincing them the space they leased would be ahead of, not behind, future environmental legislation. So the company set about finding a standard against which to measure its aspiration that the Doxford development, sited on low-grade agricultural land on the urban fringe, should result in net environmental gain. The standard it used was an upgrade of the BRE's original office Breeam scheme which, since its inception in July 1990, has attracted developers of 25 per cent of all new office space in the UK, even though it is voluntary and self-financing. The updated Breeam, launched last January, has already attracted 15 applications for assessment of new schemes, mostly at design stage. BRE, an executive agency of the Department of the Environment, is delighted at striking a chord with developers. 'We certainly see with the update of the Breeam scheme we've moved forward the boundaries of standards,' says Paul Bartlett, head of BRE's Environmental Assessment and Futures section. A building's environmental performance is not necessarily visible, he says. Breeam acts as a label. The updated office scheme, covering global, local and indoor issues, offers developments up to 42 credits for a standard list of features, assessed by independent consultants licenced by BRE. An overall rating of fair, good, very good or excellent is also awarded. Doxford business park's first phase was rated 'very good'; two of its office blocks won 34 credits, the others 33. Provision and use of buildings has a greater impact on the global environment, says BRE, than almost any other human activity, excepting population growth. For example, it estimates buildings now account for around 15 per cent of UK CFC emissions, contributing to depletion of the ozone layer, and half of carbon dioxide emissions, adding to the greenhouse effect. The Breeam scheme aims to raise awareness of buildings' impact on the environment, to stimulate market demand for environment-friendly buildings, to reduce the use of increasingly scarce resources and improve the quality of buildings' indoor environment, hence the health of their occupants. It tackles CO emissions, acid rain, ozone depletion, legionnaires' disease, noise, water economy, hazardous materials, lighting, ventilation and thermal comfort. The European Network of Building Research Institutes, of which BRE is a founder member, has decided to adopt Breeam as a basis for Enbreeam, a Europe-wide grading, which will take into account national factors, such as climate and construction techniques. The Breeam assessment charge, paid by applicants, averages between Pounds 3,000-Pounds 5,000; the total cost of the environment-friendly features which win credits ranges, says BRE, from 0 to 3 per cent of development costs. At Doxford's first phase, sold on to Property Enterprise Trust for Pounds 18m, Silver estimates the additional cost of environmental friendliness at around Pounds 400,000. 'That isn't as frightening as it might sound out of context,' he says. Some features, such as highly efficient boilers, offer immediate savings which will be attractive to tenants; quantifiable annual energy savings at Doxford's first phase office blocks are estimated at Pounds 7,800. However, striving for environmental quality may open up new areas of responsibility for developers. Having decided he wanted a landscaped environment - 'not Fort Knox' - in which the adjacent community would take pride, Silver has been drawn into worthwhile, but time-consuming, school project work. A dog-owner, he is nevertheless ambivalent about the enthusiastic response to his landscaping from neighbourhood dog-walkers, but sees it as a small price to pay for local goodwill. Different versions of the Breeam scheme already cover domestic buildings and superstores and a light industrial and warehouse category is being developed.

Other applications are emerging, from network analysis to project management      By CLAIRE GOODING   The need for a GIS evolves, it doesn't happen overnight, says East Midlands Electricity. Like other electricity suppliers, a lot of the information East Midlands Electricity uses in its day-to-day operations is held on maps. Once fully operational, its new system will serve around a thousand end-users via 350 workstations, eventually spreading to 2,000 users including managers, writes Claire Gooding. The company supplies electricity to 2.2m customers in its area, and has a turnover of Pounds 1,570m. Information on cables, voltage, and other assets was spread around different departments, held on paper-based systems including 30,000 different maps, accessed typically 400,000 times a year. Digitising the maps was one option, but the review team in 1992 started with the business need rather than technologies. What emerged was the need to link and network various information, some of it geographical, so that it was truly integrated in all its forms. One priority was an open system, running on several platforms of hardware. 'It took us 12 months to do the evaluation,' explains GIS business manager Alan Wright. 'Above all the products we looked at, Smalltalk linked with other systems, and went beyond mapping and other systems to an integrated information system.' The accent is on distributing the data, with local accessibility. 'Data capture is a massive part of the project,' adds Wright. 'Purification and data accuracy is a vital part of the process, when you're taking data from a number of different sources and different systems: they don't always stay in step.' The company is currently using Ordnance Survey digitised maps as a basis. Once all other information is in place, it will be able to do detailed analysis of the efficiency and stability of its network. The cost benefits are difficult to quantify. Wright sums them up as 'avoidable investments': the effort, and manpower otherwise expended on keeping maps up to date. An asset database is a welcome spin-off that would otherwise have needed a separate investment. Other applications are emerging, ranging from network analysis to wayleave payment management, resource management, planning and scheduling, project management and teamwork. End users have already identified 1,200 specific needs, in every different department. Some Wright dismisses as 'Star Wars' ideas but the majority deal with practical requirements. 'We aim to hold that information in one place and present it as the user wants to see it. The relational database is handy for storing large amounts of data, for instance, types of switch gear, who uses it.' The applications go well beyond the mapping of associated data with the electricity network. 'The advantage is that we put the data where the user is,' says Wright. 'It will grow from an engineering-based to encompass finance and marketing.'   Companies:-  East Midlands Electricity.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Catastrophic State of Nuclear Power  Engineering in Ukraine""]    [Text] Energodar-Zaporozhye -- The Ukrainian Supreme  Council has lifted the moratorium which it introduced in August  1990 on the construction of new units at the republic's nuclear  stations. The ban is lifted, but the chain reaction provoked by  it continues.    The Chernobyl disaster hit Ukraine twice. The first time was  in April 1986; the second in the summer of 1990. Behind the  ""concern for the people's welfare"" which moved some people's  deputies to conduct an unprecedented antinuclear campaign could  be seen a desire to reap political capital quickly for  themselves.    Hotheads, only superficially familiar with the problem,  assured the people that Ukraine could get by without nuclear  electric power stations [AES], and if they were all closed no  one would notice. Things never got as far as closures, but a  moratorium, the idea of which was supported by the Ukrainian  Communist Party and Communist deputies in parliament, was  adopted.    ...Ukraine's five AES's have fourteen power units with a  total capacity of 12.8 million kw. In 1990 they provided a  little less than one-third of all electricity generated in the  republic. Today nuclear stations bear 40 percent of the load.    But at the same time the symptoms of the current power  crisis  were already more than obvious. Since 1988 the generation of  electricity in the republic has constantly declined. There are  two reasons for this: First, half of the equipment at thermal  electric power stations [TES] is worn out and needs to be  replaced. Second, the extraction of energy sources has declined  in both Russia and Ukraine, and their price has risen. But  whereas TES's have reduced production, AES's have increased  theirs year after year.    ...Parliament's former decision halted the construction of  three megawatt units in the Zaporozhye, Rovno, and Khmelnitskaya  AES's. Economists have estimated that, given international  electricity prices of 6-7 cents per kilowatt, a year's  moratorium on one unit costs the country $500 million. However,  this is not all: In shutting the door to nuclear power  engineering, the Supreme Council automatically halted the  development of high technologies in Ukraine.    The first to disperse were the builders. Then came the turn  of personnel operating the AES's themselves. Clever people, the  majority of them young, at once understood that the moratorium  sounded the death knell to their careers in Ukraine. No new  units -- no new positions. And pay? In Russia the controller  of a unit [operator upravlenii blokom] earns $300 a month,  whereas at the Zaporozhye AES it is 10 times less. Many, just  to support their families, are forced to dash off to Moscow  after their shift and sell goods...    When Russia began to launch its own nuclear power  engineering  program, recruiters went in droves to Energodar and other  Ukrainian AES's. They offer the specialists they need not only  a decent wage, but also apartments. Highly skilled workers,  whose training takes from three to five years, began to pack  their suitcases en masse. This year alone around 400 qualified  nuclear engineers left for Russia. If things continue like  this, Vladimir Bronnikov, director of the Zaporozhye AES stated,  there will be simply no one to operate the sixth unit.    The moratorium forced plants producing equipment for AES's  to seek orders more crudely. The quality control system became  unnecessary and collapsed. As a result, many enterprises can no  longer deliver equipment meeting the requirements of nuclear  power engineering. The shortage of equipment and its low  quality and high cost have slowed the rate of the refitting of  operational units. It is clear that their safety has not  increased as a result.    It is now clear that the aims declared by the moratorium's  supporters were not achieved. The ecological situation in  Ukraine has not improved; rather the reverse. The generation of  electricity has fallen.    What should be done next? The moratorium has been lifted,  but, alas, this will not affect the power crisis in the  republic. The sixth unit at the Energodar AES will come on  stream not earlier than next March-April. Zaporozhye AES  workers, despite the ban, have nevertheless been able to  assemble the equipment and keep it in pre-operational mode. At  the Rovno and Khmelnitskaya stations construction of units is  not complete, and the equipment is not yet all in place. Now it  will have to be collected from all over the CIS or production  will have to be set up in Ukraine. Specialists believe that, on  condition that it is given strong state support, work could be  completed there in 1995-1996.    But what question can there be of support, when the Ministry  of Power and Electrification owes the Zaporozhye station alone  more than 30 billion karbovantsy for energy already produced?  Ukraine's debt to its neighbors is great. So that the future  of these units is unclear, as is the future of power engineering  in the republic as a whole.     "

Officials are concerned that the trust's investments, intended to reach Pounds 400m a year by the end of the decade, could be classified as public spending rather than private sector. The trust, which is the largest single part of the government's plans for meeting international targets on global warming, is intended to find projects to help gas and electricity customers use energy more efficiently. The government wants British Gas and the electricity companies to pass on the project's costs through consumer bills. However, the financing plans have met with fierce opposition from Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator. In Ofgas's annual report, published on Wednesday, she said that the regulator had an 'overriding duty' to keep prices down, but some of the trust's schemes would push them up. Officials from the environment and industry departments and the Treasury have discussed whether the government will need to legislate to impose a levy on customers' bills to overcome Ms Spottiswoode's objections. Projects funded by a levy are likely to be counted as public spending, officials said yesterday. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, is meeting Lord John Moore, former cabinet secretary and the trust's chairman, on Tuesday to try to resolve the problems.

These are the first consents for large power stations to be granted since February, when Thames Power, the independent electricity generator, won consent for a 1,000MW station on the Thames at Barking. The DTI dismissed speculation that there had been any deliberate policy of holding back consents because of fears that many of the new gas-fired stations will be redundant. Hydro-Electric, the integrated electricity company, has started burning cheap North Sea gas at its Peterhead power station in Aberdeenshire. The gas, from BP's Miller field, will replace oil and should add Pounds 6m to the company's bottom line. The backbone of an important new natural gas transmission system in the North Sea was completed yesterday. The 255-mile Central Area Transmission System pipeline will carry up to 1.4bn cubic feet of gas a day from the central North Sea to north-east England.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Together their schemes would generate twice as much electricity as Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, envisaged for this year's applications. Wind farms consist of collections of turbines powered by the wind. Electricity is produced when the wind turns blades connected to a generator. Among the bidders are PowerGen and National Power, the privatised power companies, which rely primarily on fossil fuels. The largest is the Wind Energy Group, a company jointly owned by Taylor Woodrow Construction and British Aerospace. Companies have recently finished bidding for inclusion in the 1991 tranche of the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO). Under this system, renewable-energy projects - such as wind power - and nuclear projects are supported by a levy on the power industry. Mr Wakeham said he expected between 60MW and 120MW to be included in the NFFO round this year. The bids submitted have topped 250MW. That is equivalent to about 800 wind turbines compared with about 40 at present in operation in England and Wales. The Wind Energy Group has applied for 90MW involving 300 turbines on 14 sites.

However, in arguing for greater competition in domestic supply of gas you make one dubious point, ignore another and reach an unproven conclusion. The electricity industry in England and Wales is not a convincing model of competition. Electricity privatisation did not result in a truly competitive market. It produced a duopoly with knobs on - with two big generators, regional supply monopolies, a subsidised nuclear sector financed by a levy on consumers' bills, and imports of French electricity subsidised by the French government. Moreover, the regulatory body, Offer, regulates prices too far downstream from the generating sector, where two-thirds of costs lie. This is not open competition. You fail to address what benefits competition would deliver to consumers. Neither you nor Ofgas, the gas regulator, has made clear what the costs and benefits would be of the break up of British Gas's vertically integrated business. Given the limits on consumer choice over an undifferentiated product, coming from a single set of pipes, there is no guarantee that consumers would gain from the abolition of price regulation. Therefore, we are not convinced by your conclusion: 'The introduction of competition would also bring nearer the day when regulation could be relaxed'.

ScottishPower thus becomes the third British electricity company to form a joint venture with Utilicorp in gas supplies. Midlands Electricity and Eastern Electricity joined up with Utilicorp in the second half of last year. ScottishPower will be responsible for the marketing and administration of the new venture while United Gas, the UK wholesaling subsidiary of Utilicorp, will be responsible for supplying the gas, which will be transmitted through existing British Gas pipelines. The new venture, which is named Caledonian Gas but will trade as ScottishPower, is owned 75 per cent by the Scottish company and 25 per cent by Utilicorp. It will compete with British Gas on price and also on service, according to Mr Martin Fleming of ScottishPower. British Gas is open to competition for customers taking 25,000 therms or more of gas a year. ScottishPower expects that in due course the threshold will be lowered to 2,500 therms and that by 1996 the government will throw the domestic gas market for large households consuming at least 600 therms a year open to competition.

Palms, like tall buildings, make a powerful impression upon the landscape. With  near-perfect symmetry and almost identical growth habits, they appear more as  natural sculptures than trees.    Many species will reach monumental proportions within our lifetime, placing an  enormous responsibility upon anyone wishing to plant one.    How is one to know just where and how to use palms in the landscape?    Landscape architects view the palm as a work of art, a strong form that can be  used to manipulate spaces. Its characteristics allow it to become an extension  of architecture, a rigid element that -- like walls or buildings -- can enhance  an overall concept by carrying it into the landscape.    But these design professionals have an ability to see into the future, to  imagine the effect of a 30-foot-high column of plant material. The novice must  learn to have such a vision to understand palm plantings.    In all forms of basic design, a few fundamentals exist. Palms have four major  uses: lines, groves or bosks, groups and individuals.      Consistent Growth Habits    Planting palms in lines takes the greatest advantage of their consistent growth  habits. Typically, the straight-trunked varieties, such as Washingtonia  filifera and Phoenix canariensis, are selected for avenue planting.    Stemming from agricultural windrow plantings, and even taking inspiration from  the formal gardens of France, urban planners early in this century knew the  value of such trees.    An equally stunning design statement can be made on a residential scale. Keep  in mind that ""linear"" plantings aren't necessarily straight. They can be laid  out in beautifully symmetrical arcs as they are at the entry to Newport Center  in Irvine. They can snake along a pool deck or a curving driveway.    But probably most dramatic are the double rows of palms flanking entry drives,  with thick trunks and bushy heads creating a visual rhythm.    The use of bosks and groves began in the rigid Moorish gardens of the Middle  East. A bosk is typically an orchard-like grid planting of feather-fronded  palms. These varieties might include Canary Island, queen, king and date palms.  The palms are planted in a grid so that the fronds can grow into canopies and  provide large areas of shade.      Residential Bosks Possible    A small residential bosk might include as few as four palms. The availability  of matched palms at almost any size today makes bosk planting possible without  the long-term commitment once necessary. A bosk might be in a paved area,  possibly with a pattern incorporated into the ground plan. The palms can be  planted in circular or square openings in the pavement, and a fountain might be  built at the center.    The bosk can be larger, in a variety of geometric shapes with beds of annual  color emphasizing the symmetry. So rarely used to its full potential, the bosk  offers a solution for small urban gardens, where the soft, waving fronds and  filtered sun, latticework trunks and bright paving extend upbeat interiors to  the outdoors.    Groups of palms always will suggest the tropics, where the trees grow like  weeds and seedlings surround the mother plant with thick foliage. These dense  thickets of green fronds provide a perfect background for colorful plantings,  lending that hint of exotica.    When designing a garden with clumps or groups of palms, it's important to stick  with just one or two varieties. Conglomerations of different palms in a dense  garden environment will dilute the effects of each type. When planting the  clump, try to incorporate different heights to simulate the natural  regeneration of the tree.      Select Palms Carefully    For most homes, a single specimen fits the budget and scale of the lot. If only  one or two palms will be used, take care to select an appropriate variety.    For example, the blue, feather-fronded Butia capitata, while rather expensive,  is worth the money if it fits your color scheme. King palms, Archontophoenix  cunninghamiana, can be one of the most decorative, with huge clusters of bright  red berries and lime-green trunks.    Avoid the Mexican fan palm, Washingtonia robusta, because it soon will grow out  of sight with a long, spindly trunk. Plant your specimen palms near entries, or  as a focal point with night lighting. Make them the center of your garden or  tuck them into patio corners.    The watchword for planting palms is scale. It is important to understand the  relationship between the palm's ultimate size and the space you plan to put it  in. Patios will want smaller palms that stay neatly sized or those that grow  very slowly. Against tall buildings, use tall trees. So often, palms are  removed because the characteristics of the species were not understood.    Keep in mind that palms are one of the best ways to disguise street lights and  telephone poles. And, for best results, use companion trees for your palms.    These trees are often used in conjunction with palms due to forms and textures  that enhance the overall character of the garden. They include but are not  limited to: Albizzia julibrissin (the silk tree), California pepper, most  eucalyptuses, standard-size citrus and most ficus trees.    Some available landscape palms:    Fan palms -- California fan palm, Washingtonia filifera; Mexican fan palm,  Washingtonia robusta; Mexican blue palm, Brahea (Erythea) armata; windmill  palm, Trachycarpus fortunei; Mediterranean fan palm, Chamerops humilis.

And, for best results, use companion trees for your palms.    These trees are often used in conjunction with palms due to forms and textures  that enhance the overall character of the garden. They include but are not  limited to: Albizzia julibrissin (the silk tree), California pepper, most  eucalyptuses, standard-size citrus and most ficus trees.    Some available landscape palms:    Fan palms -- California fan palm, Washingtonia filifera; Mexican fan palm,  Washingtonia robusta; Mexican blue palm, Brahea (Erythea) armata; windmill  palm, Trachycarpus fortunei; Mediterranean fan palm, Chamerops humilis.    Plume Palm -- Canary Island date palm, Phoenix canariensis; jelly palm, Butia  Capitata; king palm, Archontophoenix cunninghamiana; thatch or kentia palm,  Howea forsterana; queen palm, Arecastrum romanzoffianum; Senegal date palm,  Phoenix reclinata; pygmy date palm, Phoenix robelenii.

Sun Guangdi, chief engineer for nuclear power for the China  National Nuclear Corp (CNNC), said some foreign businesses have  shown interest in financing new nuclear power plants.    As a showcase of what Sino-foreign co-operation can  accomplish, CNNC officials cite the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant  in Guangdong Province, the country's first joint venture in this  field.    Sun said many provinces are eager to build more plants, but  developing nuclear power is hindered by the shortage of capital.    Some provinces -- such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian,  Shandong  and Hainan -- are actively looking for sites and conducting  feasibility studies of nuclear power plants.    All these provinces are in South and East China and suffer  severe shortages of electricity.    ""The market for nuclear electricity is potentially vast, and  with advanced nuclear technology we have the ability to develop  nuclear power,"" Sun said.    Encouraged by the safe and efficient operation of the  country's first two nuclear power stations, in Qinshan,  Zhejiang, and at Daya Bay in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone,  China is stepping up work on other plants.    Second-phase construction has already begun at the Qinshan  plant to install two 600,000-kilowatt generators, Sun said. A  planned third phase would expand total capacity to 3 million  kilowatts.    The capital for the project came from the State and from  Shanghai Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui, which use the plant's  electricity.    China also plans to build another nuclear plant in Guangdong  and one in Liaoning Province.    The new plant in Guangdong will be located at Lingao, north  of Daya Bay. The plant will house two 900,000-kilowatt  generators, and construction is due to be completed in 2002.    Part of the capital for the project will come from the  profits of Daya Bay, whose No 1 Generator went into commercial  operation on February 6. Its No 2 Generator is expected to  begin operating commercially in May or June.    The Liaoning plant will be located at Wafangdian near Bohai  Bay and will have two Russian generators, each with a capacity  of 1 million kilowatts.    Sun said designing of the plant has already begun.    ""With power shortages becoming increasingly severe in  China,""  Sun said ""nuclear power is a safe, economical and clean way for  the country to resolve its difficulties."" However, Sun said,  China got a late start in nuclear power and must make big  strides to catch up with other countries.    Nuclear power accounted for only 0.3 per cent of the  country's total electricity output last year, compared with 78  per cent in France, 43 per cent in South Korea and 27.7 per cent  in Japan.    China's two nuclear plants generated 2.49 billion kilowatts  last year and the figure this year is expected to climb to 8  billion to 10 billion kilowatts.    In addition, China is negotiating to build a nuclear power  plant in Iran with two 300,000-kilowatt generators.    Sun said that construction is in full swing on the Chashima  Nuclear Power Plant in Pakistan, one of China's biggest  assistance projects in a Third World country.     "
0,FT932-1871 ,"FT932-1871 _AN-DFVCUACVFT 930622   FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (10): The outlook is bleak but it's not terminal - The future for coal      By DAVID LASCELLES   COAL is coming under pressure as a power generation fuel in Europe, though reports of its imminent demise may turn out to be exaggerated: it will still be the largest single source of electricity in the region well into the next century. Two factors are at work. One is the policy of the Brussels Commission to reduce subsidies to the coal industry in the three major coal countries, the UK, Germany and Spain. The other is the steady tightening of environmental regulation. On one level this is reflected in the international commitments made at the Rio Earth Summit to cut down emissions of carbon dioxide, much of which is produced from power generation. On another, there is a raft of EC and national regulation aimed at reducing output of sulphur and nitrous oxides which are said to cause acid rain and other damage. Again, coal-fired power is partly to blame. The main piece of EC regulation is the 1988 Large Combustion Plants Directive which sets emission ceilings extending into the next century. This directive is due to be reviewed next year, and the chances are that the ceilings will be lowered, putting further pressure on coal-fired power. These trends are at their most stark in the UK which has the largest coal industry in Europe, but where recent events have pushed it into a state of crisis. Today, it finds itself caught between a government determined to put coal on to a commercial footing, and a power industry which finds other types of fuel, particularly gas, more attractive. Although the UK government was forced by a public outcry to review last year's decision to close down more than half the country's surviving coal mines, it still hopes to begin privatising British Coal, the state-owned monopoly, towards the end of this year. Once that goes ahead, there is little reason why British Coal should not cut to half its size quite rapidly. All that will cushion the blow is a temporary extension of the subsidies. The background to this is the steady erosion of coal's position in the electricity industry. In 1980, the UK produced nearly 100m tonnes of deep-mined coal, and generated over 70 per cent of its electricity from coal. Last year, power generators burnt only 75m tonnes of coal whose share of power generation fell to 60 per cent. And this trend will continue. Research commissioned by the UK government for its coal review from Caminus suggested that the power industry will only need 40m-49m tonnes by the year 1997-98, and that coal's share could fall below 50 per cent by then. Apart from the government's determination to phase out the Pounds 1bn-plus subsidies which the coal industry requires each year, the factors driving these changes are mainly cost. The newly privatised UK electricity industry views coal not just as an expensive fuel, but as one whose appeal will not improve over time, principally for environmental reasons. As a result of bygone energy policies, the UK has many of the largest coal-fired power stations in Europe, and the cost of cleaning them up is enormous. Drax, a 4,000MW station in Yorkshire owned by National Power, is being fitted with desulphurisation equipment at a cost of over Pounds 700m. This daunting expense is making the power industry wary of leaning too strongly on coal. At the moment only one other plant is being desulphurised, and it is looking increasingly unlikely that that number will rise very far. Instead, the generators are considering alternative ways of meeting the emission limits. These include running coal-fired stations for fewer hours, or abandoning coal altogether for cleaner fuels, in particular gas. A lot of gas station construction is already underway, and it is forecast that gas could account for the equivalent of 30m tonnes of coal-fired power generation by the end of the decade. The picture on the continent is not so stark. Countries with small coal industries are steadily winding them down as they become uneconomic. Belgium, once a big producer, stopped altogether at the beginning of this year. France expects to stop in 2005. But the larger producers are resisting major changes to coal because of the employment it provides and the lack of alternative fuels. In Germany, where hard coal is heavily subsidised and accounts for about a quarter of electricity generation, output is declining, but slowly. Consumption of coal for power generation, currently around 40m tonnes, is expected to decline to 35m over the next five years. 'It is a very different situation to the UK,' says Dr Adolf Spies, chairman of the German coal producers association. 'We have practically no oil and very little gas. Coal is the only resource we have . There is a strong security argument.' Germany is aiming to negotiate a new subsidy regime to replace the present one which expires in 1995. But though it hopes to make the new one more transparent, it will face pressure from Brussels which is trying to reduce aid in this area - other than for restructuring or final closure. A wholly separate question for Germany is what to do about the East German coal industry which it inherited with unification. Based on highly polluting brown coal, it requires a vast clean-up. Spain also supports its coal industry, the costliest in Europe, through state aid and consumer subsidies. But here too coal is probably at its peak. Spain's national energy plan foresees coal consumption levelling off, with an increasing proportion coming from cheaper open cast sources. Coal's deeply entrenched position will be its salvation for some time. One question is whether it could ever make a comeback as new technology allows it to be burnt more cleanly, and production costs come down. Mr Crispian Hotson, chief executive of Ryan Group, an independent coal company in the UK which hopes to take advantage of the changes in the market, believes it could. He envisions a number of small clean-burning power stations of 200MW close to coal sources. 'Coal becomes an interesting business when they create genuine competition for it,' he says.

Its shares have underperformed the sector by almost a fifth since August when Professor Stephen Littlechild announced price caps for the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales. That regime should allow the RECs' distribution businesses to make a real rate of return of around 7 per cent, as will the cap announced for Scottish Power. Yet Scottish Hydro claims its rate of return on distribution will be squeezed to less than 2 per cent. In rejecting the new cap and forcing a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the company appears on strong ground. In its review of British Gas, the commission suggested an appropriate rate of return for a utility would be 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent - a judgment that the electricity regulator took into account in his review. Scottish Hydro seems to have been singled out for special treatment because the price corset at privatisation was tied too tightly. Treating it equally now would mean allowing the company's distribution prices to rise significantly relative to other regions. After the political furore that followed Prof Littlechild's generous treatment of the RECs, it is not surprising that he was reluctant to take such a course. There must have been a temptation to follow the water regulator's example with South West Water and pass the hot potato to the commission.   Companies:-  Scottish Hydro-Electric.

As Napoleon, Tamburlaine, and countless famous others have found, it can strengthen the resolve. PowerGen, the smaller of the two electricity generating companies, has already proven both shrewd and assertive. Since the early days of its privatisation, it has come across as the friendly face of generation. But within the velvet glove the management is keeping a firm, if not an iron, grip on the newly created electricity market. There are few signs of a public sector mentality at PowerGen. Chief executive Mr Ed Wallis, who has been in the industry since he was fifteen, is no bureaucrat, but a sharp and direct, hands-on manager. Having got over the fracas when Mr Robert Malpas, the company's chairman, left the company just before its privatisation, the board is now a close-knit team. Although smaller than National Power, PowerGen is by no means small. It supplies around 9mMW hours of electricity, to 100 customers - on average slightly smaller customers than National Power - and has 21 power stations. It will make a pro forma profit before tax of Pounds 264m in the year ending 31st March 1991, and expects to pay dividends of Pounds 43m, according to the flotation prospectus. But it has done its best to capitalise on seeming small and approachable. 'The customer is king,' says Mr Wallis, and the company made a point of offering the regional electricity companies, its largest customers, customised packages of electricity. It has won other customers like this: Toyota was seduced with a tailor-made contract and was the first large industrial customer to sign to take electricity directly from a generator. But this accommodating philosophy did not stop PowerGen from competing fiercely with the regional companies to supply large customers, during recent bargaining rounds. PowerGen had been very aggressive, several regional companies reported, and was undercutting their offers. Not so, says Mr Roberts. 'We offered the same prices to the regional companies as we did to direct customers.' But PowerGen does not deny it is keenly interested in winning more large customers. The company's attitude to price is, similarly, hardheaded. Electricity is, Mr Wallis says, a commodity, and despite all the talk of customer relations there is no chance the company will forget the importance of competitive pricing. PowerGen has been equally vigorous in its approach to fuel purchasing and particularly in diversification away from traditional coal-fired generation. It was the first generator to commission a new combined cycle gas turbine power station, and has secured gas supplies for a 680MW station at Rye House in Hertfordshire, as well as the 900MW Killingholme station on Humberside - which will take all the gas from the North Sea Pickerill field in the first such single field deal. PowerGen's commitment to new gas technology is matched by its interest in the latest coal technology. It has invested in a British Coal project at Grimethorpe in Yorkshire, which is developing combustion technology to burn coal more cleanly, and has joined the US electrical power research institute, EPRI, which has made considerable investment in clean coal technology. The company has already invested Pounds 250m in flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) technology which scrubs the gases that leave coal-fired stations for its Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottingham. But PowerGen is also looking hard at importing foreign, low sulphur coal. Four out of its five large coal-fired power stations have easy access to coastal terminals, making it easy to import, as the company has pointed out. It is pursuing a policy of diversification away from UK coal. Whether innovation will actually help PowerGen compensate for its size is another question. It is already true that National Power has more control over the bidding which sets the electricity price in the pool, or spot market, simply because it has more power stations than PowerGen. This, however, may begin to change as more independent power stations come onstream.  The Financial Times   London Page 36 Illustration (Omitted). Photograph Ed Wallis (Omitted).  "

The successful outcome of the heads-of-agreement talks is important because it will help negotiations on the final contracts after the energy white paper is published next month. The heads of agreement, negotiated between 11 of the 12 regional companies on one side and National Power and PowerGen on the other, cover issues including the impact of possible tax changes and the effect of inflation on prices. Details of prices per electricity unit and volume - which could cause some conflict - will be completed in bilateral contract talks between each of the regional companies and the generators. It is unlikely, however, that any of the 11 will sign anything before publication of the white paper. One regional company executive said the preliminary deals were likely to form the commercial basis on which most, and possibly all, coal-fired power is traded from April. He said: 'They are not the answer to the pit closures, however. They sustain the rump of pits which can survive in the competitive market but they do not create in themselves any extra room in the market.' The agreement is based on the assumption that the generators will buy 40m tonnes of coal from British Coal in the year from April and 30m for each of the next four years.

The peaceful plutonium use program received approval by the  Atomic Energy Commission, the nation's highest nuclear  policy-formulating panel, headed by Science and Technology  Agency Director General Mikio Omi, they said.    To this end, the committee decided to defer a plan to start  the operation of a projected second plutonium extraction plant  until after 2010, when it was originally scheduled to start up.  The second plant is only on the drawing board, with its  construction site undecided.    Completion of the second extraction plant would increase  Japan's plutonium production capability beyond that of an  extraction plant now under construction at the village of  Rokkasho in Aomori Prefecture, they said.    The Rokkasho factory is Japan's first plutonium extraction  facility that will start producing plutonium in 2001.    The officials said the new program was officially adopted to  eliminate international anxieties that Japan may divert excess  plutonium into atomic weapons production.    On top of its compliance with safeguards obligations to  accept regular, unimpeded checks by international atomic energy  agency monitors, Japan will never exchange nuclear technologies  with countries other than Britain, France, Germany and the  United States to prevent nuclear arms proliferation, the report  says.    The report, adopted by the commission Friday, says the  government will make policy decisions around 2010 concerning the  extraction capacity and technology for use in the planned second  extraction plant.    The program calls for burning plutonium from Japan's  existing  nuclear reactors at a few light water-type nuclear reactors for  electricity generation, starting in the latter half of the  1990s, the report says.    Japan now entrusts British and French extraction plants with  extracting plutonium from its nuclear reactors.    The number of light water-type nuclear reactors that will  use  plutonium as part of its fuel will be increased to more than 10  by 2010 to consume an increased amount of plutonium coming from  the Rokkasho plant, it says.    However, Japan will not scrap its basic nuclear policy of  counting on ""nuclear fuel cycle"" for its future electricity  needs, the report says.    Nuclear fuel cycle refers to electricity-generation use of  plutonium extracted from spent fuel rods downloaded from a  nuclear reactor that is energized by enriched uranium.    In line with this basic stance, Japan will start building a  ""demonstrator"" fast-breeder reactor (FBR) with the power  generation capacity of 660,000 kilowatts at the onset of the  21st century, they said. It will be followed by construction of  another FBR to be put into commercial use by 2030, they said.    The FBR, which generates electricity by burning plutonium,  is  known to produce more plutonium than it consumes.    The new decision to defer the planned operation of a second  plutonium extraction plant will force Japan to store spent  nuclear fuel downloaded from various reactors inside the  premises of various nuclear power plants, the report says.    While storing the spent nuclear fuel in the nuclear plants  for the time being, Japan will consider how to more effectively  store the spent nuclear fuel that will accumulate in coming  years, according to the report.

0,FT922-8304 ,"FT922-8304 _AN-CENCNAAXFT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (10): Battle in the Vale of York  -National Grid faces a baptism of fire      By MAURICE SAMUELSON   BRITAIN'S electricity industry is about to face one of its first public challenges since its privatisation. It will happen at a planning inquiry next Tuesday, into a proposal to build 90 kilometers of high voltage transmission lines to take power from the new 1,875 MegaWatt gas-fired power station at ICI's Wilton site, Teesside. The power station, developed by a consortium led by the US Enron Corporation and including a number of regional electricity companies, is the biggest built in Britain for about 20 years. It is due to open in the autumn and be fully operational next spring. In order to distribute its power throughout the rest of the country, the NGC plans the longest stretch of new 400 kilovolt 'super-grid' built in Britain since the 1970s. However, it has aroused protests from no fewer than 8,500 objectors, including the North Yorkshire County Council and six other local authorities, the Council for the Protection of Rural England and the Country Landowners Association. Most of the protesters are incensed at the suggestion that the new super-grid line should pass through the Vale of York, at the foot of the beautiful North Yorkshire Moors national park. Although it will not prevent the power station from running, the hearing will be something of a baptism of fire for the privatised electricity industry as a whole and for the NGC in particular. The NGC is responsible for developing and maintaining the transmission system, a job previously carried out by the State-owned Central Electricity Generating Board, which, unlike the NGC, was able to coordinate the planning of transmission with that of new generating capacity. The hearing will, therefore, also provide a forum for the widespread complaints about Britain's lack of an integrated national energy policy. Wilton power station is only the biggest of the new plants due to expand an already bloated electricity generating industry. Several objectors therefore query whether the Wilton power station should be built at all. They point to the NGC's own comments last month when it published its third annual seven-year projection of demand and supply in the electricity market. It noted that some 28 new power stations have so far been committed to the high voltage transmission system, and that the excess of generating plant over demand would jump from 26.8 per cent in 1992/3 to 56.9 per cent in 1997/8, unless, as seemed likely, existing plant were decommissioned more rapidly than would otherwise happen. The statement reported a continuing imbalance whereby the south of England contained 55 per cent of electricity demand but only 40 per cent of generation. While not criticising any particular station, it added that the further developments in the North would probably involve heavy additional investment in transmission. Many of the objections to the grid line and the power station are of the 'not in my backyard' variety. Some protesters argue that if more power is needed it should be produced in the main centres of population where it is needed and not be transported over long distances from other parts of the country. The electricity industry argues that the Wilton plant, fuelled by North Sea gas, will improve the environment because it replaces 'dirty' coal-fired electricity. It also claims that it will produce cheaper power and will therefore be in the public interest. The Inspector will probably regard this debate as outside his remit and simply report it to the government. But the objectors have already anticipated this by accusing the government of approving the power station without the correct procedures. The Council for the Protection for Rural England complained to Mr Carlo Ripa de Meana, the EC commissioner for the environment, a year ago, saying that Mr John Wakeham, the Energy Secretary, had breached EC rules by failing to make the transmission lines and the new gas pipeline the subject of separate assessments of the Wilton station's indirect environmental impact. If Mr de Meana agreed, that could spark another clash between Brussels and Britain on environmental issues like that over the controversial roadworks at Twyford Down near Winchester. In consultations over the super-grid extension, the NGC has tried to allay local concerns by offering a choice of final routes for the cables. It has tabled three alternatives for the sensitive 50km section from Picton to Shipton and another two for the 27km immediately south of Teesside. But that has not satisfied some objectors who say that the power should not come south but should be routed over the Pennines to North West England. The NGC says this is technically and financially difficult. There have also been suggestions to make the cables invisible by burying them. But this, too, has been rejected. Although there would be no overhead lines, passers-by would still be able to see the series of pumping installations needed to control the pressure of the insulation oil in which underground cables are immersed. All of which could leave the objectors with only the shape of the new grid line's pylons as a subject for discussion. Here, too, the NGC is trying hard to offer an unprecedented choice to the public. The current standard shape of electricity pylons still roughly resembles the Meccano-type structures designed for the industry by Sir Reginald Blomfield, a member of the Royal Academy, back in the 1930s. NGC engineers have now drafted a series of new styles, of which the least traditional is a folded plate tower similar to motorway lamp standards. More than 1.5 metres wide at its base, it requires deep concrete foundations. To build them in the countryside could cause inconvenience to farmers, and, unlike the slender feet of the existing towers, take up useful grazing land. In addition to the folded plate tower, NGC engineers have also devised a variants of the present latticed tower. Known as the L12, it is known among NCG engineers as 'Eifellated' because of its vague resemblance to the France's most famous landmark. It has upward-swept arms compared with the drooping arms of most British pylons. It is also lower and lighter than the biggest towers, the 50 meter high structures, which were were the mainstay of the last significant phase of grid construction in the 1960s and 1970s.

It was quite a rumble. This wasn't some polite Olympic contest in one of the air-conditioned, hill-top sports palaces built for the Games. This was a street affair fought in a sweaty old gym near one of the rougher parts of town. The US men's volleyball team, winners of gold at the last two Olympics, took on the younger, bigger Italians, who are the reigning world champions. The Italians had already won their qualifying group and the US was sure of second place, so this was a battle for pride and a psychological edge should the two meet again in the gold medal game. The battle lasted three hours. First came finger-pointing and stares. Then the hitting started: violent and unrelenting. Volleyball may not be a contact sport, but it is not short of aggression. In a game where the two teams are separated by a net, looks, including stares, are important. The US team, half of whom give as their home towns beaches in southern California, shaved their heads last week to express solidarity with their bald team-mate, Bob Samuelson, following a yellow-card dispute which cost them an earlier match. It was a brave thing to do, especially as Samuelson, who has no facial hair and therefore no experience of razors, did most of the shaving. Even with five days' growth (Samuelson excepted) the team look highly menacing - and thoroughly stupid. The Italians, all star players with the big professional clubs in the Italian league, also pay close attention to their hair: short but not staid with a little something to hold it in place even when they are diving around the floor and leaping in the air and sweating like flying pigs. Their oldest player, Andrea 'Lucky' Lucchetta, 29, sports a particularly impressive topiary which builds to a delicate coxcomb along his parting. The basic strategy of volleyball is simple. If your opponents manage to get the ball past the blockers at the net, you have three touches to create a killing attack of your own. The first will usually be a defensive scoop or 'dig' which guides the ball to the team's setter. He pushes the ball up in the air, usually to a pre-arranged spot, where one of the big men should be flying in to windmill it down on the other side. The best attackers have such powerful vertical jumps that they seem to hang in the air, assessing the defence, before battering the ball. Most teams have two or three reliable hit men. The Italians can put six men on court at once who can deliver the knock-out blow. On some plays five men can be flying towards the net at once as part of a choreographed attack. This is the Raging Bull school of volleyball. The joy of volleyball is that it is not a contact sport, said Sylvie Bigras, the assistant Canadian chef de mission at the Olympics and a former junior international, as she watched her countrymen pounded into the plastic matting by the big-hitting Italians 15-11 8-15 15-12 15-7. It is also 'the consummate team sport. A player can't control the ball as it rebounds off his body, and run with it.' Against the US, Italy came out punching, Andrea Zorzi, 2 metres tall and designer-stubbled, circling far off the court to get the best angle of attack for his roundhouse rights. The Italians' other 2-metre man, Andrea Gardini, smashed imperious attacks from centre of the court. 'They're a very physical team. Big strong, good jumpers, hittting the snot out of the ball,' said Bob Ctvrtlik, one of four US team members who play in the Italian league. 'Everything is a power game.' By the start of the second set, the Americans were punchy. But in volleyball, where the six men on court must defend as one, move as one and think as one, sudden shifts of mood are common. 'Momentum is everything in volleyball - more than any other sport,' said Ctvrtlik. 'It comes in waves.' Simply by hanging on, the US broke what Italian coach Jose Velasco called 'the rhythm of our concentration'. Somehow the tide had turned. The US fought back to win 9-15 16-14 15-11 15-11 on their sixth match point. 'We rely on defence and slowing the ball rather than stuffing it,' said Ctvrtlik. 'The Italians are not used to having the ball come back. The US tactic is to wear them down.' Velasco agreed: 'If an opposing defence plays well, we lose our rhythm of concentration. For Italy to win, we had to defend and block as well as attack.' In the quarter-finals today the US play the Unified Team, about whom they are superstitious and suspicious. Italy play the Netherlands. Each teams will keep a wary eye on the other's progress.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

The society, a left-of-centre think tank, argues that US-style regulatory commissions should be created to oversee the water, gas and electricity industries. At the open hearings consumers and other interested parties could give evidence. The commissions would be much more open than the current regulatory offices Ofwat, Ofgas and Offer. The study, by Professor Michael Waterson of Reading University, argues that commissions holding open hearings would be more appropriate for water, gas and electricity because there are limited prospects for introducing competition there. He argues that forms of regulation should be tailored to the characteristics of the industries concerned, however. So in industries such as telecommunications, where technological change is opening opportunities for competition, the current body, Oftel, is perfectly adequate. Prof Waterson acknowledges that public commissions can be much more expensive than regulatory offices. He says the latter system might be usefully extended to organisations such as the Post Office and British Rail, which are becoming more commercial.

0,FT941-11667 ,"FT941-11667 _AN-EBCDJADBFT 940203   FT  03 FEB 94 / Technology: Collapsing the system without getting the sack - Simulators are being used for training, design and crisis management      By ANDREW FISHER   If power engineers have nightmares, they probably include hurricanes, thunderstorms, blizzards, bolts of lightning, generating equipment failures and severe voltage losses - anything likely to threaten the electricity system or even collapse it. For most of them - at least in the National Grid system along which electricity is distributed in England and Wales - such incidents never occur in real life. Only around 20 per cent of those controlling the power system ever experience any emergencies. Thus when the National Grid planned its new Pounds 80m control network, brought into operation last October, it included a sophisticated training simulator designed to give those engineers who had only worked trouble-free shifts a taste of what to expect when chaos intervened and nightmares came to life. 'We're not trying to frighten them,' says Steve Allamby, lead instructor. 'But people on shift can go for a number of years without seeing major faults. So we put them under very onerous multiple fault conditions like hurricanes.' Every one of the control engineers at the National Grid's four regional centres and the national control centre in Wokingham, Berkshire, is being put through the simulator course. 'This is the only place in the British Isles where you can collapse the system and not get the sack,' says Gordon Stirrat, head of the simulator training operation. Teams of engineers from around England and Wales - Scotland's power distribution is handled by the generating companies - spend two days at the simulator in St Albans, just north of London in Hertfordshire. If Wokingham goes down for any reason, the St Albans facility can rapidly be switched over from training to run the whole National Grid. On the simulator, engineers are subjected to several scenarios of growing severity. These are based on possible conditions in their own areas, so that engineers from the south could be faced with winds from the English Channel or a sudden failure in electricity imports from France, while those in the north could have ice and snowstorms. The instructors can use the simulation software to build up the series of events so that the engineers have to cope with a 'cascade effect', as Stirrat puts it. The faults are usually related, but it is not always obvious which one is potentially the most serious. If the engineers are coping too easily, extra faults can be introduced to stretch their abilities further. To add to the confusion, a report can be phoned in of someone having climbed a pylon, so that power has to be routed around it. The effects on the power system of the hurricanes of 1987 in south-eastern England can be recreated, as can the vicious countrywide snowstorms of 1990 which caused even more damage. A band of lightning which tends to sweep across the south-east coast and up to East Anglia through London is also featured. In the midst of coping with all this, an instructor can distract the engineers by pretending to be a regional grid manager and march on to the control floor demanding an instant report on what is happening. Each session lasts around two hours, with those on the simulator sitting at a bank of computers in front of a large screen with a detailed diagram of the National Grid. Engineers from the regions look at the part of the screen containing their own power stations, sub-stations and electricity lines. Flashing lights and indicators alert them to problems, to which they react by studying their screens and telephoning experts along the network to find out what is happening and have matters put right. The roles of those at the other end of the telephone are played by instructors and team members not involved in the session. They sit in a room overlooking the simulator floor. As well as seeing how those on the simulator handle the incidents, with only a few minutes available for some solutions, the instructors also observe how well and coolly the senior team member analyses events. Generally, says Stirrat, engineers react correctly to the incidents thrown at them. If they make mistakes, it is important they are aware of why things went wrong. No one has yet found it all too much and walked off the floor, but Stirrat recalls that an engineer did throw up his hands in (presumably) mock despair once and cry out: 'I surrender.'

0,FT931-639 ,"FT931-639 _AN-DC2BZADIFT 930329   FT  29 MAR 93 / MMC urged to open household supply market      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission is considering a call from British Gas's competitors for the liberalisation of the household gas supply market in its review of the industry. But this is countered by consumer groups and some North Sea oil producers who urge caution in changing the present structure. In a Financial Times survey of evidence to the commission which is due to present its report to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, on April 30, all of British Gas's main competitors say they want to enter household sales. Many of the regional electricity companies - most of which have set up gas supply arms - are eager to enter the market, but other competitors want a phased introduction of competition. Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, suggests a system under which the supply contracts for British Gas's 92 districts are franchised to companies. Most of the gas marketing companies believe it is not necessary to break up British Gas as Sir James McKinnon, the regulator, proposes. But 13 of the 25 main competitors have told the commission that the company's pipelines should be sold. British Gas has suggested hiving off pipelines to a separate subsidiary under its ownership, but this does not go far enough for many competitors. 'We will never be sure that we are paying the same tariffs for transporting our gas along British Gas's pipelines until they are under separate ownership,' said the head of gas sales at one of the regional electricity companies. But other companies such as United Gas, which has supply deals with six regional electricity companies, is urging the commission to decide whether to remove British Gas's mono-poly over domestic sales before it addresses structural changes in the market. Consumer groups such as the Gas Consumers' Council remain sceptical of the benefits from breaking up British Gas and from introducing competition to household sales. The council has told the commission that, while it supports the principle of consumer choice, its view is that 'the domestic gas consumer is well-served by a privatised public gas monopoly in a regulatory system'. Similarly, the Major Energy Users' Council, which represents large industrial consumers, said: 'The market is too large, too complex, too important to all of us to have academic solutions thrust down our throats.' This is a view supported by some North Sea oil and gas producers such as Shell who value the strong purchasing power British Gas has wielded in North Sea gas fields. Other competitors urge caution. 'The domestic market must open up, but we've got to talk through the issues raised about supply obligations and safety,' said Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica. British Gas has argued strongly against opening up the household supply market, claiming that prices would rise rather than fall. It is for the commission to weigh up the arguments for and against liberalising the household supply market and then the government will decide whether to follow its advice. But if it decides against opening up the market, many suppliers will be disappointed.   Companies:-  British Gas.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

'The two chairmen have agreed to take measures to guarantee financial stability in the sector,' a statement said. It said the agreement involved proposals to reduce the nuclear debt burden and to study exchanges of assets to rationalise the energy market. The two companies also agreed to collaborate in nuclear power management, research and development, primary energy and marketing. Mr Inigo de Oriola, Iberdrola chairman, said last week the two companies had agreed to transfer their nuclear assets to a new company. The government imposed a moratorium on new nuclear construction in 1984, leaving companies with large debts and unfinished projects. Under the proposal, the transfer of nuclear assets to a new company would reduce their financial costs considerably. He said Iberdrola's financial debt could be reduced by Pta530bn (Dollars 4.7bn) from the present Pta1,700bn as a result. Mr Oriola also said that Iberdrola and Endesa would exchange other assets, mainly allowing Endesa to consolidate its presence in Catalonia.

0,FT923-10251 ,"FT923-10251 _AN-CG4BOADOFT 920731   FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (3): A continental patchwork - Europe's shifting policies      By STEVEN THOMAS   THE market for power generation equipment in Europe has been transformed in the past five years. The 1987 decision to privatise the UK electricity supply industry seems to have been one of the triggers for this change. Prior to this, the market was technologically and commercially stagnant, comprising a trickle of orders for coal and nuclear plant generally placed with long-standing suppliers. Now it appears highly dynamic, as five big industrial groupings scramble for orders for combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT). The change is due to the availability of natural gas for power generation and the encouragement of competitive forces in the power generation sector. These were reinforced by a surge in electricity demand that accompanied the economic boom of the late 1980s, the prospect of the EC's Single Market, environmental concerns and the prospect of Eastern Europe becoming an important new market. These changes hastened a long overdue shake up of the world power plant supply industry, reducing the world market to just five major players, the three European-based suppliers, ABB, Siemens and GEC-Alsthom and two US-Japanese groupings, GE-Hitachi-Toshiba and Westinghouse-Mitsubishi. Previously, the last two had played little role in Europe, but now perceive a chance to gain a toe-hold. The changes have been most dramatic in the UK. Released from their obligations to nuclear power, to British coal and equipment suppliers, the generating companies have gone on a remarkable shopping spree. In the last three years, more plant has been bought than in the previous 15 years, despite little signs of conventional need for it. Firm commitments have been made for about 20 GW of CCGT plant (equivalent to about a third of total UK capacity) to enter service in the next five years. Most has already been ordered and each of the five world majors has won a share. The wave of ordering had nothing to do with the usual process of analysing demand trends and ordering just enough of the most economical plant to fill any gap. The sole criterion was whether the proposed plant had a good chance of making money for its owner. With equipment suppliers offering the plant on turnkey terms with strong performance guarantees, gas suppliers selling gas at attractive and stable prices and the distribution companies eager to sign up to take the output of the plant, the risks to the new generation companies were minimal. This, and the fact that they no longer had the pre-privatisation responsibility to operate the transmission grid, meant that few of the traditional utility skills of design and engineering were required. What was needed was good accountants and lawyers. Interests other than the plant suppliers will have found the results less attractive. Not much of the British coal industry is likely to survive this stampede to gas, while the scope for any nuclear revival after the 1994 Government nuclear review may well have been pre-empted. Much of the new gas-fired capacity is likely to generate at costs higher than the existing coal-fired plant that it will replace, but the contracts the CCGTs have with distributors mean that it will be the coal plant that has to go. Ultimately, it will be the electricity consumers who will foot the bill for this over-indulgence. The new Office of Electricity Regulation is under pressure to find a way of halting the flow of orders and few now expect much activity in the next five to 10 years. Whilst other countries in Europe seem to be following the UK's lead in reforming electricity supply, all is not what it seems. In Southern Europe - Greece, Portugal and Italy - changes are occurring which will allow independent power producers to get into the market. However, the rationale is much more a matter of pragmatism than dogma. Here, there is still plenty of potential for demand growth, as well as a current shortage of plant. However, the mainly state owned utilities have long been hamstrung by a chronic shortage of capital and, in some cases, public opposition to new power station developments. Allowing international companies to compete to build the required plants and encouraging industrial producers to build extra capacity are probably the only options open to them. Nevertheless, all the Southern European countries are contracted to receive large new volumes of gas, not always with a ready final market and the power plant suppliers can look forward to a reasonable market for CCGTs to burn this gas. The countries of Northern Europe have shown much more ideological commitment to the idea of reform: the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden are at various stages in restructuring their electricity industries. However, these are relatively small, mature systems with little scope for demand growth, often based on cheap hydro-power and reliable nuclear plant. The resulting volume of orders for new plant is unlikely to cause too much excitement to the suppliers. The countries of Eastern Europe, prompted by lending institutions such as the World Bank, are restructuring electricity supply to embody the free market principles enshrined in the new UK system. However, even allowing for the need to replace discredited nuclear power plants and polluting coal-fired plants, these markets may prove a disappointment. Economic recession and the introduction of more energy efficient processes are cutting deeply into electricity demand making the shut-down of the worst plant less painful. Investment capital is scarce and the first priority may be remedial measures to salvage as much as possible of the existing plant rather than building new stations. The two largest national systems in Europe, those of France and Germany, are notable absentees from the ranks of the reformers. The European Commission may extract some marginal concessions under its Single Market provisions. However, it seems unlikely that the formidable utilities at the heart of these systems and their associated lobbies, nuclear in France and coal in Germany, will readily give up privileges such as the ability to choose where, when and what type of power plant is built. The boom in plant ordering that has been seen in the UK is therefore unlikely to be repeated in the rest of Europe, not least because of the effects of the economic recession on electricity demand. Nevertheless, even France and Germany will not be able to resist some features of the new market indefinitely. Placing orders for plant with favoured national suppliers and maintaining a monopoly hold on the generation market are no longer sustainable policies. However, whether governments in Europe will be happy to surrender their leverage over the electricity supply to the market as completely as in the UKis more doubtful.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Requests for additional information should be directed to Andrew Krantz of the U.S. Department of Energy at the above address.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     I. EPAct's IRP Reporting Requirements of DOE         The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) contains several requirements of DOE to report to the President and Congress on the status and likely impacts of electric and gas IRP development across the nation. These IRP-related reporting requirements can be found in EPAct, Title I_Energy Efficiency, Subtitle B_Utilities, Sections 111(e) and 115(e). The purpose of this notice is to obtain information relevant to the IRP evaluation and small business impact reporting requirements by soliciting the opinions of IRP stakeholders concerning the impact of IRP on electricity costs to consumers, reliability of electric service, dependence on particular energy sources, and small businesses engaged in providing energy services. In the near-term, DOE must satisfy these EPAct requirements which call for DOE to prepare this report to the President and Congress within two years of EPAct's enactment. The report must contain, among other IRP-related items, an evaluation which determines:            Whether and to what extent IRP (electric only) is likely to result in_    a. Higher or lower electricity costs to an electric utility's ultimate consumers or to classes or groups of such consumers;     b. Enhanced or reduced reliability of electric service; and     c. Increased or decreased dependence on particular energy resources; as well as     The competitive impact of implementation of energy conservation, energy efficiency, and other DSM programs by utilities (electric and gas) on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation, or servicing of similar energy conservation, energy efficiency, or other DSM measures; and whether any unfair, deceptive, or predatory acts exist, or are likely to exist, from implementation of such programs.            The DOE IRP Program will also use responses to this request for providing insight into the direction of the Program's longer-term research agenda related to assessing the national impacts of IRP. Responses to this request will be analyzed and reported by the staff of DOE's Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) Program, which is under the auspices of the Office of Utility Technologies which is under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. This summary will characterize what various groups believe to be the likely impacts of electric IRP on the nation.         II. Purpose of Request         The overall legislative intent of Subsection 111 of EPAct is to promote energy efficiency, in particular by encouraging utilities and States to adopt the planning principles of IRP. The legislative intent of the requirements to report the impact of IRP on electricity costs to consumers, reliability of electric service, and dependence on particular energy resources is to assess the likely results of IRP implementation against the intended purpose and goals of EPAct's IRP-related provisions. It is also the intent of the provision to determine the competitive impacts of the energy conservation, energy efficiency, and other demand-side management programs of electric and gas utilities on small businesses to ensure that State regulatory commissions are considering the impact which expanded DSM programs may have on small businesses already engaged in similar activities, and are implementing measures to assure that utility actions will not provide utilities with an unfair competitive advantage over such small businesses.     The DOE's IRP Program is responsible for this report. The program views the Federal role in IRP development as a collector of important data, a conduit of the lessons learned by experienced IRP practitioners to new IRP adopters, a developer of new tools and data bases and monitorer of the outcomes of IRP processes around the country. Among the priorities in this effort is the fulfillment of these EPAct reporting requirements concerning the likely impacts of IRP on the nation.     Submitting this report to the President and Congress will be a component of a continuing effort by DOE's IRP Program to monitor and evaluate the impact of IRP on the nation's States, utilities and consumers. The IRP Program views as part of its role to think critically about IRP and its expected benefits. Because DOE implements national energy policies that emphasize IRP as a potential solution to some of the problems affecting the nation's utility energy services, an assessment as to whether and to what extent IRP is providing overall benefit to the nation, as it is practiced, is a necessary and important DOE responsibility.

0,FT932-16146 ,"FT932-16146 _AN-DDGB3ADOFT 930407   FT  07 APR 93 / N. Ireland electricity share sale: Last non-nuclear power company to be privatised in June      By MICHAEL SMITH   THE government is to privatise Northern Ireland Electricity in June amid City expectations that it will seek to raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m in the flotation. Following this sale of the last non-nuclear power company in the public sector, the next step in the government's privatisation programme is expected to be the disposal of its remaining shares in British Telecom. Yesterday's NIE announcement reinforced City speculation that the BT sale will be in late July. The government yesterday launched the privatisation of NIE, the first flotation to be targeted specifically at the Northern Ireland public, with a series of television advertisements featuring Finn McCool, the legendary Irish giant. The offer for sale will be in early June, with share trading expected to start in the week beginning June 21. Potential investors will have to wait until mid-May before the company publishes its pathfinder prospectus, including accounts for the year just ended and profit forecasts. The share price will be announced in early June. Mr Simon Linnett, a director of N. M. Rothschild, advising the government, said yesterday he could not yet say how much the government would realise. But he expected the order of magnitude to be 'about the same' as the Pounds 350m realised last year through the sale of the four Northern Ireland generating plants. The disposal of NIE, which procures, supplies and transmits electricity throughout Northern Ireland, represents the penultimate stage in the government's privatisation of non-nuclear electricity companies. The final stage is likely next March when the government is expected to sell its remaining 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that one of the government's objectives was to widen and deepen share ownership in Northern Ireland. At least half of the shares will be available to small investors who, like institutional investors, will be asked to pay for the shares in instalments over about a year. About 570,000 customers in Northern Ireland will be mailed directly about the flotation along with another 750,000 potential investors in Great Britain. UK institutions will be given presentations in April and May. The initial allocation to them will be reduced if there is substantial demand from small shareholders. NIE customers will be eligible for incentives including bonus shares and bill-discounts if they register with the NIE share information office. Non-customers who register will be eligible for bonus shares, although on less favourable terms. Four banks - AIB, First Trust Bank, Northern Bank and Ulster Bank - have been appointed to operate share shops. Investors will also be encouraged by Finn McCool who, according to Irish folklore, bestrode the Giant's Causeway around 250BC. In one of two television commercials, McCool is shown emerging amid lightning and crashing boulders from a cliff-face. Investors in the rest of the UK will have to be content with newspaper advertisement images of McCool, as television advertisements are not being shown outside Northern Ireland.

0,FT944-6620 ,"FT944-6620 _AN-EK2CXACSFT 941129   FT  29 NOV 94 / Ulster to renew electricity link with republic      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN      DUBLIN   The power link between Ulster and the Irish Republic is to be restored, Northern Ireland Electricity, the privatised power utility, announced yesterday. It was damaged by IRA bombs in the early 1970s. The North-South Interconnector is one of a number of cross-border initiatives dusted off in the wake of the paramilitary ceasefires. The move will result in savings for both NIE and the Electricity Supply Board, the republic's power utility. The link will improve load management efficiencies, allowing both companies to cover temporary power shortfalls. It will also provide trading opportunities for NIE to sell to the republic. NIE said it was 'still talking about contracts'. ESB estimated that the project could result in savings of IPounds 500,000 (Pounds 495,000) a year. The restoration would increase the viability of NIE's proposed Pounds 175m power link with Scotland, which is the subject of a public inquiry that should be completed by February. An NIE official said yesterday that the two projects were 'perfectly complementary and in line with European energy policy'. If the link with ScottishPower is approved both Irish grids will be integrated into the European network for the first time - there is already a link between England and France. The European Union has backed the Ulster-Scotland link with a Pounds 61m grant. Mr Geoffrey Horton, the Northern Ireland electricity regulator, is reviewing the NIE/ScottishPower link after a request from the province's consumer committee. As part of his review Mr Horton is looking at alternative proposals, including one from Meekatharra Minerals, the loss-making Australian mining company, to build a lignite power plant near Ballymoney in County Antrim.

0,FT941-16853 ,"FT941-16853 _AN-EAGC3ADTFT 940107   FT  07 JAN 94 / Fuel companies offer scheme to avoid VAT on domestic bills      By MICHAEL SMITH   Electricity and gas companies are making arrangements for householders to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in advance to avoid the value added tax the government is imposing on household fuel bills from April. At least three regional companies - Manweb, Norweb and Midlands - believe that up to 10 per cent of householders will want to pay at least a year ahead to reduce their bills. If their highest expectations of 10 per cent were achieved, advance payments for future gas and electricity bills would exceed Pounds 1.25bn. Britain's households pay about Pounds 7bn a year for electricity and Pounds 5.65bn for gas. As well as achieving savings for themselves, gas and electricity buyers who pay in advance would boost the profits of suppliers who would be able to earn interest on the money. Many of the companies are already cash positive. However, the government would be deprived of considerable funds. If the pre-payment total reached Pounds 1.25bn, the tax avoidance in the year from April, when VAT on household power and fuel will be 8 per cent, would be Pounds 100m. For 1995-6, the avoidance would be even greater as VAT on fuel rises to 17.5 per cent in that year. Fewer customers are likely to want to commit themselves so far ahead even though returns would be greater. Since the government announced the imposition of VAT in last March's budget, financial advisers have alerted clients to a legal loophole which would enable tax avoidance through early payment. As the law stands, payments in advance for goods to be supplied incur the VAT charge applicable at the time of payment rather than at the time of supply. Electricity and gas companies say they are not actively exhorting customers to pay in advance but most are offering advice. 'We are not encouraging householders to pay in advance but we have to tell them that facilities are available if they want to do it,' said Hydro-Electric, serving north Scotland. Several companies are sending out special leaflets with quarterly bills explaining how VAT will affect them. Some, including East Midlands Electricity, have provided a payment form for customers who wish to pay in advance. Few customers have so far taken advantage, although Yorkshire Electricity says one customer has paid for 10 years. Manweb, distributor in north Wales, Cheshire and Liverpool, said only 13 customers had made payments. Northern Electric, serving the north-east of England, said it had received just Pounds 10,000 from 17 customers and Swalec in south Wales said it had received Pounds 15,000. However, most money is likely to be paid in the weeks immediately before April. Manweb said it expected up to 10 per cent of its 1.3m household customers to pay in advance while Norweb forecast early payments of anything between Pounds 10m and Pounds 50m, compared with an annual bill of Pounds 500m to Pounds 600m. British Gas and Swalec are among companies which said it was not possible to predict likely pre-payment levels but both said they had flexible arrangements which would enable them to cope. Northern Electric said it doubted whether it would receive more than Pounds 1m in pre-payments.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

0,FT943-14871 ,"FT943-14871 _AN-EGLEZAGXFT 940712   FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (11): Goliath gives way - David Buchan looks at monopoly deregulations      By DAVID BUCHAN   Euroteleport is smaller and less grandiose than its name. With just 10 full time staff, it sees itself as David to the Goliath that is France Telecom, with 156,000 employees. But from its base of Roubaix, Euroteleport is prising loose France Telecom's lock-hold on telecommunications in the country. It set itself up last year as a kind of airport (hence its name) to direct communications traffic for companies which, since 1990, have been allowed to go outside France Telecom in creating internal networks between their own factories, subsidiaries or industrial partners. Since 1990 France's PTT has granted some 200 licences for such independent networks. Some have gone to organisations with obvious means as well as needs, such as the SNCF railway system and Electricite de France (EdF), the electricity utility, whose tracks and cables can accommodate parallel telephone lines. But several private companies without these terrestrial advantages have gone for help to Euroteleport. Mr Jean-Pierre Machart, Euroteleport's managing director, claims that dissatisfaction with France Telecom prices turned two other customers towards Euroteleport. The local textile group of de Wavrin decided that France Telecom was providing too expensive a link between its Scottish, Italian and Dutch branches, and is now following Euroteleport's advice in using US Sprint, although the fact that the latter has just linked up with France Telecom may jeopardise Euroteleport's relationship with Sprint in the long term. Auchan, the supermarket chain, was paying France Telecom FFr14.5m a year to link its 52 supermarkets in France for a service that Mr Machart claims to be able to provide for FFr4.5m a year. In fact, France Telecom has entered far more into the spirit of competition than other French utilities, pushed partly by the European Commission and partly by new technology which is steadily reducing the barriers to entry into its market. 'We are no longer a monopoly,' says Mr Gerard Moine of France Telecom. The red letter date in the European telecoms calendar is January 1 1998, when ordinary voice telephony is to be opened to competition. It is hard to see France Telecom losing its national hold over this. Even Euroteleport's ambition is purely regional. 'We would like to be the telecom operator for everyone in the Nord-Pas de Calais region,' says Mr Machart. 'But we are too small to try to link up the whole of France. We could have satellite clients across the country, charging for instance FFr1.50 a minute to call the US compared to today's cost of FFr6. But France Telecom could always react by lowering international call costs, because it has such a large domestic business on which tariffs could be commensurately raised.' Indeed, further reductions in its international tariffs are an important part of France Telecom's preparation for 1998. But Mr Moine admits that it may not be easy, given that it has already cut trans-Atlantic charges by 60 per cent over the past five years, and the French utility's debt servicing, at 8 per cent of turnover, is much heavier than, say, British Telecom's at 3 per cent. France's two other Goliaths, EdF and Gaz de France, are showing far more determination to keep potential Davids at bay. In contrast to telecoms, where it has accepted European liberalisation with a more or less good grace, France is still stoutly contesting the European Commission's attempts to end its energy monopolies. It believes that Brussels is behaving like a lawyer rather than an economist in refusing to acknowledge both the huge energy investments that only monopolies or near-monopolies can make, and the huge advantages that these investments can produce. With assets of FFr 600bn, a debt of FFr170bn and a cash flow of FFr60bn a year, EdF has become the world's largest producer of electricity (generated 75 per cent by its 54 nuclear power plants). With the exception of some Dutch and UK rates, it is the cheapest in Europe. The Commission has said it will take France and several other EU states to court for refusing to end monopolies on importing (as well as the slightly less sensitive matter of exporting) energy, but it has not yet done so. The stakes are less high for EdF (which exports some 12 per cent of its output now) than for GdF, which already imports 90 per cent of its gas. 'The government is worried that breaking up GdF's import monopoly would fragment and weaken France's bargaining power when it comes to buying as gas from supplier monopolies in Russia, Norway or Algeria,' says a senior industry ministry official. But the government seems ready to accept its recent Mandil committee report that certain industrial users of gas could contract to import gas directly, but only 'in co-operation with the network' - in other words, GdF. In addition, without privatising the utility, the government is ready to open GdF's capital to oil or gas producers - a possibility enhanced by the fact that GdF's new president, Mr Loik Le Floch Prigent, used to head Elf-Aquitaine. The Commission has made further liberalisation proposals, to win approval from other EU institutions. They have drawn a mixed reaction from France: France is ready to allow outsiders to bid competitively to supply additional electricity generation to EdF which, however, would remain the sole distributor of power in the country. This would end EdF's production monopoly, as the Commission desires. France is flatly opposed to allowing 'third party access' requiring EdF/GdF to carry other people's electricity or gas to any French consumer who wants it. Paris objects on grounds of equity and efficiency. It would undermine uniformity of price - considered an overriding social objective in France - because French companies would be bypassing EdF/GdF to get a cheaper price. It would also undermine the certainty needed for investment. 'No one would build nuclear plants any more,' says Mr Pierre Lederer, chief EdF economist. 'It would have an accordion-like effect on the market,' comments Mr Dominique Maillard of the industry ministry, because falls in investment would lead to eventual shortages and price rises themselves stimulating over-investment and over-capacity. France is against a free energy market for itself, but sees some self-interest in others making the experiment. EdF has become the world's biggest electricity exporter, partly because the break-up of monopolies in, for example, the UK, have given it a market. Monopoly at home, free market abroad?

Whether output sold under a contract is allocated to a particular facility (for example, a generating unit), to the entire system of the seller of that output (net of any uses of that system output allocated to a particular facility), or to a portion of a facility is based on all the facts and circumstances, including whether the transaction is inconsistent with the purpose of section 141. In general, output is allocated to a facility or system only to the extent that it is physically possible. For example, output from a generating unit that is fed directly into a lower voltage distribution system of the owner of that unit generally cannot leave that distribution system and, therefore, must be allocated to those receiving electricity through that distribution system. Output may be allocated without regard to physical limitations, however, if exchange agreements, or similar agreements, provide output to a purchaser where, but for the exchange agreements, it would not be possible for the seller to provide output to that purchaser.    (2)     Factors.     Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, contractual terms relating to the delivery of the output (such as delivery limitations and options or obligations to deliver power from additional sources) are the most significant factor in allocating output to a facility or system. For example, a contract to provide a specified amount of electricity from a system, but only when at least that amount of electricity is being generated by a particular unit, generally is allocated to that unit. Similarly, a contract to buy 20 Mw of system power with a right to take up to 40 percent of the actual output of a specific 50 Mw facility whenever total system output is insufficient to meet all of the seller's obligations generally is allocated to the specific facility rather than the system. The method of pricing output under the contract and the consistency of the contract with commercially reasonable terms are also significant factors. For example, output sold under a contract to provide peaking capacity from a combustion turbine generally is allocated to that turbine if the contract provides for pricing that is typical of peaking unit pricing, this pricing is based on the capital and generating costs of that turbine, or no power need be delivered if that turbine is inoperable.    (3)     Allocations among users.     A facility or system (or portion thereof) that, under this paragraph (d), is allocable to two or more users generally is allocated among those users on a ratable basis. Payments for output provided by an output facility financed with two or more issues of bonds generally are allocated ratably among the issues according to the relative amounts of proceeds of each issue used to finance that facility.    (4)     Electric transmission facilities.     If a contract for use of a transmission facility provides for payments for transmission services using a more accurate method of measuring the transmission facilities used than the contract path specified by the parties (for example, a method that accounts for loop flow or a method based on load share ratios of a network), that method must be used to determine use under this paragraph. In other cases, the determination of use of an electric transmission facility may be based on the contract path specified by the parties to the contract, if reasonable.    (5)     Conservation facilities.     In general, the financing of an output conservation improvement is treated as the acquisition of an output facility by the utility sponsoring the improvement. The use of a conservation improvement is allocated under the rules in this paragraph (d). Thus, generally, the output attributable to a conservation improvement is allocable to the beneficiary of that output.         "
0,FT944-10885 ,"FT944-10885 _AN-EKIEIAASFT 941109   FT  09 NOV 94 / Basque steel plant's retreat raises fears: A new threat not linked to terrorism      By TOM BURNS   Cheaper energy in France has prompted a leading steel company in Spain's Basque country to cross the frontier and invest Pta11.2bn (Pounds 55m) in a new plant in Bayonne. The decision by the family-owned Marcial Ucn group, which makes rods and long bars for the construction industry, adds a new dimension to Spanish fears about falling competitiveness. These concerns were fuelled earlier this year by the relocation plans of the loss-making Spanish subsidiaries of Gillette, the US consumer products multinational, and of Suzuki, the Japanese vehicle maker. The move also has political overtones for the Basque government, led by the local nationalist party. Yesterday, it accused the Madrid authorities of forcing companies out of the area by failing to frame a coherent industrial policy. The Bayonne plant, one of the largest single production investments for many years by a Spanish private company, will produce 900,000 tonnes of crude steel a year. This may prove troublesome to the Spanish government, which is planning to build a mini-mill of roughly similar capacity in the Basque port city of Bilbao, an hour's drive away. 'This is a very serious development because we are losing business instead of attracting it,' said Professor Ignacio Marco of Deusto University, the Bilbao business school, and former chairman of the Basque Energy Board. 'It is a very big investment by a leading local company that has always been closely identified with the Basque steel industry.' But Mr Enrique Portocarrero, an executive of the Circulo de Empresarios Vascos, a Basque employers' association, said the investment was more a psychological than an economic blow. 'I doubt we are going to see a flight of Basque industry to the other side of the Pyrenees,' he said. Marcial Ucn opted for Bayonne despite strong pressure from local authorities. The latter were willing to subsidise up to 30 per cent of the investment if the plant remained in the Spanish Basque province of Guipuzcoa, alongside the French border, where the company has its headquarters and where four of its seven Spanish plants are located. The steel manufacturer said the attraction of Bayonne lay in the fact that electricity in France costs 20 per cent less than in Spain - mini-mills melt scrap metal with huge charges of electricity. French scrap metal was also cheaper and Bayonne had offered it a site near the harbour. It will begin building the plant in 1996 in a venture with the Japanese Mitsui group, which will provide 25 per cent of the money. In order to soften the impact, however, Marcial Ucn said it would also invest Pta4bn in its Guipuzcoa plants to increase productivity and maintain the 850-strong labour force. Spain's high electricity prices have been consistently criticised by manufacturers based in the frontier zones of the Basque country and Catalonia which are barred from hooking up directly to the French grid by the government's monopoly over the import of France's nuclear-based energy. The competitive disadvantage became a serious issue in the recent Basque elections when the local nationalist party criticised Madrid. Prof Marco says: 'We are being made to compete with Europe and we are strapped by high inputs at every stage, from electricity tariffs to harbour fees, and from high interest rates to labour costs.'

To the farmers living in mountainous regions and wishing to  have enough to eat and wear, this will not be just a dream. The  Chinese Government has vowed to redouble efforts to send  electric light to every county, to 95 percent of rural  households by 2000.    ""China will make preferential policies concerning loans,  taxation and revenues in this regard to speed up electric power  projects to aid the poor in the vast countryside,"" said a  government official.    Meanwhile, China will implement a ""source plan"" to make  comprehensive use of water sources in mountainous areas, for  meeting the needs of people and livestock, for irrigation and  for generation of electricity.    According to statistics, 97 percent of the country's towns  and 89 percent of its rural households had been electrified by  1993. Per capita consumption of electricity in the countryside  rose to 275 kwh from less than 65 kwh in 1978, bringing the  gross figure to 249 billion kwh, or 35 percent of the country's  total consumption.    However, 28 counties and some 120 million of the rural  population in China remain without electricity, mainly in eight  areas such as eastern Inner Mongolia, Guizhong and the Three  Gorges. Among them, some eight million people even don't have  enough to eat and wear.    It has become obvious that the construction of hydroelectric  power facilities and the electrification of China's rural areas  have become priorities for farmers to overcome poverty.    China announced the building of facilities to electrify a  batch of counties in the early 1980s. By 1989, altogether 109  counties had met the requirements for rudimentary  electrification. The second batch of 200 counties is now  constructing power grids.    As a result, more than 33 million rural people have  benefited  from the projects in getting electricity and drinking water.  Moreover, government revenues of those counties doubled within  the five years of the electrification campaign, and redoubled in  the ensuing three years.    The ongoing National Electrification Work Conference has set  the target of building a total of 1,000 electrified counties  across the country by the turn of this century.    However, the shortage of capital, among others, is seriously  threatening the realization of this objective. ""Despite  increased investments in the construction of electric power for  rural areas,"" explained an official, ""The gap between supply and  demand expands.""    Wang Shucheng, vice-minister of power industry, said that  about 30 billion yuan is needed simply to get electric power  through to the areas and households without electricity --  averaging more than four billion yuan each year in the next  seven years.    The State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade  Commission and the Ministry of Power Industry proposed phased  arrangements of construction projects after careful planning and  selection.    They suggested the expansion of big grids be the main trend  for covering the rural areas with electric power and reasonable  increases in investment be made to innovate rural power grids  and small hydroelectric and coal-fired power stations and to set  up demonstration projects in using new sources of energy.    In addition, they said, more channels should be opened for  the flow of capital in this direction and joint power  construction should be encouraged.     "

0,FT924-4450 ,"FT924-4450 _AN-CLBBRADIFT 921202   FT  02 DEC 92 / Pension scheme attacks compensation proposal: Electricity fund threatens to quit trade body      By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor   THE UK's second biggest pension fund, the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, has threatened to resign from the National Association of Pension Funds. The fund vigorously disapproves of the trade association's support for a compulsory compensation scheme for occupational pension funds. In a strongly worded letter to NAPF, Mr Mike Cannan, chief executive of the electricity scheme, said: 'There is widespread dismay that the NAPF would appear to have problems in identifying whose interests it should be representing. This issue has, in our view, greatly undermined the standing of the NAPF.' Mr Cannan said that, if the proposals were not withdrawn, the association's council should propose a motion of confidence at the next annual general meeting to prove its support among the membership. The 25-strong council is elected from the membership of the association, a voluntary body which represents the UK pensions industry. The dispute follows the establishment of the government's Pension Law Review Committee, chaired by Professor Roy Goode, after frauds committed by the late Mr Robert Maxwell came to light. The Goode committee sent out a questionnaire in September with 81 detailed questions for the pensions industry, and invited responses by December 15. The association prepared its own response, and sent it to members to gauge their reactions. It is the association's proposal for a compulsory compensation scheme which has angered the electricity fund, which has Pounds 10bn in assets and covers employees of the power generation and distribution industry. The association wants the pensions industry to pay compensation to fund members however a shortfall in an individual pension fund occurred. In his letter, Mr Cannan argued: 'To propound a view that the compensation scheme should meet a shortfall in pension benefits irrespective of the reason for that shortfall, and for the cost of any shortfall to be met by levies on occupational schemes is fundamentally flawed from an employer/trustee viewpoint.' The electricity scheme wants any pension compensation scheme to be funded by a combination of professional indemnity insurance, the existing Investors' Compensation Scheme (run under the Financial Services Act) and the government. The liability of occupational pension schemes would be strictly limited. Mr Mike Brown, director of information services at the association, said it was considering members' responses. 'There is a lot of support for the view that there should be a compensation scheme, but some members do not want to go as far as the council,' he said.

0,FT931-2526 ,"FT931-2526 _AN-DCSB4AD9FT 930319   FT  19 MAR 93 / Hidden 'green' costs may add 4% to fuel bills      By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent and MICHAEL SMITH   HIDDEN costs of government energy-saving schemes could add nearly 4 per cent a year to domestic fuel and electricity bills, in addition to the value added tax levy announced in the Budget, it emerged yesterday. The new figures were released by government departments as the row over the impact of higher fuel bills on poor households grew. In Tuesday's Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said existing energy-efficiency schemes would play a larger part than previously announced in reaching environmental targets. The UK committed itself at last July's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels in the year 2000. Government projections say reaching that target will need a cut of 10m tonnes of carbon (mtC) from projected levels of 170mtC. New figures show that the government expects the Budget measures to save 3mtC and existing measures to save 4mtC. They also reveal that the biggest part - 2.5mtC - will come from schemes organised by the Energy Saving Trust created last year to encourage household energy efficiency. If the trust is to meet this target it would have to spend between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m a year on household insulation schemes, says a previously published report by the Department of the Environment. The rise in average energy bills across the country might then be between 3 per cent and 4 per cent if costs are passed on to customers, the report suggests. However, households which participate in the schemes will be cushioned from some of the rise by using less energy. The electricity and gas utilities, which will make the investments identified by the trust, are keen that all costs should be passed on to customers. The trust, headed by former cabinet minister Lord Moore, was one of the main 'green' planks of the Conservative election manifesto last spring but has been criticised for a slow start. It has appointed a chief executive only recently. On Tuesday the chancellor said fuel taxes in the Budget 'together with measures that have already been announced . . . should take Britain two thirds of the way to meeting the Rio target'. Midlands Electricity yesterday announced a 4 per cent tariff cut for domestic customers, Michael Smith writes. The company said its efforts to reduce prices would largely offset the Budget imposition of VAT. The reduction, effective from April 1, is the largest announced for the coming year by any of the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales. Midlands said its customers will save more than Pounds 12 a year on average. Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman, said he hoped it would be possible to make further cuts next year. These would offset the price rises resulting from the government's decision to introduce VAT on domestic fuel bills at 8 per cent. London Electricity said it is cutting prices by an average of 2 per cent from April 1, saving more than Pounds 6 a year for its average domestic customer. Other companies which have announced charges for next year include Seeboard, which froze its prices, and South Wales Electricity, which cut rates by 1 per cent. The reductions have been made possible by falling coal prices and heavy cost cutting.   Companies:-  Midlands Electricity.     London Electricity.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-9103 ,"FT942-9103 _AN-EEQDYAHJFT 940517   FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (9): Privates on parade  -Pat Kimber studies electricity reform in the UAE      By PAT KIMBER   The United Arab Emirates, in common with many Gulf states, is affected by the continuing low oil revenues. So for the past few months there has been talk of privatisation and the introduction of independent power producers (IPPs). Privatisation, it is argued, would release funds for other projects, cut bureaucracy and speed decision-making. The opposing arguments are practical and emotional. They include the difficulties of private sector involvement in a complex power-producing system and a previously unchallenged policy of cheap electricity for the people. But now things are changing. An official announcement that the government is to finance a study on the privatisation of public utilities came on the heels of the federal Ministry of Electricity  Water's (MEW) hint that it will phase out subsidies. Tariffs have remained unchanged since federation in 1971, with no regard to power costs or inflation. Electricity prices will now begin to be raised - initially from two US cents to a still very low three cents a unit. Close attention has been paid to what the neighbours are doing. British Gas in Bahrain and international group UPGI in Oman are already building gas turbine plants. In Qatar the government has set up a private company which will eventually run all its power stations. Rumours have been circulating in Dubai that private sector companies are ready to construct power plants on the build-operate-transfer (BOT) and build-own-operate (BOO) systems, so popular in the Far East. It is not surprising that Dubai - the long-established trading centre of the region - should be the prime mover on privatisation since it has four separate power and water authorities. The UAE was formed by the federation of seven emirates - Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Fujeirah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Qwain. Before federation each emirate had its own utility and it was assumed that the newly set-up MEW would take responsibility for the whole country. It never came about. The three large emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah still run their own electricity organisations while MEW looks after the four smaller emirates which have comparatively little income and very scattered populations. MEW's budget this year is around Dollars 100m, according to minister Humaid bin Nasser Al Owais. This will provide another 150 megawatts in the northern emirates which the federal ministry administrates. MEW is headquartered in the federal capital, the city of Abu Dhabi, under minister Al Owais. The deputy minister, Saaed Majid Al Shamsi, works mainly from Dubai. 'MEW is politically responsible for electricity and water,' he said. 'We represent the UAE internationally - for instance on negotiations for the proposed Gulf grid project. We also cooperate with the electricity companies in the three large emirates - especially on tariffs which are highly subsidised throughout the country.' Of the UAE's entire total installed capacity of 5,500MW, some 900MW is controlled by MEW and is mostly gas turbines with 130MW from diesel generating sets in the more remote areas. It is also responsible for a 132 kilovolt transmission network which is being upgraded by UK consultants Ewbank Preece. Power in Abu Dhabi emirate (including the city) is looked after by its own Water and Electricity Department (WED). The WED is now in the process of adding some 1,000MW to its present generating capacity of 2,440MW. By far the largest slice of this will come from the Dollars 1.8bn 732MW Al Taweelah B power and desalination plant - an extension to the original 253MW Al Taweelah A commissioned in 1985. Al Taweelah B is being built by a consortium headed by Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss multinational, and including ABB Kraftwerke of Mannheim, SAE Sadelmi of Italy and Six Construct of Belgium. Tractebel of Belgium is the consulting engineer for the project which will be the world's largest power and desalination station when it comes on stream in 1996. There is certain to be yet another extension and ABB looks to be a frontrunner for this contract when it is announced. Other WED power projects under construction include Medina Zayed (60MW), the 200MW Abu Dhabi main power station extension and 100MW at Al Ain. A 200MW gas turbine station with desalination plant is also being built in Mifra by a consortium led by Ansaldo Energia with gas turbines by Siemens. Deutsche Babcock of Germany has a Dollars 74m contract to undertake power station maintenance and refurbishment work. WED has commissioned UK consultants Kennedy  Donkin (recently merged with the US Rust organisation) to study existing transmission networks and make recommendations for future demand. Ewbank Preece is overseeing two new 220kv links and the enhancement of an existing 220kv overhead line system. Proposals to build a load despatch centre to monitor all the water and electricity flows in Abu Dhabi emirate have finally been accepted by WED. The Dollars 90m contract has been awarded to ABB. Electricite de France (EdF) is consultant for the project which will involve a regional centre in Al Ain. Power Measurement of Australia is supplying instruments to monitor the grid system. Sharjah is in a construction boom reminiscent of Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Sharjah Electricity and Water Department (SEWD) currently produces some 700MW, nearly all from its Layyah station in Sharjah town. Two General Electric Frame 9E gas turbine units and additional desalination plant are now being installed. This will help to meet the high summer peak when the 24-hour air conditioning demand often overwhelms the emirate's ability to cope with a rapidly increasing population attracted by the rapid building programme. Distribution remains a problem on a network which started life supplying power to the long-departed British forces base and airfield. A new link is to be built from the Sajaa gas field to Layyah and further major power line installations are planned. Dubai has seen a phenomenal growth in its power supply since the first lights were switched on in 1961. The recently set-up Dubai Electricity  Water Authority (DEWA) has grown out of the Dubai Electricity Company which dates back to 1959. Capacity was then just 1.4MW from privately owned generators. Now it is nearly 2,000MW and increasing, as more plants come on stream this year. In March, the 457MW Jebel Ali G power and desalination station built by a Siemens-led consortium was fully commissioned. Jebel Ali E is undergoing a Dollars 81m conversion to combined cycle by a consortium led by ABB Kraftwerke. Kennedy  Donkin is consultant for the project which includes ABB SAE Sadelmi for civil works and boiler supply by Combustion Engineering (Italiana). The extension will add two waste heat recovery boilers to the GE Frame 9E gas turbines installed in 1992. The much-talked-about Jebel Ali H is almost certain to appear in DEWA's plans before the year is out. Dubai's primary 132kv transmission system voltage has been reinforced by a 400kv network utilising the latest technology. The construction work was undertaken by the National Thermal Power Company of India (NTPC) which has recently opened an office in Dubai to supervise its increased workload in the emirates. Last year, DEWA was frequently in danger of having to cut power supply. This would have been a severe blow for the extremely efficient utility and for the people of Dubai who enjoy a highly-sophisticated lifestyle. Kennedy  Donkin is advising DEWA on upgrading its control and management systems but the possibility of black-outs has forced power engineers into thinking that yet another large station, either combined cycle or steam turbines, must be sanctioned. It could be the UAE's first IPP. Pat Kimber is editor of Middle East Electricity   Countries:-  AEZ  United Arab Emirates, Middle East.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

The first is to say that 'the obvious solution is to replace the FFL with VAT.' Why? The construction of nuclear power stations was a strategic decision concerning the diversity of supply and it was reaffirmed by successive governments. It was therefore not a mistake. If this decision now requires revenue to support it then surely this should be raised through the general burden of taxation rather than falling on the hapless purchaser of electricity. This leads to his second assertion: that lower product prices would result from a switch to VAT on electricity. This is unlikely to happen in the present circumstances with margins tight or non-existent, and UK manufacturers paying more for their electricity than those of any other EC country except Germany and Italy. The more likely prospect is that manufacturers would give a huge sigh of relief as an uncompetitive cost component was removed. In short the saving would not be passed on. The FFL is a device to raise (not recover) revenue. It is manifestly wrong and as, David Newbery remarks, a distortion; industry would be well rid of it. Unfortunately, to remove its effect to taxation would tend to attack one of the government's sacred cows of not appearing to raise taxes and is therefore not politically correct.

0,FT941-8922 ,"FT941-8922 _AN-EBQDKADKFT 940217   FT  17 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Power benefits delivered      From Mr JOHN BAKER   Sir, Your leader, 'Littlechild's power gamble' (February 14), gives the reader a misleading and partial analysis of the power generation industry. It is misleading because, by repeated reference to the market power and price-fixing ability of the duopoly generators, it implies their guilt can be taken for granted. Yet in his latest report, as in all his earlier ones, Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, confirms he has found no evidence of any abuse by National Power with regard to its behaviour in the market, pricing or profitability. The article is partial because, while critical of the power generation industry's structure, it omits to recognise any of the benefits it has delivered. For example, electricity pool prices are still below the level predicted by government at the time of privatisation, and competition in generation is increasing faster than anticipated - hence the reduction in our market share in three years from 47 to 35 per cent. Moreover, National Power's wholesale charge for the vast majority of consumers is significantly lower in real terms than before privatisation - 16 per cent for the typical industrial user - and the very largest users would also have enjoyed price reductions had they not lost government subsidies in 1991. Even without them, they are paying on average no more in real terms. Add to that an increase of more than 50 per cent in our productivity, and capital investment, largely on environmental clean-up measures, exceeding our pre-tax profits over the last three years, and I believe that this is firm evidence of the success of privatisation.

0,FT923-12042 ,"FT923-12042 _AN-CGUANAEVFT 920721   FT  21 JUL 92 / Setback for Pounds 1bn Mersey Barrage scheme      By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and DAVID LASCELLES   THE PROJECT to build the Mersey Barrage, a Pounds 1bn electricity-generating dam between Liverpool and the Wirral to harness the Mersey's tidal power, has failed to win government backing. Whitehall is understood to have last week told Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of the Mersey Barrage Company, that it would provide no further cash. The barrage would not qualify for public funds to subsidise the cost of its electricity. Shareholders will meet in Liverpool today to decide whether to try to keep the 10-year-old project alive with an injection of Pounds 14m. About Pounds 7m has been spent so far by the public and private sectors. Supporters of the project say that Whitehall's decision raises questions about the government's commitment to environmentally friendly power generation. The government is likely to have been swayed by the project's high energy costs and by shippers who use the three Mersey ports of Liverpool, Garston and Manchester Ship Canal. They fear the project would threaten navigation of the estuary. A feasibility study is being carried out on the project. Although studies are incomplete their general findings are already known. Environmentalists have mixed feelings. They favour renewable sources of energy but are worried about the environmental impact of such big schemes. The decision whether to subsidise the barrage went to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The government wants to shelve the scheme for later consideration, but supporters say this would kill off the project because its design teams - numbering up to 40 people - could not be easily reassembled. Shareholders include Alfred McAlpine, Allied Steel  Wire, Barclays Bank, BICC, Blue Circle, Costain, Ocean Marine, Rolls-Royce Engineering, Royal Insurance, Shell, Tarmac and Trafalgar House. Local shareholders are represented by Littlewoods, Mersey Docks, Manweb, Trinity International and Liverpool University. The crucial issue for funding the barrage is the price that could be charged for the electricity generated. This needed to be about 7p per unit, of which 4p would be offset by the non-fossil fuel levy. A price of 3p per unit would only allow about 40 per cent of building costs to be raised from the private sector. The barrage was expected to have a capacity of 700MW, enough for three-quarters of Liverpool's needs. It would also have been a substantial contribution to the legal obligation of Manweb, the electricity supplier, to take 20 per cent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources. David Lascelles writes: The Department of Trade would not comment on the state of the project last night. Last year it authorised 122 renewable energy projects with a total capacity of 472MW.

They have formed a club - called E7 after the G7 group of large industrialised countries - to support joint action. Its aims range from informal discussions about energy policy to practical consultancy work in developing countries and the former Soviet Union. Early proposals include the promotion of solar power in Indonesia and Malaysia, pollution control in India, clean coal technology in China and hydroelectric development in Georgia. A small E7 secretariat in Montreal, Canada, co-ordinates the projects. The eight utilities include two from Canada and Japan and one each from Italy, France, Germany and the US. Two of the club's leading figures are Gilles Menage, chairman of Electricite de France, and Maurice Strong, chairman of Ontario Hydro. The UK is the only G7 country not represented. After the privatisation and restructuring of the electricity industry, there is no British company which satisfies the E7 rule that members should be integrated utilities both generating electricity and selling it to consumers. There is likely to be a debate in Tokyo about whether to expand E7. 'It seems too bad that we cannot have a British member when the UK has led the way in restructuring its power sector,' said one participant. But the priority will be to convince funding agencies such as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that the club is not a vehicle to promote its members' business interests.

The report's authors found in a survey that consumers and suppliers were sceptical about the concept of energy services packages, which are meant to meet customers' needs 'through efficient energy production and supply, and improved end-use energy efficiency'. The report concludes: 'Customers are sceptical about energy efficiency or energy services, or lack an understanding of the concept.' The survey also found that three-quarters of energy suppliers believed that competition would be based on prices. Most dismissed the notion that energy-efficiency packages would be a big feature of the competitive energy market, at least in the initial stages of liberalisation. One independent gas company said: 'Things will change as competition becomes more fierce and companies look to add value. But this is a long way off. For now the com-petition is about unit price.' The report recommends that the government and energy industry regulators continue to intervene in the market when it is fully opened to competition in 1998 to ensure that 'energy efficiency is not relegated to the sidelines'. It says any measures taken to reduce the market dominance of British Gas or the regional electricity companies should not hinder the ability of suppliers to offer a range of services and different energy supplies on a single contract and charge for them on one bill.

Sir John Bourn, head of the office, told parliament that in spite of having to float the two companies during a period of market uncertainty due to the Gulf crisis, the Department of Energy had 'introduced a number of innovations'. The two companies, created out of the former Central Electricity Generating Board, were floated in March last year. The report said the department had largely achieved its aims of maximising net proceeds, increasing individual share ownership and achieving a modest share premium. The office praised the department's handling of the offer, particularly the practice of obtaining indications of likely demand from institutions at various prices. Taxpayers had also shared in the benefits of an upward movement in the market during the offer period, thanks to a back-end tender, where a proportion of shares were earmarked for offer to the highest bidders among overseas and institutional investors after the offer period. This raised an additional Pounds 44.5m. However, it said incentives offered to individuals may have represented 'less value for money' than in the earlier sale of the regional electricity companies. The incentives, estimated to have cost Pounds 40.9m, were of the same level as those in the previous sale, but had played a more limited role. Lex, Page 20  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "
0,FT922-13958 ,"FT922-13958 _AN-CDIBOABDFT 920409   FT  09 APR 92 / Technology: A shock to the system / A look at how privatisation has affected the RD activities of Britain's electricity industry      By CLIVE COOKSON   SPENDING on research and development has been one casualty of electricity privatisation in the UK. The new companies have closed laboratories inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board, made many scientists and engineers redundant and reduced the scope of their RD. The size of the decline is uncertain, since the privatised RD arrangements are not yet fully in place and the companies have been slow to disclose their new levels of research spending. In evidence for last month's Commons Energy Committee report on electricity privatisation, the Watt Committee on Energy, an independent group, estimated that National Power, PowerGen, National Grid and Nuclear Electric spend less than Pounds 100m a year between them on RD. That compares with the CEGB's RD budget of Pounds 200m in 1988-89, the last year before it was broken up. As the Watt Committee commented: 'For a high-technology industry with sales exceeding Pounds 5bn per annum and facing both supply and market developments together with a degree of uncertainty in the medium- to long-term future, a total spend of . . . less than 2 per cent of sales seems anomalous.' Most hostility has come from bodies representing the RD staff hit by the cuts. Patrick Hanson, national research officer of the Electrical Power Engineers' Association, said the energy secretary in the government elected today should use powers under the Electricity Act to fund research in the national interest which had been abandoned by the privatised industry. However John Wakeham, the outgoing energy secretary, said that, while it was too early to be certain, 'the run-down by the old CEGB research establishments is probably being compensated for in a pretty efficient way by manufacturers of products and users of products seeking to do the necessary research in order to assist themselves in the market'. The privatised companies agree with him. 'In the long term, manufacturers, suppliers and research institutions will be stimulated to fill the gap,' predicted East Midlands Electricity. 'This will result in a healthier, more competitive and more commercially focused RD activity.' The new RD arrangements of the non-nuclear parts of the industry are: National Power, the largest generating company, is closing its main laboratories in Leatherhead, Surrey, where 200 scientists and 250 support staff worked. It is setting up instead a streamlined research and technology division at its business centre in Swindon, Wiltshire, with 100 scientists and 20 support staff. RD spending will fall from Pounds 26m to Pounds 14m a year. PowerGen, its smaller competitor, has closed the Marchwood laboratories in Hampshire and concentrated RD at its Ratcliffe Technology Centre near Nottingham. The number of scientists employed has fallen from 190 to 40. PowerGen's RD spending will fall from Pounds 14m to Pounds 8m a year. This includes a payment of Dollars 3.3m a year to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in the US. National Grid, the transmission company, has set up a technology and science division with 210 scientists and support staff in Leatherhead. In contrast to National Power and PowerGen, its RD spending has gone up slightly - from about Pounds 6m a year when transmission was something of a Cinderella subject within the CEGB to Pounds 8.2m now. The regional electricity companies, which distribute power to consumers, support RD through EA Technology in Capenhurst, Cheshire. Collectively they underwrite about Pounds 13m of EA Technology's Pounds 20m a year budget and spend a further Pounds 4m on individual projects. Peter Chester, who retires this month as National Power's executive director for technology and environment after supervising the RD restructuring, says this was a response to the profound shift in technical strategy which accompanied privatisation. Instead of the planned expansion of large coal-fired power stations designed by the CEGB, National Power is building smaller gas-fired combined cycle plants designed by international power engineering companies. 'One consequence is a much reduced call for 'research' in support of existing plant; in future this will be supplied mainly from within the engineering function,' said Chester. National Power's slimmed-down RD staff will concentrate on: strategic studies of new options for power generation such as 'clean coal' technology; emission control techniques; cheaper fuels; waste-to-energy processes; co-generation; wind power development; and other opportunities for business development. Critics have attacked National Power particularly for running down environmental research, for which the Leatherhead laboratories had a worldwide reputation. But Chester says this was inevitable. When the CEGB set up its environmental science programme 15 years ago, 'major scientific questions were still open, environmental research in the universities and other institutions was relatively poorly supported and policy on reducing SO and NOx was awaiting better scientific understanding. Now there are clear policies, many other players in the field and much external environmental expertise to draw on.' National Power says it is making every effort to 'assist in the transfer of those skills and facilities no longer needed, to organisations that can make effective use of them'. According to Carlos Lopez-Cacicedo, research and technology director, 90 per cent of those made redundant at Leatherhead have found new jobs. The company is giving away surplus equipment that would be worth several million pounds if new. For example, Imperial College, London, has set up an Atmospheric Chemistry Research Unit on the basis of mobile laboratories donated by National Power. And the Natural Environment Research Council is acquiring special greenhouses designed to assess the effect of pollutants on plants. As the generating companies slim down their own RD activities, they are contracting out more research. The biggest beneficiary so far is EPRI, based in California, which carries out collaborative RD for the US electric utilities. Last year PowerGen became EPRI's first overseas affiliate. Its Dollars 3.3m a year subscription gives PowerGen access to a range of projects on which EPRI is spending Dollars 46m a year. EPRI has just opened a UK office in anticipation of receiving more work from the electricity supply industry in Britain and other European countries. In the UK two electricity RD organisations with similar names, ERA Technology and EA Technology, stand to benefit from any further contracting out of research. ERA Technology in Leatherhead (originally the Electrical Research Association) has been operating as a free-standing contract RD company since 1973, covering electro-technical research. EA Technology (formerly the Electricity Research and Development Centre) still depends on underwritten funding from the electricity companies but is moving to find new customers. At the same time Stuart Excell, managing director of EA Technology, suggests that the industry's regulator, Stephen Littlechild, should give the electricity companies more incentive to support RD - especially research into more efficient use of electricity - by allowing them to pass on the costs in increased charges to customers. 'Otherwise it's like asking a company to spend money reducing its own turnover,' he says.  The Financial Times   London Page 17  "

[KEPC] plans to  begin demonstration tests of a superconducting magnetic energy  storage (SMES) system, which employs superconductivity  technology to overcome the difficult process of storing  electricity and transmits power when necessary. Under a  five-year plan starting in fiscal year 1994, the company intends  to spend about 880 million yen to install the nation's largest  demonstration system at a transmission station in the suburbs of  Fukuoka to collect various data which could not be gathered at  the existing small-scale facilities. Power companies have been  asked to seek ways to level out fluctuations in power loads  caused by a gap between normal power demand and peak demand  experienced during summer afternoons. This problem would be  greatly alleviated should storage of electricity become  possible. At KEPC's research institute, researchers feel ""the  upcoming experiments will be a big step toward making the system  practical.""    Major electrical machinery manufacturers and four  universities, including Kyushu University, plan to participate  in the demonstration test. Work on designing the model system  is to begin next fiscal year, and test operations will begin  after the system is installed between 1997 and 1998, following  partial tests and other initial procedures.    The model system will store electrical energy up to 1  kilowatt-hour, with an output of 1,000 kilowatts. This compares  with conventional systems' storage capacity of 200 to 300  watt-hours and output of 50 kilowatts. In the United States,  the U.S. Defense Department embarked on a project in late 1980's  to develop a device to store 20,000 kilowatts per hour as part  of its Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) plan, but apparently  ""not much progress has been made in the development project,""  (as stated by an official at the KEPC).

0,FT944-12960 ,"FT944-12960 _AN-EJ3AVAD5FT 941029   FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: More power to the people - The Pounds 186m payout to shareholders by East Midlands Electricity      By DAVID LASCELLES   Shareholders in East Midlands Electricity will be celebrating Christmas early this year, and other electricity company shareholders could be joining them. On Monday, East Midlands announced a special interim dividend of Pounds 186m, or 85p a share. Since the average shareholder owns 200, this will produce a cheque for Pounds 170 some time towards the end of November. Like the share buy-backs that other utilities have announced in recent weeks, East Midlands' sudden generosity was prompted partly by the embarrassingly large amount of cash it has accumulated since privatisation and partly by a fear that Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, might try to get his hands on it when he brings down the Budget next month. For a number of reasons, East Midlands thought the special dividend was a better way of getting this cash to shareholders than buying in shares. According to chairman Nigel Rudd, it is fairer: all the shareholders get the cash, rather than just those who are lucky enough to be at the top of the buy-back queue. It is also better for East Midlands' staff who are saving up to exercise options on shares at a set price: it gives them a bigger profit when they exercise the options. The third reason is that there is greater tax certainty: the Inland Revenue has said that the dividend will be treated like any other, and those who qualify for a tax credit will get it. In the case of a share buy-back, decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. The dividend was only half the story, though. East Midlands also announced it was consolidating its shares on a 22-for-25 basis. This will offset the value by which they might be expected to fall to reflect the amount of cash being taken out of the company. So, at the end of the day, the share price should remain the same. (At the moment they are ex-special dividend and trading well below their earlier price. This will remain the case until November 24 when shareholders are due to approve the transaction). In the long run, though, Rudd says earnings per share should benefit because the company has become more-highly geared because of the pay-out, and its assets will be working harder. Analysts generally welcomed the pay-out and cast around for other possible candidates. The obvious ones are Yorkshire Electricity and Southern Electric, the only two regional electricity companies which have not, so far, passed surplus cash back to their shareholders. Another possible is Eastern, which did its buy-back before the industry regulator introduced new price formulas in August which enabled companies to work out how much surplus cash they would have. The cash hand-outs may have got the stock market excited but they were not popular politically. East Midlands' move brought angry protests from consumer groups which thought the money should go to customers rather than shareholders.

This measure was announced by the Cuban president during the  close of a special session of the National Assembly of the  People's Government (ANPP) (parliament) convened to review and  find solutions to the economic crisis facing the country.    There is no other option; in Havana alone, the consumption  of  electricity has increased 24 percent because of the use of  electric stoves due to the lack of other fuels, he said. He  added, however, that the government will not rest a minute until  it finds a solution to this situation.    As for the increase of tobacco prices, the president asked  for prudence and that estimates be made before the application  of the measure because of its effect on the population.    During the inauguration of the event the day before, Finance  Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez recommended an increase in  cigarette prices in a report to the ANPP, which could provide  the government with 2 billion pesos in taxes per year, (a peso  is equivalent to the dollar at the official exchange rate).    Fidel Castro pointed out that the decisions to be adopted in  this area are aimed at overcoming the current crisis, which he  compared to the 10-year war period of 1868-78, the first Cuban  attempt to militarily achieve independence from Spain.    In this regard, he pointed out that even though many  considered it impossible, four years after the collapse of the  socialist bloc, ""here is Cuba, in the Caribbean, and 90 miles  from the United States.""

0,FT931-6410 ,"FT931-6410 _AN-DCBCFABYFT 930302   FT  02 MAR 93 / Challenge of moving mountains: The difficulty of tackling growing stocks of coal      By MICHAEL SMITH   MIKE CHILDERLEY heaves a deep sigh as he peers down from the top of a 3m tonne heap of coal next to the Cottam, Nottinghamshire, power station which he manages. There is enough coal there for six months, he says, but 'today, like every day except Sundays, we have 17 trainloads of the stuff coming in'. His problems are unlikely to ease. The government's four-month review of the coal industry has come up with few solutions. But one almost certain to be adopted in an attempt to save some of the 31 threatened pits involves persuading the electricity generators to maintain or even increase stocks. UK coal mountains have grown because demand for electricity has risen more slowly than expected as a result of the recession, a mild winter, stronger competition from the nuclear industry and a rise in imports. Stockpiles in England and Wales are about 46m tonnes, enough to keep power stations going for six months and three times the level the coal and electricity industries believe is commercially justified. British Coal has about 11.2m tonnes, against the 5m it would ideally like; National Power has about 18m tonnes (against about 5m-6m) and PowerGen, which owns Cottam, has 16m tonnes (5m-6m). British Coal executives argue that maintaining or raising stockpiles would merely postpone pit closures. 'What we need is a bigger market, but the government does not seem prepared to create that,' says one. 'Leaving coal stocks where they are merely means that the market will collapse when the next five-year contracts with the generators end.' Some power stations may close before they burn all the coal they have. Even for those like Cottam, with a secure future, there are considerable penalties for being so overstocked. Before the coal review, Mr Childerley planned to reduce his mountain to about 750,000 tonnes in the next few years. Each tonne of coal added to the pile adds 50p to the company's costs in handling charges alone, on top of the cost of capital tied up in the stocks, he says, adding that the stockpile can take little more. 'Our preference would be that the coal stays in the bowels of the earth until it is needed,' says Mr Childerley. The government's preferred method of saving some pits hinges on persuading, or coercing, the generators to take an extra 65.5m tonnes of coal over five years. The generators say there is a firm market for 40m-43m tonnes. PowerGen has said it wants about Pounds 140m for keeping stocks at their current level; National Power, the larger of the two generators, has not specified an amount but would want at least as much again as the amount wanted by PowerGen. Whatever the generators get, British Coal is likely to suffer most if stockpiles remain high. By 1998, when the next set of contracts run out, the coal industry is likely to be in the private sector and the government will have less of an interest in preserving pits. In addition the 34m tonnes in generators' stocks then would last a lot longer than now because coal burning will have been reduced further as other sources of fuel grow in importance. 'Imagine if by then BC has by then been split into several companies,' says a BC executive. 'The generators will simply be able to pick one supplier off against another.'

0,FT923-13223 ,"FT923-13223 _AN-CGOA1ABAFT 920715   FT  15 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Getting into hot water - The Philippines' investment in geothermal energy is not without its drawbacks      By VICTOR MALLET   Geothermal energy sounds like a heaven-sent answer to two of south east Asia's most pressing problems - electricity shortages and air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels - but the experience of the Philippines demonstrates how even this apparently elegant solution is fraught with environmental obstacles. Just as the region's shrimp exporters either deplete the sea's natural stocks or destroy coastal mangrove swamps to make way for shrimp farms, so the Philippines must choose between a range of environmentally unsatisfactory options to alleviate its desperate lack of electric power. Coal-fired power stations in the Philippines have been criticised by nearby residents for polluting the atmosphere and the fields, and a proposed nuclear plant was suspended partly because of fears that it would be prone to earthquake damage. A decision this year to approve the building of a geothermal plant inside a national park regarded as a holy place by local tribes has shown that geothermal energy also has environmental drawbacks. Exploitation of the earth's subterranean heat holds obvious advantages for the Philippines, which is poor enough to need to reduce its oil imports and rich enough in volcanic activity to make investment in geothermally-produced electricity worthwhile. The Philippines, with about 20 per cent of its electricity already coming from this source, is the second largest producer of geothermal power after the US. It intends to add 1,600 MW by 2000 to its existing capacity of 889MW. Indonesia also has substantial geothermal potential. With power cuts up to 12 hours long on the main island of Luzon and on Mindanao in the south, there is no doubting the need for further generating capacity in the Philippines. The previous administration of Corazon Aquino abandoned a 620MW nuclear power station built by Westinghouse of the US under the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos before it was commissioned amid a controversy over safety and alleged corruption, but neglected to order new plants to make up for the electricity shortfall. It was against this background that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), after years of delay, reluctantly issued an environmental clearance certificate in January for a 120MW geothermal project inside the Mt Apo national park on Mindanao. The decision angered environmentalists, who argue that it endangers the wildlife in the park, including the rare Philippine eagle, and negates the whole purpose of establishing such national reserves. Geothermal energy, exploited by drilling wells similar to oil wells and drawing out hot subterranean water to run steam turbines, enjoys several environmental and other advantages over alternative sources of electricity. With no combustion required, the plants are more reliable and should release less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than oil or coal-fired power stations. Nor are they affected by the drought which has sharply reduced the output of the Philippines' hydroelectric dams. They must, however, be built in places with proven geothermal resources  - places which may be distant from electricity consumers or, like Mt Apo, environmentally controversial. Nor are these the only problems. Like oil fields, geothermal fields eventually run out of commercially exploitable energy. Drilling is expensive, turbines are noisy and development of a geothermal field can release unpleasant-smelling hydrogen sulphide and substantial quantities of carbon dioxide. Nazario Vasquez, vice president for energy of the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC), acknowledges that the first geothermal projects in the country in the 1970s failed to recognise the problems of water pollution caused by dumping the used underground brine on the surface, complete with substances such as lithium, chlorides and boron which affected local rice crops. Two of the four operational fields are run by PNOC and the other two by Philippine Geothermal Inc (PGI), a subsidiary of Unocal of the US. At PNOC's Mt Apo project all the fluid will be reinjected into the ground in line with a 'zero-discharge policy', Vasquez says. 'While before we could just walk into an area and develop it, the (Aquino) government opted to seriously consider environmental clearances.' About a third of the 25 to 30 wells will be for reinjection and therefore to help the environment, he says, rejecting suggestions that the reinjection is necessary in any case to maintain the pressure of the fluid reservoir. Of the 54,000-hectare national park, 701ha has been set aside for the PNOC and only about 100ha will be used, he says, although environmentalists have expressed concern that the road built by PNOC and the future development will open the park up to further degradations by farmers and loggers. 'At the first (exploratory) PNOC well alone, the extent of forest devastation is appalling,' wrote Yasmin Arquiza, a journalist and environmental activist, before the PNOC was given the final go-ahead for the project this year. 'Trees have been cut down indiscriminately to give way to a sprawling field dotted with corn and cabbage patches.' The tribes, meanwhile, have been bought off. They will receive one centavo per kilowatt hour, equivalent to 7m pesos a year, to be paid into a foundation for the local community and the environment managed jointly by the developers, the DENR, the tribes and non-governmental organisations. Mt Apo is not the only geothermal site where environmental considerations are coming into play. The PNOC is planning to expand geothermal electricity output from the island of Leyte by at least 440MW, and has calculated that the carbon dioxide expected to be released into the atmosphere from underground can be half absorbed by the trees on the 100,000ha of land it manages there, and half reinjected. To help with environmental costs the company is seeking Dollars 30m (Pounds 15.7m) in grants and Dollars 40m in loans from the Global Environment Fund managed by the World Bank. Geothermal energy projects may, in the words of a paper produced by PGI, 'tend to be more environmentally benign than the conventional alternatives', but even geothermal power, it seems, cannot produce electricity without some cost to the environment.

The generator is ready to supply BGE with up to 1.2m therms of gas a day at short notice in times of high demand. The five-year agreement - the first of its kind - begins in autumn next year. Gas will be supplied from National Power's portfolio of supplies using British Gas's transmission network to Moffatt, in Scotland, from where it will be delivered through the interconnector pipeline being constructed beneath the Irish Sea. Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive, said: 'This agreement is an example of the value of international co-operation in relation to energy supplies, which we believe could be enhanced by increasing liberalisation of energy markets.' The deal is further evidence of increasing crossover between the electricity and gas sectors since the government's energy privatisation programme. Rival generator PowerGen already has an interest in gas marketing through Kinetica, a joint venture with oil company Conoco. Several regional electricity companies have also formed joint ventures with gas producers. Enron, one of the largest gas companies in the US, which is part of a consortium building a gas-fired power station at ICI's Wilton site in Teesside, signalled its intention last month to become an important gas marketer by buying up gas interests in the North Sea. National Power said yesterday it was 'looking at all opportunities' for marketing more of its gas. 'We have a programme of building gas-fired power stations, and have built up a strong portfolio of gas supplies, so the marketing opportunities are there.' National Power acquired a small quantity of gas in June through British Gas's release programme - in which BG is selling off some of its contracted gas to competitors to reduce its share of the industrial market. The generator said it would use this to gain marketing experience. Meanwhile, the gap between UK gas prices and those in Europe continues to widen, according to the quarterly survey of prices carried out by consultants Energy Advice and British Gas. The UK's 18m household gas customers pay 8 per cent less than those in Netherlands, 27 per cent less than in the former West Germany, and almost 50 per cent less than those in Italy. The figures are based on prices at the beginning of July this year, and do not take account of the further 2 per cent cut in prices that will come into effect on October 1.

The answer came in the form of parastatals: big, state-run companies which provided huge numbers of new jobs and useful sources of patronage for the Afrikaner elite. Now, with the country's attention focused on finding employment opportunities for the vast, unskilled black labour pool, attention has once again centered on these giant companies. But despite the pre-election aspirations of some of the more statist among African National Congress advisers, the economic climate is now vastly different from the early days of Afrikaner rule. Iscor, the state iron and steel company, was privatised in 1989 and is now the most actively traded stock on the Johannesburg market. Similarly, Sasol, the giant oil-from-coal company, is also privately run and has begun to shift its focus to the manufacture of petrochemicals and other derivative products. Both are now among the country's leading exporters of semi-manufactured products. Over the past few years, moreover, with an eye to possible further privatisations, the remaining state corporations have been shifted to a 'commercial' basis, and are run as self-financing, independent public companies, with an appointed board of directors. In recognition of this shift, the new government has chosen to emphasise the strategic importance of existing state industries and their potential as bases of local technology and manufactured exports, rather than their possible role as job providers for the masses. 'The public enterprises have a special role to play in the process of rebuilding and revitalising the economy' observes Ms Stella Sigcau, minister of public enterprises. Although some state-run companies, such as the Mossgas oil terminal off South Africa's southern coast, are struggling, others have dramatically improved productivity in the past few years. Transnet, which runs the country's railways, airline, ports and harbours was for years best known as a home for unskilled, white workers who could be guaranteed lifetime employment on the railways. 'I don't even want to talk about how bad our hiring ratio used to be,' acknowledges Mr Anton Moolman, managing director, noting that the company is now committed to a comprehensive affirmative action programme. However, while the demographics may have improved, overall employment in the company has been falling steadily as it has sought to improve productivity and cut costs. In 1993, more than 15,000 employees were redeployed and 27,000 took voluntary severance packages. 'Our prices are now competitive globally,' Mr Moolman says. 'We stand to benefit greatly from the economic recovery.' Given the prominence of electrification goals in the government's reconstruction and development programme, Eskom, the giant electricity utility, has a particularly important role to play. Last year, the utility electrified 200,000 new homes. In 1994 it hopes to raise the total to 250,000, all financed internally. Both of these companies, moreover, are now intent on expanding their operations abroad, especially in Africa. Transnet has already got operations under way in Libya and east Africa, while Eskom envisions the establishment of a vast regional electricity grid that can make use of the hydroelectric resources of the Congo and Zambesi basins. Mr John Maree, Eskom's chairman, wants to use South Africa's low-cost electricity as a key incentive to increase foreign investment. 'With the second-cheapest electricity in the world, we are able to create an Electricity Valley in South Africa - similar to California's Silicon Valley  -that will attract high energy consumption industries to the region,' he says. Perhaps most striking of all has been the ANC-led government's new affection for the country's arms industry, now split into two companies, Denel, which does most of the manufacturing, and Armscor, which concentrates on procurement and maintenance. They have been applauded by the new administration as representing a 'very important technological base without which numerous job opportunities would be lost.' Given this emphasis on commercial activity, moreover, the thorny question of privatisation has forced its way back onto the agenda. Although President Mandela recently deprecated the notion as just another means of maintaining white economic clout, the government seems to be leaving the door open for a change of heart. It has publicly declared that it will 'look with interest' at ways in which privatisation might empower the black community, while Mr Jay Naidoo, minister without portfolio, has said that he is in favour of selling 'unproductive assets' in state hands. Whatever the future of that debate, however, it seems highly unlikely that the government will seek to decommercialise, let alone renationalise, the privatised companies. In the unexpectedly sober new South Africa, job creation and patronage in the parastatals will be taking second place to efficiency and sustainable growth.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Profits in the six months to September 30 increased to Pounds 26.1m compared with Pounds 15.4m last time on turnover which edged higher to Pounds 830.2m (Pounds 821.7m). The sharp increase in pre-tax profits was underpinned by a jump in operating profits which grew to Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 26m) and the decline in interest costs from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 12.4m. Earnings per share rose to 6.9p against 4.3p and the group plans an increased interim dividend of 5.5p (4.85p). Commenting on the results, Mr James Smith, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The increase in operating profit reflects the benefit of our cost reduction programmes and the continued strategic development of our portfolio of electricity purchase cont-racts.' He added that the group also saw a useful increase in sales to the competitive non-franchise market. 'Profit before tax and earning per share benefited significantly from reduced interest charges. We are confident of achieving satisfactory results for the full year.' In the core electricity distribution business net units distributed fell by 1.9 per cent, although after adjustments for weather differences and other factors the underlying level of distribution was only marginally lower. Electricity sales to domestic and industrial customers dropped but were offset by a slight gain in units distributed to commercial customers. The most significant factor affecting performance, however, was the tight control of costs. In particular, increases in costs of distribution were again kept below the rate of inflation while 400 jobs out of a total of 8,000 have been lost in the last 12 months. Earlier this week the group announced it was seeking a further 450 voluntary early retirements within the next three months. Capital expenditure, which totalled Pounds 38m in the first half, has been reduced in line with a decrease in new business, mainly reflecting the impact of the recession on new housebuilding. COMMENT Eastern has the lowest customer tariffs and the lowest added costs per customer among the 12 regional electricity companies and is clearly determined to maintain this edge. Mr John Devaney, the group's new managing director, has a reputation as an effective cost-cutter and has already set to work. This year pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 173m and earnings could reach 45.5. Assuming a dividend increase to 18.7p the shares are on a high prospective yield of 6.2 per cent reflecting caution over Eastern's role as an industry leader.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "

Sir John Bourn, head of the office, said in a report to parliament that in spite of having to float the two companies during a period of market uncertainty because of the Gulf crisis, the Department of Energy had 'introduced a number of innovations'. The two companies, created out of the former Central Electricity Generating Board, were floated in March last year. The report said the department had largely achieved its aims of maximising net proceeds, increasing individual share ownership and achieving a modest share premium. The office praised the department's handling of the offer, particularly the practice of obtaining indications of likely demand from institutions at various prices. Taxpayers had also shared in the benefits of an upward movement in the market during the offer period, thanks to a back-end tender, where a proportion of shares were earmarked for offer to the highest bidders among overseas and institutional investors after the close of the offer period. This raised additional proceeds of Pounds 44.5m. However, it said incentives offered to individuals may have represented 'less value for money' than in the earlier sale of the regional electricity companies. The incentives, estimated to have cost Pounds 40.9m, were of the same level as those in the previous sale, but had played a more limited role. Lex, Page 20  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

Pakistan has achieved self-sufficiency in uranium,  and only locally-processed uranium is being used in nuclear  power stations. Addressing the inaugural function of the second  science conference at Aitchison College in Lahore, he disclosed  that Pakistan is processing uranium by itself and making it  usable. There are only a few countries that are self-sufficient  in uranium. Most countries import uranium to meet their  requirements, but Pakistan does not need to do so because it has  its own uranium reserves. Uranium is a metallic element that is  used as fuel in nuclear reactors or for producing energy.    Ashfaq Ahmed said that Pakistan has been successfully  pursuing its nuclear program since 1976, and that Pakistani  scientists do not receive any external assistance or cooperation  in this regard. They are fulfilling their scientific duty by  utilizing their own resources, which is a tremendous scientific  achievement. Pakistani scientists and technologists have not  allowed the shortage of funds to impede their work. They have  built several major parts for a nuclear power plant that were  previously imported, and have not let external impediments stand  in the way of the smooth operation of their program. Pakistan's  first nuclear power plant was supplied by Canada some 20-22  years ago, but due to international pressure it soon stopped  supplying uranium, fuel, heavy water, and spare parts. This was  a great challenge for Pakistan, which our scientists accepted  with great dexterity. They succeeded in keeping the plant  operational by utilizing local resources. China is the only  country that has provided a 300-kilowatt nuclear power plant,  now being constructed at Chashma.    Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed said that we are capable of building  nuclear  power stations. Nuclear energy is indispensable for Pakistan.  Pakistan has no option but to use nuclear technology to increase  electricity production, because it cannot meet all of its energy  requirements by utilizing such conventional energy production  resources as water, oil, gas, and coal. The country is facing  power blackouts due to the shortage of electricity.    The nuclear energy chief said there are 6,550 nuclear  medicine centers in various countries around the world, of which  nine are in Pakistan. Several of these centers will be set up  in the country to help diagnose and treat complicated diseases.  The private sector will be encouraged to play a role in this  field as well. He added that nuclear technology is also being  used in the agricultural field, and 18 new crop varieties have  been discovered. Ashfaq Ahmed declared that Pakistan's nuclear  program is solely for peaceful purposes.    Nuclear power plants generate 70 percent of the world's  electricity. France meets 75 percent of its energy requirements  with nuclear power plants. There are 424 nuclear power reactors  in the world. Therefore, there is no reason why Pakistan should  be asked to refrain from utilizing nuclear technology to  increase electricity production, improve health care facilities,  and boost agricultural production.    As far as the question of rolling back the nuclear program  is  concerned, it is entirely a political issue, and the nuclear  scientists have nothing to do with it. The Chashma nuclear  power plant will start producing electricity in 1997-98.  Pakistan needs several similar nuclear power plants. If France  had not refused to supply the nuclear reprocessing plant for  enriching uranium, Pakistan would have been able to set up  nuclear power stations by now. In any case, the country's  future energy requirements can only be met through the  establishment of nuclear power plants.     "

Thick plumes of black smoke spiraled into the clear desert air when one of four  natural gas-fired heaters used to back up the solar heating system exploded.    A short time later, a second natural gas heater caught fire and exploded as the  first of 75 firefighters and 25 pieces of equipment were arriving at the site,  about 140 miles northeast of Los Angeles.    ""We had a series of explosions, more than two,"" said Capt. Sharon Sellers of  the San Bernardino County Fire Department. ""Our first units got on-scene at  9:16 a.m. and a second explosion occurred at that point, then a series of them  during the entire incident,"" Sellers said.    ""There was a mushroom cloud. The heat was real intense and there were  explosions,"" said an inmate from the Boron Federal Prison Camp who was pressed  into service to help fight the fire. He would not identify himself.    Sellers said two workers at the plant suffered minor breathing problems and  were treated at Barstow Community Hospital.    Operated by LUZ International Ltd. of Los Angeles, the $280-million Harper Lake  solar plant began generating electricity on Dec. 28 and produces 80 megawatts,  enough power to serve 115,000 people. The company operates eight such plants in  the California desert. Combined, they generate 274 megawatts, which is sold to  Southern California Edison Co. An Edison spokesman said there was no  interruption of electric service to its customers.    ""We had two oil heaters on line and were bringing up the third and fourth oil  heaters when this explosion occurred,"" LUZ International spokeswoman Kathleen  Flanagan said in Los Angeles.    While no flames were visible 1 1/2 hours after the fire began shortly before 9  a.m., San Bernardino County firefighters had difficulty reaching the blaze deep  within the generating equipment.    ""There is fire up there somewhere still heating that oil,"" Sellers said.    The blaze was contained, but continued to burn late Wednesday.    Cause of the fire was unknown, but fire officials ruled out arson and said it  probably resulted from an equipment malfunction.    While Flanagan said she could not immediately estimate the cost of the blaze,  the Fire Department said a single natural gas heater costs $500,000. One was  destroyed and a second was heavily damaged.    Flanagan said the black smoke from an estimated 15,000 gallons of burning  synthetic oil was not any more toxic than smoke from natural crude or refined  oil and was not carcinogenic.    But that report was disputed by Capt. Clyde Gamma of the California Department  of Forestry and Fire Protection. He identified the synthetic oil as Therminol  and said it is cancer-causing.    Flanagan said the plant could resume generating electricity by Monday. But she  said the backup natural gas-fired heaters would not be used.    ""We will be operating strictly in the solar mode,"" she said. For solar  generation, large curved mirrors are used to concentrate the sun's energy onto  synthetic oil, which flows through an insulated steel pipe. The hot oil boils  water into steam that drives conventional electrical turbines.

The tool  was made for the special purpose of machining micromachines.  Prototypes were made for a drawing-to-itself-tool for forming  micro-substances and for a cutting tool. Next, the research  group will develop a machining system that will permit  interchanging tools for micro machining as needed while viewing  the machined material under an electron microscope.    The newly developed ``hikitsuke'' tool succeeded in  attracting to itself copper wire 80 microns (one micron is  one-thousandth of one millimeter) in diameter and millimeters  long and also a silicon block with dimensions of 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.6  millimeters. Three methods of attracting objects are used: air  sucking force, liquid surface tension, and static electric force.    The air sucking force method combines a glass tube with an  inside diameter of 0.1 millimeter and a vacuum pump. It attaches  the object at the end of the glass tube using air sucking force.  The liquid surface tension method uses surface tension created  by sending a liquid (water was used in experiments) to the end  of the same glass pipe. The static electricity method attracts  by using static electricity created by supplying voltage in  between the tool and the platform on which the object rests.  Experiments succeeded in opening indentations the same as that  on dice on 300 micron angle salt crystals using a chisel-type  cutting tool. The chisel is used on super-hard metal alloys with  a blade tip 10 microns wide applied to the processed object and  with added sonic vibration.     "

Thirty years from now, this energy source should be a  serious alternative to nuclear power.    Geothermal energy is very different from other ""alternative""  energy resources such as wind and solar power, because it has  the potential to produce power at an industrial scale, of the  order of hundreds of megawatts. Italy, for instance, already  produces 500 megawatts of electricity per year this way.    The intention is to construct a giant underground heat  exchanger linked to a turbine to test the industrial viability  of this renewable source of power. However, significant  difficulties include the economic and technical viability of  recovering this energy in small fields (typical in Europe) and  the high costs of hot dry rock research. Consequently, the  success of the latest Community projects will determine the  future of geothermal energy use.    Under the Joule II (non-nuclear energy) programme,  scientists  at Soultz-sous-Forets (France, Lower Rhine) began work in  December 1992 on a project consolidating research underway since  the 1970s. The aim is to inject water into hot rocks at a depth  of 4,000 m (in a granite platform criss-crossed by numerous  faults forming a giant `radiator' at 180 degrees Celsius) to  produce sufficient energy to drive an electricity generator.    Two other sites are being examined in the United Kingdom and  Germany. Some 60 scientists are involved in this project  (ECU5.5 million, plus a further ECU3.3 million for 1994-95),  from around twenty universities and institutes in France, United  Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.    In Soultz, the first stage involves drilling boreholes  through the sedimentary layer and granite platform, to prove the  technical feasibility of an industrial-scale pilot with a  capacity of several Megawatts. Equipped with a generator, this  industrial pilot will be built after 1995. If all goes well, a  prototype geothermal energy power station (producing 5-10  Megawatts) will follow around the year 2000. It will be linked  to the electricity grid and work as a complement to traditional,  small power stations.    Better understanding of the basement rock fracture systems  has already allowed researchers to produce a model of a Hot Dry  Rock reservoir. A 3,950 m borehole has been drilled and could  form the first part of the future pilot system, while the next  borehole (4,000 m deep) will be used to test the circulation of  hot water. With these holes, researchers will be able to begin  construction of the pilot and study problems like corrosion,  pumping, and modelling (chemical and thermal) of the rocks.    Corrosion problems, which are crucial to the industrial  phase, will be solved by removable internal tubing systems  and/or injection of corrosion-inhibiting substances. Hydraulic  models of the rocky massifs exploited (over 3,000 cubic km) will  be made to check the impact on deep water resources in the  region. Calculations show a balance could be quickly  established between the pumping system and natural water  circulation between the rock faults. An early estimate of  progress and planning of the industrial pilot project will be  presented in Soultz in 1994.    Whatever the future of geothermal energy, this research has  already improved understanding of rock mechanics and drilling  techniques. This knowledge will find applications in the oil  and civil engineering sectors. Another spin-off has been the  composition of an Atlas of Geothermal Resources in the EC,  Switzerland and Austria, to be updated this year to include  Central Europe.

0,FT924-13041 ,"FT924-13041 _AN-CJRAMACFFT 921017   FT  17 OCT 92 / The costs of closure: FT writers answer the questions arising from the controversy over coal      By DAVID LASCELLES, IAN HARGREAVES, DAVID GOODHART and RALPH ATKINS   Why is Britain sharply scaling down its coal industry if this will throw tens of thousands out of work and lead to more imports? British Coal has been heavily subsidised - to the tune of Pounds 100m a month, according to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary. He would rather cut British Coal down to a smaller size, even at the risk of boosting imports, because he believes this will bring benefits for the economy as a whole, such as greater efficiency and cheaper electricity. Britain is not the only country to run down its coal industry. Several Continental countries have shut down their mines for good. 2. But isn't British Coal the most efficient producer left in Europe? Yes, by far. It mines coal at a fraction of the price of Germany and Spain, the only two Continental coal producers of any size. But this is irrelevant since prices in the international coal market are dictated by large producing countries including the US, Australia and Colombia. Typical British Coal prices are currently 50 per cent higher than imported coal. In its restructured form British Coal's management believes it could match imported prices within five years. 3. If Spain and Germany believe it is worth paying a price to keep their coal industry, why doesn't the UK? In contrast with those countries, Britain has a wide choice of indigenous fuels, so it is not as tightly locked in to one in particular. It is also questionable whether Spain and Germany will be able to continue subsidising their coal industries under European Community rules. But the fundamental reason is that the UK government believes the price is too great, and produces unacceptable distortions in the energy market. 4. Wouldn't it be cheaper for us to pay the coal miners to go on working? And what effect will this have on our balance of payments? The government will spend Pounds 1bn on coal community aid and redundancy payments, and achieve subsidy savings of Pounds 1.2bn a year, if Mr Heseltine's figures are correct. But the public cost will be much higher if you take into account the ripple effect on unemployment, lost tax revenues and so on. If British Coal is privatised, the Treasury will also have to assume billions of pounds of liabilities for pensions, mine subsidence and free coal for miners. The cost to the Treasury will therefore be substantial. Whether the net result is worth it depends on how far Mr Heseltine's wider benefits materialise. The balance of payments will suffer from a rise in coal imports, though these may not be as big as feared because of the switch out of coal into domestically produced gas. 5. Why do the cuts have to happen now, in the depths of a recession? The timing is dictated by the long-term effects of privatisation of the electricity industry. The electricity generators were privatised on the understanding that when their contracts with British Coal ran out in April 1993, they could renegotiate them on realistic rather than inflated prices. Negotiations on those contracts are now underway, and it is clear that the generators want to take as little British coal as possible because of its high cost. If the government wanted to postpone the colliery closures, it would either have to roll back electricity privatisation, or subsidise the 1993 contracts - neither of which it is prepared to do. 6. Is the National Union of Mineworkers to blame for the closures? Or are Mr Arthur Scargill's dire predictions being proved correct? The effect of the Scargill-led dispute in 1984-85 was to speed up, not slow down, the pace of pit closures. It also helped put back the recent productivity improvements by about two years, thus preventing more pits from reaching an acceptable cost base. Once the die had been cast for electricity privatisation, much of what Mr Scargill had warned about was bound to come true, but that was partly because his own union had undermined the security  -of - supply argument for coal and made it a less attractive fuel for the generators. 7. What is the chance of the closures being stopped? The unions have little industrial leverage, but they hope to raise a sufficient public outcry to frighten the government into reversing its position, as with the poll tax. To that end Mr Scargill has adopted a moderate strategy, eschewing a strike ballot (for now) and talking about the costs to the taxpayer. But this is unlikely to be enough. The best hope for a moratorium comes from Tory backbenchers and the courts. If enough Tory backbenchers vote with Labour for a review of the closures in next Wednesday's debate, they will presumably be stopped for at least a few months. On Thursday the High Court is due to decide whether British Coal abandoned its own colliery review procedure. Tory backbenchers are a better bet than the judges. The government would survive if it was defeated in the debate, but Mr Heseltine may feel obliged to resign because he has become so closely associated with the decisions announced this week. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, says his party's aim is to save the coal mines - not bring down the government. The motion that Labour will draw up for the debate will aim at attracting the maximum number of wavering Conservative MPs. If the government loses, it is likely to table immediately a motion expressing confidence in the government - which it would probably win comfortably. 8. Are we right to be using gas when we have far less of it than coal, and what effect will it have on my electricity bill? There is a great deal of gas in the North Sea - enough to last at least 50 years, so there are no short-term supply problems. The switch to gas is happening partly for commercial reasons, but also because of bad planning in the electricity privatisation. Gas has many advantages over coal: it is cleaner, easier to transport and converts more efficiently into electricity. Gas power stations are also quick and cheap to build, and face fewer planning obstacles. Whether gas produces electricity more cheaply than coal is much disputed because although coal looks cheaper on paper, not all calculations take full account of its heavy environmental costs - which will grow as more green regulations are implemented. Mr Heseltine says the closure of the coal mines will wipe Pounds 300m off electricity bills, but Mr Andrew Horsler, marketing director of British Coal, claims gas-fired stations will add to electricity bills because they will replace coal stations whose costs have already been completely written off, and therefore can produce electricity very cheaply. Another problem is that electricity distribution companies are building gas stations to cut their dependence on supplies from the duopoly of National Power and PowerGen. Present rules allow them to pass the cost straight through to customers so they have no incentive to buy the cheapest fuel. 9. If we abandon all these coal mines now, could we mine the coal again later? British Coal is mothballing four of the 31 collieries listed for closure in case its market revives. But it is costly to keep mines open and these will most likely be shut too unless there is a swift change in coal's fortunes. If, next century, the UK decided to switch back to coal, it would have to build new mines. 10. It sounds as if there are monopolistic practices going on in the electricity industry which are hitting coal unfairly and adding to electricity costs. The National Power/PowerGen duopoly has undoubtedly been able to drive a hard bargain with British Coal, and it has already been threatened with possible monopoly investigation by Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, for trying to influence electricity prices. But Prof Littlechild himself has come under fire from consumers for allegedly failing to ensure that electricity distributors are buying the cheapest possible power when they contract with gas-fired power stations. Some of them have threatened to take him to court. If they win, gas power station deals might have to be unraveled. 11. If the coal cuts go through, will Britain then have achieved the free market in energy which the government wants? No. The nuclear power industry receives Pounds 1.2bn of subsidies a year, though these are being phased out. Nuclear could be in for the British Coal treatment in 1994 when the government plans to review its future. One lesson the nuclear power industry will have learnt this week is that it has only two years to prove that it can stand on its own feet. There are also tight controls on electricity distribution which effectively create regional monopolies. These are also supposed to be phased out over the coming years. A totally free market, if such a thing were possible, is not in sight until the end of this decade. 12. Although the cuts are regrettable, perhaps the run-down of coal is a good thing for the environment? Coal is unquestionably the dirtiest fuel, in terms of the damage caused by mining, transportation, and the emissions at power stations, all of which place extra costs on the economy. It also faces pressure from the government's commitment to an EC target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. If the EC were to introduce a proposed carbon tax, its appeal would be further reduced. Technology does exist to burn coal more cleanly, and it is being introduced at power stations. But it is expensive and reduces the efficiency of the fuel. 13. Will anyone want to buy what's left of the coal industry? Should Sid buy shares? In its truncated form, there is a realistic chance that British Coal can operate profitably. The company was in the black last year, and prospects exist for further productivity gains to meet the tougher terms of the new electricity contracts. At the moment, British Coal is more likely to be sold to another company than floated on the stock exchange as was British Gas. Some half-dozen large companies have expressed an interest, including Hanson, owner of one of the largest US coal companies. There are also two buy-out proposals by trade unions. But if none of these come about, British Coal could be sold to stock market investors. In world terms, it would be a minor coal company with moderate profits at best. World energy supplies are plentiful for the foreseeable future so, barring upheavals, the price of coal is unlikely to show a sharp increase.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

He is one of five British farmers involved in a pioneering project to grow willow and poplar as a fuel crop that is commercially viable and kind to the environment. Winter is a busy time on Goodwin's 75-hectare cereal farm in Essex, 50 miles north-east of London. This is when the one-year-old trees have to be cut back, or coppiced, so the stumps sprout. The new shoots, which can grow up to four metres in the first year, will be harvested after two to five years and turned into woodchips to be burned for electricity. Coppicing of woodland goes back to the middle ages. But growing tree crops for fuel on arable land has only taken root in Europe in the past few years. Sweden, with vast forests and a strong commitment to renewable energy, already has about 9,000 hectares under commercial production. Now farmers in the European Union are becoming interested because of the introduction of compulsory set-aside, under which they can grow non-food crops without forfeiting subsidies. The National Farmers' Union will debate the issue at its annual meeting in London today. Cereals and oilseeds, straw and farm waste are all being tried for fuel. But arable coppice is seen in Britain as having the greatest potential, in terms of cost and impact on the environment. The government is funding the Pounds 1.1m five-farm project and last year included coppice in the list of non-fossil fuels from which electricity companies are obliged to obtain some of their power. Goodwin, whose family has grown willow for cricket bats for a century, is enthusiastic about the new use of the tree. 'As far as its environmental attractiveness is concerned, I don't see anything coming close to it,' he says. Although weed-killer is used to protect the young trees in their first year, coppice does not need constant applications of agrochemicals during its 30-year lifespan. The nutrients in soil previously used to grow cereals, coupled with annual leaf fall, can replace fertiliser. Sewage sludge can also be used, offering one solution to the problem of disposal that will arise when dumping sludge at sea is banned in 1998. The trees attract wildlife. 'We have found more than 40 species of bird within our plantations,' saysGoodwin. 'We wouldn't have seen a fraction of those under cereal production.' Access is provided for walkers and riders to open space around the trees, and there should be none of the visual objections associated with wind turbines. The burning process is surprisingly clean, too. Coppice releases no more carbon dioxide when burned than it absorbs during growth, emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide are low and the ash can be recycled as fertiliser. The wood crop produces about 30 times the energy used to grow and harvest it, compared with an energy ratio of less than two-to-one for the diesel substitute made from oilseed rape. Establishing a plantation is currently expensive at Pounds 1,300 or more a hectare. But grants are available from the Forestry Authority. The government is also considering encouraging coppice production on fixed set-aside land by 'rolling up' five years' worth of subsidies into a lump sum of about Pounds 1,550 a hectare in the first year. The expectation is that coppice will require little or no financial support once established as a commercial crop. With such attractions, many farmers are contemplating coppice as a way of sustaining rural employment. But most are hesitant until there is a proven market. That is why a group of farmers and businessmen set up Border Biofuels in 1992 to build power plants fuelled by woodchips. The company is applying for a licence for a 5MW plant - enough to supply electricity to a small town - near St Boswells in the Scottish Borders. Initially the Pounds 6m plant would burn forestry residue but this would gradually be replaced by coppice. The company hopes to assemble 30 or more farmers growing up to 2,000 hectares to supply the plant. 'It's a commercial crop with a margin comparable to cereals, subject to the market being established,' says Harry Frew, a director. Once coppice took off, cuttings would become widely available and the high cost to new entrants of about 10p a cutting could be slashed to 1p or 2p. Several regional electricity companies are interested as well. South Western Electricity (Sweb) is applying to build a 2.5MW power plant in Cornwall, using 18,000 tonnes of dry coppice a year from local growers. It has plans for three other wood-fuelled plants of 5MW to 10MW in Hampshire, Suffolk and Northamptonshire. 'We're keen to break this chicken-and-egg situation of no-crop-no-market and no-market-no-crop,' says Gerry Swarbrick, power resources manager. 'We believe renewables deserve a chance to demonstrate themselves on a commercial basis. We expect these technologies will one day stand on their own two feet.' There is a long way to go. The UK government aims to stimulate a modest 1,500MW of new electricity-generating capacity from renewable sources by the end of the decade - about 3 per cent of the country's electricity needs. Coppice would initially be a tiny part of that, with only about 100 hectares so far being grown. But the government-sponsored Renewable Energy Advisory Group presented a striking vision of its potential as the technology improves. It forecast that if 2.8m hectares - 16 per cent of agricultural land - were turned over to coppice by 2010, the energy created could amount to 22 per cent of electricity consumption.

Mr Blix said more countries would adopt nuclear power to generate electricity only if the industry continued to demonstrate its safety and environmental advantages. Mr Blix said in a speech opening a four-day conference on the future of nuclear power said it is regrettable that the issues which now dominate the media 'tend to create an atmosphere in which it is difficult to have a balanced public discussion of the nuclear power option'. Delegates among the 200 experts from 37 countries stressed the need for global co-operation on safety and new technology. Mr Blix said alarm over plutonium trafficking and the nuclear programmes of such states as Iraq and North Korea had overshadowed the benefits of nuclear power. 'Disturbing as some of these developments are, they do not negate the overriding trend towards ever greater international co-operation to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy,' he said. Russian nuclear experts in Vienna said Moscow's dependence on nuclear power could double by 2010 but any further boost in output would depend on safety and cost. Russia has 29 nuclear reactors, producing 12.5 per cent of its electricity supply. Four more are under construction. Mr Viktor Sidorenko of Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry told the conference that new plant designs were based on modern safety regulations and old units were now subject to stringent annual security checks. 'International collaboration and co-operation have become an integral part and condition for activities in the field of nuclear power in Russia,' Mr Sidorenko said.

The company said the move would enable it to cut costs while retaining the option to burn alternative fuels. Under current operating conditions the affected units are forecast to have minimal generation. Their withdrawal, the company said, would enable it to make savings through reductions in maintenance costs, use of system charges and business rates without affecting its ability to meet forecast demand. Richborough and Ince are PowerGen's only plants where orimulsion, the bitumen-based fuel, is burned - but the company said it would continue to burn about 1.3m tonnes a year in the units still open at the sites. The registered capacity of PowerGen plant available to the grid system as a result of the move of the units into reserve will be reduced by 1,080 megawatts. PowerGen said withdrawal of this plant would not prejudice the possibility of these units being considered for disposal under the recent undertaking given by PowerGen to Offer, the industry regulator, to use all reasonable efforts to negotiate the disposal of about 2,000MW of its coal- or oil-fired plant within two years. When generating plant is put in reserve, PowerGen says, it is not available for operational use. However, under certain circumstances it would be possible to recommission it if future market conditions made it economically viable to do so. The Treasury will shortly appoint a merchant bank to advise on the sale of some or all of its shares in the electricity generators National Power and PowerGen, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said in a written answer yesterday.

Mr John Baker wants tribunals of three to five members to replace single regulators. Writing in today's Financial Times, Mr Baker also suggests that the regulators should be brought together in a common organisation with colleagues from other industries and that their deliberations should be more open. Mr Baker's article fuels a growing debate about utility regulation. Controversy will intensify this year and next as the number of industries affected by regulation grows through privatisation of the coal and rail sectors. Regulators will also reach conclusions this summer on their reviews of water and electricity distribution industries. The results will be compared with a recent review of rates of return in the gas industry. The water review is causing acute concern among fund managers, two of who are urging water companies to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission rather than accept severe price limits. Mr Baker compares the UK regulatory regime with that in the US and, while criticising the US system as 'burdensome' and for promoting central planning, says Britain could 'learn something from the Americans'. Drawing on US practice of regulatory commissions with three to five members, Mr Baker suggests tribunals, rather than single regulators, would remove the 'cult of the personality'. A common organisation for the various regulators would 'enable the quality of support staff to be raised and to transfer experience between industries'. Mr Baker calls for: a precise definition of the role of regulation; publication by regulators of 'strategic plans' of their objections; greater use of public hearings; and quick appeals procedures.

0,FT923-11539 ,"FT923-11539 _AN-CGXAXABTFT 920724   FT  24 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The price of coal   BRITISH COAL deserves praise for its record profit last year of Pounds 170m. After years of cost cutting, the corporation is now one of Europe's most efficient producers, although it still cannot compete with prices on the open world market. It is ironic that these achievements should come at a time when British Coal's future is so uncertain. The long-term coal supply contracts with electricity generators, which account for more than 80 per cent of its revenues, are up for renegotiation; for the first time they will be struck at a commercial price, rather than one dictated by the government to prop up the coal industry. With these new contracts in place, coal will be returned to the private sector. Still more pit closures are inevitable. The government is right to want to privatise coal as part of its so far patchy strategy to allow market forces to restructure the UK's energy mix. But British Coal has a point when it argues that it is being asked to compete against other fuels whose prices are also artificially set. Nuclear power has a protected status, which may or may not be altered when the industry is reviewed in two years. Then there are the independent UK electricity generators, which will be burning gas obtained on highly favourable long-term contracts. Finally, there is the inadequately competitive structure of the electricity generating industry, where two unregulated giants may be able to crush British Coal in contract negotiations. This is not an argument for rethinking the privatisation of coal - or even delaying it. It has to be recognised that coal is not an attractive fuel: it is difficult and dangerous to obtain and it requires a lot of cleaning to meet air quality standards. The most efficient open-cast mines are also the least environmentally friendly. Coal's main advantage is that it is plentiful, but security of supply is less of a concern than it was 10 years ago, and Britain is fortunate in having abundant alternatives. The government should therefore focus on two points. First, it cannot avoid some interest in the coal contracts, given its importance for the size of the industry and its value at privatisation. It would be a disaster for ministers to revert to the old game of requiring a bloated price, but it would also be unsatisfactory for the generators to use their powers to drive a bargain with damaging long term consequences for consumers. The Office of Electricity Regulation should be asked, exceptionally, to produce and publish an analysis of coal's future in electricity generation, to help government and other interested parties judge the proposed deal. Second, Britain should use its EC presidency to press actions already launched in Brussels against coal protectionism in other member states. EC coal subsidies totalled Ecu10bn (Pounds 7bn) last year. Germany is a particular culprit, as is Spain, where some mines produce coal at five times the cost of British Coal.

0,FT924-9345 ,"FT924-9345 _AN-CKFB8AHDFT 921106   FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (7): Across the water / Review of the energy sector      By DONAL BUCKLEY   IN CONTRAST to the Irish manufacturers which are trying desperately to distance themselves from the effects of the downturn in the UK currency, the Irish energy sector is looking increasingly to the UK for future development. The Irish gas board, BGE, is well advanced in its plans for the construction of a IPounds 280m gas interconnector to Scotland in order to tap into North Sea gas. A study on the feasibility of a UK electricity interconnector is also under way. Flogas, the only publicly quoted LPG distributor, is developing its UK market presence by diversifying into the sale of British natural gas in England, and the hopes of some of Ireland's leading oil exploration companies are increasingly dependent on North Sea prospects. The currency advantage of the stronger Irish pound makes buying UK energy for the Irish market more attractive. Conversely, competition from cheaper priced sterling products has further intensified the pressure on the Irish government from industrialists requiring reduced energy costs to improve competitiveness. Even before the rise of the Irish pound against sterling, the Culliton Review Group, a government-appointed commission on employment creation and industrial competitiveness, pointed out that the Irish government-owned electricity supply board, EBB, could reduce the cost of electricity by using imported fuels instead of peat. However, such a decision would spell disaster for Bord na Mona, the state-owned peat harvesting company which generates 55 per cent of its revenue from its sales to the EBB. Peat also provides an important source of employment in the Irish midlands, where the Taoiseach's constituency, Mr Albert Reynolds's, is based. Culliton says: 'The financial and social consequences of a reduced price for milled peat should be faced by the government directly and not hidden in a cross subsidy between the two state sponsored bodies.' But since implementation of the Culliton proposal would cause social and political consequences equivalent to a pit closure for a British Labour government, the Irish coalition government is unlikely to risk such a move. Similarly, the government seems reluctant to implement another Culliton proposal: that BGE charge a more commercial price for the natural gas it sells to Irish Fertiliser Industries as a feedstock for manufacturing nitrogen fertiliser. IFI (and its predecessor, NET) has been receiving this gas at a discount, paying as little as one fifth of the price paid by commercial customers. A more likely victim of the drive for competitiveness could be the state-owned Irish Refining Company. whose sales rely mainly on the government requirement that Irish oil distributors source one third of their supplies from the refinery. The result is an extra imposition on petrol prices for consumers. Here the government has at least taken the step of trying to find a purchaser or partner to take over the operation and invest in upgrading. So far its efforts have proved fruitless. The government appears to be holding out in the hope that an important oil discovery in the Celtic Sea - on the shore of which the refinery is located  -could help to justify the investment. The most recent well to be drilled last month discovered oil, which flowed at 100 barrels a day, approximately 30 miles south of the refinery. This news offers little encouragement for the refinery company, but adds to the tantalising results of exploration, which indicate that there is oil at a number of locations off the southern coast. (The structure is so complex that it requires innovative investment and production techniques to bring it ashore.) The government has recently begun to recognise that it too must take a more innovative approach to offshore exploration. As a result it has reduced corporation profits tax on oil discoveries to as low as 25 per cent - which compares favourably with tax rates for North Sea producers. It has also designed its terms to revive interest - which had been flagging, after the disappointing results of the 1970s. Mobil, the second largest US oil company, has committed itself to drilling programmes with a number of Irish companies, including Aran Energy and Bula. Pict, the UK exploration company, also joined in the search this summer. To encourage exploration in the frontier area off the north west Atlantic coast, Mr Bobby Molloy, the Irish minister for energy, is scheduled to announce special licensing terms which 'will reflect the particularly challenging nature of the acreage.' The challenge to which the minister refers includes the weather conditions; the minister describes the area as having one of the best wind regimes in Europe. But while the wind may cause difficulties for exploration, it can facilitate the generation of alternative energy. Last month saw the completion of Ireland's first wind farm on the north west coast with a capacity of 6.45 megawatts for the ESB controlled national grid. But even the recent 30 per cent increase in the price, to 3.6p per unit for independent supplies, is unlikely to lead to this sector catering for the increased electricity demand expected before the end of the century. Instead, the ESB has developed proposals for another gas powered station in Dublin. Since nuclear fuel has also proved unpopular, it seems that the only other alternative would be the interconnector which it is exploring with the UK National Grid Company. Both partners hope that the EC could be persuaded to help finance the project (the gas interconnector is receiving IPounds 80m.). Routed through Northern Ireland and Wales, it would link both parts of the island to the European free trade electricity network. Such a link would also lay the groundwork for outside involvement in generating electricity for the Irish market. With serious concern that gas sales are unlikely to provide a return from the interconnector soon enough, BGE may encourage British Gas to avail itself of the interconnector in order to introduce natural gas to the Belfast markets, and to power an electricity station in Northern Ireland. The next step could see British participation in the distribution of natural gas in the Republic, just as Flogas is already doing in the UK.  The Financial Times   London Page 35  "

The Treuhand privatisation agency decided yesterday to begin negotiations on selling east Germany's largest brown coal mining company, Mibrag, to the consortium. A rival German energy consortium, led by Rheinbraun and including RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, failed to submit a competitive bid, according to the Treuhand. PowerGen's move comes at a politically sensitive time for the UK government, in the middle of a review on how to reprieve some of British Coal's mines. However, the privatised generator stressed yesterday it had no plans to import the coal, which would all be used locally. PowerGen and NRG Energy are understood to have bid nearly DM1bn (Pounds 412m) to buy Mibrag's extensive open-cast mines in the Leipzig area and planned several billion D-Marks in investments. Mibrag, which produced 36m tons of brown coal last year, expects to sign contracts shortly to supply brown coal to several big power stations planned in Saxony. The company's workforce is to be slashed by 5,500 to 10,500 by the end of this year. The UK-US consortium also aims to become the first foreign company to operate power stations in Germany, breaking the fiercely-protected oligopoly of domestic producers. German electricity rates are among the highest in Europe and PowerGen and NRG Energy have held out the prospect of producing cheaper electricity. Both the Treuhand and the German Cartel Office have expressed interest in obtaining cheaper rates for German industrial and household users.

Mr John Maltby, the departing chairman, said the government would have to pay for decommissioning the historic nuclear research installations if it wanted to sell off the group. 'It is difficult to privatise anything with unquantified liabilities, particularly in the decommissioning area', he said. AEA said that it had a 'letter of understanding' from the Department of Trade and Industry that it would meet the bill. The same dilemma about how to split off past nuclear liabilities upset electricity privatisation three years ago. The authority, which now trades as AEA Technology, shows decommissioning liabilities of Pounds 14.3m in its balance sheet. Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive, said there were other activities which 'you could say don't really belong' if the group were sold. He cited the 500-strong police force AEA employs for security at sites now run by British Nuclear Fuels. Recession and a drop in government nuclear work cut group turnover in the year to March 1993 from Pounds 425m to Pounds 415m, and cut operating profits from Pounds 33m to Pounds 23m. Half the Pounds 61.6m of exceptional costs was due to redundancy, AEA said. Staff numbers fell in the year from 9,187 to 8,022. The group plans a further 500 redundancies this year. Infrastructure renewal - upgrading decades-old electricity and air conditioning systems - also accounted for Pounds 34.2m of the exceptional costs.

0,FT924-6461 ,"FT924-6461 _AN-CKTBNAG7FT 921120   FT  20 NOV 92 / Plant exploits power of the 'battery hen'      By ANDREW BAXTER   BRITAIN switched on to poultry power yesterday with the official opening of what is claimed to be the world's first commercial power station fuelled by chicken droppings, giving new meaning to the term 'battery hen'. The Pounds 25m powerplant at Eye in Suffolk generates 12.5MW of electricity  -enough for 12,500 homes - from poultry litter: a mixture of wood shavings, straw and poultry droppings that can be burnt at very high temperatures to produce steam. The plant will use 130,000 tonnes of poultry litter a year - nearly 9 per cent of the 1.5m tons produced every year in the UK or enough to fill 25 football fields two metres deep. According to Fibropower, the London-based company that has built the plant and developed the technology, chicken power is generating worldwide interest. Mr Rupert Fraser, finance director, said it could be used wherever there was sufficient density of poultry droppings. The fuel used at Eye represents the 'output' of 70m chickens. As the birds are harvested every few months, that is equivalent to a population of 12.5m birds at any one time - so the plant's output is produced at the rate of one watt per chicken. Mr Fraser emphasised that the plant used poultry litter only from broiler poultry farms, where the birds live on a bed of deep litter. This provides a regular fuel source as the chicken farmers have to clear their sheds frequently, and a consistent fuel because of supermarkets' need for uniform quality chickens. Although the process is no more efficient than a similar-sized coal-fired power station, Fibropower says that replacing a coal power station with chicken power, along with the associated handling in poultry litter, will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by two thirds. The only significant by-product is ash, which will be sold as an environmentally friendly, nitrogen-free fertiliser. The Suffolk plant was one of 75 renewable-energy projects approved in 1990 and is the largest to start operating under the non-fossil-fuel obligation of the 1989 Electricity Act. That obliges the 12 regional electricity companies to take fixed proportions of the electricity available from renewable-energy projects. Eastern Electricity has taken a minority stake in Fibropower, and has invested Pounds 2m at Eye and a slightly larger 13.5MW chicken powerplant being built at Glanford, south Humberside, by Fibrogen, a Fibropower sister company. The duopoly of National Power and PowerGen must be destroyed if there is to be a future for independent generators, Dr James Smith, chairman of Eastern Electricity, the biggest of the regional distribution companies, said yesterday. Dr Smith, officially opening the power station fuelled by poultry litter, said more, similar renewable-energy projects were needed in the future. Independent generators needed a more competitive market, he said.  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "
0,FT934-6334 ,"FT934-6334 _AN-DKYDLADWFT 931125   FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Scots are developing the power to invade England - The current expansion plans of Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric      By JAMES BUXTON   Opinions may differ on whether a line of new pylons through the hills of southern Scotland near the A74 Glasgow-Carlisle road enhance the scenery. They will certainly enhance the business of Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric, the two Scottish electricity companies. The recently-completed pylons are the upgraded interconnector, the transmission line taking Scottish electricity exports to England. Scottish Power, which reports its interim results today, gets the lion's share of the 350MW increase in the interconnector's capacity, which is rising to 1,200MW, though Hydro-Electric's export capacity will rise slightly. Total capacity should rise to 1,600MW by 1995, following improvements in the English grid. Last week Scottish Power received another boost when it concluded an agreement with British Coal to take more than 2m tonnes of coal a year for the next five years on terms similar to those reached by the two English generators in the spring. The deal involves a backdated reduction in the price which will cut the company's fuel costs by Pounds 10m this year, and a more rapid drop in world coal price levels than planned under the previous contract. Hydro-Electric, which generates most of its electricity from gas and hydro power, will get one sixth of the coal. Unlike the regional electricity companies and the two English generators, the Scottish companies are vertically integrated, both generating and supplying electricity. Apart from the Northern Ireland company they were the last to be floated and the only ones where the government got the price about right, permitting a small premium for investors but a sluggish aftermarket. From the start in 1991 the two companies pursued different strategies. Scottish Power, with a market capitalisation more than twice that of Hydro-Electric, concentrated on its much bigger domestic market, while exporting power to England via the interconnector. It also developed some generating projects in England and studied the possibility of supplying power to the Isle of Man, but none of these schemes materialised. Hydro-Electric was nimbler in signing up to supply individual customers south of the border. With Norweb it pushed ahead on a project to build a 680MW gas-fired power station at Keadby on the Humber. Analysts considered Hydro-Electric more dynamic and the market established a premium for its shares over Scottish Power. However, in September Hydro-Electric dropped out of the FT-SE 100, and since October has stood at a slight discount to Scottish Power, which is now making a bigger effort to explain where it is going. Mr Ian Preston, Scottish Power's chief executive, put achieving greater efficiency as a primary objective. It is now bringing itself up to the benchmark standards of the best US utilities, and has shed 30 per cent of staff in its core business since privatisation. Other aims are to make the most of its generating assets and 'to diversify prudently in utility-related businesses'. It has plans to build a 250MW interconnector to supply Northern Ireland. The original route for the pylons across Ayrshire ran into opposition but the company will seek planning consent for a revised line next year. When that comes onstream towards the end of the decade, and taking into account the interconnector upgrade to England, 30 per cent of Scottish Power's output should be going outside its own territory at prices outside the control of the regulator. The present level is 9 per cent. In diversifying, Scottish Power has reorganised its retailing business, which claims 30 per cent of the Scottish white goods market and is expanding in northern England. It has a joint venture in gas with Utilicorp, named Caledonian Gas, which already has 2,000 customers. 'It's a low risk business,' says Mr Preston. 'Caledonian gets the customers, Utilicorp supplies the gas and British Gas delivers it.' Like other gas suppliers he is urging the government to liberalise the gas market to embrace most domestic customers. At present only consumers who take 2,500 therms a year, giving an annual bill of more than Pounds 1,100, can choose their supplier. Scottish Power is also spending Pounds 7m on a fibre optic telecommunications network between Glasgow and Edinburgh for use by other companies. For Hydro-Electric, with a much smaller domestic market and a share of the interconnector that will only reach 490MW in 1995, the priority has been to develop generating capacity south of the border. That policy is now coming to fruition. The Keadby plant will begin operating in January 1995, and last month it formed a joint venture with BNF called Fellside to own a 157MW gas fired combined heat and power plant opening early next year at Sellafield. With the enhanced interconnector and a 7MW combined heat and power plant at Dover, Hydro-Electric should be supplying 820MW of power in England by 1995. The north of Scotland company recently formed Vector Gas, a joint venture in gas with Marathon, which intends to market gas all over Britain under the HE Energy label. Rather more than Scottish Power, Hydro-Electric has its sights on becoming an all-purpose energy utility.   Companies:-  Scottish Power.     Scottish Hydro-Electric.

Pakistan has achieved self-sufficiency in uranium,  and only locally-processed uranium is being used in nuclear  power stations. Addressing the inaugural function of the second  science conference at Aitchison College in Lahore, he disclosed  that Pakistan is processing uranium by itself and making it  usable. There are only a few countries that are self-sufficient  in uranium. Most countries import uranium to meet their  requirements, but Pakistan does not need to do so because it has  its own uranium reserves. Uranium is a metallic element that is  used as fuel in nuclear reactors or for producing energy.    Ashfaq Ahmed said that Pakistan has been successfully  pursuing its nuclear program since 1976, and that Pakistani  scientists do not receive any external assistance or cooperation  in this regard. They are fulfilling their scientific duty by  utilizing their own resources, which is a tremendous scientific  achievement. Pakistani scientists and technologists have not  allowed the shortage of funds to impede their work. They have  built locally several major parts for a nuclear power plant that  were previously imported, and have not let external impediments  stand in the way of the smooth operation of their program.  Pakistan's first nuclear power plant was supplied by Canada  some 20-22 years ago, but due to international pressure it soon  stopped supplying uranium, the fuel; heavy water; and spare  parts. This was a great challenge for Pakistan, which our  scientists accepted with great dexterity. They succeeded in  keeping the plant operational by utilizing local resources.  China is the only country that has provided a 300-kilowatt  nuclear power plant, now being constructed at Chashma.    Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed said that we are capable of building  nuclear  power stations. Nuclear energy is indispensable for Pakistan.  Pakistan has no option but to use nuclear technology to increase  electricity production, because it cannot meet all of its energy  requirements by utilizing such conventional energy production  resources as water, oil, gas, and coal. The country is facing  the difficulty of power blackouts due to the shortage of  electricity.    The nuclear energy chief said there are 6,550 nuclear  medicine centers in various countries around the world, of which  nine are in Pakistan. Several of these centers will be set up  in the country to help diagnose and treat complicated diseases.  The private sector will be encouraged to play a role in this  field as well. He added that nuclear technology is also being  used in the agricultural field, and 18 new crop varieties have  been discovered. Ashfaq Ahmed declared that Pakistan's nuclear  program is solely for peaceful purposes.    Nuclear power plants generate 70 percent of the world's  electricity. France meets 75 percent of its energy requirements  with nuclear power plants. There are 424 nuclear power reactors  in the world. Therefore, there is no reason why Pakistan should  be asked to desist from utilizing nuclear technology to increase  electricity production, improve health care facilities, and  boost agricultural production.    As far as the question of rolling back the nuclear program  is  concerned, it is entirely a political issue, and the nuclear  scientists have nothing to do with it. The Chashma nuclear  power plant will start producing electricity in 1997-98.  Pakistan needs several more similar nuclear power plants. If  France had not refused to supply the nuclear reprocessing plant  for enriching uranium, Pakistan would have been able to set up  nuclear power stations by now. In any case, the country's  future energy requirements can only be met through the  establishment of nuclear power plants.     "

The companies yesterday completed financing for the Pounds 400m station, which will open in January 1995. New power stations such as Keadby, which will be buying gas from British Gas, have faced opposition since gas prices were increased by about 15 per cent to 20 per cent in September. Critics said this meant the projects would produce expensive electricity, which regional companies would then sell to captive domestic customers. Mr Malcolm Faulkner, Norweb's managing director, said Keadby would supply competitive power. He said the high price reflected flexible supply terms. Only about 60 per cent of gas will be supplied by British Gas. Mobil Gas Marketing will be another supplier. The Keadby station will use the latest turbine technology. John Brown Engineering, which will build the station, said the deal was its largest order of its type from the UK. A UK, US, and Japanese consortium will build a Pounds 230m 660MW power station on the Isle of Grain in Kent. TBV Power, which is jointly owned by Tarmac and Black and Veatch, a US construction company, will join Marubeni, the Japanese trading company, to design and build the station. The government should triple or quadruple its target for introducing renewable energy such as wind, wave and solar power, according to a report from MPs the Commons energy select committee yesterday.

0,FT921-3655 ,"FT921-3655 _AN-CCMBUAB2FT 920313   FT  13 MAR 92 / Green light for UK gas suppliers: Deborah Hargreaves reports on the ending of British Gas's monopoly      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   A Pounds 1bn a year UK gas market has been opened up for independent suppliers this week with British Gas's agreement to reduce its share of industrial and commercial customers from a virtual monopoly to 40 per cent by 1995. Pressed by the government, British Gas also agreed to run its pipelines as an arm's length business serving it and other suppliers on equal terms. The two changes, together with the prospect of independent suppliers serving retail customers later in the decade, will mark the end of British Gas's virtual monopoly over UK gas supplies. This was particularly welcome news for the small number of independent gas suppliers who now see scope to expand their business. 'We welcome the proposal to release gas to new suppliers,' said Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica, a gas company jointly owned by North Sea producer, Conoco, and electricity generator, PowerGen. 'But we hope we will be consulted about the mechanisms of the new arrangements to avoid disruptions.' So far, only nine companies supplying 1,900 customers compete against British Gas. They account for a fraction of the industrial market which itself is one-third of the total UK gas market. But the government is keen to encourage smaller, entrepreneurial gas marketing companies to become active in the market to forge links between a wider range of customers and a source of supply. The choice of supplier is a luxury so far enjoyed only by large business users, but soon small companies will benefit when the government lowers the consumption threshold for companies to choose an alternative supply. Large energy users have generally welcomed having a choice of supplier. 'We are keen to talk to companies that can provide us with one overall price for gas - the British Gas price schedules are extremely complex,' said one energy buyer. Rivals to British Gas have, in the five years since its privatisation, come from the large oil companies which produce gas in the North Sea. 'The independents are really gas traders which can balance supply and demand, making supply available when customers want it by negotiating with producers and arranging a transport contract,' explains Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, a UK independent wholesaler. His company is concentrating on supply to large industrial sites. But taking on British Gas will be no easy feat. Some of the independents have found partners among regional electricity companies eager to diversify since they were privatised. Seeboard, the supplier to the south-east of England, recently became the latest of four electricity companies to announce the formation of a gas supply subsidiary. The electricity companies are preparing to move into the domestic market when that opens up. Household customers could then choose a joint gas and electricity supplier with the cost of both fuels covered on one bill. United Gas, an independent gas sales company, has teamed up with the electricity companies to move into the smaller end of the market. 'We looked at the market and saw there was no point in supplying large users because we just couldn't compete with British Gas on price,' said Mr Peter Bryant, deputy chairman. 'But we saw the opportunity for suppliers to medium-sized customers, and eventually households.' Midlands Gas, in which United has a 25 per cent stake, was the first electricity venture pioneered by Mr Bryant. The company has a contract to provide the fledgling supplier with 36m therms of gas for its first year of operation. According to Mr Roger Gill, managing director of Midlands Gas, the company has 420 customers and will soon sell all its gas allocation for the first year. Mr Bryant also wants to develop new forms of energy contracts for the UK market and be actively involved in building up short-term sales. No short-term market exists in the UK, but increasing competition could lead to the sale of some gas on a monthly basis as in the US. United has experience of the US market as it is an offshoot of Utilicorp, the second-largest gas marketing company in the US. Utilicorp buys reserves and sells them on to customers at a small, fixed premium. Kinetica is looking beyond pure gas supply. The company has grown into one of British Gas's largest rivals and supplies more than 900 sites. Mr Norman Ellis, managing director, says: 'We've always believed that just being a trader has its limitations. A lot of British Gas's strength comes from owning its own infrastructure such as gas pipelines.' The company has secured the first contracts to build independently owned pipelines in the UK to supply two power stations. British Gas owns the transmission grid, but must hive this off into a separate subsidiary, a move the government hopes will convince competitors the company's transit tariffs are fair. British Gas is obliged to give rivals access to its pipelines, but has been accused of providing more favourable transport tariffs for its own supplies. 'For a balanced independent company to succeed in what will be a highly competitive market, I'm convinced it will need its own pipelines,' said Mr Ellis. 'But getting a foothold in that business has been very, very difficult.' The country is unlikely to become criss-crossed by a mass of rival gas pipelines, however. Once British Gas hives off its pipeline and storage facilities, competitors will have access to its main pipeline system and the smaller domestic lines right up to the household meter. To reach domestic customers, rivals may have to install their own meters. This is one of a number of criteria being thought through before this sector is opened. Mr Bryant believes competition will begin to develop for household users by the end of the decade. But he stresses the government needs to set some standards for entry into the market to ensure that rival suppliers are not likely to run out of supply and cut off domestic users.

The West Midlands plant, employing 60 people, expects to burn 23 per cent of Britain's waste tyres in its first year of operation. The project is the latest waste-to-energy scheme under a contract with the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency, which encourages alternatives to coal-fired power. The contract allows Elm Energy - a US joint venture between utility group Nipsco and the tyre company Performance Services Corporation - to supply power to 25,000 homes in the Midlands region. If pre-production tests this week are successful, the company intends to build another plant at East Kilbride in Scotland and to seek a suitable site in the south-east. Elm says the power station at Wolverhampton will be the cleanest in the UK, pointing to Pounds 48m of equipment and plant installed to ensure that emissions are well below maximum levels set by the World Health Organisation. Mrs Anne Evans, managing director, said that unlike fossil fuels, waste tyres contain only low levels of carbon and none of the dioxins which lead to greenhouse gases. 'This new technology is not an environmental problem. Our emissions are between one hundred thousandth and one billionth of the allowable limits,' she said. Potentially harmful by-products of burning tyres are to be recycled. The tyre industry will buy back zinc oxide, steel particles will be sold for scrap, and calcium sulphate used for building materials. Once purified, steam from the plant's generators will be transformed into electricity by a 35 megavoltamp turbogenerator. Midlands Electricity will supply the power to domestic users.

0,FT933-20 ,"FT933-20 _AN-DI3C1AG8FT 930930   FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (26): Lights are going out all over India - Electricity      By SARA WEBB   DAY after day, India's city-dwellers are reminded of the country's desperate need for power. In the summer months, when temperatures can soar as high as 45 degrees celsius, air-conditioners shudder to a halt, rooms are plunged into darkness, and those industries which cannot afford to run their own generators grind to a standstill for yet another power cut. Not even the Prime Minister or the usually-pampered VIPs escaped the power cuts in New Delhi this summer. Much to the embarrassment of the authorities, Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's home was without electricity for several hours. Other residents of Delhi were deprived of power for much longer and more frequently: they showed their displeasure more visibly by beating up employees of the Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU). Acute power shortages afflict much of urban India in the summer months. The power sector simply cannot meet the combined demands of India's industrial, agricultural and residential consumers as investment in the power sector has failed to keep pace with the country's economic development. India has installed capacity of 72,000 megawatts (MW) and the government expects to add a further 31,000MW in its 1992-97 economic plan. But even then, it estimates that by the end of 1997 shortfalls in energy will range from 9 to 21 per cent. As the government cannot afford to meet all of the country's power requirements itself, it decided in 1991 to encourage private sector participation in new power generation and distribution projects, wooing investors with an array of financial incentives. These include a five-year tax holiday on profits and lower duties for the import of power equipment. Even so, the private sector has been quite slow to sign up. The individual state governments have offered power projects amounting to more than 33,000MW in capacity to private sector companies. But, while the private investors are clearly interested in some of the proposals, they still have a number of concerns. At present, 46 coal, gas and hydro-electricity projects are being discussed, with a total capacity of 25,120MW and involving an investment of about Rs760bn (about Dollars 25bn). Among the foreign participants who have either signed agreements, or who are close to doing so, are Cogentrix and Enron Power of the US, and Siemens of Germany. Power officials have been busy with roadshows around Asia, the Middle East, the UK and the US in the hope of drumming up more overseas interest in power projects. Foreign investors have been pushing the government for additional work. The decision to turn to the private sector, however, ignores the simple fact that India has plenty of scope to improve its existing power generation and distribution system. 'Instead of investing money in new projects they should improve the efficiency of the existing plants,' says Mr Shekhar Singh, an environment expert at the Indian Institute of Public Administration, who says that 'huge' savings are possible. Some effort is being made to do this by renovating and modernising power plants and distribution systems. However, one senior official in the Ministry of Power expressed disappointment at the lack of private sector interest in such renovation projects, even though, he claims, 'investors would be putting in less money than for new projects plus they would see a higher return: there's less risk involved and less money up-front'. But as one foreign company which specialises in this area says: 'it makes considerable sense to increase the effectiveness of installed equipment; but while renovating plants will increase supply, it won't fill the gap.' Energy experts point out that India needs to do more to improve the efficiency of the distribution network provided by the SEBs. More than a fifth of transmission and distribution losses in India are due to stealing and inefficiency - a poor record by international standards. 'Electricity has been handled as a social commodity meant to be doled out in exchange for votes - it's either subsidised or free', says Mr SV Joshi, director of the power generation and distribution systems division at Siemens, India. In some states, including Tamil Nadu, farmers receive free electricity because the cost of collecting exceeds the amount due. While in a big city such as Calcutta, the private-sector Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation collects 92 per cent of its revenues within 15 days of them falling due, in the rural areas revenue collection is far more difficult to conduct. 'Twenty years ago, agriculture only consumed about 18 per cent of the power supply: today it accounts for 42 per cent of consumption,' says Mr N. Ramji, joint secretary at the Ministry of Power's Investment Promotion Cell. Most of that is used in irrigation schemes, in areas such as the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Many slum-dwellers simply steal electricity by hooking up to overhead cables. Many of the SEBs, which are responsible for generation and distribution, have a reputation for being poorly managed, overmanned, and corrupt. The Economic Times, an Indian newspaper, recently reported that the SEB in the state of Bihar was so overstaffed with 42,000 employees that 80 per cent of its budget was spent on staff salaries. Bihar may be one of the worst examples, but officials admit privately that many of the SEBs need to improve their performance. The problem is that traditionally the public sector has been reluctant to rationalise through job-cuts, a sensitive issue. The final way in which India might improve its energy use is through conservation and the use of more energy-efficient equipment, in the home, the factory, and the field. Solar powered irrigation pumps have only recently been introduced in Rajasthan, and environmentalists are keen to see wider use of solar energy. DESU has billboard announcements and advertisements imploring people not to consume too much electricity, though the request to turn off air-conditioning in summer probably falls on deaf ears. Environmentalists argue that what is needed is a pricing system which discourages the use of electricity at peak times, and which reflects the actual cost of the electricity supply. 'Electricity is far too cheap, there are no incentives to save it' complains Mr Singh.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

Her concerns, which she said arose 'in the first week' of her appointment in November, were made to the Commons environment select committee yesterday. Mr Robert Jones MP, the Conservative chairman of the committee, accused her of making 'a robust condemnation' of Sir James McKinnon. The controversy - which surfaced when Ms Spottiswoode gave evidence to the trade and industry select committee in January - is over whether gas and electricity customers should pay for projects initiated by the Energy Saving Trust. The trust is intended to help the utilities identify ways in which their customers can save energy. Ms Spottiswoode's concern is that the trust will need to spend in the region of Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m a year by the end of the decade to meet government targets. This could add several per cent to household fuel bills, on top of the controversial imposition of value added tax announced in last year's Budget. The trust was featured prominently by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the UK's strategy for combating global warming. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said: 'Until this problem is solved it is hard to see how Mr Major's strategy is on the road.' Mr Jones argued that there was 'a clear difference of opinion' between Ms Spottiswoode and Professor Stephen Littlechild, her counterpart at Offer, the electricity regulator.

0,FT921-3160 ,"FT921-3160 _AN-CCPB5AC1FT 920316   FT  16 MAR 92 / The European Market: Hopes for east-west electricity trade may be dashed - Austria's deal with the Ukraine is unlikely to herald similar energy barter deals      By IAN RODGER   AN imaginative electricity deal concluded a few days ago between Austria and the Ukraine has once again raised hopes about the potential for large-scale trade in electricity between eastern and western Europe. The Austrian electrical utility, Oesterreichische Elektrizitaetswirtshafts (OEL), is to buy up to 800m kW hours annually from Interenergo in Kiev for 15 years. The total value of the contract could rise to ASch7bn Pounds 347.5m). In return, the Ukrainian power authority has agreed to use part of the proceeds from the sale to buy Austrian equipment and know-how to improve control of emissions at three of its coal-fired power stations. It will also buy gas turbines to increase their efficiency. This deal echoes another a year ago between Czechoslovakia and Germany. Then, Bayernwerk, a Munich utility, agreed to buy about 1,400MW of electricity from the Mochovce nuclear power station being built in western Slovakia. Czechoslovakia has agreed to use the revenue from its sale to instal instruments and control systems supplied by Siemens to bring the plant up to western safety standards. Once the new plant is running, two older and more dangerous nuclear plants elsewhere in the country will be shut down, much to the relief of Germany and Austria. These quasi-barter deals could become models for several others. It is generally agreed that all the nuclear power plants in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe are in poor condition. Many are beyond repair and must be shut down and others will require massive investment to bring them up to western safety standards. Mr Adolf Huttl, head of the KWU energy division of Siemens, said recently that it would cost DM12bn (Pounds 4.1bn) to renovate all of the 63 pressurised water reactors in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. This excludes the 16 Chernobyl type reactors. Like most experts, Mr Huttl believes they are too badly designed to be worth repairing. However, there are a number of practical obstacles to further large-scale barter deals. For one thing, most eastern European countries are net importers of electricity, and do not have surplus power to sell. Some analysts have even raised their eyebrows over the Austria-Ukraine deal on these grounds. The Ukraine would appear to be in a worse supply position than some other east European countries because it faces the prospect of having to shut down the two remaining 1000MW units at Chernobyl. The Austrians say they are confident of power deliveries under the contract because the Ukraine has so much other generating capacity, including four less dangerous pressurised water reactor (PWR) nuclear stations. Privately, they say they are counting on a substantial decline in domestic demand for power in the Ukraine in the next few years as industrial output there falls sharply. There would also seem to be little potential for sales of electricity from western European countries to eastern ones, even assuming that the eastern countries could to pay for it. Except for France, most western European countries have inadequate generating capacity for their own needs. Moreover, environmental lobbies would be strong enough to block or slow construction of new power stations, especially those where output was designed largely for export. Another obstacle to trade is the lack of transmission capacity between eastern and western Europe. Western European utilities do not want to connect their grid to the Comecon grid because its voltage is not stabilised. The alternative is to move power on high voltage direct current lines. However at the moment, there is only one such line, of limited capacity, connecting east and west, between Austria and Hungary. Austria will have to expand this capacity to get all the power it wants from the Ukraine, and it remains to be seen if OEL can overcome opposition to new power line construction from the substantial number of people in the country who believe high voltage lines cause cancer. Even if it does, it will not be able to take the volumes foreseen in its contract with the Ukraine until at least 1996. There is, of course, an even more fundamental obstacle to substantial east-west trade in electricity. Both parts of Europe have virtually identical weather and seasonal patterns, which severely limits the opportunity for offsetting each other's demand peaks and troughs. Perhaps the greatest prospects for energy trade between east and west are still along the lines developed during the cold war, with the west buying the east's oil and gas in return for hard currency.

An improved ""window material"" used  as a transparent, conductive contact layer also contributed to  this positive result.     "

By FT Writers   This kerfuffle about salaries is a peculiarly British thing, said Mr John Bellak, once chairman of Severn Trent Water and recipient of a Pounds 512,626 pay-off last year. He was reflecting from the Carlton Club in London on the latest arguments about pay, pensions and share options that are swirling around the water and electricity distribution companies, four years on from privatisation. Some critics charge that the executives of the privatised companies are former civil servants who have managed to get their hands in the honey pot; supporters claim that they are overworked managers battling away in complex industries, whose personal merits are only now beginning to be recognised. The extremes of the debate are crude, of course, and do not address directly the question of whether reward should be matched to performance. But as annual reports have trickled out recently, and the small print at the back has revealed details of remuneration and pay-offs, critics have become more outspoken: the rewards have been outstripping performance, they say. In the Commons, warming to the theme that privatisation had turned into a swindle against consumers, Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting Labour leader, asked the prime minister this week: 'How can you defend the fact that the chairman of North West Water got Pounds 47,000 a year before privatisation and now he gets Pounds 338,000?' Mr John Major defended the water privatisation programme and said directors should abide by the government's strict limits on pay increases for public sector workers. Meanwhile, Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, has been telling executives that those who climb to the top of the ladder should be mindful of their responsibilities to others. Water and electricity executives might have had an easier time fending off their critics but for three factors: the recession, lay-offs in the privatised industries, and larger bills for consumers. 'For a lot of people, when they come into the industry, what really hits them is that they're in a goldfish bowl,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity. Those looking into the bowl see plumper and more valuable shapes than in recent years. This is true even in the goldfish bowl of Scotland, where, as in the case of Scottish Power and Scottish HydroElectric, the privatisations were priced more parsimoniously than the English electricity companies, and where the chairman and senior executives have been a little more restrained in taking salary increases than some of their English peers. None the less, the rises were substantial. Mr Ian Preston, chief executive of Scottish Power, has seen his pay rise from Pounds 63,175 before privatisation in 1991 to Pounds 255,218 in 1993-94. Sir Donald Miller, Scottish Power's first chairman, saw his pay increase from Pounds 75,873 in 1990 to Pounds 203,192 in 1992, the year he retired. In England, at Northern Electric, the salary of Mr David Morris, chairman, went up in the last financial year to Pounds 208,000; it was Pounds 72,151 in 1989-90. At Northumbrian Water, Mr David Cranston, the chief executive, earned Pounds 150,000 in the last financial year, three times more than the company's managing director at the time of flotation. On top of their salaries, most directors and senior executives of the privatised companies have been granted options to buy shares at a specific price. There is nothing unusual in this practice: it is a common method of allying hopes of personal fortune to corporate performance. But the bonanza has led to growing calls from the Labour party for an independent inquiry into the way the utilities are regulated. At Swalec, the south Wales electricity company, Mr Wynford Evans, chairman, has exercised options on 111,510 shares, making a paper profit of just under Pounds 500,000. Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, and two other directors of Southern Electricity, had paper profits of more than Pounds 1m in total on the exercise of 240,000 share options. The departure last year of Midlands Electricity's managing director, Mr Richard Young, was made more comfortable by his possession of options which could provide a paper profit of more than Pounds 500,000. There is no doubt that, as one City utilities expert put it, 'many of the privatised company executives have gone from being moderately comfortable engineers to quite wealthy businessmen in three or four years.' But the qualification of the adjectives is significant. As the observer noted: 'There are plenty of 30-year-olds in the City making more money than these guys.' The amounts involved are trivial compared with the sums made by property entrepreneurs in 1989-90, when values were surging. But the privatised utilities' executives are a more cautious breed, trained to make technical decisions rather than to play percentages. 'When we were privatised - the 12 English electricity companies - the 12 of us were both chairmen and chief executives. Eleven of us were long term in the industry, 10 were engineers,' recalled Mr Townsend. Now the roles of chairman and chief executive have been split and 'virtually all the chief executives are engineers, not all of them from inside the industry'. They have in common the fact that they seem obsessed with work. Mr Alan Smith, managing director of Anglian Water, said he had never worked harder, never worked longer and never worried more than in the years since privatisation. Sir Desmond Pitcher, the subject of Mrs Beckett's ire as chairman of North West Water, uses the golf course and opera house as an extension of his office. 'He just hasn't time to be a playboy or anything like that,' said a colleague. Mr John Seed, chief executive of SWEB, the south-west electricity company, started work on Thursday at 7am, finished at midnight and was starting work again yesterday at 6am. There is little evidence that the higher salaries and the grant of share options has turned the technocrats into hedonists. 'After privatisation my salary increased significantly, but I did not buy a bigger house or car. My life did not really change,' said Mr Walter Waring, managing director of Eastern Electricity until 1992. Such modesty is characteristic. Sir Donald Miller formerly of Scottish Power has a yacht but did not bother to upgrade it when he moved off nationalised industry pay. Mr Bellak has a rambling country house in Staffordshire, but he owned it before he joined Severn Trent. Mr Preston, also of Scottish Power, who was taking a day off fishing yesterday, 'has a smaller house in Glasgow than I have', said a colleague, 'and a little cottage in Dumfriesshire'. Mr Townsend pointed out: 'The big difference is when you retire - if you look at the situation under the old regime, we wouldn't have been very well off at all.' Yet, for all their rather mundane aspirations, the executives and directors of the privatised utilities often attract venom. At the political level, the disparity between their good fortune and the misfortune of those made poor by recession is an easy target. In the City there are expressions of unease at their salary levels. 'These companies were privatised on the cheap as the merchant banks did a good job of persuading the government how little they were worth. They were then given an extremely relaxed regulatory regime as privatised monopolies. The directors were given a wodge of share options and the ability to sack people, so they got large increases in their share prices. So everyone's a millionaire,' said a senior fund manager. The executives in the privatised industries would say this is a gross exaggeration. They are not defensive about their pay packages. 'I would never have come here for Pounds 40,000,' asserted Mr Michael Hoffman, chief executive of Thames Water, who joined the company nine months before privatisation. 'And I would never have recruited top people into other positions if the company did not pay them proper competitive salaries.' Attracting top talent through salaries that compete with the private sector has been a crucial issue since the mid-1980s, when the government was seeking to strengthen the management of the state utilities. Often the incoming managers took pay cuts on the assumption that, as the state utilities absorbed private sector practices, the pay position would be redressed. Mr Waring argued that one reason for the pay rises of the past three years was the government's refusal to pay a fair salary in the public sector. It was common for senior staff reporting to him to be paid 10 per cent more than directors. 'There were discussions with government about adjusting salaries before privatisation, but they would not do it,' he recalled. After privatisation, as the water and electricity companies went into the market for new staff, they had to pay market rates. This had a ratcheting effect, as the wages of existing staff were brought into line with the newcomers. The arrival of new staff was only one element of the changes which took place in the state utilities in the period before and immediately after privatisation. 'As a nationalised industry, we had one paymaster. These days we have to explain our strategy and requirements to a wider public,' said Mr John Tysoe, for the last year non-executive chairman of Yorkshire Electricity. That wider public includes shareholders, City institutions such as merchant banks, the regulators and the customer; it is not as cosy as being an old-fashioned water authority. This wider range of functions is offered as one justification by executives for their higher salary rates. They also cite the more complex nature of their business. With finite profits from their regulated, mainstream activities, the companies have been diversifying into unregulated business such as power generation abroad, and waste disposal. So new and wider skills have been required. South West Water hired Mr Keith Court and Mr William Fraser as chairman and managing director just before privatisation. They have not had a pay rise since but, said the company, 'they were recruited for their extensive international business experience to manage huge capital programmes and to deliver to budget and on time. It was understood that, if they could deliver, then the rewards would follow.' What these rewards will be is not clear. In industries where, as Mr Bellak noted, 'different companies are developing different personalities', the levels of payment will remain a source of contentious debate. As they look out of the goldfish bowl, Mr Court and Mr Fraser will know that, in the interests of peace and quiet, they will have to be able to justify every penny in their pay cheques.

The regional electricity companies (recs) outperformed the wider market by 6 per cent. Adding to the general euphoria was a feeling that the companies themselves may embark on a share buy-back spree. Another story boosting sentiment was that a potential stakebuilder in Eastern Electricity had moved into the market shortly before the close on Wednesday, buying nearly 3 per cent of the company in a single deal. A leading analyst at one of the top integrated trading houses in London said the review was 'much better than expected from the market's point of view', and could lead to a short term upturn in share prices of as much as 10 per cent. He added that all the companies had received shareholder permission to buy back their own shares. There was a minor ripple of unease around the market, however, following the emergence of rumours that an investigation had been instigated by the Stock Exchange into possible insider trading by directors of some of the recs. London Electricity was the sector's best performer, leaping 61 to 645p, closely followed by South West, up 52 at 714p, and Southern, 51 higher at 714p. There was widespread speculation that the buyer of a block of 7.7m Eastern Electricity at 704 1/4 p on Wednesday could have been a potential stakebuilder. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was said to have bought the stock for a client. The deal produced an overnight gain of more than Pounds 2.3m for the purchaser. Around the same time on Wednesday an institution bought a block of 1.7m shares in Midlands Electricity at 701 3/4 p. Midlands rose 32 1/2 to 730 1/2 p and Eastern 30 to 739p.

Environmentalists and energy industry advocates have been locked for months in a stalemate that prevented the bill's sponsor, Senator Bennett Johnston from the oil-producing state of Louisiana, from bringing it to the Senate floor. But in a compromise, environmentalists agreed to drop their demand that car makers must raise fuel efficiency on the vehicles they sell, in exchange for abandonment of efforts to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil and gas drilling. The bill passed by 94-4 in the Senate, backed by Mr James Watkins, energy secretary, who said it was a 'substantial milestone' containing 'nothing we can't live with.' Similar legislation is expected to be moved by the House of Representatives energy committee in the next few weeks, paving the way for a bill to be enacted this year. The Senate bill would: Impose new energy efficiency standards on most commercial and residential lamps and electric motors, saving an estimated Dollars 25bn in energy costs over the next 20 years. Promote alternative motor fuels by requiring private and public fleet operators to buy vehicles powered by electricity, solar cells, ethanol or natural gas. By the year 2000, 90 per cent of non-military federal vehicles will have to run on these fuels. Maintain the current ban on oil and gas drilling on the US Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Ease licensing rules for natural gas pipelines, making it easier for gas producers to reach new markets. Allow independent electricity generators to compete in the wholesale electricity market.

0,FT942-2248 ,"FT942-2248 _AN-EFTD4AF3FT 940620   FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (9): Coal squeezed between gas and nuclear - Britain is a battleground between rival fuels for power generation      By MICHAEL SMITH   Central European countries can only dream of the range of fuels available to the UK for electricity generation. But they are less envious of the political problems which result for a government determined to let the market decide on which fuels should be used. There were times in 1992 and 1993 when the very survival of the government seemed threatened by the furious reaction to its decision to close three fifths of the nation's 50 remaining coal mines because of a lack of markets for their products. With that crisis apparently overcome, the government's difficulties in power generation this year centre on a nuclear review which it promised five years ago but has been reluctant to start. It will have to deal with the demands of Nuclear Electric, which with Scottish Nuclear provides virtually all of the UK's nuclear power, that it be privatised and be allowed to build new power stations. Meanwhile, the growth of the use of gas in power production is continuing. Although changes in prices in the England and Wales power trading pool have delayed the building of some stations, gas could take more than 30 per cent of the market by the end of the century, compared with almost nothing in 1990. Some forecasts see gas taking almost all of the market by the year 2001. Many European countries would rule that out because of its implications for security of supplies. The government shows no signs of doubt, saying that if corrections are needed in the fuel supply balance then the market will have plenty of time to make them. Its confidence in its abilities to sort out any problems will have been immeasurably boosted by its resolution of the coal closures crisis which was politically adept. With the closures programme now largely completed - at least while the industry remains in state hands - Britain now has only 16 deep mines (three fewer than were envisaged in its mishandled plan two years ago) aemploying fewer than 10,000 men. That compares with 50 pits and 50,000 men two year ago. Ministers got away with it because their white paper of March 1993 appeared to offer so much. They indicated that several hundred million pounds were available to keep the mines open, but in the event almost nothing has been paid out. What the white paper did was to buy time. Since then a succession of pit closures have been announced, but because they have closed in ones and twos rather than in one large operation there has been far less publicity. The government's defiance of public feelings about pit closures stems in part from its determination to privatise an industry that it believes would be much better run in the private sector. Privatisation is expected to be completed later this year. At its previous size the industry would have been unsellable; the markets were simply not there. The main reason was that the two largest generators in England and Wales cut purchases from 65m tonnes in 1992-3 to 40m tonnes in 1993-4 and 30m tonnes for the following four years. However, the government's argument that the tonnage decline was dictated by the free market is not wholly convincing. The coal is being displaced mainly by new gas plants which will produce electricity at higher prices than existing coal stations. The coal lobby argues that the 'dash for gas' is due to the way the electricity industry was privatised, with the creation of just two large power generators in England and Wales. This would have been less harmful if the government had created vertically integrated generating and distribution companies as it did in Scotland. But in England and Wales, the 12 regional electricity distributors were desperate to lessen their dependence on what they consider to be a duopoly of the two generating companies. Their participation in the dash for gas, in which they helped to build new stations, was prompted by a desire for alternative supplies. National Power and PowerGen were forced to join the gas stampede or see their markets severely squeezed, the argument goes. In energy markets nothing is ever simple. The coal lobbyists tend to forget that the switch to gas is partly prompted by environmental considerations; gas emits much less sulphur dioxide than coal and without it the UK would struggle to meet internationally agreed pollution targets. Nevertheless the government did no favours to the coal industry when it decided to privatise it after completing a sale of the power industry with a less than fully competitive structure. But perhaps the biggest test of the government's free market principles will come in its attitude to the nuclear industry both in this year's review and over the next few years. If the electricity market was truly free then Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear would be told that that they could never build another nuclear station unless they could produce power from it at fully competitive prices. But that would probably mean the beginning of the end for the nation's nuclear power industry, with two companies retaining an ever dwindling share of the market as they decommission ageing stations. Nuclear Electric acknowledged recently that it could only build Sizewell C, its second 2,600MW pressurised water reactor station in Suffolk, if the state provided it with 'material support'. That does not necessarily mean direct aid. It could, for example, be achieved by the government agreeing to meet unforeseen decommissioning costs. Or the government could decide to set aside a specific proportion of the power generation market for the nuclear industry. Any form of support, however, would require the government or consumers to give assistance that they will not be providing to other fuels after 1998. In the review and beyond, the government will face arguments from powerful lobbies, including some of the country's largest companies who want a share of power station contracts, that nuclear power generation should be supported, and soon. If Nuclear Electric is unable to start work on Sizewell C soon, the expertise gained in building Sizewell B, its forerunner, would dissipate, they say. They also argue that Britain would be unable to meet future environmental targets on sulphur and carbon emissions. If the government accepts these arguments it will be accused of abandoning the free market principles it clung to in the coal debate. An inconclusive result to the nuclear review seems likely.

The Chinese side  may reject excessive demands made by foreign parties.    The source told this reporter yesterday that an official in  charge of the State Council had personally taken up the matter  involving a hydropower plant, a Sino-foreign joint venture in  Zhuhai. He instructed that the foreign party's request for an  18 percent return on investment must not be accepted. Later,  the foreign party lowered the return on investment to less than  15 percent, which was accepted by the Chinese side. However,  the State Council pointed out that the case should not be taken  as a precedent.    The source pointed out: ""In recent years, localities have  tried by every means to develop Sino-foreign joint power  projects on a large scale. More than 300 letters of intent and  agreements have been signed over the past three years. However,  only a limited number of projects eventually have proved  successful.""    He continued by saying that some provinces and cities were  overanxious for quick results, accepting the harsh terms  proposed by foreign parties, including high rates of return on  investment. This case has aroused attention of the State  Council.    Owing to a lack of experience during the initial period of  attracting foreign investment in power projects, some southern  provinces accepted the request by a Hong Kong company for a 50  percent return on investment and for fixing the price of coal at  90 yuan per ton for a long term.    According to the source, the State Council, in principle,  has  set the return on investment for foreign parties in Sino-foreign  power project ventures at 11-12 percent. If the foreign party  makes excessive demands, the Chinese side may reject the request.    China's total installed capacity was 167 billion kw by the  end of 1993, and 840 billion kw of electricity was generated  during the year. Of this, 671.5 billion kw was generated by  thermal power plants, 127 billion kw by hydropower plants, and  1.5 billion kw by nuclear power plants.    Last year China invested 52.2 billion yuan in power  construction, newly adding installed capacity of 12 billion kwh.  The state plans to invest 6 million yuan [as published] this  year and the newly installed capacity should be higher than that  in the previous year.    He continued by saying that the per capita consumption of  electricity in mainland China is 600 kwh, while the figure is  over 5,000 kwh in the United States and over 2,000 kwh in Hong  Kong, Japan, and Britain.    To meet the standard of intermediate-level developing  countries, where the per capita consumption of electricity is  1,000 kwh, he said, China will have to increase its installed  capacity to 1.2 billion kwh.    To vigorously develop power construction in the future, the  source said, China will pay equal attention to thermal,  hydropower, and nuclear power. At present, China is now  selecting sites along the coast for building nuclear power  plants. He continued by saying that high growth has been  registered in China's economy and industry. For this reason, it  is imperative to develop energy. On the premise of rationality  and mutual benefit, China is willing to cooperate with investors  from all countries to build more power plants in China.    He pointed out that progress has been smooth for the Zhuhai  power plant, built by Zhuhai in cooperation with Hong Kong's  Cheung Kong and other corporations. A number of large thermal  power plants will be open to foreign investment, and tenders  will be invited from all countries very soon.     "

Power stations are one of the main causes of air pollution in Europe. Moreover, they cause a diplomatically troublesome kind of pollution which can travel thousands of miles across national boundaries. The Green Party in Germany grew out of public rage that acid rain from abroad was withering Germany's beloved forests. The surge in public support for environmental campaigns in the late 1980s across much of Europe was also stimulated by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear explosion in Ukraine. Public concern has prompted many attempts at curbing pollution from electricity generation. However, these initiatives have proved controversial; even those governments which most fervently support controls have also been reluctant to relinquish their right to set energy policy without reference to their neighbours. According to the European Commission, around two thirds of emissions of sulphur dioxide in Western Europe come from power stations or domestic heating. Power stations also pump out about a fifth of emissions of nitrogen oxides in these countries. Both 'sox' and 'nox', as these collections of gases are known, can cause acid rain. They can retard plant growth, and cause skin and eye irritations and breathing difficulties in people. Power stations burning coal, oil and gas are also responsible for about a third of the emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the main gases implicated in the threat of global warming. Most European countries have signed up to two main rafts of regulation to tackle these threats. The Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention, drawn up in 1983, is a package of protocols directed primarily at sox and nox. Countries have negotiated separately on each of these protocols. In addition, at the end of last year, the European Union collectively ratified the climate change convention agreed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. Under the treaty, the EU must bring emissions of carbon dioxide back to 1990 levels in the year 2000. That will mean a cut of some 12 per cent on projected levels, the Commission estimates. European countries have assembled a range of tools to try and reach these targets. To combat sulphur emissions some such as Germany, and to a lesser extent the UK, have fitted power stations with flue gas desulphurisation. Before the Rio summit, European Union countries also drew up proposals for an energy tax of Dollars 10 a barrel of oil-equivalent, weighted towards those fuels with highest carbon content. However, the proposals have stalled because of worries about the impact on international competitiveness, and about political controversy. The UK government, which last year walked into one of its stormiest political rows when it imposed value added tax on domestic heating fuel, has been particularly unwilling to contemplate a further, Brussels-imposed hike in the price of fuel. France, which generates more than two thirds of its electricity from nuclear power, has also protested that the nuclear power should be exempt from the tax as it does not emit carbon dioxide, sox or nox. European Union countries have also drawn up an energy conservation programme called SAVE - specific actions for vigorous energy efficiency. The programme wants to urge higher energy efficiency standards on the building and car industries. However, momentum behind these has also slowed, partly because recession reduced the rate of construction and new design, Commission officials suggest. Despite those obstacles, there has been improvement on some of the fronts. However, there are many signs that this is due to wider industrial changes, rather than the success of the anti-pollution measures. While EU data is incomplete, Commission figures show a steady decline in sulphur emissions during the 1970s and 1980s, by roughly 20 per cent overall. In its 1992 overview of the state of the environment in the EU, the Commission comments that this fall is 'due mainly to the energy-saving measures taken in response to the 1973 and 1978 oil shocks and industrial restructuring' as well as to adoption of new anti-pollution regulations. It notes that 'since the mid-1980s emissions have been falling at a slower rate'. Nox has proved a tougher battle. While measures to control pollution from power stations and other industry have had some success, 'the reductions in emissions .. are more than offset by the increases in the number of vehicles on the road. The net result is that nox emissions are still rising in many countries,' the report says. While carbon emissions have been growing more slowly than expected, for instance in the UK, this is largely due to recession, environmentalists warn. Commission officials suggest privately that further improvements may follow that pattern: due less to specific measures than to structural changes within Europe, such as east German modernisation, or the UK's switch from coal to gas in power generation. Equally, future energy policy changes - for example, if the UK decided to phase out nuclear power in the recently-launched review of the industry - could counteract the effect of measures to curb air pollution. The environmental impact of electricity generation is likely to continue to be politically contentious. But while there may well continue to be environmental improvement, the driving force is likely to be the economic and industrial changes in Europe as much as purely 'green' concerns.

By early May, Guangxi had investigated a total of 1,427  price-related cases, confiscated illicit incomes totaling 27.62  million yuan, handled a total of 1,043 price-related cases, and  collected price-related fines totaling 2.4 million yuan.    In view of a series of problems exposed during the region's  commodities prices examination, including an unbalanced  crackdown on price-related cases, ineffective measures against  price-related cases, slack regulation and control of daily  necessities and services prices, and so on, the regional  people's government held a regional prices examination work  conference in Nanning on 9 June.    Liu Xueyue, regional people's government secretary general,  said in his speech to the conference that the second-stage of  the regional commodities prices examination will be directed at  certain basic daily necessities, production means, and services  prices, including grain, chemical fertilizer, agricultural goods  and materials, electricity, and so on.    With regard to grain and other basic necessity prices, Liu  noted that conscientious efforts should be made to implement the  state grain prices reform plan and relevant measures, market  prices control measures, and so on. The whole region should  strictly control price hikes, especially those relating to bus  and train fares; prohibit enterprises and operators from raising  chemical fertilizer prices, agricultural goods and materials  prices, and electricity prices without state approval; and  prohibit enterprises and operators from altering state guidance  prices as well as other prices set by the state, such as, prices  set by the State Council or the regional people's government.  Moreover, Liu stated that the whole region should strive to  implement to the letter a series of preferential prices set by  the state for farm and sideline products and prohibit relevant  units from raising basic services prices, such as, rent, water  prices, electricity prices, bus fares, and telephone charges.

An on-going meeting on national rural hydropower  construction  revealed that 14 out of 200 counties selected to undergo full  electrification by the State Council in 1991 have now attained  the goal ahead of time.    Over the past three years, rural areas of the country have  added a generating capacity of 3.77 million kilowatts, according  to the meeting.    Also, the total generating capacity of waterpower projects  which are now under construction is expected to reach about 9.6  million kilowatts this year.    Controls on electricity prices for users on rural hydropower  networks have been lifted, and newly-built power stations have  adopted a new price system of capital repayment with interest.    According to the meeting, the nation's total investment in  waterpower construction in 1993 was seven billion yuan.    It also said that agricultural banks throughout the country  provided loans of 8.64 million yuan to build medium- and  small-sized power stations, 6,855 of which have been put into  operation and more than 400 of which are still under  construction.    The focus of the hydro-power construction drive over the  past  few years has been on the development of local electricity  networks and joint stock companies.    More than 40 trans-county regional companies have been set  up, and nearly 150 companies have been reorganized or rebuilt in  line with the share-holding system or joint stock system.    The electrification in recent years has boosted economic  development in rural areas, in mountainous areas in particular.    The average area of irrigated land per capita in the  initially electrified counties increased to nearly half a  hectare, with an average grain output per capita reaching more  than 360 kilograms, according to the meeting.    The electrification drive enabled 33.2 million farmers in  poverty-stricken mountainous areas to use electricity, the  meeting said.     "

Manweb and East Midlands Electricity have been test-marketing supplies from Alliance Gas, a joint venture between British Petroleum, Statoil of Norway and Norsk Hydro. Manweb yesterday signed a contract with Alliance to take up to Pounds 50m of gas over the next three years. Alliance yesterday said it would buy gas from the Viking field, about 70 miles off the Lincolnshire coast in the southern half of the North Sea. It is taking half the field's production from BP Exploration, which has equal shares in the field with Conoco, the operator. East Midlands is talking to Alliance about extending its experimental deal, while Alliance is also pushing ahead with direct sales to industry. Mr Kris Maroe, Alliance Gas's managing director, yesterday forecast total sales of Pounds 100m a year by December. Domestic sales are not yet open to competition, but Manweb said it was confident it could become 'a major player' should British Gas's monopoly end. Manweb's gas customers include Marks and Spencer Financial Services, based in Cheshire; Chester and Liverpool city councils; Greater Manchester Police and ICI Runcorn. Initial contact was through electricity sales liaison staff who passed leads to gas specialists, the number of whom is to increase from three to five. Some sales are in the south of England to branches of national companies based in the north-west. Manweb pays British Gas for use of pipelines, the fee taking into account the distance pumped and maintenance, although the gas involved comes from a common supply into which British Gas and independent suppliers feed. Alliance's gas comes from the North Sea, but Manweb has also been able to bid successfully at auction for some excess British Gas supplies from its Morecambe Bay field, cutting distribution costs to north-west customers.

James is her own voice, creating her own tradition. Her writing does have  echoes of a longer, Victorian tradition: the spacious novel with its loving  attention to environments and atmospheres, the delineation of character (which  Christie tended to skim over with telegraphic speed) and the conveying of  nuance in relationships and moments. ""Devices and Desires"" is a comfortably  spacious 424 pages long, as tidy and well-furnished as a Victorian parlor.    Her continuing protagonist, the poet-detective Adam Dalgliesh, a sensitive  loner touched with sadness, has brought out a new, slim volume of verse and,  resisting his publisher's desire to push it like a candy bar, has retreated to  the Norfolk coast to compose his soul in a converted windmill he has inherited,  with a sizable sum of money, from a beloved, bird-watching aunt.    James' descriptions of the Norfolk coastline in its remote, spare beauty, quite  unlike the overdeveloped littoral elsewhere, appears to be born of close  familiarity and abiding love. It is lovely to read about.    Dalgliesh's only chore is to deliver proofs of a cookbook to its local author.  It is enough to embroil him reluctantly in the local scene. The author is the  sister of a man who directs a nuclear-power station near the sea. The station  is under a publicity assault generated by an earnest, penniless young man who  lives nearby and is sheltering a homeless mother and child.    A serial killer of young women, whom the media has named the Whistler, is  stalking the vicinity (James is very good at evoking the horror of the  confrontations) and Dalgliesh is sought out by a former London colleague who  now heads the local CID and who regards Dalgliesh with a mixture of respect and  scarcely muted resentment. (James is very, very good at the shoals and  cross-currents of relationships.)    The large dramatis personae includes the director's ambitious assistant, whom  he is attempting to phase out as his mistress, too; a retired clergyman, his  wife and the nice young woman who looks out for them; a free-spirited painter  attempting, with the help of a beguiling and precocious daughter, to care for  his motherless brood; and various boffins and stenos from the power-plant  staff.    The director's assistant is murdered, seemingly the latest victim of the  Whistler. But it turns out that the Whistler had been nabbed not long before  the killing, and a key question is: Who knew, Who didn't? Even Dalgliesh is at  least briefly a suspect; the victim was found at the shore, not far from the  windmill. (""I suspect everyone . . . and no one,"" a sleuth once remarked.)    As Greyhound used to say, getting there (in this case to the solution) is half  the fun. In ""Designs and Desires,"" as in many mysteries, it is substantially  more than half the fun. It is an irony particularly applicable to James that  the more extensive the scene-settings and the more (Henry) Jamesian the  characterizations, the more rickety and anti-climactic the denouement can seem.    The detecting of who did in the assistant is intricate and professional, and  although it mounts to what used to be called a sock finish (and fiery as well),  it also feels oddly perfunctory, like a grand opera built around a visit to  Disneyland.    As if she were aware that the atmospheres (even the evidence of careful  research about the perils and controversies attending nuclear power) were not  enough, James has attached a subplot, involving a pair of minor-league  terrorists at the plant, that is arbitrary and owes more to the work of  Alistair MacLean, say, than to her own sensitive interpretations of present  society.    She is not a poet of the abnormal, like her nearest rival, Ruth Rendell, who  peers into the darkest recesses of the aberrant psyche as no one else does. But  James is in her own right a poet of, perhaps, more universal men and women and  especially those whose lives are touched with crime and death.    This is James on Terry Rickards, Dalgliesh's touchy colleague: ""Dalgliesh  thought of him as a type of police officer less common than formerly but still  not rare; the conscientious and incorruptible detective of limited imagination  and somewhat greater intelligence who had never supposed that the evil of the  world should be condoned because it was frequently inexplicable and its  perpetrators unfortunate.""    This is Dalgliesh -- on the same page; Rickards' wife is expecting momentarily  -- remembering his wife and son who died at childbirth: ""His memory of her,  which for years, a traitor to grief and their love, he had resolutely tried to  suppress because the pain had seemed unbearable, had gradually been replaced by  a boyish, romantic dream of gentleness and beauty now fixed forever beyond the  depredation of time. His newborn son's face he could still recall vividly and  sometimes did in his dreams, that white unsullied look of sweet, knowledgeable  contentment, as if, in a brief moment of life, he had seen and known all there  was to know, seen it and rejected it.""

0,FT933-8634 ,"FT933-8634 _AN-DHPABAB2FT 930814   FT  14 AUG 93 / Letter: Squeeze on coal market has gone too far      From Mr A D J HORSLER   Sir, In Tony Jackson's article ('No more buried treasure', August 9) there is much tilting at windmills and a key point is missed. This is that a strong case exists for believing that the squeeze on the market for UK coal has gone too far. Many of the gas stations replacing coal-fired generation, however financially attractive to their investors, are doubtfully economic in national resource terms, as the trade and industry select committee has pointed out, once pricing rivalries in the electricity sector are set aside. Magnox stations may or may not be very cheap on an avoidable cost basis - but how long will they continue? Further nuclear investment is likely to cost a great deal more, despite claims to the contrary. So the right size of the UK coal industry in national economic terms may well be larger than the shorter-term market pressure will support at present. Mr Jackson's argument that we can find out by 'letting each pit operate as a separate commercial entity' ignores the strong interaction between pits in market quality and in mining terms, as well as the market power issue to which he alludes. The 'transitional arrangements' that Mr Jackson suggests provide the ground for the present contracts with electricity generators, and for the government's temporary subsidy arrangement if market volume would allow that to function. With the continuing reduction in operating costs of deep mines, British Coal expects to compete fully with imported coal at inland power stations by the mid-1990s. The pressing argument is about how many deep mines would be competitive at that time, but would not be given a chance to be so, given current pressure on volumes from other fuels enjoying more effective protection in the power station market.

With 10 new hydroelectric dam projects planned, which aim to  produce about 1,300 MW of electricity at a cost of billions of  dollars, the issue of preserving the environment and avoiding  the mistakes of the past is becoming more important to Laos, he  said.    Feasibility studies for most of the projects have been  completed. Most of their output will be sold to Vietnam and  Thailand. The investment cost per unit of hydroelectric power  is lower than that of plants using other types of fuel.    Mr Phao said Laos will be a significant energy source in  Southeast Asia because it has enormous mineral deposits and  potential for hydroelectric power. Laos aims to protect its  forests, so only private firms that want to protect and revive  the environment will be welcome.    Vatthana Pathoumvan, manager of the Electricite Du Laos  (EDL)  hydroelectric station at Nam Ngum, said feasibility studies will  be completed next year, so no details are yet available.    However, he said, construction depends on the demand for  electricity in neighbouring countries, especially Thailand. Of  the 220 MW of hydroelectric power generated by Laos, 70 percent  is sold to Thailand.    Apart from the Sedone I and II projects in Pakse province,  which are being undertaken by Korean firms, Thai MDX Co is  undertaking feasibility studies of the Nam Ngum II and III  projects.    The executive manager of EDL, Ungreun Pakan, said the  Laotian  Government is concerned about environmental problems because it  had trouble during the first stage of Nam Ngum I.    However, Laos is lucky that it has low population growth, so  the government has no problems moving people to make way for  construction of power plants, he claimed.     "

0,FT923-10244 ,"FT923-10244 _AN-CG4BOADVFT 920731   FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (9): When cleanest is cheapest - Environmental example from the Mongolian plains      By VIC WYMAN, of The Engineer   WHEN IT comes to technology, backward societies are sometimes more advanced than those of developed countries. In a number of other poor countries, machines are used every day to renewable sources such as the wind, the sun and flowing water into electricity and heat. In cattle-rich Mongolia, for example, a study is taking place, with United Nations backing, of small, portable 'digesters' that produce valuable methane gas from animal waste. The Mongolian demand for renewables led to the import of of several hundred small solar cell units, rated at about 60 W, supplied from the US, Europe and China. Western demand for renewable energy has prompted ambitious schemes such as large 1 MW wind turbines, being developed to satisfy the rising demand for base-load electricity. They are intended to compete with conventional power plants burning fossil fuels such as coal, and with nuclear power. The technologies and the markets are far from mature. Yet by 1987 renewables were already supplying an estimated 6 per cent of the world's primary energy, equivalent to the energy from 476m tonnes of oil. Most of that was from large hydroelectricity schemes. By 1990 the world already contained an estimated 20,000 wind turbines, one of the most developed of the renewables, feeding an annual 3.2bn kWh of electricity into power grids. Europe has about a quarter of the installed wind power capacity. Yet all renewables will become increasingly important. 'Worldwide development of renewable energy systems on a large scale will be necessary in the future, due to the inevitable and accelerated exhaustion of reserves of fossil fuels,' says the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Renewables promise a reduced dependence on imported fuels, a diversification in power supply to improve energy security, and the freeing of finite fossil fuels such as oil for premium uses such as processing into valuable commodities. Over the past couple of years the clean nature of renewables has added to their attraction. Burning fossil fuels releases the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) that has been locked up in the fuel for millions of years. Renewables, however, usually draw on the less polluting physical effects of the sun, such as the wind. And the CO2 released by biofuels renewables, including the burning of straw and trees, was taken from the atmosphere only a few years previously. The European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) says that about a third of CO2 emissions are from electricity generation. 'For every 1 per cent of electricity generation capacity which is displaced by renewable energy, a 0.3 per cent reduction in total CO2 emission is therefore obtained,' it says. That is a cut of 15m tonnes a year in the European Community alone. There would also be large reductions in the emissions of other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxides that contribute to acid rain, and 1m tonnes less power station slag and ash whose disposal is becoming increasingly expensive and contentious. The EWEA says that only if renewables are combined with more efficient use of energy will the developed world meet its targets for controlling pollution. Yet renewables have their own environmental problems, including noise and visual obtrusiveness. The latter bedevils wind power. 'The undoubted benefits of renewable energy sources must not blind us to their environmental costs,' warns the Council for the Protection of Rural England. The growth of renewables promises plenty of business for manufacturers, and operating and maintenance jobs. The EWEA says that the bulk of the wind turbines will probably be built in Europe which is home to most of the world's 30 or so established producers. They include respected engineering concerns such as MAN of Germany and the UK's British Aerospace, and little known but successful small Danish companies. Outside Europe the two big wind turbine manufacturers are US Windpower and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan. Many countries are committed to renewables. The European Commission, which is funding research and development, says small hydroelectric units could provide 2-3 per cent of the European Community's electricity and solar power 1-2% of its total energy, mostly as heating. Denmark, one of the world's leading wind power countries, produces about 2 per cent of its electricity from turbines, with a target of 10 per cent by the turn of the century. Yet kick-starting a renewables market is not easy. And the sheer size and cost of large wave and tidal power schemes, such as a proposed Pounds 1.1bn tidal barrage in the UK's Mersey estuary, make their construction unlikely. In Europe, subsidies for renewables installations have been backed by stimulants such as tax relief on investments or earnings, and premium payments for the power produced. Denmark, for example, introduced a 30 per cent private turbine installation subsidy that disappeared in 1989 as the technology improved. Such schemes are, however, open to abuse and costly to run. And although the UK government has provided Pounds 180m for renewables research and development since 1979, and currently subsidises the electricity from installations, it is unclear whether it will meet its target of 1,000 MW of renewables, or 2 per cent of the UK's generating capacity, in place by the turn of the century. Critics say this is a fraction of the potential and that renewables should receive more in subsidy than the current 1 per cent of the Pounds 1.2bn being collected this year from the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) levy on electricity from fossil fuels. The balance supports nuclear power. The NFFO subsidy is also due to end in 1998, which critics say is far too soon for relatively unproved renewables to provide a return for investors. Technical studies point to 20 year lives for wind turbines although large machines have yet to clock up that sort of lifetime. There is also the cautionary tale of the UK company Howden which lost Pounds 13.2m as a result of problems on turbines it supplied to California. In 1989 Howden pulled out of the market. The turbine market should, however, be helped by the current development of international standards that investors will be able to trust. The UK government now intends to review its renewables strategy after the completion of an independent study in the autumn. Yet the UK's unsettled approach to renewables is not fundamentally different from that of other industrialised countries. The hurdles for renewables are many and the technologies in many cases have yet to prove economic. However, like is not being compared with like, as few economies allocate the true cost of the pollution from burning fuels, for example. As countries move towards more sophisticated energy and environmental pricing, typified by the energy and carbon tax proposals from the European Commission, the renewables market could get a new wind.

As a result, southwest China is soon to become China's  premier hydroelectric power base, according to deputies to the  National People's Congress [NPC] now in session here who hail  from southwest China's Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces and  Guangxi Autonomous Region.    Sixty-five giant hydropower stations will form ""electric  corridors"" along the region's main rivers of Jinshajiang,  Yalongjiang, Daduhe, Lanchangjiang, Wujiang and Hongshuihe.  Their power will be fed to a local grid, which in turn will  transmit power to Guangdong in south China and to east China.    Southwest China has exploitable hydropower resources of 194  million kw, 572000060100f the national total.    According to Wang Zhaobang, an NPC deputy from Guangxi and a  hydropower expert, 11 power stations have been completed or are  under construction in southwest China, which will generate 51.9  billion kwh [kilowatt-hours] of electricity a year.    Another seven giant stations will be built in the area  during  the last five years of this century, he disclosed. Those  stations will have a combined generating capacity of 20 million  kw.    When all the 65 hydropower stations are completed, they will  generate 631 billion kwh of electricity a year.    One newly-completed station in Guangxi has already started  supplying power to Guangdong Province, according to He Rong, an  NPC deputy from Guangxi.    ""This marks the start of implementing a state plan to  transmit power from southwest China to east China,"" he said.    Local electric power authorities have opened the door to  overseas investment in hydropower development. The three  provinces and one autonomous region have signed a dozen  contracts with companies from the United States, Thailand and  Hong Kong on the construction of hydropower stations and power  grids. They have also received over one billion U.S. dollars in  loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank,  according to the deputies.     "

The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based group of industrialised countries, yesterday gave its blessing to the laisser-faire stance - often denounced as a 'non-policy'. It says in a review that while Britain's energy policy does not have targets and prescriptions, 'it is based on a clearly articulated principle of reliance on market forces'. Moreover, 'the overall direction of UK energy policy can be commended as consistent with the IEA shared goals' of open and free markets. The UK experience could be useful to other members of the IEA who are restructuring largely state-owned energy industries. The accolade was accepted gratefully by the government. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said: 'I welcome this endorsement of our liberalisation policy. The UK is pleased to be in the vanguard of change and a model for others to follow.' The IEA was not wholly unreserved in its praise. It said there were still imperfections in the gas and electricity markets and urged action to remove restrictions on the movement of oil and gas. The government could do more to raise energy efficiency and improve the environment, particularly by ensuring that the transport sector bore its share of energy costs. Mr Eggar said that many of the IEA's criticisms were already being acted on. The IEA reviews members' energy policies every four years. The UK review will be published later this year. The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for Europe to press ahead with opening up its gas and electricity networks to competition as 'part of the drive to restore Europe's international competitiveness'. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said Europe needed an internal energy market which gave businesses the freedom to shop around. He said some of the largest users were in industries such as chemicals which competed in tough international markets where energy costs had a strong bearing on success.

Taxpayers may still have to pay up to Pounds 2.9bn to enable Britain's ageing Magnox reactors to be taken out of service, the 100-page report, by the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University, says. The study was commissioned by the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee, which advises it on the methods and costs of dealing with civil nuclear waste. The high and unpredictable costs of decommissioning nuclear sites have been one of the nuclear industry's greatest headaches. The uncertainty was the main reason for the withdrawal of the nuclear industry from the 1989 electricity privatisation. The National Audit Office has estimated that future decommissioning could eventually cost Pounds 18bn and that the taxpayer might have to foot the bill as well as the nuclear industry. The research unit report says that annual provisions of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 5m for new plants could be sufficient to pay for their eventual decommissioning. It points out that this is a small proportion of the income of Pounds 200m a year which a typical plant generating 1100MW might earn. Accurate estimates, however, are hard to make until 'real progress is made' towards the construction of a store for nuclear waste. The fund would not solve the problem of decommissioning the Magnox reactors, the report says. 'Over a decade's worth of provisions were effectively 'lost' at privatisation of the electricity industry and expected decommissioning costs have risen rapidly in real terms over the last decade.' In a separate report the advisory committee says: 'Government could be the guardian of the fund but public confidence might be enhanced if the fund was truly independent and retained for the sole purpose of decommissioning plant.'

For color television sets, life-cycle costs at all standard levels are less than the baseline unit. Of the three candidate standard levels, a unit meeting level 3 has the lowest consumer life-cycle cost. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1.     However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the average consumer of $10.97, standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $14.52, and standard level 3 by $24.06. The lower life-cycle costs indicate that no standard level would cause any economic burden on the average consumer. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2.     While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little impact, the Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in financing the purchase of television sets. Similarly, DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate.     The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $0.64 billion to consumers.

There was not a piece of art to be seen in the industrial city -- unless you  appreciate the stark outlines of oil derricks and massive storage tanks.    Now there are two sculptures -- and counting.    On Tuesday, city officials dedicated ""Undone Abstraction"" by Claremont artist  James Mitchell in a half-acre triangle of city park on Pioneer Boulevard east  of Alburtis Avenue. The steel-slab sculpture, six feet high on a two-foot base,  is the latest product of a year-old ordinance. It requires builders to donate  an amount equal to 1% of their project cost toward public art for developments  of at least $1 million.    The city's first piece of public artwork, Utah artist Dennis Smith's sculpture  of a little girl reading, was dedicated about a month ago in front of the city  library in the town center.    The public art ordinance symbolizes an ambitious exercise in image-changing for  this town with only 15,000 residents, but more than 3,000 businesses, including  two oil refineries and a pair of hazardous waste sites.    Two years ago, the city opened Heritage Park, a $4-million project. The  6.5-acre park contains the ruins of a 19th Century estate as well as its  restored Victorian gardens, which in the 1880s put Santa Fe Springs on the map,  city officials say. Also restored are a carriage barn, an English-style  greenhouse and a windmill irrigation system.    Within the last year, the city also has opened to the public the Clarke estate,  a long-forgotten 8,000-square-foot, turn-of-the-century mansion that the city  bought and restored for $3.5 million.    The mansion's original owners departed in the 1920s about the same time as the  city's ranching image, when geologists discovered what was then the  sixth-largest known reserve of oil in the world, said Margaret Hammon, the  city's cultural-resource specialist.    The oil boom turned Santa Fe Springs into a dirty, sprawling, bustling,  unincorporated company town surrounded by vast open spaces, where orange groves  shared fields with oil rigs. But as the crude reserves dwindled, the  nine-square-mile city, incorporated in 1957, has found itself with plenty of  real estate to offer.    ""The welcome mat is out,"" City Manager Don Powell said of the city's well-known  pro-business stance, which has attracted $60 million in developments annually  for the last five years. Most of the city is zoned for heavy industry, and the  city typically puts approval of industrial projects on the fast track.    Although there was no artist behind it, the landscape of heavy industry owns a  beauty of its own, said Hammon, who has master's degrees in fine arts and  public administration. On Carmenita Road below Imperial Highway, there remains  a refinery on the east and dozens of huge storage tanks on the west side of the  street. ""At night, you should drive down that street,"" she said. ""It's just  beautiful. It's an interesting, glorious sight to see all those tanks lit.""    In recent years, city officials and staff decided that local residents should  benefit more directly from this commercial vitality. Hammon said the city's  landscaped median strips and railway overpasses have long been a source of  local pride. But City Manager Powell decided those enhancements were not enough  and circulated the public art ordinance idea, which he said is modeled after  similar regulations in Brea, Norwalk and Paramount.    The program in Brea, another former oil town, has resulted in the creation of  91 works of art since 1975. The rate now is about six a year.    The works in Santa Fe Springs must reflect one or more of three historical  periods: Mexican/Indian, turn-of-the-century ranching or industrial modern.    Although only two pieces of art have been created so far, the Santa Fe Springs  project has outproduced, by two, a similar program in Los Angeles. There, the  City Council approved its own version of the ordinance in November, 1988, but a  concern over possible lawsuits from developers has delayed its start, said Jane  Kolb, a spokesperson for the city's Cultural Affairs Department.    No such legal challenge was forthcoming from Jeffery Potter, the 36-year-old  president of Potter Development Corp. Potter paid for the latest sculpture so  he could build his just-completed, office-warehouse structure.    Potter collects contemporary California art for his home and office. ""It's like  a little museum,"" he said of his Los Angeles corporate headquarters. ""I never  have enough art.""    For a city with about 175,000 fewer pieces of artwork than the Los Angeles  County Museum of Art, the match was perfect.    Potter could have placed the sculpture in front of his building, but agreed to  the more accessible Pioneer Boulevard site, which is flanked by businesses on  one side and a neighborhood of modest, boxy houses on the other. Potter, whose  brief, prepared remarks at the ceremony Tuesday were partly drowned out by a  parking 18-wheeler, said he hoped the traffic from both communities would enjoy  the red and black painted sculpture. The developer, who said he long wanted to  be an artist himself, contributed about $10,000 more to the artwork's creation  than the $14,000 the city required.    Artist Mitchell's work consists of two rectangular boxes balanced at about  45-degree angles and connected by a circular joint. The 33-year-old Claremont  artist, who has sold sculptures across the country, said in a later interview  that his work represents an exercise in volume and space rather than message,  but Mitchell noted a persistent theme in the labors of city officials.

There was not a piece of art to be seen in the industrial city -- unless you  appreciate the stark outlines of oil derricks and massive storage tanks.    Now there are two sculptures -- and counting.    On Tuesday, city officials dedicated ""Undone Abstraction"" by Claremont artist  James Mitchell in a half-acre triangle of city park on Pioneer Boulevard east  of Alburtis Avenue. The steel-slab sculpture, six feet high on a two-foot base,  is the latest product of a year-old ordinance. It requires builders to donate  an amount equal to 1% of their project cost toward public art for developments  of at least $1 million.    The city's first piece of public artwork, Utah artist Dennis Smith's sculpture  of a little girl reading, was dedicated about a month ago in front of the city  library in the town center.    The public art ordinance symbolizes an ambitious exercise in image-changing for  this town with only 15,000 residents, but more than 3,000 businesses, including  two oil refineries and a pair of hazardous waste sites.    Two years ago, the city opened Heritage Park, a $4-million project. The  6.5-acre park contains the ruins of a 19th Century estate as well as its  restored Victorian gardens, which in the 1880s put Santa Fe Springs on the map,  city officials say. Also restored are a carriage barn, an English-style  greenhouse and a windmill irrigation system.    Within the last year, the city also has opened to the public the Clarke estate,  a long-forgotten 8,000-square-foot, turn-of-the-century mansion that the city  bought and restored for $3.5 million.    The mansion's original owners departed in the 1920s about the same time as the  city's ranching image, when geologists discovered what was then the  sixth-largest known reserve of oil in the world, said Margaret Hammon, the  city's cultural-resource specialist.    The oil boom turned Santa Fe Springs into a dirty, sprawling, bustling,  unincorporated company town surrounded by vast open spaces, where orange groves  shared fields with oil rigs. But as the crude reserves dwindled, the  nine-square-mile city, incorporated in 1957, has found itself with plenty of  real estate to offer.    ""The welcome mat is out,"" City Manager Don Powell said of the city's well-known  pro-business stance, which has attracted $60 million in developments annually  for the last five years. Most of the city is zoned for heavy industry, and the  city typically puts approval of industrial projects on the fast track.    Although there was no artist behind it, the landscape of heavy industry owns a  beauty of its own, said Hammon, who has master's degrees in fine arts and  public administration. On Carmenita Road below Imperial Highway, there remains  a refinery on the east and dozens of huge storage tanks on the west side of the  street. ""At night, you should drive down that street,"" she said. ""It's just  beautiful. It's an interesting, glorious sight to see all those tanks lit.""    In recent years, city officials and staff decided that local residents should  benefit more directly from this commercial vitality. Hammon said the city's  landscaped median strips and railway overpasses have long been a source of  local pride. But City Manager Powell decided those enhancements were not enough  and circulated the public art ordinance idea, which he said is modeled after  similar regulations in Brea, Norwalk and Paramount.    The program in Brea, another former oil town, has resulted in the creation of  91 works of art since 1975. The rate now is about six a year.    The works in Santa Fe Springs must reflect one or more of three historical  periods: Mexican/Indian, turn-of-the-century ranching or industrial modern.    Although only two pieces of art have been created so far, the Santa Fe Springs  project has outproduced, by two, a similar program in Los Angeles. There, the  City Council approved its own version of the ordinance in November, 1988, but a  concern over possible lawsuits from developers has delayed its start, said Jane  Kolb, a spokesperson for the city's Cultural Affairs Department.    No such legal challenge was forthcoming from Jeffery Potter, the 36-year-old  president of Potter Development Corp. Potter paid for the latest sculpture so  he could build his just-completed, office-warehouse structure.    Potter collects contemporary California art for his home and office. ""It's like  a little museum,"" he said of his Los Angeles corporate headquarters. ""I never  have enough art.""    For a city with about 175,000 fewer pieces of artwork than the Los Angeles  County Museum of Art, the match was perfect.    Potter could have placed the sculpture in front of his building, but agreed to  the more accessible Pioneer Boulevard site, which is flanked by businesses on  one side and a neighborhood of modest, boxy houses on the other. Potter, whose  brief, prepared remarks at the ceremony Tuesday were partly drowned out by a  parking 18-wheeler, said he hoped the traffic from both communities would enjoy  the red and black painted sculpture. The developer, who said he long wanted to  be an artist himself, contributed about $10,000 more to the artwork's creation  than the $14,000 the city required.    Artist Mitchell's work consists of two rectangular boxes balanced at about  45-degree angles and connected by a circular joint. The 33-year-old Claremont  artist, who has sold sculptures across the country, said in a later interview  that his work represents an exercise in volume and space rather than message,  but Mitchell noted a persistent theme in the labors of city officials.    ""When you think of Santa Fe Springs, it's always oil derricks, industrial  factories and railroad yards,"" he said. ""They are trying to improve their  image. The art program is one step in that direction.""

The recently published results of Nuclear Electric paint a rather grim picture of that company's economic future. Take away the subsidy of more than Pounds 1.2bn received each year from the electricity consumer, and Nuclear Electric made an operating loss of Pounds 783m in the financial year 1991-1992, and Pounds 661m in 1992-1993, while at the same time stacking up new liabilities for waste and decommissioning of almost Pounds 1.2bn (to be added to the existing liabilities of almost Pounds 20bn). Meanwhile, it is not just the environmentalists who are pointing out the potential of energy efficiency and renewable energy. In 1989, the Department of Energy identified cost effective energy savings potential of 30 per cent, with a pay-back period of less than five years. Analysis of data from the government's Energy Efficiency Office, submitted to the government's recent review of the coal industry, shows that investment in nuclear power is only one quarter as effective in reducing C0 as the poorest of the energy efficiency measures examined. Money spent on nuclear power is only just over half as effective as modern renewable technologies such as wind power in reducing C0 emissions. Fully one third of the C0 reductions are available at negative costs. If the UK is serious about reducing C0 emissions, the first item on its 'green' agenda must be to put an end to waste; not just the waste of energy, but the waste of money on dangerously polluting and massively expensive technologies such as nuclear power.

And the Crawley-based company linked the results to further benefits for its customers, which it valued at Pounds 22m. Seeboard, which serves south-east England, reported profits for the six months to September 30 of Pounds 33.5m (Pounds 36.3m) after a Pounds 12.8m charge for a premium paid to redeem Pounds 54m of government debt ahead of time. Turnover was Pounds 509.3m (Pounds 534.3m). The interim dividend is raised to 4p (3.3p) from earnings per share of 9.1p (10.15p). Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said the results reflected the cost reductions which Seeboard had achieved over the last 18 months through job cuts and greater efficiency. The dividend increase was 'generous, but we can afford to pay it, and we're doing the customers proud too'. Seeboard will be reducing its quarterly standing charge by Pounds 2.50 or 20 per cent from next February. It will also pay each customer a special rebate of Pounds 1 out of the interest earned on the Pounds 70m received in VAT prepayments earlier this year. Other improvements include an increase in the direct debit discount from Pounds 3 to Pounds 4, and a free bill-paying service through the post office. Although Seeboard is obliged by the new price regulations to cut prices for its customers next year, Sir Keith said these measures would deliver the benefits 'ahead of time'. Since privatisation in 1989, he said Seeboard customers had seen a 16 per cent reduction in electricity bills in real terms. Among the divisional operations, the distribution business made an operating profit of Pounds 43.6m (Pounds 39.3m). The supply business reported a reduced loss of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 6.7m), while in the retail, contracting and gas sales businesses, improved trading margins led to better results.

Expectations are high, both of him and of the Trust, an independent limited company which is intended to search out energy-efficiency schemes. Moore is optimistic that he can fulfil them. 'There is no limit to the areas we can examine, and if I find that levers are inadequate, doors are closed, then I'll shout,' he says. Fighting talk - but he will start his chairmanship with at least two controversial issues on his desk. The first is the debacle of the coal mine closures, and the question of whether environmental costs have tipped the balance between coal and gas. Moore is adamant that he does not feel under pressure to enter the fray, although the comments of an independent body dedicated to assessing efficiency might be welcomed. 'I refuse to be drawn into the political debate,' he says, with a sensitivity that comes from an abrupt exit from politics after being tipped briefly as the successor to Lady, then Mrs Thatcher. The sensitivity may be understandable, but then the Trust is on the sidelines of one of the most wide-ranging and controversial energy efficiency issues faced by the country. Instead, the Trust is intended to focus on domestic rather than industrial projects - to search out ways for British Gas and the regional electricity companies to encourage their customers to use less energy in their homes. But even on that remit Moore faces an immediate obstacle. Last week Stephen Littlechild, regulator of the electricity industry, appeared to veto the possibility of regional electricity companies passing on the cost of investments in energy-efficiency to their customers. However, plans for the Trust have always assumed that the cost of almost all its projects - both gas and electricity - would be passed on. At a stroke, Littlechild's statement seems to threaten half the Trust's potential success. 'It is too early to express disappointment. I want to find out what he thinks in detail,' Moore says cautiously. Beyond that immediate obstacle, he also needs to solve the conundrum of why companies should suggest schemes that persuade their customers to use less energy and so could cost them revenue. Moore says he has a solution: 'I believe that corporations have a role in the community and can enhance shareholders' return by being 'good corporations', not just by short-term profits.' That is a much-debated position: although he is a director of Credit Suisse's fund management arm, he may not find his views of corporate governance shared by the mass of utility shareholders, let alone the companies themselves. He feels, however, that he has equipped the Trust with enough independence from the government and the utilities to negotiate these questions. He says that one of his main conditions in accepting the job was that a majority of directors on the Trust's board should be independent of the utilities. He is concerned too that the costs of running the Trust - which with an eventual staff of between 30 and 40 could amount to several million pounds a year - must not be paid entirely by the utilities. 'That would be dangerous,' he says, and he hopes that eventually the Trust can take fee income from initiating projects. He says he wants the Trust to cover businesses other than gas and electricity, possibly including the motor industry. With much of the scope of the Trust in question, will it really have an impact? 'I am not interested if it is just going to be small marginal schemes,' he says. 'What impact we will have as an engine of change I don't know.'  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

The Treuhand privatisation agency decided yesterday to begin negotiations on selling east Germany's largest brown coal mining company, Mibrag, to the consortium. A rival German energy consortium, led by Rheinbraun and including RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, failed to submit a competitive bid, according to the Treuhand. PowerGen's move comes at a politically sensitive time for the UK government, in the middle of a review on how to reprieve some of British Coal's mines. However, the privatised generator stressed yesterday it had no plans to import the coal, which would all be used locally. PowerGen and NRG Energy are understood to have bid nearly DM1bn (Pounds 412m) to buy Mibrag's extensive open-cast mines in the Leipzig area and planned several billion D-Marks in investments. Mibrag, which produced 36m tons of brown coal last year, expects to sign contracts shortly to supply brown coal to several big power stations planned in Saxony. The company's workforce is to be slashed by 5,500 to 10,500 by the end of this year. The UK-US consortium also aims to become the first foreign company to operate power stations in Germany, breaking the fiercely-protected oligopoly of domestic producers. German electricity rates are among the highest in Europe and PowerGen and NRG Energy have held out the prospect of producing cheaper electricity. Both the Treuhand and the German Cartel Office have expressed interest in obtaining cheaper rates for German industrial and household users. The Rheinbraun consortium is also negotiating with the Treuhand to buy the Laubag brown coal company in nearby eastern Brandenburg state, but progress has been slow. The Treuhand hopes to speed the process with its decision to negotiate exclusively with the Anglo-American consortium on Mibrag. Mibrag's sale is to be concluded by June the Treuhand said. If PowerGen and NRG Energy are unable to sustain their offer, new tenders will be invited.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.   Industries:-  P12  Coal Mining.     P4911  Electric Services.

He said he hopes the  measures taken to resolve the energy crisis throughout the  nation will be effective and will end the constant power  rationing to which people have been subjected. The measures  include purchasing electricity from countries such as Panama,  which began sending 13 megawatts through the Central American  interconnection system this Friday for an initial period of  three months at a cost of $3.8 million. A power-generating barge  will be leased and will arrive in the coming days in the  northern port of Puerto Cortes. Private plants will also be used  to generate electricity.    According to official reports from the National Enterprise  for Electric Power (ENEE), the country's daily deficit is over  80 megawatts, which has prompted the creation of a rationing  schedule. Reina appealed to the people to conserve energy while  the crisis is overcome. ""I am working as hard as I can so the  Honduran people will not suffer so much with these problems,"" he  added.    Also, he said the state will collect $26 million in arrears  maintained by ""wealthy"" businessmen for several years with the  ENEE, which might help to solve the current problem. ""To achieve  this, we must cut down on our energy use. It is time for people  to help solve the crisis,"" the president stated. The current  energy crisis is the result of a lack of water at the Francisco  Morazan hydroelectric plant, the country's largest such plant,  which supplies 63 percent of national demand. According to the  same sources, a lack of foresight by previous governments and  neglected maintenance of the thermoelectric plants that also  generate power are also to blame for the problem.    The government trusts that Central American countries, like  Nicaragua and Costa Rica, will supply electricity to Honduras,  but these nations have reported that they also face problems  because of the drought.

The first steps towards the courts were taken yesterday when Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, in the report of an inquiry into pit closures he has been conducting for Nottinghamshire County Council, argued that both Mr Heseltine and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, had been in breach of their statutory duty under the Electricity Act 1989. He also suggested that action could be taken in the European Court against Mr Heseltine under Articles 90 and 92 of the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Community. These articles relate to distortion of competition by publicly-owned enterprises. Mr Martin Gawith, deputy leader of the council, said: 'We will hope to get our partners together to seek legal redress.' The partners to which he referred are the local authorities which are members of the Coalfield Communities Campaign. Both public and private-sector organisations in Nottinghamshire, fearful of seven colliery closures with direct and indirect job losses of 14,000, have been vocal in their protests. The Scrivener report, which includes two volumes of evidence, was yesterday submitted to Mr Heseltine, in connection with his promised white paper on energy policy, and to the Commons select committee on trade and industry. Mr Scrivener contended both that 'there is unequivocal evidence of a rigged market' in electricity and that, under the terms of the Electricity Act, the secretary of state, in this case Mr Heseltine, has a duty to promote competition. 'If the evidence is such that competition is being distorted, as claimed, then not only has he the power to act but he has a duty to do so and in the final resort interested parties have a right, enforceable in the courts, to require him to perform his duty,' Mr Scrivener said. He also considered that the legality of a levy on fossil fuels and the provision of a subsidy to support nuclear power 'must be questionable' under the Treaty of Rome. He suggested that 'proceedings could be taken . . . without getting involved in the more controversial question of governments in the EC providing subsidies - which is a political 'hot potato'.' Mr Scrivener concluded from evidence presented to the three-day enquiry he conducted in Nottingham last month that 'Europe's largest coal resource can be turned off because of distortions in a non-competitive market.' There should be, instead, a national energy policy which includes 'securing and maintaining an indigenous supply of coal.' He also suggested that there should be a moratorium on electricity supplies from France, the decommissioning of older nuclear power stations, no building of new gas power stations and 15-year contracts for British Coal from the power generators - the same as gas contracts.

Tokyo Gas will continue testing and  research with the goal of practical application by summer 1996.  In theory, it will be possible for a household to generate its  own electricity from the city gas supplied to each home.    The fuel cell system consists of a hydrogen dissociation  type  reformer that directly manufactures very pure hydrogen from city  gas (natural gas) and a solid polymer fuel cell manufactured by  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The system generates electricity by  using the very pure hydrogen as fuel. By developing the reformer  that produces hydrogen from city gas, Tokyo Gas has cleared the  path toward practical application of a fuel cell system that  runs on city gas.    The newly developed hydrogen dissociation type reformer  produces hydrogen by:    1) Using steam pyrolysis to dissociate city gas, the main  component of which is methane,    2) Using a palladium film to extract only the hydrogen from  the resulting mix of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon  dioxide,    3) Burning off the remaining substances.    The key point in the technology is the fact that researchers  were able to dramatically increase the efficiency of obtaining  hydrogen by reducing the thickness of the palladium film through  which the hydrogen passes to one-fifth its original thickness.    The problem in the past has been that a carbon monoxide  converter and a hydrogen purifier were needed to obtain very  pure hydrogen, which made the equipment bulky. The reformer, on  the other hand, is 28 cm in diameter and 1 meter high, which  makes the system five to ten times smaller. Tokyo Gas is aiming  for practical application in the 21st century of this new fuel  cell system that simply uses city gas.     "
0,FT921-11533 ,"FT921-11533 _AN-CA4AUABMFT 920131   FT  31 JAN 92 / Leading Article: A single EC energy market   THE NEW energy directive put forward by the EC Commission is supposed to be one of the fundamental building blocks of the European single market. But it will have to uproot deeply entrenched interests if it is to achieve the desirable objective of removing barriers between member states' markets for electricity and gas. In few areas do state monopolies maintain such dominance as energy. Few also suffer from such distorted price structures, the result of decades of subsidy and government manipulation. The directive challenges, head on, many members' long-established energy policies. The measure proposed last week by Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the Portuguese Energy Commissioner, would open the EC's gas and electricity distribution networks. Under the directive, large energy consumers could buy electricity and gas from suppliers anywhere within the EC, starting next year. Three years later, this permission would be extended to smaller consumers. By letting competitive forces into the market in this way, the EC hopes to expose the Community's high-cost energy producers. But merely opening taps or throwing switches would not yield the desired results, which is why the directive also contains provisions that would remove less visible barriers to energy trade. For example, the mono-polies, whether state-owned or otherwise, would be required to unbundle their various components - generation, supply and distribution - and make them conform to accepted accounting standards. This should reveal cross-subsidies that give any unfair advantages. Member states would also have to let incoming suppliers reach domestic consumers and local fuel supplies, if necessary by building plant. One step It is an indication of the size of Mr Cardoso's task that only one country - the UK - remotely approaches the kind of free market he envisages, and then only in electricity. Yesterday's decision by the UK to lift the ban on gas imports is only a step, if an important and belated one, in a long march towards a liberalised UK gas market. It is from the continental countries that the greatest resistance is expected. In France, where the state-owned Electricite de France enjoys a monopoly, the plan would not merely allow in competitors, but would also expose the subsidy enjoyed by its substantial nuclear power industry, because it does not bear the cost of future decommissioning of plant. In Germany, electricity prices have been kept artificially high to help the country's inefficient coal industry. Mr Cardoso's plan would force Germany to review this policy. Special problems Indeed, each member state has a special set of problems, and will seek special treatment as the directive makes its way through the Brussels machine. Much of the resistance will come in the form of warnings about the threat to security of supply. These should not be dismissed, but combined with appropriate regulation an open market - stimulating trade in energy - is potentially more secure than a closed one. Opponents may also point to the evidence of UK power liberalisation - limited though it is - to argue that a free market does not necessarily bring the desired benefits. The British record has been disappointing so far because prices have tended upwards rather than down. But this is partly because the UK market contains vestiges of the monopolies and price distortions which adherence to the principles behind the directive would remove. Apart from pointing the way ahead for the EC energy market, the plan would create an opening for increased gas imports from Russia and reinforce the EC's efforts in resolving that country's financial problems. Just as with farm produce, it is not in the interest of either the EC consumer, not to mention the desired stability of eastern economies, for the EC to resist Russian gas imports. In reverse, a more flexible EC energy market should also facilitate the much needed export of electricity to eastern Europe. Mr Cardoso has launched a bold plan. It is worth fighting for.

0,FT944-1289 ,"FT944-1289 _AN-ELUC8AB8FT 941221   FT  21 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Sweet source of power - Sugar cane is being used for energy in Sao Paulo says Patrick McCurry      By PATRICK MCCURRY   Electricity produced on vast sugar cane plantations in the countryside of Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest and most industrialised state, could help relieve a predicted energy shortage. Distilleries of fuel alcohol made from sugar have been generating their own energy for years by burning the crushed cane in large boilers which produce steam to power electricity turbines. Today an increasing number are seeking to sell their surplus energy to Brazil's electricity grid. The state of Sao Paulo produces more than half Brazil's harvest of around 220m tonnes of sugar cane. Most of the cane is used to produce fuel alcohol for cars under a government alternative energy programme launched in the 1970s. In recent years distilleries have been selling small amounts of excess energy to distributors, or 'co-generating', and during this year's harvest distilleries have begun selling energy to a distributor through long-term contracts. Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz, which operates in the interior of Sao Paulo state, has been the pioneering distributor in co-generation. Eduardo Goncalves, CPFL chairman, says that an advantage of sugar cane energy is that the harvest - May to November - occurs when rivers, and Sao Paulo's hydroelectric capacity, are at their lowest. The state generates 60 per cent of its needs from hydro power and imports 40 per cent. But Sao Paulo faces increasing energy problems because there is less potential for increasing hydroelectric capacity. Nelson Garcez, a state energy official, believes the state will have to import 70 per cent of its needs within 15 years unless non-hydro energy sources are developed. Goncalves says that while the co-generation programme is relatively small it has important potential: 'There is a lot of talk about using bio-mass for energy in Brazil, but this is the first major project under way.' Two leading alcohol distilleries began supplying energy earlier this year to CPFL under 10-year contracts. A further eight have signed one-year contracts. One of the long-term contracts is with Vale do Rosario distillery, which crushes 18,000 tonnes of cane a day during the harvest. It supplies the distributor with a capacity of 4MW, enough to power a small shopping centre. Cicero Junqueira Franco, director of the distillery, says he intends to increase generating capacity by installing higher-pressure boilers and more sophisticated turbines. To increase capacity by 5MW would cost around Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.4m). But one obstacle to further development, he says, is uncertainty about the government's pricing policy. A government-linked organisation regulates the prices that distributors such as CPFL can pay for their electricity. The price for this year was Dollars 41 per megawatt hour - low by international standards, but enough to persuade the two distilleries to sign up long-term. After transport costs CPFL is paying virtually the same price to sugar distilleries as to import electricity from the huge Itaipu hydro plant on the Brazil- Paraguay border, although energy from the state's hydro plants is currently about 25 per cent cheaper. That price, however, is likely to increase because new hydro plants are in more remote - and therefore costly - locations. Many believe the trend in Brazil will move towards more flexibility on pricing, which could stimulate co-generation. Ademar Balbo, director of Galo Bravo distillery, says he hopes to negotiate a supply contract with CPFL after investing Dollars lm in a more powerful generator. This will increase the distillery's capacity to 9MW from 6MW, leaving a surplus of 3MW. 'The prices that are being paid by the distributor are not that good at the moment but it is a long-term investment. Brazil is growing and energy prices are likely to go up,' he says.

With world aluminium supplies burdensome, the output reductions are not likely to support prices, but the economic impact on the region and individual producers is significant. The Bonneville Power Administration, the federal agency that markets electricity from more than 30 dams in the Northwest has began 'temporary' energy curtailments to to aluminium producers on January 16. Now, with spring thaws approaching, and water levels rising, power officials and aluminium industry executives say the situation may not improve to the point where it pays to restart closed aluminium pot lines. 'I expect current power supply problems will last at least until the end of this year,' said Mr John Carr, executive director of Direct Service Industries, the organisation that represents eight aluminium companies and other industrial users arranging power contracts with Bonneville. Of eight aluminium companies in the region, two, Reynolds and Vanalco, did not cut production after the announcement. Reynolds' Troutdale smelter was already shut in response to low prices, leaving power available to its second plant. Privately-owned Northwest Aluminum is buying higher-cost alternative power to maintain output. However, since January, Kaiser Aluminum's two smelters have reduced annual capacity by about 68,000 tonnes, the Alumax unit of Amax has cut output by 68,000 tonnes, Alcoa's is down about 42,000 tonnes, and Columbia Ventures and Columbia Falls aluminium have each pared output by more than 40,000 tonnes. Mr Jack Speers, power manager at Alcoa, said Bonneville might have power available to provide full service to smelters for 8 to 10 weeks in late April and May, the annual 'fish flush' period when dams release water to sustain Salmon migration. However, with the cost of restarting a pot line around Dollars 1m and no assurance that full power will be available through the summer, 'it's unlikely that we would bring potlines up again,' he said.

At the same time, overall energy growth in Asia will boom at 4 per cent per year over the next 20 years, says the International Atomic Energy Agency, more than double the growth in the west. Natural gas will be the fastest growing energy fuel in the region, providing a further spur to independent producers as gas-fired units can be built twice as fast as coal units. The recently-negotiated projects underline the growing acceptance by national governments, notably in South Asia and Southeast Asia, of the need for greater public accountability and the reduction in electricity price subsidisation. These changes in perception are helping establish a more hospitable environment for independents to negotiate their deals. In India, the US Enron Power Development Group signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which will allow it to supply the first phase of a 2,015MW gas-fired (LNG) powered plant and related facilities. The scale and nature of the project - costing more than Dollars 2bn and using an imported fuel - makes the deal exceptional in a catalogue of some 70 Indian power projects seeking private sector partnerships. The first phase, now nearing construction start, calls for a 695MW unit costing Dollars 930m, to be followed by a 1,320MW second phase. Equity partners with Enron are General Electric and Bechtel of the US. The build-own-operate project will recoup its costs from the MSEB through the sale of power at 7.5 US cents per kilowatt hour. The deal followed about 18 months of negotiations - not long by international standards - and came on the heels of a similar package of independent power deals involving British companies National Power, British Gas and Rolls-Royce, the largest of which is a 1,000MW coal-fired power station at Visakhapatnam on the Andhra Pradesh Coast. Independent power producers are also encouraged by the success in Indonesia of a US-Japanese consortium's 1,200MW coal-fired Paiton power project on east Java. The deal is the first sizeable independent power deal in Indonesia and involves project leader Mission Energy of the US and partners General Electric of the US, Mitsui of Japan and PT Batu Hitam Perkasa of Indonesia. Construction will start early next year with full power from the project planned for early 1998. The breakthrough in Asia's third-most populated country, after China and India, has sent power plant equipment suppliers and potential project sponsors scurrying to the archipelago. Enron, for example, recently submitted a feasibility study for a joint venture agreement for Indonesia's first large gas-fired plant in East Java. The 500MW integrated power project is aimed at taking advantage of Jakarta's policy to bring gas-fired power generation into Indonesia's mix of coal, oil and hydroelectric power generating stations. The restructuring of the industry is not limited to independent power groups setting up alongside state utilities. There is also the overhaul and, in some cases, market flotation of the state groups themselves. The main reasons are to ensure the delivery of efficient electricity plant quickly and to relieve the state of the onerous financial burden of build all plant under its own wing. Legislation was passed in Pakistan in April to authorise the sale to the private sector of thermal power stations operated by the Water and Power Development Authority. Indonesia's PLN is also being prepared for a minority flotation, along the lines, two years ago, of the 22 per cent divestiture by the Malaysian government of Tenaga Nasional Berhad, the state utility. Thailand's Electricity Generating Authority is preparing to set up private sector subsidiaries and is hiving off some thermal power units to independent power operations. The Manila government is grooming the National Power Corp. for flotation and plans to allow power distributors to built their own power stations. Even Singapore's efficient Public Utilities Board has announced that its gas and electricity business will be commercialised in about two years. It is doing so as it prepares the groundwork for the Dollars 5bn 4,800MW Tuas oil-to-gas power complex, to be built by the end of the century. In terms of equipment supply, the ascendancy of gas as an important power station fuel is stimulating more interest in gas-fired projects, both by independents and the state utilities. Despite the move to privatisation, it is state utilities which still provide the vast majority of orders, although this is diminishing steadily. According to David Genever-Watling, chief executive of General Electric Industrial Power Systems of the US, the Asian power generation equipment market should account for 45 per cent of all power equipment orders in the 1990s. This meant 462,000MW of power equipment orders. Of this, 206,000MW would be for coal/steam turbines and 84,000MW for hydropower, emphasising the point that hydro and coal potential in Asia are available in enormous quantities, albeit not always in the right places. Significantly, gas, which scarcely figured in the equation a decade ago, is now looming larger, with a prediction of 82,000MW for combined-cycle and 37,000MW for gas turbines. GE's prediction also noted that nuclear equipment over the next 10 years would account for 50,000MW of orders, although this is concentrated mainly in Japan, Taiwan and Korea. China is only now making its first foray into nuclear and Indonesia will not be a factor for a decade.   Countries:-  XOZ  Asia.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

0,FT922-8312 ,"FT922-8312 _AN-CENCNAAPFT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (4): Single market stalemate - Europe's monopolies defend their territory      By DAVID LASCELLES   THE European Community's plan for electricity represents one of the most ambitious aspects of the single market - and also one of its most controversial. From the moment Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, put forward his proposals in January, he has been subjected to a barrage of complaint and criticism from much of the EC's electricity industry. So heated have the exchanges been on occasions that an official from one large member state described them as 'a dialogue of the deaf'. Does this mean that Mr Cardoso's plan is ill-conceived, or that he has successfully targeted deeply entrenched interests? Part of Mr Cardoso's difficulty lies in the diversity of the EC's power industry, which ranges from huge state monopolies such as Electricite de France to small privately-owned local generators. In some countries, the industry is monolithic, in others it is split between generators and distributors. Mr Cardoso's original plan aimed to break up the monopolies using the EC's special powers. But that was plainly an unrealistic goal, and Mr Cardoso backed off. Instead, his proposal seeks to attack the monopolies through a different route: by introducing more competition, and making it harder for large companies to use their complex structures to disguise their true costs. The plan has two main parts. One will give power producers the right to sell electricity to customers in another member state by guaranteeing them access to the local power grid. This is known as third party access (TPA). Initially, TPA will apply only to users of more than 100GW hours of electricity a year, which would limit it to the 400-500 largest power consumers in the EC. But after three years, it would be extended to smaller customers, effectively opening up the entire EC market to cross-border competition. The second part will oblige integrated companies to unbundle their accounts so that the various segments (generation, distribution, contracting etc.) operate more autonomously. This should make it easier for outsiders to gauge the market and compete. Mr Cardoso's vision is of a market that will eventually be so fluid that consumers will be able to buy their power from any generator in the EC, no matter how distant. Power companies will also be able to locate plant in other states and become, in effect, multinationals. Mr Cardoso wants his plan to start next January, but an early timetable seems unlikely, given the high level of opposition. At a ministerial meeting in Portugal early last month, a majority of energy ministers agreed to end monopolies on electricity production and construction of energy networks. But they baulked at the TPA proposals. Broadly, the EC has divided between the Continental countries, with their well-ordered and (often) state-owned power monopolies which have objections to the plan, and the UK with its newly privatised system which supports it. In between are Mr Cardoso's Portugal, where the industry is partially privatised and is looking for new opportunities, and smaller countries such as Denmark which have given qualified support. The objections of the Continental power lobby were summed up by Mr Alessandro Ortis, vice president of Italy's Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica, and president of Euroelectric, the Brussels-based trade group. He told a recent meeting at the European Parliament that he favoured free transit and price transparency. But he believed that the TPA proposals would be damaging. In Frankfurt, Mr Wolf Heinemann, the deputy director of VDEW, the German electricity trade group, said his members also rejected the proposals. 'We are not against competition as such,' he stressed. 'But we do not believe the plan will lead to higher efficiency.' He warned that it could even drive up prices for small consumers as power generators tried to recoup the margins they lost in competing for the large-customer business. Mr Heinemann also said the highly integrated German power industry was not susceptible to the same kind of unbundling as the UK industry. If German consumers paid higher prices for their power than others in the EC, this was not due to inefficiency so much as to special local conditions, such as charges mandated to preserve the German coal industry, and tough environmental regulations. In France, Mr Claude Destival, the director of economics and strategy at EdF, had similar reservations about the practicability of third party access. But he also said that the introduction of unbridled competition would prevent EC member states from having a national energy policy. 'Energy policy is too important to be left to market forces,' he said. By contrast, the UK industry is strongly enthusiastic about the plan - which accords with the spirit of the post-privatisation market - though cynics might argue that UK power companies are protected from external competition, having only a single cable connection with the Continental grid. But UK companies are less interested in exporting power than in establishing themselves in foreign markets. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, the smaller of the two main UK generators, says his company doubts that it can compete in France and Germany. But it plans to invest in projects for gas and coal-fired power in Portugal, and in a gas plant in Greece. Mr Cardoso faces a long uphill battle to win acceptance for his plan, which will come up before its first ministerial council in late May. One political factor in his favour is that the UK assumes the EC presidency for the second half of the year, and will doubtless be gunning for it, though even that may not be enough to get it approved by Mr Cardoso's original January 1993 deadline.

0,FT922-8302 ,"FT922-8302 _AN-CENCNAAZFT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (14): Power line under the ocean  -Ulster is no longer an electricity island      By JIM FLANAGAN   THE ink was barely dry on the documents transferring ownership of Northern Ireland's four power stations to the private sector when the province's annual round of electricity price increases was announced. A 4 per cent average rise in line with inflation was hardly surprising but it handed detractors of privatisation a fresh platform for a bitter attack on Ulster energy policy. It underlined the fact that the Government is in the process of privatising the power industry in spite of fierce opposition from consumer groups, unionist and nationalist politicians and trade unions fearing massive job cuts and higher tariffs. Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), an amalgamation of four small municipal authorities less than 20 years ago, ceased to exist as a public utility on April 1. Its power stations were taken over and all of NIE's obligations and employees moved to a new company, NIE plc. The new company, Ulster's biggest, continues to have responsibility for providing a reliable supply of electricity and controls the scheduling and despatch of all generating units. The new power station owners have to compete for the right to sell electricity to NIE. It in turn has a statutory duty to operate the system in a manner facilitating competition in generation and supply. NIE Plc is due for flotation in November. In selling the power stations the over-riding concern of Ministers was to inject as much competition as possible. Historically, NIE's main problems have been its dependence on costly fuel imports, isolation from national grids and its small size - peak winter demand throughout the province was a mere 1,447MW last year. The utility's 70 per cent dependence on oil led to big Government subsidies in the early 1980s but modest profitability has been restored in recent years as fuel costs have stabilised. It could be argued that privatisation has provided an answer to all the problems at a stroke and raised Pounds 353m for the Treasury's coffers. British Gas has bought Ballylumford power station at Larne, County Antrim, for Pounds 132.4m. The 1,080 MW oil-fired plant meets the demand of almost half of NIE's 600,000 customers. The new owners will be converting the station to run on natural gas by 1997. Premier Transco, a new British Gas subsidiary, will be building, owning and operating a pipeline to carry natural gas into Northern Ireland from Scotland. Ballylumford will be the first user but the pipeline will also service other suppliers wishing to bring gas to Ulster consumers. Another subsidiary, Premier Energy Suppliers, is being established to market the product in Northern Ireland. Both the pipeline and power station conversion project have attracted European Community backing. Terms have been agreed but British Gas has still to complete a detailed undersea survey and complete negotiations with Bord Gais Eireann in Dublin regarding the shared on-shore pipeline in Scotland. Applied Energy Services and Tractebel, an American/Belgian consortium, have formed a joint venture, NIGEN, to acquire Kilroot power station near Carrickfergus and the Belfast West plant for a total of Pounds 214m. However, the deal had not been finalised by the April 1 deadline. The Department of Economic Development has taken over responsibility for running the plants while NIE is providing a payroll system allowing wages to be paid. NIGEN has made it clear that an agreement with the Government has been realised and the delay is due to 'technical reasons'. It said: 'It is not because they can't raise the money. It is the process involved in project financing which has led to the hold-up'. NIGEN has Pounds 25m in place and is in the process of placing the remaining capital with a syndicate of international banks. Kilroot, Ulster's most modern station, is a dual coal and oil firing plant with a capacity of 520MW satisfying about one third of the province's total demand. Belfast West, the province's oldest station, is a 240MW coal-fired plant covering about 10 per cent of demand. Coolkeeragh power station at Londonderry, the only plant in the west of the province, has been acquired in a management-employee-buy-out for Pounds 6.5m. The 420MW oil-fired station also meets about 10 per cent of demand but is strategically important because of its geographical location. The industry's competitive goals will be strengthened towards the end of the 1990s when an electricity inter-connector between Scotland and Ulster comes on stream. Scottish Power and NIE reached agreement on the Pounds 170m project before the power station sales. The cable will be capable of transmitting 250MW of power and provide another mainland link. There is also renewed interest in restoring the inter-connector with the Republic of Ireland, out of commission since being repeatedly targeted by the IRA in the 1970s. NIE and the Republic's Electricity Supply Board have announced plans for a small power link providing back-up in the north-west of the country. With the new power station owners likely to figure in any competition for future NIE generating requirements, it seems the industry is well placed to meet demand, currently growing at 4 per cent a year. The whole scenario throws a question mark over the exploitation of lignite, the province's only indigenous source of fuel. It has been found in huge quantities and studies suggest a lignite-fired power plant would be viable. But given the environmental implication of such a project and the plans already announced for meeting future requirements, lignite is unlikely to be developed in the forseeable future. The government has insisted that the privatisation is in the best interests of tax payers and energy users. But consumers will judge the restructuring of the industry by the bills dropping through their letterboxes. Mr Geoffrey Horton, the new electricity regulator appointed by the Government to protect consumers rights after privatisation, is likely to be a busy man.  The Financial Times   London Page IX  "

The pilot superstore will open in Snipes Retail Park, Ashton-under-Lyne, Manchester, on March 17. ICL is involved through Technology, a wholly owned subsidiary and one of the UK's largest personal computer distributors. The move has the backing of Technology's suppliers. The stores will sell hardware and software from IBM, Compaq, ICL, Apple and Toshiba among others. IBM, which recently agreed to resupply Technology with its products after a row about its acquisition by ICL, said it expected to sell its home computers and portables through the stores. Mr Steve Sowery, director of retail operations for Technology, said the move would enable the company to exploit fully the emerging market for small office and home office systems. More than 40 per cent of pc sales are expec-ted to go through retail outlets by 1995, according to Romtec the marketing consultancy. Norweb is the most aggressively expansionist of the 12 regional electricity companies in retail operations. Mr Duncan Gray, the company's strategic planning controller, said the venture would seek synergy between Norweb's retailing expertise and Technology's computing know-how. ICL, in which Fujitsu of Japan has a holding of a little more than 80 per cent, moved into personal computers through the purchase of Nokia Data Systems of Finland and into volume products through the acquisition of Technology. The company's first stake in retailing came through its acquisition of the 20,000 sq ft Icon computer superstore near Dudley in the West Midlands in July last year. ICL said that the store had closed after only seven weeks when its backers pulled out, but was now trading profitably. Technology expects to generate about Pounds 1.5m in revenues per store in the first year.

Is the situation really so alarming? I asked this question  of Nur Rashitovich Nihmatulin, the first deputy chairman of  Ukrainian Goskomatom. He explained:    [Begin Nihmatulin recording] The situation in nuclear energy  today is rather complex. We have worked fairly successfully in  the autumn-winter season, producing up to 42 percent of the  electricity throughout Ukraine. This is not because we raised  the power at our atomic stations. It is because conventional  power was forced to reduce generation of electricity owing to  nondelivery of oil and gas. About 30 percent of the capacities  were in reserve.    But we are feeling a terrible shortage of deliveries of  nuclear fuel. To date, we have not paid for fuel for four sets,  and if this situation continues we will be forced to take out of  circulation about 4 million kWh of capacity. That is one set at  the South Ukrainian, one set at the Zaporozhye, perhaps even a  second set at Zaporozhye, and lower the load on the Chernobyl  atomic power station.    Today, we consider that it is being resolved positively:  There is compensation for the strategic weapons that will be  sent off to enterprises in Russia, and on account of that  strategic weaponry fuel is to be supplied for our reactors, and  we hope that nuclear power will be alive and we will not have to  take out of circulation a single set of a single station.

Yes, I know ministers are frightened of the anti-Europeans in their party; and presumably they hope to appease them with a vigorous stand in defence of national sovereignty. But the problem is that this is a crusade which is certain to fail in the medium term, and probably in the short term as well. In any case, why go out on a limb now? The Maastricht treaty was such a miserable experience for Mr John Major that you would think the prime minister would do his best to steer clear of all questions of principle about Europe and its development for as long as possible. Yet here he is, taking a combative stand on an issue which is bound to involve a battle on two fronts: it must lead to an unwinnable confrontation with his partners in Europe, but it must also stir up the anti-European campaigners among those who are nominally his own supporters. This is a spectacular exercise in political masochism. This crusade is doomed to defeat, because its underlying objectives set the UK at odds with virtually all its European partners. The government pretends that it is only asking that the voting rules which protect blocking minorities in the Council of Ministers should be kept at the present level, even after the admission of four more member states: 23 votes, or the equivalent of two big countries and one small. The reality, of course, is that the British government is trying to make majority voting more difficult than at present; whereas effective decision-making in a larger Union will obviously require more majority voting, not less. The puzzle is that the Conservative government seems to have been manoeuvred by its Euro-phobic wing into refighting the last war but one. The windmill it is tilting at is the old fantasy that Britain's national sovereignty is threatened by the sinister federalists in Brussels; and it appears to imagine that it can creep by stealth back in the direction of a national veto. It does not seem to realise that the terms of the debate have been changed beyond recognition. Many years ago, in 1965-66, the Community had a shattering confrontation between France and the rest, over the rights and wrongs of majority voting. That was before majority voting was due to come into force as part of the Community's normal regime, and the French were trying to prevent it happening. After a six-month confrontation, a truce was signed in 1966 which was afterwards called the Luxembourg Compromise, even though there had been no compromise on anything. Nevertheless, the psychological shock of the crisis effectively deterred majority voting for 20 years. But the Luxembourg Compromise was wiped off the slate by the 1986 Single European Act, which explicitly broadened the scope for majority voting; and the agenda on the slate was rewritten by the Maastricht treaty, which also carried the majority voting trend even further. As a result, today's central question about majority voting is the reverse of yesterday's: it is not whether a member state can be compelled by majority vote to do things it would rather not do, but whether it can use its national veto to prevent most or all of its partners from doing what they collectively want to do. It is now clear that the first, old-fashioned question can have several different answers. Most rational people now recognise that the purpose of majority voting is not to out-vote the recalcitrant, but to persuade them to negotiate and to compromise. But for those who will not negotiate and will not submit, there is the alternative of the opt-out: if you don't like the journey, you can leave the ship. That was the double lesson of Maastricht: the other member states could not compel the UK to accept the social chapter, or the Danes to accept monetary union or indeed anything else in the treaty; but nor, in the last resort, could Britain and Denmark prevent the others from going ahead with the treaty they had compromised on. In the long run, the majority will get the kind of Europe they want, and the options for those who disagree will essentially be quite simple: to compromise, to submit, or to stand aside. If majority decisions are blocked inside the Council of Ministers, through systematic legal obstruction, they will be taken outside, in some other way. If the British government is now trying to strengthen the legal methods of obstruction, it is perhaps because it is slowly dawning that the opt-out is not a satisfactory type of solution. The plan for economic and monetary union may well prove an acute test case, and it is likely to come to a head during the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference to review and revise the Maastricht treaty. At that moment, it will be clear which member states are still committed to monetary union. And it is quite possible that an inner core will be ready to go ahead to a single currency, conceivably in a very near future. Mr Major will then be left holding his opt-out, which means he cannot stop them, just as it means he cannot join them. Note that the concept 'blocking minority' does not exist in any European treaties. What they lay down is the number of positive votes required to pass a measure; at present 54 out of 76. The underlying assumption is that the governments which signed the treaties share a broad political consensus on the purpose of their association. That consensus did not exist in 1965. But the French lost that battle for one simple reason: they could not impose their view of Europe then, and it is time the British saw that they cannot impose their view of Europe now.

He denied that the debate about the future of coal could jeopardise the UK's ability to meet international targets, even though the use of coal in power stations to generate electricity emits twice as much carbon dioxide as the use of gas. 'If the review decides that more energy is to be produced by coal, more savings will have to be found elsewhere,' he said. One of the main targets of the paper is transport, the sector where emissions are growing fastest. A 10 per cent rise in fuel prices above the rate of inflation could prevent emission of one million tonnes of carbon a year (MtC), or about 0.6 per cent of the UK's total emissions, the paper says. Equipping new cars with speed limiters and reflecting fuel efficiency in the price of new cars could save another 2 per cent. On government projections, UK emissions in the year 2000 are likely to be at least 6 per cent, or about 10 MtC, above target levels. However, car sales tax was abolished in the Autumn Statement, a measure to help stimulate the depressed car market. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, said: 'The Autumn Statement was all about building roads and not about investing in public transport.' More than 150 countries have signed the United Nations framework convention on climate change, agreed at the Rio Earth Summit in June. Under the convention they must make plans to stabilise emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Mr Howard said that the UK intended to ratify the convention by the end of 1993, obliging it to bring emissions back to 160 MtC. According to a report last month by the Department of Trade and Industry, the UK's carbon dioxide emissions in the year 2000 could be between 157 MtC and 179MtC. Yesterday's paper uses the middle case of 170MtC. The DTI projections were based on an assumption that the proportion of electricity generated by coal would fall sharply during the 1990s from 68 per cent to 47 per cent, while gas generation of electricity would rise from zero to about 22 per cent. A carbon or energy tax is among the options in the paper. It also lists measures to encourage energy efficiency by businesses and households. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, warned: 'We are running hard to stand still - investment by industry, commerce and households in energy saving measures is down by 28 per cent in the past two years.'

0,FT944-9175 ,"FT944-9175 _AN-EKPEKAHMFT 941116   FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (11): Rights-thinking strategies - New applications / Laurie Morse examines novel ideas for contracts      By LAURIE MORSE   Ronald Coase, the Nobel prize-winning economist, once explained that if it were well understood that trading involved the exchange of rights to certain things, rather than the exchange of the underlying things themselves, our universe of tradeable commodities and securities would be far larger than it is. The people who structure derivatives strategies understand this uncoupling very well. Every day they engineer contracts where the rights to certain returns and their associated risks are disassembled and repackaged to suit their customers' needs. Once viewed as exotic, derivative instruments used to manage all sorts of market risks - interest rate, currency, commodity, or equity - have achieved widespread acceptance in the financial world. Their primary route of expansion now is through application in new industries where the concept of risk management remains a novel idea. However, other uses for derivatives are evolving, and these new applications take the craft far beyond managing just market risk. One of these, the evolution of products used to manage credit risk, has had a troubled start, though its supporters say it could become a Dollars 1,000bn industry. Another class of new derivatives focuses on using market forces to allocate scarce resources. These include secondary markets for trading pollution allowances that have been issued as part of the US clean air act. Introduced two years ago as a radical new way to ration pollution while allowing polluters some flexibility when facing regulatory constraints, these products also have not lived up to their early promise. US futures exchanges in some cases are taking the lead in innovation, trying to expand the risk management capacity of industries as diverse as catastrophe insurance and electricity generation. Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust, and Credit Suisse First Boston took the lead in the experiment with credit derivatives. In a logical extension of their success with interest rate and currency swaps, these bankers and brokers saw their customers had a secondary need: a means to manage the credit uncertainties in their portfolio. Managing credit risk has long been the purview of bankers, and the bread-and-butter of credit rating agencies. Transferring, or trading, credit risk has been nearly impossible without liquidating the cash instrument in question. However, derivative experts say it is possible to keep a high-yielding, high-risk security in portfolio, and manage the credit risk while still enjoying an above-market return. Brokers are now willing to write an option on the difference, or 'spread' on the yield between the high-risk securities and more secure investment like a Treasury security. The options insulate the customer if the credit risk of his securities increases, while the broker who wrote the specialised option neutralises his exposure by performing an offsetting trade from a global selection of corporate credit deals. These highly-structured instruments are efficient only if the broker has access to a global corporate debt network. To date, credit derivatives' volumes have disappointed their backers, who say lack of liquidity and efficient pricing are limiting the market. Making new commodities out of pollution credits, electricity, and even trash have proved equally frustrating. The US Environmental Protection Agency, in writing the Clean Air Act of 1990, surmised that reducing nationwide sulphur dioxide emissions, a key ingredient in acid rain, might be made cheaper and more efficient if polluters had a set of options to choose from. The agency assigned each main sulphur dioxide polluter (mostly coal-burning electricity plants) certificates representing allowable levels of emissions. If the power generating company chooses to abate its sulphur dioxide output by switching to cleaner fuels or installing a costly smokestack scrubber, it is free to sell its excess allowances to another polluter. Over time the allowances expire, with US sulphur dioxide emissions due to fall to half of their present levels by 2,000. Trading experts such as New York-based Cantor, Fitzgerald and the Chicago Board of Trade tumbled over each other to capture this new market-in-the making two years ago. However, time and experience have proven that utilities, quasi-public entities which rarely have to deal with market forces of any kind, do not make carefree traders. Although the Chicago Board of Trade has conducted two annual pollution allowance auctions, and Cantor and other dealers have brokered private allowance trades, the majority of utilities have banked their allowances and pursued more costly abatement solutions. Mike Walsh, senior economist at the Chicago Board of Trade, notes that the emission allowance program, to be a success, does not require active trading. 'In fact, it's working very well - companies are switching fuel, retiring dirty units, and many companies are trading allowances within their own operations, transfers that don't show up publicly,' he says. However, the limited trading has dashed hopes for a derivative market in pollution credits. Mr. Walsh said the Chicago Board of Trade has shelved its plans to trade pollution allowance futures until a viable primary market develops. In fact, the rapid deregulation of the electric power industry in the US may rekindle interest in allowance trading. However, Mr Walsh and others believe that electric utilities will first learn to use futures and options to price and hedge their electricity output as their markets become freer. The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's leading energy futures market, has plans to introduce electricity futures within the next year.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

True, the sun was shining on Wolverhampton and she had just completed a 15-month struggle to secure financing for the UK's largest non-fossil fuel electricity generating plant. Rather, she was a trifle wan. It was all a bit of an anti-climax, said the US businesswoman. It had been a close-run thing. She told the lawyers in London at 11.20pm on Tuesday that either everybody signed up or she would walk away from the Pounds 49m project, which will use about 20 per cent of the UK's scrap tyres. Come what may, she was catching the 11.40pm train to Wolverhampton. The agreements were signed. But the signatures were obtained about a year later than Mrs Evans had expected. In October 1990 she was talking of a Pounds 36m project on the site of an old Wolverhampton iron foundry. Now there is Pounds 13m more at stake - and it is that extra sum which caused a year of difficult negotiations and a final five days of tetchy discussions. Mrs Evans's company, Performance Services Corporation of Hebron, Connecticut, acts as a consultant on the use of scrap tyres in energy production. The Wolverhampton project, whose company name is Elm Energy, stems from the Department of Trade and Industry's desire to be rid of a growing mountain of waste tyres. Originally the scheme was to have been financed by Pounds 12m of equity and Pounds 24m of bank borrowings. Final financing is Pounds 14.5m equity and Pounds 34.5m of debt. So Mrs Evans had to persuade her equity backers to put up more money, and to persuade the banks to lend more. The cost escalation came from a number of factors. Finding a contractor proved difficult. Eventually a consortium of Tarmac of Wolverhampton and Black  Veatch Engineering of Kansas City agreed to take on construction - Tarmac for its building expertise, Black  Veatch for its knowledge of plant mechanics. Designers then altered the plans to increase the plant's output. This is set at 25MW, to be sold to Midlands Electricity as power for about 25,000 homes. Land-reclamation costs rose. Applications for a Pounds 2m reclamation grant were accepted by the Department of Environment but rejected by the Treasury. As the costs rose so did Mrs Evans's demands on her US partner, Nipsco Development, a subsidiary of the Indiana electricity utility. Nipsco had first agreed to put up Pounds 4m. The amount grew and at the end of last week the US company threatened to pull out. The more Nipsco put up as equity, the more Mrs Evans's stake was diluted. She now has 5 per cent, Nipsco 95 per cent. The banks were cautious. In the background was concern about the rapidly changing pattern of environmental regulation, not to speak of more stringent lending policies. Mrs Evans said she has a 13-year non-recourse loan at a margin over base rate, but only after the contractors had been tightly screwed down. They have a Pounds 38m fixed-price contract with performance guarantees. Work began yesterday.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

Taxpayers may still have to pay up to 2.9 billion pounds to  enable Britain's ageing Magnox reactors to be taken out of  service, the 100-page report, by the Science Policy Research  Unit at Sussex University, says.    The study was commissioned by the government's Radioactive  Waste Management Advisory Committee, which advises it on the  methods and costs of dealing with civil nuclear waste.    The high and unpredictable costs of decommissioning nuclear  sites have been one of the nuclear industry's greatest  headaches. The uncertainty was the main reason for the  withdrawal of the nuclear industry from the 1989 electricity  privatisation.    The National Audit Office has estimated that future  decommissioning could eventually cost 18bn pounds and that the  taxpayer might have to foot the bill as well as the nuclear  industry.    The research unit report says that annual provisions of  between 1m pounds and 5m pounds for new plants could be  sufficient to pay for their eventual decommissioning. It points  out that this is a small proportion of the income of 200m pounds  a year which a typical plant generating 1100MW might earn.    Accurate estimates, however, are hard to make until ""real  progress is made"" towards the construction of a store for  nuclear waste. Plans to develop a store in the rocks underneath  Sellafield in Cumbria have been delayed several times.    The fund would not solve the problem of decommissioning the  Magnox reactors, the report says. ""Over a decade's worth of  provisions were effectively `lost' at privatisation of the  electricity industry and expected decommissioning costs have  risen rapidly in real terms over the last decade.""    In a separate report the advisory committee says:  ""Government  could be the guardian of the fund but public confidence might be  enhanced if the fund was truly independent and retained for the  sole purpose of decommissioning plant.""

""The tobacco harvest, the food program, and the  sugar harvest will be given absolute priority in terms of oil  supplies for 1994, Lage said after touring tobacco producing  areas in the western province of Pinar del Rio.    Lage, considered the architect of the limited Cuban economic  reforms, said the current tobacco harvest could be the best  quality seen for the past few years if current weather  conditions continue.    The lack of fertilizer and oil to operate equipment also  affected Cuban tobacco production, a traditional export product.    Nevertheless, Lage said that this year the oil supply  situation -- the Achilles' heel of the feeble Cuban economy,  which has been affected by a serious crisis since the beginning  of the decade -- will improve this year.    The shortage of oil (with its corollary lengthy power  outages), passenger buses, and food were the main hardships the  island's 11 million inhabitants faced last year.    The state-run Cuban Petroleum Enterprise (Cupet) announced  during the first week of this year that it ended 1993 with a  record production of 7.7 million barrels of heavy national crude  oil with a high sulfur content.    Engineer Agustin Jimenez, director of the Maximo Gomez  thermoelectric plant, admitted that the amount is barely enough  to generate 40 percent of the electricity consumed on the  island. Using that type of crude also causes excessive corrosion  to burners and other equipment.    Cuba received an average 91 million barrels of oil per year  in 1989 from the former USSR.    According to president Fidel Castro, the island's economy  cannot function with less than 43 million barrels per year, most  of which must be purchased on the international market or with  sugar traded to Russia.    The authorities are determined to reach production levels of  4.5 to 4.6 million tons of sugar this year. That figure is only  a few hundred tons more than the 1992/1993 harvest, which was  the poorest in the last few decades.     "

Dutch-led opposition to the Brussels liberalisation plan, originally to have been in place when the single market starts in January, snatched away what the current UK presidency of the EC had identified as one of its most desired trophies. Under pressure from Denmark, EC nations also postponed until next year any decision on a proposal to boost competition in oil and gas drilling and exploration. The plan would prohibit governments from giving preference to companies from their own nations in the granting of prospecting and drilling licences. The British energy secretary, Mr Timothy Eggar, said a decision could be taken on the proposal during the first half of next year when Denmark holds the EC's rotating presidency. Diplomats said Denmark may have vetoed the plan if the other 11 EC nations had tried to push it through. Under EC rules, any member nation can veto a measure it judges harmful to vital national interests. But the veto is rarely used. Norway also opposes the competition plan. Though not an EC member, Norway could try to block the project through the terms of a free trade accord which it - and six other non-EC members - signed earlier this year with the Community. The Commission proposals aim to open national gas and electricity networks to greater competition from next year, by giving large energy users the right to buy from suppliers anywhere in the EC. This facility would then be extended to smaller energy users from 1996. The ministers in their conclusions asked Brussels to 'consider modifications'. That 'is not withdrawal or amendment', but looking at things like transitional periods, UK officials said.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

As of the  release of this news, nearly 40 counties and cities have been  affected by the rain which has claimed 16 lives.    Affected by a warm and wet current, most of the province has  been generally hit by heavy rain since early this month.  Sanming district was badly hit with its 11 counties and cities  covering 130 towns and 1,450 villages facing emergency  situations. Of them, Yongan city and the counties of Ninghua  and Qingliu received over 300 millimetres of rain and Sanming  city as well as the two counties of Youxi and Mingxi by over 200  millimetres of rain. The rest of the province received rainfall  of more than 100 millimetres. The flood peak level of the river  at Ninghua was put at nearly 14 metres, the most dangerous flood  peak level in recorded history. Affected areas within the county  had their supply of water and electricity cut while roads  leading from the county and telecommunication facilities were  all damaged. The greatest flood peak in the past 40 years was  seen in the Minjiang River valley at Youxi county because of the  heavy rain and most parts of the land and villages situated on  the plain were flooded.    Statistics show that damage in Sanming prefectures alone  included 200,000 houses, the collapse of 15,000 others with 16  deaths. Some 61,000 hectares of crops were inundated and the  direct economic loss was put at RMB [Renminbi] 650 million.

0,FT924-2658 ,"FT924-2658 _AN-CLKB5ADFFT 921211   FT  11 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Economics and energy prices   ANYONE UNDER the illusion that the furore over the future of the British coal is capable of simple resolution would do well to read the report published yesterday by Professor Stephen Littlechild, director general of the Office of Electricity Regulation. Its complex tabulations and reasoning about the wisdom of the electricity industry's so-called 'dash for gas' serve to illustrate how difficult it is to be confident about judgments which by definition involve guesswork about the likely course of fuel prices over very long periods. Prof Littlechild's view is that in signing up for substantial quantities of gas-fired electric power, Britain's regional electricity companies did the right thing. He argues that the price they will pay for their gas is lower than the price they could have obtained in seeking more coal-fired capacity via the two big national generators, National Power and PowerGen. Prof Littlechild is also sympathetic to the argument of the regional companies that, faced with the National Power-PowerGen duopoly, it is in their interest to open up additional sources of generation. Offer's calculations were instantly challenged yesterday by National Power and others, but those who lack the specialist knowledge to do their own arithmetic are likely to conclude that Offer's figures are the least partisan and most trustworthy available. Offer's critics maintain that the regulator also has a vested interest in diversifying ownership in electric power generation and hence in backing the dash for gas. Indispensable tool The immediate point for the government, as it approaches the end of its review of the October decision to close 31 coal mines, is that it should now discount the gas issue in its reassessment of coal's future. Unless government can be satisfied that Prof Littlechild has got his numbers wrong, the option of mothballing or delaying completion of gas-fired capacity is out. The underlying point is that, whatever the difficulties, economic analysis of the kind published yesterday by Prof Littlechild is an indispensable tool of energy policymaking. It is one of the more disgraceful aspects of British energy policy over the years that it has seldom, if ever, been based upon rigorous work of this sort. Uncompetitive prices Instead, politicians have preferred to lurch from project to project, arguing pointlessly about whether energy policy needs to exist at all (yes, says the Labour party; no, said the Thatcherites.) The danger with the first view is that it quickly turns into a command economy, with politicians responding to short-term pressures and making bad decisions which result in uncompetitive energy prices. This was British energy policy from 1945 to 1979. The legacy of the latter (British energy policy 1979-1992) is a series of major decisions on privatisation, new pits and power station projects taken without any attempt to understand and allow for the economic links between them. In energy, a decision about electricity is also inescapably a decision about coal, nuclear, gas and oil. If Britain is to retain, as it must in the interests of a competitive economy, its momentum towards regulated markets in energy, it is essential that transparent data about prices are available both to the market, the regulator and to the politicians who will still be required to take some decisions, whether for social, environmental or security reasons. It may well be that in response to the rebellion on its back benches the government will decide that it wishes to maintain or even increase the level of subsidy to the coal industry in order to save miners' jobs. If so, ministers should ensure that at the very least the price of this transaction is visible: either as direct subsidy from general taxation or a quantified levy on electricity consumers. There will be powerful instincts to the contrary. Transparent subsidies attract the attention of the European Commission, and electricity consumers have proved to be obligingly supine in accepting the existing toll to pay for uneconomic nuclear power. But when it comes to energy policy, the oldest advice is the best: let there be light.  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "
0,FT942-2406 ,"FT942-2406 _AN-EFTD4ABMFT 940620   FT  20 JUN 94 / Inefficiency and bad maintenance attacked: World Development Report      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   The World Bank is urging a complete reorientation of policy on infrastructure provision in developing countries, to shift the focus from building new roads, electricity plants and water pipelines towards ensuring such installations provide the service they were designed for. An extensive analysis of infrastructure issues in the latest edition of the World Bank's annual world development report shows that about Dollars 200bn (Pounds 132bn) a year of infrastructure investment in developing countries has greatly increased access to electricity, sanitation, paved roads, telephones and water. But inefficiency and poor maintenance have meant that money is wasted and service is patchy. 'The report's main message is clear: there has been too much emphasis on the stock of infrastructure built and not enough on the service provided,' said Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank's president. 'The emphasis everywhere must be less on cutting ribbons to open new facilities and more on ensuring that those facilities deliver the intended services,' he added. The report notes that spending Dollars 1m to reduce the very high losses of electricity in transmission and distribution networks could save some African countries Dollars 12m in generating capacity, while the proportion of water delivered to the field in irrigation projects is typically only 25-30 per cent, compared wth 40-45 per cent in the most efficient projects. World Bank highway projects primarily involving maintenance produce returns that are almost twice as high as those concentrating on new road construction. But almost Dollars 13bn worth of roads - one third of those built in the last 20 years - have eroded for lack of maintenance. Overall, the World Bank estimates that technical inefficiency such as leaking water pipes, electricity transmission losses and railway overstaffing costs the developing world Dollars 55bn a year. In addition, it calculates that inefficient pricing structures that fail to recover costs fully from users cost developing country governments Dollars 123bn a year. These inefficiencies cause great hardships not only for the very poor but also for businesses, the report says. A study in Istanbul showed that nearly all households used back-up water supply systems such as wells, rivers and street vendors because of the unreliability of publicly supplied water. For the poorest households, however, these back-ups cost 5 per cent of total income, while for the richest it was only 1 per cent. Another survey of 179 businesses in Nigeria showed that more than half owned their own electricity generators, an expense which amounted to around 10 per cent of the total machinery and equipment for the largest companies but as much as 25 per cent for the smallest. Yet because Nigerian regulations prevent the sale of surplus power, they operated their generators on average at no more than 25 per cent of capacity. While efficiency of operation is typically much higher in industrialised countries, the report argues that there is nothing inevitable about this. 'Although the availability of infrastructure facilities does increase in step with national income, the efficiency and quality of service delivered is relatively independent of income - that is, low income countries can be good performers, while chronic waste and inefficiency can be found among middle and even high income countries,' said Mr Gregory Ingram, who headed the team that wrote the report. The report suggests three ways in which service can be improved: manage infrastructure like a business, not a bureaucracy introduce competition directly, if feasible, and indirectly if not give users and stakeholders a strong voice and real responsibility. Analysing 42 developing countries the report found that in those with centralised road maintenance systems one third of unpaved roads and more than 20 per cent of paved roads were in poor condition; in those with decentralised systems only 15 per cent of unpaved roads and just over 10 per cent of paved roads were in poor condition. Another study of 121 rural water supply projects in Africa, Asia and Latin America showed that of those where participation by the local population was classified as high, 83 per cent had good maintenance levels and 81 per cent were graded as effective in achieving their goals. Of those where participation was low, 23 per cent had good maintenance levels and only 8 per cent were graded as effective. While non-governmental development groups applauded the World Bank's call for more emphasis on maintenance and for greater user participation, they said that the Bank itself was part of the problem. 'What proportion of Bank infrastructure lending goes to maintenance? There is no figure in the report,' said Mr Paul Spray, head of policy at London-based Christian Aid. The emphasis on improving infrastructural service rather than expanding the stock of infrastructure contained in the world development report echoes a theme which has been repeated in World Bank internal analyses in recent years; most notably in the Wapenhans report, which found an alarming deterioration in the success rate of Bank projects and attributed it in part to an in-house culture that rewarded officers more for the volume of new loans arranged than for success with which they followed through on projects. Although the Bank has taken steps to counter this cultural tendency, it has so far failed to convince many of its critics that it has really changed its spots.

Conceived last month as an international public-relations exercise, to save Mr Major's face from the domestic consequences of Black Wednesday, it was engulfed before it began by the new domestic crisis caused by the British government's decision to close 31 coal mines. Europe's leaders had answered the call to Birmingham, in the hope that they could help Mr Major and save the Maastricht treaty. By the time they arrived, the British government's self-inflicted coal crisis seemed to be rendering their efforts inadequate, irrelevant and derisory. Unfortunately, the summit was much worse than a non-event; it looked and sounded as if the Community was intent on committing collective suicide. The communique was doubtless intended to inspire confidence in the common leadership of Europe's governments, but it sounded like a manifesto of monetarist despair. The accompanying 'Birmingham declaration' had been long touted in advance by the Mr Major's government as the reassuring answer to the complaints of the Euro-sceptics that Maastricht would subject us to a centralised Euro-state. But the declaration released on Friday evening is about as reassuring as a leaky balloon. The Community's dilemma can be simply stated: Europe's governments are failing to persuade their electorates that the European Community, as it now functions, is providing answers to their real problems; and nothing that occurred last Friday will change that situation. In their communique on the economic situation, the heads of government said they were 'concerned' at lower growth and increasing unemployment. Mr Major adopted an equally lofty tone at his concluding press conference, when he said that he 'regretted' the plight of the miners his government had just decided to put out of work. But the millions of unemployed, in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, are unlikely to be impressed by the 12 governments' statement of 'concern', nor appeased by Mr Major's vacuous expression of 'regret'. On the contrary, they are only likely to be interested in Euro-babble if they get the impression that their governments, acting collectively, can do something to halt and then reverse the apparently ineluctable rise in unemployment. Is this the impression that they would get from Friday's summit? In a word, no. On the contrary, all the 12 are able to offer is the same mixture as before. 'Strong co-ordination at the Community level,' they say, 'will help to ensure that the economy of each member state is strengthened by the success of other member states.' The problem is that there has been no effective co-ordination at the Community level (for example, over the fiscal imbalance in Germany which is helping to drive the rest of Europe to perdition); and it is not at all clear what particular 'success' they have in mind. The British and other European governments have tried to cover their policy nakedness, by laying the blame for Europe's troubles on over-centralism in Brussels. They would have us believe that we would all be better off if the Commission stopped interfering in every 'nook and cranny'. Hence last week's declaration on 'subsidiarity'. There are just two problems with this subsidiarity issue: it is an off-shore principle which the UK government does not wish to apply in Britain; and in any case it is entirely irrelevant to the central concerns of the people of Europe. 'We reaffirm that decisions must be taken as closely as possible to the citizen,' says the declaration. But it goes on: 'It is for each member state to decide how its powers should be exercised domestically.' In other words, Britain will continue to be governed by an elective dictatorship, as exemplified by the secretive cabinet decision on the pit closures. Mr Major is not really interested in subsidiarity; he is merely lancing at the windmill of a non-existent European state, in the hope that this will make him look like the champion of the national interest. In any case the subsidiarity issue is just a distraction. Does anybody seriously imagine that 49 per cent of the French voted No mainly because they were worried by 'nooks and crannies'? Of course, the hunting-and-shooting extremists object to Community protection of migrant birds. But the main factor behind the No vote was obviously general economic fear. Here is the nub. The problem is not really future fear of the Maastricht treaty, but present fear of the effects of the single European market, which is relentlessly compressing prices, costs, incomes and growth. The corollary of the new world of cost deflation is that it is putting in jeopardy the European model of society. In Britain this is called the welfare state; on the Continent it is called Christian or social democracy; all these variants are threatened by European and worldwide hyper-competition, because Europe is under increasing pressure to cut out all forms of economic activity which are not immediately profitable. There is of course no magic solution; there are no national solutions, certainly not for Britain. But unless the 12 come up with some policies which seem likely to salvage both the prospects for economic growth and their traditional national models of society, the single market, the Maastricht treaty and even the Community itself could founder with all hands. And that would be a paradoxical and posthumous victory for Thatcherism.  The Financial Times   London Page 40  "

The consequence is one of the more attractive companies the government has ever brought to flotation. Hydro-Electric is easily the smaller of the two vertically integrated Scottish electricity companies, generating, transmitting and distributing power, which are to be floated at the end of May. It serves the northern two-thirds of Scotland, a quarter of the UK landmass but with only 600,000 domestic customers. A low 18 per cent of its Pounds 435m turnover comes from industrial users. That might not seem a very promising basis for a successful electricity company. Until privatisation loomed Hydro-Electric concealed its promise. As the junior partner of the much larger Scottish Power, which called the shots in Scottish electricity, it tended its network of 53 dams and their related hydro-electric power stations in the Highlands, but also built a large power station at Peterhead which can be run on either gas or oil. It saw itself as a utility with a social function, taking power up the glens and out to the islands, though the bulk of its customers live in Aberdeen and Dundee. It had an agreeable public image which persists to this day, and which few other electricity companies in Britain can match. The run-up to privatisation brought separation from Scottish Power and a swapping of generating assets. In the new British electricity industry, in which generators compete and Scotland's ample surplus capacity is now available to England, Hydro-Electric is well placed. Consider its advantages: in power generation its 2,800MW of generating capacity includes 1,000MW of hydro-electric plant, highly dependent on rainfall but operating at with zero marginal cost. Hydro-Electric has access to Scottish Nuclear's nuclear plants and a share of Scottish Power's coal-fired capacity. Peterhead is being adapted and increased to take relatively cheap untreated gas from British Petroleum's Miller field in the North Sea from 1992. Between 50 and 70 per cent of Peterhead's 1,300MW output is committed for sale to Scottish Power. This low cost and flexible mix of power sources enables Hydro-Electric to offer the lowest average domestic tariffs in the UK and competitive tariffs for commercial and industrial customers. Since it has relatively few industrial customers taking more than 1MW it faces little threat from other generators and last year lost only 0.6 per cent of its industrial customers to rivals. The retirement of most of the former management enabled Mr Roger Young, the chief executive who came to Hydro-Electric from the manufacturing company Low  Bonar, to create an almost entirely new senior management mainly from the private sector. With the help of consultants the new team embarked on a big reorganisation, aimed at switching Hydro-Electric from being a state-owned utility to a profit-oriented business. The difficult change of culture, given Hydro-Electric's background, was helped by the fact that it is a relatively small organisation, employing only about 3,700 people, a number which has fallen faster than any of the English regional electricity companies. Roger Young, an affable but intensely determined manager, perceived from the start that most of Hydro-Electric's growth would have to come from outside its own relatively small area, where power consumption is likely to rise by between 1.5 and 2 per cent a year. Hydro-Electric was quicker than some companies in adapting to the new power trading regime in England and Wales when it began a year ago, and also achieved a coup by signing an options contract with BOC, the industrial gases group, as well as Wiggins Teape, the paper manufacturer. Power sales to England have added about 11 per cent to Hydro-Electric's sales in terms of volume and may be worth an extra Pounds 50m on top of expected 1990/91 sales to its own region of about Pounds 430m. But as with Scottish Power, exports from its surplus capacity are limited by the size of the interconnecting power lines to England, with only 300MW of capacity available to Hydro-Electric. Although planning permission is being sought to increase the size of the interconnector, which would give Hydro-Electric an extra 500MW of export capacity, the company has other plans to develop south of the border. Its most promising project is a planned 51 per cent stake in a 700MW combined cycle gas turbine plant to be built at Keadby near Scunthorpe, in partnership with Energy Resources, a north of England company. So far financial backing, gas supply and customers have not been announced but Hydro-Electric believes the Pounds 300m scheme will go ahead. The Keadby project has overtaken the Neptune project for a 1,000MW plant on Teesside, where Hydro-Electric is involved with Northern Electric (BOC recently pulled out of it). If Keadby goes ahead and the interconnector expands, Hydro-Electric could in five years time be selling as much power in England as in Scotland. It is from England that most growth in Hydro-Electric's profits is likely to come. Profits growth in Scotland may be sluggish, with Hydro-Electric being obliged by the regulator to keep its increases in domestic tariffs to just below the rate of inflation (unlike the English regional electricity companies), entailing further improvements in efficiency, though production costs will fall with Miller gas coming onstream from 1992. The government is expected to float Hydro-Electric with a stiff gearing ratio of nearly 50 per cent, knowing that it needs no large new generating plant in Scotland and that it made a respectable Pounds 50m operating profit in 1989/90. That gearing may intially fall but is then likely to increase as Hydro-Electric invests in expanding the interconnector, bears its share of de-sulphurisation costs at Scottish Power's coal-burning plant and tests its management skills in building new generating plants in England.

Mr Savit Bhotiwihok, the minister responsible for energy policy, told a meeting of the Petroleum Institute of Thailand that the government would focus on developing domestic and regional energy supplies to meet electricity demand which is growing by an annual 10 to 15 per cent - or by roughly 1,000 megawatts a year. He said he expected to sign a memorandum of understanding next month with the government of Laos on the purchase of between 1,000 Mw and 1,500 Mw of electricity from proposed hydro-electric and coal-fired power stations in that country. By the end of this year, he added, Thailand and Malaysia could have completed negotiations on the sale of Malaysian gas to feed a power station with a capacity of about 1,800 Mw on or near their common border. A pipeline to the frontier area is already under construction on the Malaysian side. He said other possible sources of energy for Thailand included the offshore exploration zone shared by Malaysia and Thailand, the hydro-electric potential of the Mekong river, Burmese gas, and hydrocarbons from Cambodia and Vietnam. Mr Savit acknowledged that Thailand would continue to import oil from the Middle East but he raised the possibility of a European-style regional gas network and said: 'A lot of our effort nowadays is spent on studying the integration with our neighbouring countries'. The Thai government would vigorously support exploration and development of oil and gas fields in Thailand, and study the possibility of establishing a nuclear power industry. Development of lignite resources would also probably continue, but the government was unlikely to proceed with building new dams solely for the purpose of generating electricity. Mr Savit said that the Petroleum Authority of Thailand would be assigned to explore the possibility of building export refineries and establishing a 'huge' oil storage capacity in southern Thailand to 'stabilise' the regional oil market.

Mr Atkins said: 'The most important of these relates to the funding of the proposed interconnector to Scotland and an application which the government has made to the European Commission for assistance towards its costs. 'The government strongly supports the application and hopes for its success but recognises the need for the commission to undertake a thorough evaluation of it. Consequently, although one option for the flotation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) was November 1992, it will not be possible to complete the sale this autumn. Once the outstanding matters have been resolved, the sale will take place as soon as possible, dependent on a suitable slot in the government's overall privatisation programme.' NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m interconnector project earlier this year and it is thought the government is seeking about Pounds 70m from the commission towards the cost of construction. The first part of the sell-off took place in April when Ulster's four power stations went into private hands. British Gas bought the biggest station, Ballylumford near Larne, East Antrim; Nigen, an American-Belgian consortium, acquired Kilroot station, near Carrickfergus, East Antrim, and Belfast West station. A management-employee buy-out team bought the Coolkeeragh plant at Londonderry. The sales grossed about Pounds 300m for the Treasury. It had been anticipated that the transmission, distribution and supply business would be floated in November, raising a further Pounds 350m for the government. Advertisements have been running almost nightly on Ulster Television promoting the image of NIE, and the postponement has come as a shock.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT921-7287 ,"FT921-7287 _AN-CBVAEAFNFT 920222   FT  22 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity   The government has several motives for its recent wholesale interference in the electricity industry, not least a pre-election wish to prove to domestic consumers that privatisation can bring tangible benefits in the form of lower nominal, as well as real prices. But the crux of the negotiations between Whitehall and the two generating companies in particular is the future of British Coal. The irony can scarcely pass unremarked: the government is seeking to safeguard a future privatisation by pulling strings in a supposedly unfettered industry. In effect, the generators are being asked to forgo some of the extra profits they stand to make after next year from cheaper imported coal. It is difficult to quantify, but if a deal over future deliveries of UK coal is struck, the generators might increase annual profits by 15 instead of 20 per cent. Far from damaging the companies' shares, the effect of lower revenues would be amply offset by the simultaneous removal of political and regulatory uncertainty. A pre-election deal securing a UK coal industry with, say, 40m tonnes of output from 28 pits, is unlikely to be overturned by a Labour government relieved of the need for a subsidy. Nor is it likely to offend the regulator, even though it would do little to promote competition in electricity generation. Some of the gas-fired power stations planned by new entrants to the market would still be uneconomic even given the slightly higher cost of coal.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "
0,FT944-1045 ,"FT944-1045 _AN-ELVDSADRFT 941222   FT  22 DEC 94 / A model in need of overhaul: UK privatisation policy, admired internationally, is under fire at home      By BRONWEN MADDOX   A decade after the flotation of British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, the German state-owned monopoly, is lumbering towards the stock market. The DM15bn Telekom sale, one of the largest in the world, reflects the eagerness with which much of Europe and Asia is now embracing the UK model of privatisation. The transfer of state companies to the private sector, widely regarded as the essence of Thatcherism, remains one of the UK's most popular exports. The collapse of communism, which shook faith in the virtues of state ownership, has helped its international propagation. But in the UK, where sales of state-owned companies have raised nearly Pounds 60bn for the government since 1980, the philosophy is under attack. Customers of the privatised utilities feel that shareholders have been the real winners, with sharp rises in profits and dividends. That grievance has been deepened by steep hikes in directors' pay, notably the 75 per cent rise awarded last month to Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive. In the face of public and backbench criticism of privatised utilities, the government has recently shelved proposed sales of the Forestry Commission, Scottish water, and the Post Office. It is under increasing pressure to demonstrate that past privatisations have delivered the promised benefits. Some privatisations are now less controversial - including British Steel, British Airways, the Rover car-maker and Cable  Wireless, the telecoms group. These all face competition in their markets, and have greatly improved their performance (while many of their international rivals are loss-making). However it is on the performance of the utilities - telecommunications, gas, electricity and water - that privatisation is judged by the British public. With some or all of their businesses effectively monopolies, they have not faced competitive pressures in the private sector. The UK privatisation model relies on independent regulators to curb their monopoly power and encourage economic efficiency through price controls. These controls have taken the form of capping annual price rises according to a formula linked to the retail price index (RPI); in most cases, these are 'RPI-X' formulae that hold rises below the rate of inflation. Of the four, British Telecom provides the most convincing case that the UK model works. A decade ago, BT warned 250,000 customers waiting for new telephone lines that it would not even suggest an installation date; now, it says it will install a new residential line within 48 hours. Before privatisation, telephones had to be rented from BT; now there are hundreds of models on sale in shops. Since 1984, the price of calls has also dropped by an average 40 per cent in real terms. Meanwhile, turnover has doubled to Pounds 13.8bn in the year to March 1994; the 90,000 fall in staff numbers to 150,000 has allowed pre-tax profits to treble to Pounds 2.8bn. The spur has been competition, largely from Mercury, the Cable  Wireless subsidiary, as well as technological change and the price controls. But growth of competition was slower than expected, with some would-be rivals arguing that they were inhibited by the terms of access to BT's network. Privatising electricity presented greater challenges, in the absence of competition in the industry. Radical structural reform during the sale separated transmission and generation. The 12 regional electricity companies (Recs) that supply power to consumers were allowed to compete in generation, to a limited degree. That competition, together with price capping imposed by the regulator, has caused staff numbers and operating costs to fall sharply. But Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxera, the forecasting group, argues that the savings should have been greater since the price of coal, gas, oil and uranium has fallen since privatisation. 'There is little evidence to show that customers are much better off,' he says. Moreover, the industry's restructuring proved unexpectedly controversial when it triggered a 'dash for gas', as generators built power stations using cheaper gas to replace coal as a fuel. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, backed the switch on the grounds that it cut costs and increased competition in power generation. But it also hastened the decline of the coal industry, creating a row over pit closures that harmed the image of privatisation. Despite those concerns, the restructuring of the electricity industry has spared its regulator many of the problems that have confronted his counterpart in gas. The government chose to privatise British Gas with an intact monopoly in transportation and supply of gas. The company was also the only UK buyer of gas from producers. While it has been forced to cut gas prices for smaller customers, initially it faced no price cap in the market for larger customers. The light regulation and unchanged structure were heavily criticised at the time of privatisation. Professor John Vickers, an Oxford economist, says the price controls on British Gas required 'lower productivity gains than those British Gas had previously achieved while in public ownership'.* The government has since introduced curbs on British Gas, including limits on its market share and a requirement to sell gas to competitors to allow them to supply customers. But these fall short of the changes recommended by the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which have both criticised the terms on which competitors can gain access to the British Gas network to deliver their gas to customers. The problems of gas regulation dwindle, however, when set beside those of water where it is impossible to introduce direct competition without creating competing networks of water pipes. The weight placed on the regulator to curb abuse of this monopoly is consequently higher. A complication in his task is that companies have embarked on a Pounds 40bn capital spending programme, to modernise pipes and sewage plants after decades of under-investment and to enable the the UK to comply with European environmental directives. Under the price formula set at privatisation, the costs are passed onto customers, and have pushed bills up by 5 per cent a year above inflation since 1989. Mr Ian Byatt, the water regulator, has criticised the Brussels standards, particularly those on drinking water, for being unnecessarily tough. He has also attempted to lighten the consumer's burden by restraining real price increases for the next 10 years to an average of 1 per cent. But as Professor Colin Mayer, an Oxford economist, comments, it has 'been difficult' for the regulator to determine the industry's cost of capital and to compare companies' efficiency. 'There are no easy answers', he adds. The mixed record of utility regulation indicates that insufficient ambition in creating competition when privatising utilities creates a troublesome legacy for the regulators - even if it helps sell the shares. As Prof Littlechild says: 'However well-intentioned and well-informed price control (is), effective competition is better.' Prof Littlechild originally believed that regulators would be able to introduce enough competition to allow regulation to wither away. However, as Prof Vickers argues, it is 'over-optimistic to view regulation as a stopgap until sufficient competition arrives'. In his view, the regulatory framework and pricing formula have 'so far survived reasonably well'. In recent reviews, regulators have tightened the price curbs, helping customers, at shareholders' expense (although they have satisfied neither customers nor companies). But problems remain. In particular, the terms on which competitors use the telecommunications, gas and electricity networks are hotly disputed. As Professor John Kay of London Economics, the consultancy, says, in the context of telecoms: 'It has been evident since the first stirrings of competition . . . that the terms on which entrants would be allowed access to the incumbent's network were critical'. It is clear that inadequate attention to such problems at the time of privatisation is the cause of many of the complaints about the privatised utilities. The forthcoming privatisation of British Rail is the next chance for the government to show whether it has learned that lesson.

'Public telephones are not working. You have a dual system so you need two types of phone-cards. Phones are being provided faster but we are paying outrageous rates that I think are the highest in the world,' complains Atilio Boron, director of the Centre for European-Latin American Research in Buenos Aires. He thinks dissatisfaction with privatised companies is already rebounding on to the government and its market-oriented economic reforms. 'My feeling is that the honeymoon is over because the model is not delivering the goods.' Given the state of the telephone system and other public services before privatisation, some may think the inconvenience of buying two phone cards is not too much to bear. Many feel the collapse of the public services before privatisation took a lot of the heat out of the arguments over privatisation. Argentines suffered six months of daily power cuts in 1989. 'The electrical crisis provided a dose of reality in the ideological debate,' says Gustavo Petracchi, president of the electricity distribution company Edesur. And the government, which was pouring more than Dollars 2bn a year in subsidies into the nationalised companies during the 1980s, has so far no regrets. According to a just-published study on Latin American productivity by the management consultants, McKinsey, overall productivity in the Argentine telecommunications industry had shown a great improvement after the 1990 privatisation, even by 1992. But at 55 per cent of US levels, total factor productivity was the lowest of the five Latin countries it surveyed. This, it says, is due to 'a chaotic situation' which previously prevailed, but agrees that telephone charges in Argentina are 'very high'. Faustino Rivero, chairman of Telefonica de Argentina, one of the two companies about which Mr Boron complains, says his company has put in 700,000 lines in 3 1/2 years, an increase of 40 per cent since it took over. Not only that, the company - whose region cost the state Dollars 400m in subsidies in 1990 - is paying taxes. Efficiency increases have been significant elsewhere: deregulation in the oil and gas sector and privatisation of the former oil monopoly YPF has helped the country's oil production to rise from 420,000 barrels per day in 1991 to 650,000 bpd now. Jose Estenssoro, president and chief executive, says YPF alone increased oil output from 289,000 bpd in 1992 to 326,000 bpd last year. 'We are trying to reach 450,000-500,000 bpd of oil by the end of next year and probably another 200,000 in oil equivalent of gas.' He says the company's workforce - 52,000 strong in 1990 - will have been slimmed down to about 6,000 by the end of this year. But the transition to privatisation has not been easy, not least for many of the foreign utilities that are operating the privatised companies. Metrogas, the gas company covering metropolitan Buenos Aires in which British Gas has an important stake, was plagued along with other gas companies with problems of low pressure last year, the first year of privatisation. Transportation capacity was inadequate to cope with demand last winter. This winter, says Rob Verrion, general manager of Metrogas, the company has expanded capacity - and will expand it further - and the complaints about low pressure have fallen. This was not the only problem. The standard of local contractors left much to be desired. As well as encouraging some local contractors to improve working standards, new contractors are moving in from abroad, including a subsidiary of the UK construction group Amec, an important contractor for British Gas. Dissatisfied with their invoicing contractor, Metrogas switched its entire database from one system to another overnight 'in what can be best described as a commando operation'. Without a good database it was impossible to put together effective credit controls - particularly important in a country with 'a history of not paying invoices for public services', says Mr Verrion. 'It's not everybody and it's not necessarily the poor people,' he adds. Stealing gas is one issue faced by the gas companies, but for the electricity companies, the problem of fraud was worse. Gustavo Petracchi, president of the distribution company, Edesur in which Chilean investors have an important stake, says that, when it took over, 26 per cent of the company's electricity was being stolen. 'The losses of energy through fraud in greater Buenos Aires alone could provide power for the city of Cordoba - which has 1m people,' he says. Fraud from Edesur has now been cut back to below 20 per cent, and by the end of the year should be 17 per cent. Mr Petracchi complains that the problem could have been tackled earlier if it had not been for political intervention by the province of Buenos Aires in early 1993. Since May, an agreement has been in place to allow the issue to be confronted. But at least Mr Petracchi avoided the difficulties of its neighbouring distributor. In May last year, a judge ordered the arrest of Angel Zapalorto, a manager at Edenor, after he cut off power to slums to stop illegal tapping into the electricity network. Mr Zapalorto spent 72 hours in jail before being released. The companies also suffered from internal fraud. Mr Petracchi said the workforce was 'riddled with corruption both open and hidden, and not only in the purchasing department'. Morale was low and still has not recovered, while the number on the payroll has dropped from 7,600 to 4,500. Workers laid off have received pay-offs averaging Dollars 30,000. Both gas and electricity companies have also received fines from their regulators. The companies have been unhappy about this, since they believe that allowances should be made for the dilapidation of the systems before they took over. 'We have a late 20th century regulatory model imposed on a gas system built in the early to middle part of the century,' says Mr Verrion at Metrogas. As the World Bank notes in its 1994 World Development Report: 'Although privatisation has occurred rapidly, the capacity for regulatory oversight has lagged.'

Like the others, Peru suffered from the debt crisis - low prices for its commodity exports combined with high real dollar interest rates on its bloated external debt. Its problem was made much worse, however, by the incredible economic incompetence of the Alan Garcia administration 1985-90, and by an ever increasing campaign of terrorism with which neither the Belaunde nor the Garcia governments were able to cope. Peru which today and 10 years ago had 5 per cent of the Latin American population has over the same period seen its share of the regional GNP fall from 4.4 per cent to 3.4 per cent, as real GNP fell by 115 per cent. Today as Peru turns the economic corner, the Fujimori administration has to cope with the past drastic deterioration in public services that accompanied economic decline. The answer for telephones, electricity, and ports is no doubt privatisation but other services are a more complicated issue. Peru has one of the highest infant mortality rates in Latin America (69 per 1,000 live births, only exceeded by Bolivia, Guatemala and Haiti), the result of poverty and a very poor water and sewerage system. Illiteracy is also high, exceeded only by the same three countries, plus Brazil. In basic services the government is wisely acting to privatise public electricity and telephones. The public grid had a capacity of only about 4000MW, slightly more than 11 years ago. In the meantime, poor maintenance, disastrous utility tariff policies in the period 1985-90, an over-reliance on hydropower in the drought-prone Andes, as well as frequent terrorist actions against long-distance transmission lines in isolated areas, have meant huge costs for industry and inconvenience for households. Probably 1 1/2 -2 per cent of GNP was lost in 1991 - to apagones (blackouts) and electricity rationing, but the problems continue in 1993. In the Lima area, ElectroLima estimates that 25 per cent of demand in the second half of 1993 will have to be rationed, compared with almost 30 per cent a year earlier. The electricity privatisations are scheduled for a year from now. They should be accelerated as quickly as possible so that the new steam plants on the drawing board can get financed and built. The telephone system with only three lines per 100 inhabitants is to be privatised in the next three months. The privatisers would be wise to give the new owners a decent interval before allowing competition so that the badly needed pre-approved investment programme can be properly financed. Ports should also be privatised as well as water systems for the main four or five cities, where supplies reach only half their target population. This will provide the government with the resources to tackle the huge water and sewerage deficit in provincial areas. The road system has been badly affected by years of terrorism, banditry, and neglect of maintenance. The central highway, the link to the main mining and farming regions of the central Andes has been inaugurated time after time with international agency loans: it is at present near collapse. For the main roads a mixture of partial privatisation, tolls and user charges is the only answer. Improvements to other roads are equally urgent, but have to rely on government money. The choices in health and education are more complex. Industrial countries themselves, the US especially, are wrestling with how to deliver costly social services. As government tax revenues improve - they have reached 11 per cent of GNP compared with less than half that at the end of the Garcia administration in 1990 - the public sector will be in a position to do more, although it should rely on private co-operation and incentives where it can as has happened in Chile. Where will the money come from? Obviously public utilities have to generate enough cash, which they are beginning to do after tariff adjustments in 1990-Pounds 91. Privatisation will force more economical investments, especially in electricity, where over-reliance in the 1970s on marginal and therefore expensive hydro schemes burdens the system. Beyond the cash flow and parsimony, finance will have to come from equity and borrowings. The stock market which has tripled in market captilisation to about Dollars 4.5bn in the last 18 months, will in time be able to provide some equity capital and blue chips such as the telephone companies, which will be under one financial roof after privatisation, will be able to access foreign equity for their expansion, instead of foreign investors simply acquiring undervalued assets as happens now. Water and electricity will need funding from the Washington institutions, especially the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the InterAmerican Development Bank (IADB). The IFC has the advantage over its parent the World Bank of lending dollars instead of yen and not requiring international competitive bidding down to the last screw, a process that often raises the cost of projects rather than reducing it, as is the intention. It is expanding to infrastructure lending in Latin America as its big brother looks more and more to central and eastern Europe. Earlier this year, an international group recommended to the IADB the allocation of at leat 5 per cent of new lending for privatised infrastructure. Leveraging this limited money with proper performance safeguards from governments on utility tariffs and exchange convertibility, the IADB ought to be able to mobilise sizeable funds. If utility privatisation forges ahead the fund should have plenty to do in this re-emerging economy.

That we did not freeze to death is largely thanks to  the concerted work of the AES [nuclear power station]  collectives. In those months, they accounted for 40 percent of  the total electricity produced in Ukraine. All together over  the last year, AES's produced 75,238 million kilowatt/hours, or  33 percent of the total amount of electricity. Moreover, it  costs half of that produced by conventional power stations.  These figures were made public at a briefing held by the  chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy,  Mykhaylo Umanets.    Nuclear Power Engineering    ""We are pleased with the result,"" said Mykhaylo Umanets. ""We  have not let the country down, and this is what matters. Are we  satisfied with the quality of our work? Safe operation is our  quality. Accidents were prevented from happening. It is true  that there were 11 incidents, but, in accordance with the  international scale of nuclear and radiation safety, they were  rated as incidents of first and second degrees, which do not  have in any unexpected consequences.""    Mykhaylo Panteliyovych also regards the cancellation of the  moratorium on the building of new power units, something that  has undoubtedly opened up prospects to the industry, as a  victory of common sense over political intrigue. A decision was  also made to postpone the closure of the Chernobyl station.  This will make it possible to prepare more thoroughly for its  closure and, at the same time, have economic advantages. The  station will continue to produce the electricity that we need so  much for a few more years.    What all of this has cost us! Quite recently, the press  brought to the public's attention the desperate ""SOS"" by the  nuclear industry, which, while selling the cheapest electricity  to the state, did not have money to purchase fuel because of  customers' failure to pay for the energy; it also sounded the  alarm that specialists are leaving Ukraine's AES's en masse.  The reason is the lack of social protection and salaries, which  are lower than those in Russia.    It appears that this alarm was heard. At any rate, the  president issued an decree enabling nuclear specialists to  resolve many of the burning problems by exporting some of the  electricity. The fuel issue has also been taken off the agenda  for several years. The stations will receive the fuel from  Russia in exchange for nuclear warheads from strategic missiles.    Considerable changes for the better have also been achieved  in raising the level of the stations' operational safety. Over  recent years, hundreds of specialists have received training at  nuclear stations in Western countries. Recently a simulator  started working at the Zaporizhzhya AES, and operators of VVR  [water-water)-1,000 nuclear reactors will improve their  qualifications with its help. The installation of a simulator  presented to us by France will soon be completed at the  Khmelnytskyy AES.    Last year, for the first time, the Sevastopol Naval  Institute  admitted two groups of students to specialize in servicing  AES's. The majority of the students are residents of towns with  developed power engineering.    The price we have had to pay for the moratorium will long  remain a pain. Incidentally, it has not yet been determined  numerically in terms of money. However, it is known that, owing  to those politicians who rose high in their careers on  anti-nuclear wings, we have lost 4 billion pre-inflation rubles.  It is precisely such funding that Ukraine did not receive from  the Union budget, after it stopped work building units that were  at a high level of readiness.    This moratorium has now been canceled. Some people have  received political dividends from this and the state -- a  headache: Where, in our budget made up of holes, can we get  such astronomical sums? The sixth unit of the Zaporizhzhya AES  has to be commissioned this year. The second unit of the  Khmelnytskyy and the fourth of the Rivne stations must be  commissioned in 1996.    Nor will it be simple to fulfill this program in view of the  fact that the construction and assembly collectives have, in  fact, deserted the stations. Only superb specialists can and  have the right to build such facilities. However, not even  these problems are a matter of the greatest concern for  departmental heads. Given our political situation, the lack of  clarity is quite disturbing. Where are the guarantees that the  new parliament will not pass a law on a new moratorium?  Decisions to open or close the Chernobyl AES have been made  five times.  Despite everything, specialists are already looking to the  future: the construction of new-generation fast-neutron power  units, which are more economical and more reliable. Canadian,  U.S., French, and Japanese specialists are offering their  designs.    We have our own scientifically substantiated concept on  developing the industry under the headline of creating our own  nuclear cycle in Ukraine. Of course, it is an expensive  undertaking. However, it is worth the huge outlays, because not  only is it economically advantageous, but also politically  expedient, pointed out Mykhaylo Umanets.    ""At present, fuel accounts for 64 percent of the cost of the  electricity produced by the nuclear stations,"" he reasoned.  ""Calculations have shown that this percentage could be halved,  if we did not have to purchase that fuel abroad, considering  that Ukraine is already capable of extracting and enriching  uranium ore to a concentration of natural uranium. We send this  ore to Russian enterprises where the fuel elements are  manufactured. We also send zirconium there, from which the  holders for the cassettes are made. Incidentally, Ukraine used  to have a monopoly on the extraction and production of zirconium  within the USSR. Since we possess it and have specialists at  the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences who may ensure the scientific  implementation of the project, we simply have no moral right not  to use such a potential in the interests of our own state.  These outlays will eventually be returned a hundredfold.  Ukraine could lose its independence if it continues to receive  energy from neighboring states, which often use it to put  pressure on us.     "

0,FT934-8138 ,"FT934-8138 _AN-DKQCRAC0FT 931117   FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (1): Need for a crystal ball - The future of nuclear electricity is shrouded in deepening uncertainty. It is still favoured by developing nations in Asia and the Pacific. But in most western countries, it is bogged down by fears over safety and worries about costs      By MICHAEL SMITH   IT IS possible, some argue likely, that the nuclear power industry will grow significantly from the base it has established as provider of about 17 per cent of the world's electricity. But even the optimists acknowledge that it is a long term prospect which may take more than half a century to fulfil. In the next 10 to 20 years the industry will have to content itself with small annual growths in total capacity and a stable perhaps declining proportion of a faster growing world electricity market. Before the year 2000, at least, most of the growth will be accounted for by a handful of Asian and east European countries and France. In most of the rest of the world, nuclear power companies and the companies which build their power stations will struggle to consolidate the gains of the last 40 years in the face of widespread public cynicism about the industry's costs and safety. The legacy of the Three Mile Island accident in the US in 1979 and the much worse Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is that the nuclear industry will have to spend increasing sums of money to make both its existing plants and new stations far safer than would be expected of a unit fired by other fuels. Nor, in the face of growing pressure on government finances throughout the world, will it be easy for power utilities to gain access to the funds necessary to build nuclear stations, as Nuclear Electric of the UK is likely to find in the next two to three years, as it looks for capital to build a second pressurised water reactor station in Suffolk. Capital markets are extremely wary of committing money to nuclear stations which are far more expensive, and take perhaps twice the time, to build than gas, oil or coal-fired stations. The markets are concerned about rates of return needed to recover the capital costs and remain sceptical that utilities make enough provision for future decommissioning and reprocessing costs when making estimates about the costs of nuclear power. The undoubted economic advantage of nuclear stations is that uranium, the raw material needed to fuel them, is cheaper than inputs for virtually all other forms of power and this advantage will grow as resources of coal, oil and gas become scarcer and more expensive. It was partly for this reason that the World Energy Council, a non-government organisation representing more than 100 countries, predicted in a recent report, Energy For Tomorrow's World, that nuclear power is one of two energy sources most likely to meet electricity demand in the second half of the next century, the other being coal. However the council's prediction is based on the assumption that world gas and oil will begin to dry up within 50 years. That is by no means certain. The energy industry's critics believe that oil and gas companies consistently under-estimate reserves as part of an effort to keep prices high. Gordon MacKerron, of Sussex University's Science Policy and Research Unit, is among those who believes reserves may last longer. 'We are discovering gas four times faster than annual consumption and have done for at least a decade,' he points out. If the long term prospects for nuclear power are debatable, controversy also surrounds the short term outlook. Latest figures from the International Atomic Energy Authority are that there are 72 nuclear units under construction against an existing world total of about 424 units. But some forecasters and academics argue that this is over-optimistic because some of the plants will not be completed. In addition some of the new plant will replace stations which are being retired. Prospects around the world vary considerably. ASIA: Japan has the world's largest expansion programme, having set a target of increasing the proportion of nuclear power in electricity generation from under 30 per cent to 40 per cent, but there are doubts about whether it can achieve it. Japan's enthusiasm for nuclear power stems from its lack of natural fuel resources and its experiences from oil price rises. If the plans were met, the current capacity of 35,000 megawatts, supplied by 42 stations, would increase to 75,000MW. Utilities are acutely conscious, however, of the growing power of the environmental lobby and believe the lack of potential sites for building new plants and the stabilisation of Middle East politics will dampen the government's enthusiasm. Korea, like Japan, is also anxious to diversify from other forms of fuel and is constructing three stations to add to the nine providing 7000MW which are already in operation. Among non-nuclear power countries, the most likely new entrant is Indonesia, but it is unlikely to make a decision before 2002. China and India provide perhaps the best hope for the industry in the medium to long term, with the construction of nine plants between them already under way, and more likely to follow. AMERICA. Since the Three Mile Island accident there have been no new orders in the US and several projects have been cancelled. However, US companies are at the forefront of technological advances by developing a new generation of safer reactors and the government is in talks with the industry to ease complications surrounding site licensing. There are hopes of new orders within the next few years. Previous enthusiasm in south America for nuclear power has been dampened by debt problems and is unlikely to revive in the medium term. WEST EUROPE. With the exception of France, and just possibly the UK, prospects are uniformly bleak. France has eight reactors under construction or planned and the UK's Nuclear Electric has requested planning permission for Sizewell C in Suffolk. However, even if Nuclear Electric can gain permission, it faces a far more difficult task in getting finance for a project expected to cost up to Pounds 3.5bn. It also has to steer a successful course through the government's nuclear review, planned to start later this year, and likely to consider whether further nuclear power stations are necessary. Most of the rest of western Europe has imposed moratoria on nuclear power. Optimists place their hopes of revival in Finland - even though its parliament recently turned down plans for a fifth reactor - and in Italy which closed its nuclear stations after Chernobyl but may consider new stations if safety improves. There are also grounds for hope that Sweden may not end up being as anti-nuclear as it has planned. Sweden has a policy of phasing out nuclear energy but nearly half of its electricity come from nuclear power and efforts to replace this are progressing slowly. German prospects look poor amid difficulties of reaching a consensus on nuclear power. The environmental lobby is powerful, one reason why none of the nuclear reactors in the former East Germany are in operation. EAST EUROPE. Russia has revived plans for significant expansion, aiming to increase nuclear's share from 12 per cent to 30 per cent of the electricity generation by 2030. Although it has plentiful supplies of oil and gas it needs to export these for hard currency. But the same lack of resources may force a severe scaling down of the plans which involve the construction of more than 20 reactors. At the very least Russia is likely to need World Bank help if it is to proceed. In the Ukraine, unable and unwilling to buy Russian gas, the parliament recently voted to resume construction of three nuclear plants where work had stopped and the continued operation of Chernobyl. That worries the rest of the world nuclear industry which fears that another accident like 1986, whether at Chernobyl or anywhere else, will put plans for increasing expansion off for years and possibly for ever. The need to reduce the likelihood of a further disaster prompted the industry in 1989 to form the World Association of Nuclear Operators. Since then the association has helped facilitate a series of exchanges between eastern and western nuclear scientists. Mr Remy Carle, chairman of the WANO governing board and deputy general manager of Electricite de France, told the Uranium Institute annual symposium in London recently that avoidance of accidents was one of four lines of attack the industry should pursue to help bring about a revival. The other three were resolving problems over waste, developing 'even safer' power stations and fuel designs, and trying to make nuclear power accepted as a 'perfectly normal energy resource'. Providing these problems are tackled, he says, the industry is set for recovery. 'The nuclear industry will take off again when there is a strong need for it.' That implies what many other people in the industry believe: that conditions for growth depend on the world economy, supplies of other fuels and other factors over which the nuclear industry has little control.

Traders commented that it was uncertainty over official US policy towards the dollar that was upsetting London stocks rather than any precise analysis of the implications for profits at the blue chip companies. The market opened firmly as London responded to the dollar's rally late on Friday, which followed suggestions from Washington that the US authorities would intervene to support the currency. Helped also by a rebound in stock index futures, the FT-SE 100 Share Index jumped by 20 points to 3,052.9 in early deals. Trading volume was painfully thin, however, and gains melted as the dollar failed to live up to its early promise and UK government bonds shaded lower. Confidence also cooled when bonds softened following regional consumer price data from Germany. But the market held the line when Wall Street opened higher, and it was not until dollar weakness had turned the Dow Average downwards and bond markets had extended their falls that the Footsie slipped into negative territory. The Dow was 6 points off in UK hours. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index showed a net fall of 3.7 at 3,029.1 and dealers looked with some concern at the approach of the 3,000 level. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed 2.2 to 3,500.2 as buyers continued to back away across the broad range of the market. A more revealing picture of the day's trading came from the official business volume figures. Turnover through Seaq, the market's electronic trading network, fell by nearly 12 per cent from Friday's figure, returning a total of only 456.3m shares. This is well below what are generally agreed to be profitable levels from the point of view of the London-based securities industry. About 60 per cent of the day's trade was in non-Footsie stocks. The fall in market indices would have been greater but for sharp rise in shares in the regional electricity companies after East Midlands Electricity had announced a Pounds 186.5m special dividend payment to shareholders. Other electricity companies have returned cash to shareholders by way of share buy-backs but this policy has become frustrated by the strong share prices in the sector. The market now looks for other electricity companies to follow the East Midlands lead, although there were signs yesterday of political objections. Although the focus was on the dollar-orientated stocks, losses among these issues were not large. Wellcome was a weak spot but this was ascribed to negative comments from a US investment bank known to be bearish on the stock rather than to currency factors. Other pharmaceutical issues also gave ground, but Glaxo managed to hold steady in spite of currency influences. Currency nerves benefited stocks seen as domestically-focused and therefore likely to attract investors seeking to avoid dollar risk. Some store and retail issues gained ground, although buyers were very selective and backed away when the market turned sour. The uncertainty in the London stock market is likely to focus on the next round of data on the US economy, due at the end of the week. On Friday, US gross domestic product statistics for the third quarter will be accompanied by the deflator figure which has been identified as a key factor in the inflation watch maintained by the US Federal Reserve Board. The economic schedule in the UK is quiet this week, and dealers doubt if the latest survey of industrial trends by the Confederation of British Industry will bring any strong response from the stock market.

RWE officials in Essen confirmed yesterday that the two companies were in negotiations but said no agreement had yet been reached. In Madrid, however, it has been reliably learned that RWE and Endesa have agreed in principle to exchange up to 10 per cent of their stock with each other. Until now, the Spanish Government has refused to allow foreign utilities to take stakes in Spanish generators and distributors. But earlier this week the large Spanish private sector utility, Iberdrola, said Tractabel of Belgium had agreed to buy 3 per cent of its stock. RWE is a much larger company than Endesa and it seems likely that any two-way investment would be made for equal amounts of money, giving the German utility a bigger share of Endesa than the Spanish would be able to take in RWE. But analysts said it was unlikely RWE would immediately take up a full 10 per cent of Endesa, which at current share prices would cost Dollars 930m. RWE tried in 1980 to take a stake in a smaller private Spanish utility, Union Fenosa, but was blocked by the Spanish government which was then trying to encourage a series of mergers among local electricity companies. RWE is also understood to be talking to Union Fenosa about collaborating in Czechoslovakia. RWE and other German utilities are seeking to expand into eastern Germany and Eastern Europe. In eastern Germany, though, the big German utilities have run into opposition from local municipalities unhappy with the prospect of handing over complete control of power generation and distribution to the powerful western companies.

To do that, Guangdong will need a great deal more electric power: even today, demand exceeds supply by at least 30 per cent and blackouts are a feature of daily life. The growth in installed electrical generation capacity in Guangdong has been rapid. In 1981, the province had just 2,800MW of installed capacity; by the end of 1992 it was 11,000MW. Over the next 17 years the province hopes to increase capacity by a further 69,000MW to 80,000MW. By then it may have achieved installed capacity of 1KW hour per person, up from its current installed capacity of 0.16KW per person. Hong Kong has installed capacity per person of 1.42KW, Taiwan 0.85KW, and the US about 2.8KW. Guangdong's spending on power plants has grown from USDollars 679m (Pounds 441m) in 1989 to Dollars 795m in 1991. Within that total, the share of imports has risen from Dollars 220m in 1989 to Dollars 430m in 1991. Larger expenditures are expected in the coming years, making the market for electrical generation equipment, transmission lines and computer systems to operate modern power plants one of the biggest in the world. Western analysts in Guangzhou estimate the province's expenditure on power generation and related equipment will grow at an annual rate of nearly 40 per cent over the three years 1992-1995, and imports by more than 50 per cent. Mr Michael Greene, a securities analyst with Warburg Securities in Hong Kong, says: 'The place is crawling with people trying to sell them electrical generation equipment. China has got to be the world's largest market for power generation equipment . . . ever.' Unlike many markets in China for imports, restrictive trade barriers for power generation equipment are few. China's domestic manufacturers, located mainly in the north-east of the country, are unable to supply Guangdong, making it dependent on foreign suppliers. The province has the autonomy to use foreign exchange for imports of power equipment. According to one analyst in Guangdong: 'Because of Guangdong's urgent need to import large amounts of electrical generating equipment, import procedures are not a serious impediment.' Neither is ownership. Although electricity generation is technically a state monopoly in Guangdong, the local government has been prepared to allow significant foreign ownership of power plants. Shajiao B power station in Dongguan is owned and operated by Hopewell, a Hong Kong property company, and the Zhujiang power station, under construction in Guangzhou, is 50 per cent owned by New World Development, another Hong Kong property developer. The province has also entered into inter-regional agreements with neighbouring provinces to develop hydro-electric power. For example, it has joined with Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan to develop hydro-electric facilities on rivers running through their territory. Guangdong also has plans to increase the amount of electricity generated by nuclear power, on current plans more than 20,000MW by 2010. Mr Chen Wen Hu, deputy chief of section in the planning department of Guangdong's Electric Power Bureau, says: 'By 1995 Daya Bay should be producing 1,800MW, but 70 per cent will go to Hong Kong and only 600MW to Guangdong. We have hopes to build three more nuclear power plants. We have finished the preparatory work for the second nuclear plant and in 2000 the first phase - 1,000MW - should begin.' This would still leave nuclear fuels producing less than 30 per cent of the province's needs by 2010. From now until then, the local authorities have thermal power stations planned, or under construction, which will add more than 50,000MW of installed capacity to Guangdong's grid. However, the quality of coal received from northern China and the time it takes to reach power stations are problems.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

0,FT944-2167 ,"FT944-2167 _AN-ELQARAA8FT 941217   FT  17 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Policing the utilities   There is a palpable sense of national unease about the activities of many of Britain's privatised utilities. It is symbolised by the decision of British Gas to station security guards outside its showrooms to deflect the wrath of customers angry at the withdrawal of services. Something seems awry in a world where senior managers get 75 per cent salary increases while seeking to cut the pay of their employees; where massive redundancy programmes run alongside accelerating profits; and where shareholders - yesterday it was the turn of Yorkshire Electricity's lucky investors - receive large payouts while consumers feel they are paying over the odds to what remain monopoly suppliers of essential services. Not all the privatised companies are in the dock. British Telecommunications, after a period of deep unpopularity in the late 1980s, attracts favourable ratings. The contrast between BT and the gas, water and electricity companies explains the unpopularity of the last three. The salary of BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance was notorious while BT was an inefficient, expensive monopoly. Now BT's prices are falling fast; telecoms regulation is seen to be tough; competition between phone operators is a reality in the consumer market; and although a heavy BT redundancy programme is in progress, consumers, not shareholders, are regarded as the main beneficiaries. By contrast, water prices have gone up sharply since privatisation. Gas prices are to rise for many consumers over the next year. Electricity prices are falling somewhat, but by nowhere near the decline in the cost of distribution - the main source of the regional electricity companies' profits. And in none of the three industries is competition yet a reality for most consumers. In water, it will never become so. Caught in the cross-fire In addition, jobs have been shed at a dramatic rate, while dividends and top managers' salaries have risen sharply. It only took the egregious provocation of Mr Cedric Brown's 75 per cent salary increase as chief executive of British Gas, at the same time as the company is seeking to cut the basic pay and holiday entitlement of its showroom staff, for MPs to start calling for public inquiries. The employment select committee this week decided to investigate executive pay in the new year. How justified is the concern? In some respects, the utilities are doing no more than ministerial bidding. The gas and electricity companies were caught in the cross-fire over the government's unpopular decision - now partially abandoned - to levy 17.5 per cent value added tax on domestic fuel. The increase in water charges has been caused in part by onerous EU directives on water quality, which the government tried too late to persuade Brussels to reconsider. That still leaves the fundamental issues of executive pay and the balance which the gas, water, and electricity companies have struck between their employees, shareholders and consumers. Unconvincing claims The arguments about executive pay have been extensively rehearsed in our letters column with respect to Mr Brown. Managers must be paid according to responsibility, and multi-billion industries need to be able to attract top-flight executives. But it is hard to claim that large salary increases and generous share options are required to 'incentivise' individuals who were already willingly in post. It is equally unconvincing to claim that executives need to be rewarded for managing a shift towards competition and business abroad, which has largely still to happen. The public feeling that it comes down to greed is difficult to resist. On cost cutting, the utilities should be offered nothing but applause. In almost all cases, redundancies have been voluntary and on generous terms. The benefit to the nation as a whole from lower utility prices must outweigh any temptation to use the utilities as a source of unproductive employment. Britain has the lowest business telecoms prices of its main European competitors - a significant factor in the competitiveness of its financial services sector, upon which hundreds of thousands of jobs depend. However, in other utilities too much of the gain from improvements in efficiency has gone to shareholders instead of consumers. This is manifestly the case with the regional electricity companies. Interim dividends up to 47 per cent higher than last year are currently being announced. The water and electricity companies have done far better than expected in their cost cutting, but virtually all independent observers believe the regulatory regime established at the privatisation of the two industries was unduly slack, and has been insufficiently tightened in the latest reviews. The boards of the utilities should have greater regard for public sensibilities in setting their salary levels. But it is the regulators who ought to ensure that a fairer balance is struck between consumers and shareholders.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT932-6572 ,"FT932-6572 _AN-DE0B8AHDFT 930527   FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (11): Envy of the neighbours - John Barham notes that energy is a fast-growing sector      By JOHN BARHAM   ARGENTINA has impressive energy resources, but until very recently made little effort to develop them. A virtual state monopoly over the energy sector prevented Argentina from exploiting resources that are the envy of its neighbours. Argentina has: Sufficient oil production to meet domestic needs and produce an exportable surplus. Reserves are estimated at about 240m cu m, equivalent to about 7-8 years' consumption. Gas reserves of about 560bn cu m, equivalent to about 30 years' consumption at current rates. Hydroelectric power that can be harnessed from ten main river systems and several Andean valleys ideally shaped for building dams. The elimination of state monopolies, removal of the crushing burden of over-regulation and liberalisation of foreign investment laws has made energy one of Argentina's fastest-growing sectors. Oil output last year rose 15 per cent to 31.8m cu m. Despite increased consumption, Argentina still exported Dollars 924m in oil and oil products, a 21 per cent increase over 1991. The industry is becoming a magnet for investment and technology. Shell has raised annual investments to Dollars 100m a year, up from an average Dollars 34m a year in the period 1986-90. Receipts from the privatisation of the entire gas industry, plus substantial chunks of the oil and electricity industries already exceed Dollars 6.7bn. Norcen, a medium-sized Canadian independent oil company, has invested Dollars 25m in Argentina, bringing with it technology that had not been applied widely there before, such as three-dimensional seismic prospecting or horizontal drilling techniques. The private companies' new technology and better management have led to the dramatic improvement in production. But there is still much to be done. The Energy Department says Argentine companies recover only about 20-22 per cent of reserves, against an international average of about 40 per cent. The government is benefiting from the oil boom in several ways. First, through privatisation receipts and second, from rising tax and royalty flows from private companies. Furthermore, oil exports to Brazil are expected to rise sharply, offsetting its heavy trade imbalance. More productive investments will also improve the economy's overall efficiency. Fiel, an industry-funded economic think tank, estimates that the state wasted well over Dollars 35bn through inefficient investments, much of them in energy, in the period 1970-1991. Fiel says the private sector should be much more productive investors than the public sector. As part of the privatisation contracts, private operators in the gas, oil and electricity industries are required to make mandatory investments. The gas industry alone, for example, must invest Dollars 612m in the period 1993-97. However the government believes companies will invest a further Dollars 630m of their own accord. In oil - where mandatory investments are lower - the forecast is for Dollars 7.7bn investments in exploration, production, refining and marketing. Industrial consumers will also benefit from more reliable supplies and lower prices. Until recently, large companies often built their own mini power stations to guarantee electricity supplies for their factories, and sold excess power to the national grid. However, Mr Jorge Brea, president of Shell's Argentina subsidiary, warns against complacency. He says sustaining growth in energy output 'will require a very important, sustained effort. The bottom line is that you cannot take it for granted. It requires hard work, investment and yet more investment.' Investment is also badly needed in energy-related infrastructure. The state-owned gas and oil monopolies neglected maintenance of their trunk pipeline networks, with the result that these systems are operating well below capacity, so any large increase in gas and oil output will further strain capacity. However, the construction of a 15,000 cu m capacity pipeline to Chile which will come on stream next year will relieve overload on the transport network in the south of Argentina. The increased oil production will be exported to Chile, while maintaining supplies to the big energy consumers in Buenos Aires. The impending privatisation of state-owned oil giant YPF should further improveefficiency. Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF's president, has devoted most of his energies to restructuring the company to prepare it for privatisation, but spent less time improving its efficiency. Financial market analysts say that YPF's productivity and output should improve considerably when it is transferred to the private sector. The impact of improved management introduced by private utility operators is impressive. When the government transferred last year Central Costanera, one of Buenos Aires' big thermal plants, none of its generators were working but now all seven are working perfectly. Private utility operators - all of them foreign - have also cut down on wastage through leaks and energy theft. This year will also see the privatisation of several hydro dams - including the big Rio Limay complex in southern Argentina - and the Transener national grid company. The Yacyreta dam, built across the Parana river together with Paraguay, should at last begin producing electricity this year. The 2,700 MW dam was designed 20 years ago and has cost about Dollars 12bn. Originally budgeted at Dollars 3.75bn, it has come in six years behind schedule. President Carlos Menem declared he dam a monument to corruption. As Yacyreta and the 1,400 MW Piedra del Aguila dam in the Andes both come on stream, the danger of power blackouts - all too frequent during the past ten years - should become a thing of the past. The government is also playing with the idea of privatising the operation of its two nuclear power stations. The proceeds would be used to complete Atucha II, the country's third nuclear plant, which has been delayed for over ten years by budget difficulties.   Companies:-  Shell Transport and Trading.

0,FT932-142 ,"FT932-142 _AN-DGABBADMFT 930630   FT  30 JUN 93 / Letter: British Gas - monopoly and costs at issue      From Mr C H BROWN   Sir, Your editorial, 'Abolishing the gas monopoly' (June 29), raises some very important issues relating to the public interest. Although the theory of your argument is plausible, a number of the practicalities have not been properly addressed. First, a competitive framework would, as the article rightly concludes, lead to the phasing-out of subsidies to about 12m households with lower levels of consumption. But can it really be in the wider public interest for these people, mostly less well-off, to face increases in their gas bills of up to 94 per cent? Who else would pay? The shareholder or the government (taxpayer)? The present system works efficiently with high levels of customer satisfaction on value for money and quality of service. Prices have come down by 20 to 25 per cent since privatisation, in contrast with the electricity industry where competition has yet to develop and prices have gone up - hardly an appropriate comparison. Our company is neither afraid of competition nor protected from it. On the contrary competitors are now operating in 53 per cent of the firm industrial market, and 13 per cent of the tariff market above 2,500 therms. We have published proposals that will also ensure competition in the interruptible market. There are two further practical hurdles. Accurate metering is essential for developing a competitive market, for without adequate daily measurement and the means of using that information, there would be significant extra costs leading to massive consumer discontent. Huge strides have already been made in producing a technically advanced ultrasonic meter. Field tests are already taking place, but full development is some years away. Again who will pay? But the most critical issue you have overlooked is the safety of gas supply. What distinguishes gas from electricity is that when it fails it is dangerous. That is the main reason why no other country has competition in gas supply to domestic households. This is the single issue on which there must be no compromise.

With regard to comments on pool heater classes, Southern Gas   Association, Energen, South Carolina Gas and Electric, Laclede, and the   Oklahoma Gas Co. proposed that an additional product class for pool heaters be   established_gas pool heaters with automatic ignition. (Southern Gas   Association, No. 4 at 8; Energen, No. 12 at 15; South Carolina Gas and   Electric, No. 34 at 6; Laclede, No. 55 at 6; and Oklahoma Gas Company, No. 57   at 7.)     The Department believes there is no significant difference in consumer   utility between gas-fired pool heaters which use electricity and those which   do not. In addition, pool heaters are customarily installed adjacent to the   pump and filter. Therefore, electricity will be readily available for the   pool heater. The Department decided to keep gas-fired pool heaters as one   class and to consider electricity-using design options as another design   option. Accordingly, the installation and maintenance expenses (in addition   to increased manufacturer costs) associated with design options using   electricity were considered in the economic calculations.     Another product class issue dealt with heat pump pool heaters. Air   Energy Heat Systems (Air Energy Heat Systems, No. 44 at 1) provided efficiency   data. The company stated that coefficients of performance are available in   the mid five's and will reach the low six's in the future.     The Department has adopted American National Standards Institute Standards Z21.561989 and Z21.56a1990 as the test procedure for pool heaters.   The American National Standards Institute standards apply to gas-fired pool   heaters only, not electric resistance pool heaters or electric heat pump pool   heaters. Since a test procedure does not exist for electric pool heaters,   coefficients of performance data were not used in the analysis.         Design options.     As for pool heater design options, the Gas Appliance   Manufacturers Association argued that since pool heaters have ``no flues,'' many   of the design options listed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are   inappropriate, such as use of flue dampers, multiple flues, and increased flue   baffling. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 5.)     Most pool heaters currently being manufactured pass the water through a   heat exchanger pipe which is located inside a combustion chamber above the   burner. This design does not have a flue, and would not benefit from design   options to improve the flue. The Department agrees with Gas Appliance   Manufacturers Association and is not considering these design options.     One company took issue with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers   Association's comments about flue dampers not being an appropriate design for   pool heaters. Flair said, ``We know of several manufacturers who build boiler-type pool heaters equipped with flues.'' (Flair, No. 85 at 1.) Flair also   recommended that the Department evaluate a water heater design option of   automatic ignition with a flue damper for pool heaters. (Flair, No. 85 at 2.)     The Department is not aware of any residential pool heaters being   manufactured currently with separate boilers or tanks that store water at   elevated temperatures. Flue dampers are effective only at reducing standby   losses from storage tanks. Therefore, flue dampers were not considered.   Automatic ignition was included as a design option.         Other comments.     One comment dealt with pool heater test procedure issues.   The California Energy Commission stated new test procedures are needed for   oil-fired, electric resistance, and heat pump pool heaters, and the gas-fired   pool heater test needs to include standby losses so that intermittent ignition   devices are credited for increasing the energy factor. (Commission Energy   Commission, No. 24 at 5.)     Modifications to the test procedures for pool heaters, which address   these issues, are contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking referenced   above.        "

Professor Stephen Littlechild drew strong criticism two months ago when he announced a set of price controls on regional electricity companies that sent share prices soaring to record levels. The view among politicians was that he had been too soft and even the City acknowledged he was less tough than he could have been. In the past six weeks or so, however, the shares have under-performed. In some cases, they have sunk to levels below where they were immediately before Littlechild's announcement. So, after three years of largely uninterrupted growth, has the bubble burst? The question will have particular concern for shareholders in Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric. When price controls were imposed on them last week, shares fell immediately as the market judged they had been given a tough time by the regulator. National Power and PowerGen, and Northern Ireland Electricity, have been feeling the breeze, too. Although not subjected to regulatory reviews recently, they have been hit by falls in the sector and the market. So what, then, are the prospects for electricity companies? In general, they remain at least reasonably good but there are some clouds around. The Labour party is perhaps the biggest threat. Although it seems to have ruled out re-nationalising the companies, it could impose a windfall tax on the profits of privatised utilities - a possibility confirmed this week by Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. Although change is much less likely under the Tories, it cannot be ruled out. The government appears increasingly sensitive to criticism that the utilities, particularly electricity, are not policed tightly enough, and a cabinet committee is examining regulation. Politics apart, there is plenty of potential to keep shareholders smiling in the medium to long term, so reinforcing the arguments of Littlechild's critics. Some of the uncertainty surrounding most of the companies recently will lift in the next few months, particularly in the case of the regional electricity companies (RECs) in England and Wales. The main doubts for REC shareholders have centred on the National Grid, the transmission company which the companies plan to float next summer. The RECs are putting considerable effort into minimising the capital gains tax they will have to pay. The outcome of talks with the Inland Revenue could make a difference of up to Pounds 1bn in their bill, although most analysts believe the market has made allowance already for the worst scenario and that share values will grow when the details of flotation have been decided. Sorting out the National Grid will allow the companies to press ahead with other ways of improving share earnings. Most have started share buy-backs but completion will, in most cases, have to wait until after the results season, which starts next month and ends in mid-December. Analysts expect the results, from the first half of the year, to produce pleasant surprises. With Littlechild's review over, dividend growth is more likely to exceed expectations than disappoint them. Indeed, the City is expecting at least 6 to 8 per cent real growth a year from all RECs for the rest of the decade. For all of these reasons, analysts view the shares as good value. But there is less enthusiasm for the Scottish companies. Privatised later than the RECs, they have always been squeezed by tougher controls. Hopes that the regulator might ease these significantly in his review were dashed. The Scots have no National Grid to sell and no immediate plans to buy back shares. Most analysts think they have less scope to increase dividends, even if real growth is likely to be 5 per cent minimum a year. Even so, some analysts feel the Scottish shares have fallen too much since the review; they point out that both companies have potential to increase their unregulated earnings by exporting power to the rest of the UK. Nonetheless, the companies - Hydro, in particular - are struggling to overcome the feeling that their prospects are less exciting than those of the RECs. National Power and PowerGen are considered to have better basics although their shares have been unsettled recently. One reason was the uncertainty created by the government's sale next February of its remaining 40 per cent stakes in the companies. Another is the revival in the dash for gas by rivals: the more independent gas-fired stations that come on stream, the less room there is in the market for the two companies' older, coal-fired stations. A further problem is that they have agreed a deal with the electricity regulator under which they will try to sell off 6,000mw of capacity by the end of next year. Failure to do so could cause them to be referred to the Monopolies Commission, although that seems unlikely. But the two companies do have strong balance sheets and above-average dividend growth is expected of both: indeed, some analysts believe they can increase dividends by more than 15 per cent a year. Northern Ireland Electricity's image as sector star has been dented following the reviews involving the mainland companies. While these were under way, some investors bought NIE as a hedge against tough price controls in England, Scotland and Wales. Still, NIE continues to be regarded highly and, as it was privatised only last year, many of the rewards of cost-cutting lie ahead.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          ELECTRIFYING FACTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     Market     Dividend                                 Pre-tax profits       Value      yield                             Year end    Pounds m    Pounds m    percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Midland Electricity       3/94        51.2      1,562.3       3.96 Eastern Group                  3/94       176.8      1,912.7       3.87 London Electricity             3/94       186.5      1,493.7       4.11 Manweb                         3/94       126.3        904.5       3.99 Midlands Electricity           3/94       195.4      1,514.0       4.06 National Power                 3/94       677.0      5,995.1       3.34 Northern Electricity           3/94       128.7        931.6       4.10 Norweb                         3/94       178.3      1,300.6       3.82 Northern Ireland Electricity   3/94        74.9        597.5       3.92 Powergen                       4/94       476.0      4,173.7       2.98 Scottish Hydro-Electricity     3/94       164.2      1,207.9       5.02 Scottish Power                 3/94       351.1      2,717.3       4.65 Seeboard                       3/94       131.7      1,013.2       3.64 South Wales Electricity        3/94       104.0        780.3       4.17 South Western Electricity      3/94       116.8        910.7       3.97 Southern Electricity           3/94       222.0      1,937.7       3.97 Yorkshire Electricity          3/94       149.0      1,447.8       4.23  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Scottish Power.

The Shutting Down of Nuclear Power Stations  Presages a Power Catastrophe'']    [Text] It could happen as early as February. The Russian  president and government will find it necessary to introduce a  state of emergency. This was stated by directors of nuclear  power stations who gathered in Moscow. They warned that, as  early as February, the Leningradskaya, Smolenskaya, Kurskaya,  Novovoronezhskaya, Kolskaya, and Bilibinskaya power stations  will be unable to operate, and hence they will have to shut down  their reactors.    Yes, the ``greens'' who have been ``at war'' for some years  now with the aid of their Western colleagues against Russia's  nuclear electric power stations [AES's] can celebrate a  ``victory.'' In the situation which has developed our power  stations are simply physically incapable of operating, since  there is no fuel, it is impossible to carry out systematic  repairs, and there is no money to buy spare parts and  consumables. And this is at a time when the only sector in  Russia which has not decreased production since 1991 and has not  permitted a slump [sentence as published]. Moreover, on the  results of the work for 1993 our nuclear power stations were  superior in virtually all indicators to the AES's of France and  the United States. This applies to the reliability of  operation, the number of breakdowns, and the performance of the  service personnel. These are not ``our'' statistics, but the  conclusions of international experts and organizations.    It should be remembered that in the European part of Russia  AES's produce almost one-half of the electricity, and one-fourth  of this goes to such centers as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Add  to this the fact that ``nuclear'' electricity is two to three  times cheaper than the price which we, the consumers, have to  pay. Therefore, the shutdown of AES's will at the very least  provoke a two- to threefold increase in tariffs; but we are  already used to this.... But something else is more dangerous:  Stations are turning from producers into mighty consumers of  energy, since this is required in order to maintain safety. And  you can't just ``hit the switch''--we all know full well what  happened at Chernobyl.    And there is no use in hiding it, because of the shutdown of  enterprises--including chemical, metallurgical, and machine  building enterprises--an electricity surplus has developed in  Russia. Electricity is mainly generated by coal and other  thermal stations, and consequently, the ecological situation is  sharply deteriorating. Discharges into the atmosphere of all  manner of substances harmful to man and life in general will  increase dramatically. Here is a truly ``Pyrrhic victory'' for  ecology!    Surely we can learn something from the experience of  Armenia,  where the decommissioning of AES's led to catastrophe? Or from  the sad experience of Ukraine, where the power situation  provoked a disastrous slump in industry and agriculture, and  therefore, in the life of society as a whole? Do we really  prefer to learn from our own mistakes? However, there is not  long to wait: If we do not intervene in the fate of Russia's  nuclear power stations today, within a month we will find out  what a power crisis is really like.... So prepare the candles,  ladies and gentlemen!    The directors of Russia's AES's, who gathered at the  ``Rosenergoatom'' concern for their emergency meeting, see as  the main culprit of their woes the ``supermonopoly structure of  the RAO `YeES Russia' [Russian joint-stock company `Integrated  Energy System of Russia']--the sole consumer of our output.''  In their appeal to B. Yeltsin and V. Chernomyrdin they laid  special stress on this fact.    And it is possible to understand the directors: Any monopoly  is harmful. The RAO buys energy from nuclear stations and, as  is the custom with us, does not pay for it in full. But the RAO  also does not receive money from consumers--it is probably  impossible to find one enterprise today which has paid for the  electricity it has received. Moreover, even our neighbors in  the nearby foreign parts prefer not to pay--there are more than  sufficient examples of this.    Effectively Russia has provided just over 3 trillion rubles'  [R] worth of electricity free of charge over the past few  years--they took it and did not pay! You might think that we  were already living under communism.... No, not ``we,'' but a  great many enterprises and republics; and ``we'' are forced to  pay over the odds for our light and heat.    The nuclear physicists work well. And the government  understands this: It is no accident that the country's top  leadership listened attentively to their problems. And hence  the directors of Russia's AES's write in their appeal:    ``We thank our government for the fine decisions aimed at  stabilizing the financial position in nuclear power engineering  which it made in October-December of last year and which have  been sunk by the prevailing reality existing in our country,  where it is not the decisions of the government or the president  that are fulfilled, but those of structures of the type of the  RAO `YeES Russia' and people who prefer to burn scarce organic  fuel, rather than deliver cheap power from AES's to consumers.''    The directors go on to cite a surprising fact: ``Of the  credits worth R70 billion allocated by the government in October  1993 to pay for energy delivered from AES's, in three months  only R6 billion has reached the AES's; R30 billion of the  indicated sum for some reason was left in a commercial bank'' (I  omit the name of the bank so as not to give it further  publicity--V.G.). True, the AES directors are mistaken here:  The money was not ``left'' in this bank for two months, but was  successfully ``put to work''--it brought in to the bank twice  the amount, since the ``nuclear R30 billion'' really ``did its  stuff.'' And very few employees of the bank cared that at some  nuclear power stations employees are not receiving their pay....    No, the employees and directors of Russia's AES's are not  threatening a strike: They understand full well how serious the  situation is today in power engineering and industry, but are  warning the president, the government, and all of us, that they  will be forced to shut down AES's, since their duty as  professionals and as human beings forbids them to allow new  Chernobyls. The AES directors clearly state that they cannot  allow the slightest risk in the operation of AES's. But, to be  honest, the AES directors no longer hope for help from the  government, since not one of its decisions has been fulfilled.     "

Eurostat's energy  figures released on March 7, which include, for the first time,  data on renewable energy -- solar, geothermal, wind,  hydro-power, and biomass -- show that renewable accounted for  6.7 percent of total primary energy production in 1992.  Although still a very small proportion of the overall energy  balance, this figure is a marked improvement on the less than 5  percent share that renewable sources held in the mid-1980s.    ""Green Energy""    Renewable energy consumption accounted for 3.5 percent of  gross inland energy consumption in 1992, notes Eurostat.  Households consumed 16.2 million toe of biomass (wood, wood  waste, municipal solid waste and biogas), particularly wood,  which represents roughly 7 percent of their final energy  consumption. Hydro-power (13.8 million toe) made up 8.2 percent  of total electricity production. France is the biggest producer,  turning out 5.9 million toe. Denmark was the biggest producer of  wind energy (78,000 toe). But this was a mere 0.06 percent of  total EU electricity production.    Gross inland consumption by all energy sources followed the  same trend as in recent years: coal down, oil stable and  natural gas up. Total consumption for each source was: hard  coal 15.6 percent, lignite 5.2 percent, oil 43.5 percent and  natural gas 18.6 percent, thermal energy produced in nuclear  power stations 13.6 percent and renewable energy 3.5 percent.  The EU's dependence on energy imports was still 50 percent.    A separate set of figures just out from Eurostat shows  further decline in EU coal industry in 1993. Output of hard  coal fell even faster between 1992 and 1993 as a result of the  crisis in the steel industry and particularly low import prices.  It fell by some 26 million tonnes or 14 percent to 158.6  million tonnes. This compares with an 8.4 million drop (4.3  percent) between 1991 and 1992. Demand from both steel and power  industries fell, perhaps by as much as over 20 million tonnes at  EU level. This resulted in falls in imports from non-EU  countries.     "

The controversial procurement directive, which came into force last January, was a key weapon in the European Commission's battle to subject suppliers of goods and services such as utilities to long-term competitive pressures. The Commission has long believed that the tendency of public agencies to buy equipment and services from domestic suppliers meant costs were higher than if contracts had been allocated on the basis of full and fair international competition, which the directive is aimed at encouraging. However, a report by Mr Steve Thomas and Mr Francis McGowan of Sussex University says the reverse could be the case for transmission and distribution equipment. 'It may be that the time when procurement liberalisation measures could prove useful has already passed and the rigidities a mandatory requirement would impose could prove counter-productive,' it says. 'Given the dangerously concentrated nature of the equipment supply industry, a much greater threat to the economic welfare of consumers may be posed by non-competitive forces in the equipment supply industry than is posed by the policies of the electricity supply industry.' In the past, says the report, electric utilities in France, Italy, Germany and the UK could all choose from at least two domestic suppliers for most big items of equipment. Now, following a series of cross-border mergers and takeovers, the option of 'buying national' usually does not exist. With further mergers still likely, no prospect of new equipment suppliers being created and the 'worrying history of cartel behaviour' in the supply industry, the assumption that it will always behave competitively looks optimistic, says the report. The directive also makes it more difficult for utilities to enter into long-term agreements with suppliers to develop and purchase new designs of equipment, ironically a practice that is increasingly common in other industries, says the report. This could weaken the utilities' market power. *The European Market for Transmission and Distribution Equipment.

0,FT932-397 ,"FT932-397 _AN-DF2CGADUFT 930629   FT  29 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Abolishing the gas monopoly   BRITISH GAS is one of Britain's more blatant monopolies. It has the exclusive right to sell gas to the vast majority of British households, it dominates the market for industrial gas, and it controls access to the country's main gas pipeline system. By the end of next month, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to decide whether British Gas's domestic monopoly is in the public interest. It will also, in practice, consider the case, rejected at privatisation, for breaking up the company. The first of these questions is discussed today, the second will be examined in a subsequent editorial. The case for abolishing the domestic monopoly is compelling. Competition would provide customers with choice, give British Gas a greater incentive to cut costs and lead to greater innovation. Electricity companies, for example, have expressed interest in entering the market and providing customers with joint gas and electricity packages - a move which could cut substantially administrative, customer service and billing costs. The introduction of competition would also bring nearer the day when regulation, which has been a source of such conflict in the gas industry, could be relaxed. Security of supply British Gas, however, is opposed to releasing its monopoly grip. It has a number of arguments. One is that security of gas supplies is better assured in a centrally-controlled system where one entity is responsible for keeping gas flowing. Another is that British Gas would be unable to maintain its social obligations if exposed to competition. These obligations include requirements to supply anyone who pays the bill and to charge all domestic customers the same unit price for gas wherever they live and however much gas they use. British Gas argues that such obligations are only possible because a third of its 18m customers bail out the other two-thirds to the tune of Pounds 250m a year. In a competitive market, rivals would simply cherry-pick the most profitable business, leaving British Gas with all the obligations. To anyone who has followed British Gas's long rearguard action against reduction of its monopoly, these are familiar arguments. They are concerns which need to be addressed but they are not reasons to hold back competition, so long as competition takes place on a level playing field. The experience of the multiple-supplier electricity system, which operates on much finer margins than gas because it cannot store power, shows that security of supply is possible in a competitive market. Similarly, experience in the telecommunications industry shows it is possible to maintain social obligations while introducing competition. Ponderous giant One way of preserving them would be to require rivals to contribute to British Gas's 'social costs' in proportion to their market shares. But it is also important to ask whether it is really necessary for one group of gas consumers to subsidise another. In the longer term, the best approach would be to phase such subsidies out. A further argument used to defend British Gas's monopoly is that customers have not done badly since the company was privatised in 1986. Gas prices have fallen by 20 per cent in real terms, while surveys show customers are satisfied. British Gas has indeed improved its operations under the discipline of private-sector ownership and regulatory pressure, but this is no reason for complacency. The company remains a ponderous giant, slow to respond to change and to bring down costs, particularly when compared to the electricity industry where competitive pressures are sharper. British Gas's management has set its sights on becoming a dynamic international, entrepreneurial company. It is still some way from achieving this transformation and so long as it remains protected from competition it will lack the best possible spur to do so. The company is right to argue for the interests of its shareholders with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, but properly handled, the abolition of the domestic monopoly need hold no terrors for British Gas.

0,FT933-3474 ,"FT933-3474 _AN-DINC7ACFFT 930914   FT  14 SEP 93 / Pounds 40m regional telecoms network planned      By ANDREW ADONIS   A FURTHER boost to tele-communications competition in England is imminent with the launch of a regional telecoms company by Yorkshire Electricity and Kingston Communications. The two companies intend to build a fibre-optic network covering Yorkshire and Humberside, using Yorkshire Electricity's pylons and Kingston's expertise and local network covering the city of Hull. The new Pounds 40m joint-venture company, to be called Torch Communications, will be set up in the next few weeks if the boards of the parent companies give approval and if a full telecommunications operating licence is granted by the Department of Trade and Industry. Torch plans to enter the market next summer, shortly after the launch of a third national fibre-optic network by Energis, a subsidiary of the National Grid. Energis will also use pylons for most of its network. Torch will focus on the business market, offering trunking and switched services to companies and other large users. It will also act as a wholesaler, leasing lines to companies and selling services to other telecommunications operators. An inter-connection agreement with British Telecommunications is under negotiation. The venture marks a significant broadening of horizons for Kingston Communications, the only municipally owned public telecommunications operator in the UK. Operationally independent of Hull council, the company is keen to expand its market following the abolition of the BT/Mercury national duopoly. Torch marks a further significant investment in telecommunications for Yorkshire Electricity, one of the privatised distribution companies. Yorkshire also has a stake in Ionica, the Cambridge-based company building a radio-based national network for launch in early 1995. Mr Malcolm Chatwin, Yorkshire Electricity's chief executive, said: 'We want to take advantage of the full range of opportunities in the growing telecommunications business. 'This is very much a long-term affair, but we will be interested in talking to other operators to see if there are joint opportunities.' It may soon become the first regional electricity company to expand its core businesses of distribution and supply outside the UK. Last month it announced discussions with the city of Turku, Finland, about the possible acquisition of its electricity distribution business. In June the company reported a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 156.3m and a 15 per cent rise in total dividends.   Companies:-  Yorkshire Electricity.     Kingston Communications.

The little factory south of town that converts rice wastes to electricity is a  sweet deal for everyone.    It relieves 21 rice mills of the expensive landfill disposal of rice hulls, and  spares residents of the Sacramento Valley from the noxious smoke of rice straw  burning in the fields.    The Pacific Gas & Electric Co. gets power without the financial and  environmental encumbrances. Electricity users may turn on their toasters  without visions of oil sheiks or leaking tankers.    Even the makers of concrete, ceramics, glass and computer chips welcome the  burning rice's ash, which is also used to oxidize and solidify toxic waste  spills.    Rob Colman, president of Oxford Energy Co., owners of the factory, says  electricity produced by his plant will bring in $15 million to $28 million a  year at a fuel cost of $3 million to $6.5 million. After paying 33 permanent  employees and other expenses, he projects operating income at $6 million to $16  million a year.      Favorable Financing    If that isn't sweet enough, Colman says Oxford has little of its own money at  risk in the $60-million total investment, while keeping majority control. The  big money comes from bank and similar financing.    The Floyd Myers Marsh Power Plant, the largest of its kind in the world, has  just gone on line to convert about 200,000 tons of rice hulls and straw a year  to 29 megawatts of electricity, enough for 35,000 homes. The plant is about 90  air miles northeast of San Francisco.    PG&E is required by the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of  1987 to buy power from small producers at ""avoided cost"" -- meaning what it  would cost to produce the power itself or buy it elsewhere.    The law has given rise to nearly 900 small electricity producers in PG&E  territory alone, using cogeneration, solid waste, geothermal, solar, hydro and  wind sources, all with a total capacity of nearly 10 million kilowatts. And  they are still coming, despite the petering out of governmental incentives.      Sighted From Interstate    At first sight from Interstate 5, the plant looms from behind massive  embankments of rice hulls covered with black plastic and old tires. Start-up  engineer Thomas Stinson says there is little fire danger. Rice hulls by  themselves hardly burn.    But when ground into a fine powder and blown through nozzles, the hulls explode  into an orange inferno at about 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit.    The rice hulls burned are about two-thirds of the total in one of the world's  richest rice-growing regions. But the straw consumption makes only a small  dent. Stinson says the straw content of the fuel now being used is only about  one-eighth, being increased gradually to an expected one-third next year.    The performance of the straw as fuel is being monitored under a state research  contract. Straw alone has never been used for a power plant. But the potential  is huge. Stinson said there's enough straw available to justify another  40-megawatt plant burning straw alone.    Hulls deliver about 6,000 British thermal units per pound, compared to 4,500  for green wood and 10,000 for coal.    The season for amassing a year's supply of straw is short and irregular,  depending on weather. Also, some growers still think burning the rice stubble  is the only way to rid the fields of diseases. They ignore the researchers who  say bailing and chemical treatment are better. So it is hard to get them to mow  the stalks close to the ground and bail the straw during harvest.    The fuel arrives on bulky double-trailer trucks and is routed through grinder,  silos, burners and -- as fly ash -- the bag house. In the control room, before  three color display screens, operators can call on data from 1,100 sensors  throughout the plant.    The steam arrives as well water and goes through 23 separate systems before  blasting into the split-cycle turbine. Most of the systems are to rid it of  chemicals that would cake up the tubes -- like the bottom of a teapot. No water  leaves the property, except little wisps of steam connected to control and  safety devices.    The plant is custom-built. Colman says it should keep humming 20 or 30 years,  with the final product going out on three wires slung on a single line of wood  poles, and the checks coming in the mail.

The Floyd Myers Marsh Power Plant, the largest of its kind in the world, has  just gone on line to convert about 200,000 tons of rice hulls and straw a year  to 29 megawatts of electricity, enough for 35,000 homes. The plant is about 90  air miles northeast of San Francisco.    PG&E is required by the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of  1987 to buy power from small producers at ""avoided cost"" -- meaning what it  would cost to produce the power itself or buy it elsewhere.    The law has given rise to nearly 900 small electricity producers in PG&E  territory alone, using cogeneration, solid waste, geothermal, solar, hydro and  wind sources, all with a total capacity of nearly 10 million kilowatts. And  they are still coming, despite the petering out of governmental incentives.      Sighted From Interstate    At first sight from Interstate 5, the plant looms from behind massive  embankments of rice hulls covered with black plastic and old tires. Start-up  engineer Thomas Stinson says there is little fire danger. Rice hulls by  themselves hardly burn.    But when ground into a fine powder and blown through nozzles, the hulls explode  into an orange inferno at about 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit.    The rice hulls burned are about two-thirds of the total in one of the world's  richest rice-growing regions. But the straw consumption makes only a small  dent. Stinson says the straw content of the fuel now being used is only about  one-eighth, being increased gradually to an expected one-third next year.    The performance of the straw as fuel is being monitored under a state research  contract. Straw alone has never been used for a power plant. But the potential  is huge. Stinson said there's enough straw available to justify another  40-megawatt plant burning straw alone.    Hulls deliver about 6,000 British thermal units per pound, compared to 4,500  for green wood and 10,000 for coal.    The season for amassing a year's supply of straw is short and irregular,  depending on weather. Also, some growers still think burning the rice stubble  is the only way to rid the fields of diseases. They ignore the researchers who  say bailing and chemical treatment are better. So it is hard to get them to mow  the stalks close to the ground and bail the straw during harvest.    The fuel arrives on bulky double-trailer trucks and is routed through grinder,  silos, burners and -- as fly ash -- the bag house. In the control room, before  three color display screens, operators can call on data from 1,100 sensors  throughout the plant.    The steam arrives as well water and goes through 23 separate systems before  blasting into the split-cycle turbine. Most of the systems are to rid it of  chemicals that would cake up the tubes -- like the bottom of a teapot. No water  leaves the property, except little wisps of steam connected to control and  safety devices.    The plant is custom-built. Colman says it should keep humming 20 or 30 years,  with the final product going out on three wires slung on a single line of wood  poles, and the checks coming in the mail.

Fortunately he survived it, but in going to the Bosnian capital when he did, he managed to destroy a tradition rather than recall one. It was the German financial daily, Handelsblatt, that hit the nail on the head. 'This demonstrative gesture underlines the fundamental change in a hundred years of French Balkan policy. Mitterrand rebuffed the Serbs whom France has supported for decades.' It concluded that Bonn and Paris now stood shoulder to shoulder on the Yugoslav question. There is a substantial body of feeling in the German financial community, and which is reflected in the editorial politics of Handelsblatt, that holds that Germany has danced to a French tune for far too long. Clearly things have now changed. The view elsewhere was that French foreign policy seemed to be returning to what was hailed universally as panache and audacity. The Dutch paper, De Volkskrant, cried: 'Hero Mitterrand in Sarajevo visit.' In France itself, however, there was self-doubt. Sud-Ouest wrote, 'Everybody, from his soul and his conscience, will admire Francois Mitterrand's gesture, for his 'courage,' as our British neighbours say, with that touch of irony which hints at the Gallic limitations of the enterprise.' The business paper, Tribune de l'Expansion, said: 'There is Cyrano (de Bergerac) in all this. Abroad surprise outweighs admiration. Our European partners can rightly wonder at an initiative taken in a full summit without the slightest concentration.' This is all a far cry from the not so distant past when any French initiative would be greeted with Gaullist slogans about France fulfilling her 'noble, global destiny' (it sounds better in French.) So if Mitterrand was trying to recreate the past the attempt failed and to many it merely provided evidence of how France had changed, not how she had remained faithful to her traditions. To others it seemed a quixotic gesture, almost irrelevant to the dreary world of concentration and harmonisation in which western Europe lives today. Struggling against this windmill was John Major. He gave an interview to Le Monde on the occasion of the Lisbon Summit, British presidency et al, that attracted no interest in Britain but was a rather skilful operation designed to win friends and influence people in France. He at least was not prepared to relinquish the realities of the old Europe and he set about asserting the principles of a Europe of Nations. So there came this passage: 'Look: no nation is more involved in the Community than is France or Germany. Are the French any less French than they were 50 years ago? Certainly not] Are the Germans any less German than 50 years ago? Certainly not]' (My italics). This is taking a taste for tradition too far, I feel. Most Europeans would hope that the Germans had changed a bit since 1942. That, after all, is what the European Com- munity is for. Major also thought the British were just as British as they were then, which may well be true. But by and large his country is not regarded as a lone defender of civilised values these days, last month's images from Sweden of bad English football and worse supporters have helped build up a picture that is somewhat at odds with the traditional English view of themselves. So the headline that appeared in Dagens Nyheter of Stockholm looked strange: 'Major loses battle for Sweden.' In fact it turned out to be the Swedish view of the Lisbon Summit which, apparently, was largely devoted to Swedish membership of the Community and which will not come as soon as many Swedes would like. The lesson from the Rotterdam paper, NRC- Handelsblad, was that the past was past and it is no use repining. An editorial headed 'The strawberry dilemma' began irresistibly: 'Straw- berries, those little kings of summer wrested from the cold earth, are undermining Dutch labour ordinances.' Once upon a time, 18,000 workers were recruited by the employment offices to work as seasonal labourers in the strawberry fields of Limburg. This year 30 turned up. The same crisis has hit the asparagus crop too. The trouble is that the rate for the job in the fields is lower than the current level of unemployment benefit. So now there are thousands of Poles queueing up to do the work and turn their guilders into millions of zloties. But the paper continues, 'Poles are ready to pluck the strawberries and store the asparagus but that cannot happen so long as the Minister of Social Affairs says there are Dutch workers available to do the job.' But they will not do it, so the strawberries rot. The paper concluded there were two solutions, one involved cutting the dole, which was impossible, the other - getting the Poles to do the work. 'But why should the Poles trek to Limburg in grotty buses and pay commission to middle men?' The answer is to grow the strawberries and asparagus on the plains of central Europe instead of in the Netherlands. So this is the future for the new Europe. Politicians and industries can go to the east, but the east must stay firmly where it is. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.  The Financial Times   London Page IX  "
0,FT943-1404 ,"FT943-1404 _AN-EIYAEABGFT 940924   FT  24 SEP 94 / Coal faces renewed dash for gas      By MICHAEL SMITH   The threat to coal from other fuel sources was underlined yesterday when Midlands Electricity and three overseas companies said they had reached agreement on financing a 750MW gas-fired power station on Humberside. Construction of Humber Power will start immediately. As with several other proposed gas stations, plans for Humber Power were put on hold after an agreement in February between the electricity regulator and the two largest UK generators to peg prices in the wholesale power pool. Yesterday's announcement dashed coal industry hopes that the pricing agreement would end the so-called 'dash for gas'. Further gas-fired power stations are being considered. British Gas is thought to be considering whether to participate in a 1,200MW station at Seabank, near Bristol, while Eastern Electricity is negotiating on a 350MW station at King's Lynn, Norfolk. The Humber Power station alone could displace 2m tonnes of coal a year from the market when it is completed in April 1997. This would rise to more than 3.5m if the project's partners build a second phase of the station, taking the full capacity to 1,200MW. Midlands Electricity has taken a 25 per cent stake, investing about Pounds 11m on completion in 1997. It forecasts the investment will provide a real post-tax return of more than 15 per cent. The company will also buy 174MW of the station's output. Midlands' partners are IVO of Finland (30 per cent), ABB, the international engineer (20 per cent), and Tomen, the Japanese trading company (25 per cent). IVO will operate the station and ABB will be the turnkey contractor. Like Midlands, IVO and Tomen have entered 15-year hedging contracts for output from the station. This is the first time that companies other than regional electricity concerns have entered long-term contracts of this nature. IVO and Tomen said yesterday that they expected to be trading in the power contract market 'in due course'. Mr Kari Huopalahti, IVO group director, said the contractual structure which made the project possible represented a step forward for power generation in the UK. Gas will be supplied by Total Oil Marine and Elf Exploration. Project credit facilities of Pounds 520m were arranged by NatWest Markets and Union Bank of Switzerland.

0,FT924-2966 ,"FT924-2966 _AN-CLJCGAB9FT 921210   FT  10 DEC 92 / Renewed hope for coal pushes fears offshore: Neil Buckley outlines the perils of reversing the 'dash for gas'      By NEIL BUCKLEY   GAS-FIRED power stations have been widely blamed for the possible demise of a large part of the UK coal industry. Now the government is being warned that any attempt to reverse the 'dash for gas' could inflict serious damage on a mainstay of the UK economy - the offshore oil and gas industry. The economics of five significant North Sea gas developments depend largely on contracts with gas-fired stations. Gas supplies from three more fields have been bought by British Gas to meet higher demand caused by the 'dash for gas'. Oil industry experts warn that, if any of these projects ceases or is damaged, producers may take future investment elsewhere. Modern combined-cycle gas turbine stations are efficient and emit only half the carbon dioxide of coal-fired plant, less than a quarter of the nitrogen oxides and virtually no sulphur dioxide. They are cheap and quick to build - which is why they were so attractive to regional electricity companies in England and Wales seeking to diversify their sources of power after the electricity industry was privatised in 1990. The power industry's enthusiasm for gas coincided with the emergence of independent gas marketers competing with the privatised British Gas. Criticism of the combined-cycle stations has centred on three allegations. The first is that gas-fired power costs more than coal-fired, though this is likely to be blunted by today's report from Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, that gas supply contracts are not uneconomic. Most comparisons suggest that gas-fired power, including capital costs, is more expensive than existing coal-fired plant. But gas-fired power is generally less expensive when the costs of fitting desulphurisation equipment to coal-fired plants are taken into account. Such measures would be unavoidable to meet European Community emissions standards if coal maintained its share of generation. There are two categories of combined-cycle station. Five of the 16 stations given the green light will have to be economic to survive. They are owned by the big two generators and will sell their electricity into the 'pool', the competitive section of the market. 'If we have got it wrong it will be PowerGen and our shareholders who take the hit,' PowerGen said. 'But we are pretty confident we have got it right.' The other 11 gas-fired plants are independent projects that have signed long-term contracts with regional electricity companies involving an agreed price. If that is higher than the pool price, the companies are allowed to pass on the cost to their customers, although Prof Littlechild has said he may review this. Suspicion centres on later projects that signed contracts after gas prices began rising because of heavy demand - especially four receiving gas under the costlier of British Gas's two price schedules. A second criticism is that the new plants will lead to much over-capacity. To avoid over-capacity, some plants will have to be retired - but this was envisaged at the time of privatisation. The government's white paper estimated that 13,000MW of new capacity would be required by the year 2000 to replace ageing plants - 70 per cent are more than 15 years old. The total capacity of likely gas-fired projects is only 10,000MW, with a further 4,000MW awaiting government consents that may not be granted - while the Sizewell B nuclear station will provide 1,200MW from 1994. Finally, critics say UK gas reserves are smaller than claimed, and prices could rise. Estimates from British Gas and other sources say there are only 21 years of proven, probable and possible reserves at the higher levels of demand caused by the rise in gas-fired generation. But experience in the North Sea and elsewhere shows such estimates are constantly increasing. Even if the criticisms are true, the government has four options: To try to stop the combined-cycle stations. Oil companies and independent consultants warn that this could jeopardise Pounds 6bn of investment in the North Sea along with investor confidence and thousands of jobs. Allow the stations to go ahead. Without compensatory action 31 pits would close, as originally envisaged. Allow the stations to go ahead, but limit their market. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, has suggested that the stations should be forced to sell their electricity only into the non-franchise market that supplies large customers and in which British Coal cannot compete. That would leave more room for coal in the franchise market that supplies households and smaller businesses. British Coal could increase sales to the generators by up to 20m tonnes a year. Customers of regional companies would bear the additional costs. The problem is that many combined-cycle stations are being built specifically to serve the franchise market on long-term contracts, and secured financing only on that basis. One project involves 23 banks. The legal difficulties of re-writing the contracts would be immense - one gas marketer described the idea as 'crazy'. Subsidise coal to enable it to compete with gas. That would hit some of the gas-fired stations, with some of the knock-on effects detailed above. Many gas and coal experts say the government should look not at gas plants, but at the heavily subsidised nuclear industry, especially ageing Magnox reactors. They are also urging the government to keep closed pits under care and maintenance, so they can be reopened. Combined-cycle stations could yet provide a new lease of life for British coal - they can burn a variety of fuels, including gas made from coal. Coal gasification technology may not be economic now, but could be within a decade. 'The choice for the government,' said one gas consultant, 'is do we accept that we are here now, and we have to go on from here, causing the least possible damage to the energy market as a whole, or do we try to turn back the clock and make an even bigger mess than we already have?'

0,FT921-13071 ,"FT921-13071 _AN-CAWAWADFFT 920123   FT  23 JAN 92 / Commission unleashes powerful forces: Big energy suppliers will fight to keep their monopolies      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   BRUSSELS' first faltering steps towards opening up the European Community energy market still face fierce opposition from established power suppliers reluctant to relinquish their monopoly clout. Many state utilities have great influence over their respective governments and could delay the approval of the Commission's draft directive on energy liberalisation. 'I'm not against competition, but it's clear to me that if you change the system in this way, you run the risk of disturbing the security of supply,' said Mr Robert Grosman at Electrabel, Belgium's main electricity supplier. In order to combat some of this opposition, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha has sidestepped the issue of central regulation for the emerging market and is leaving it up to the individual EC states. The Commission will review the situation in 1995 to check whether competition is going ahead as planned. Said Mr Jonathan Stern, energy expert at the Royal Institute for International Affairs: 'It could mean that the legislation is put in place, but nothing happens in practice, because there is no one to ensure that it does.' He argues that those countries which face most opposition to the plans, could just drag their feet on introducing the framework. At the same time, some consumers are eager to push ahead more quickly with a fully competitive market. By initially restricting competition to customers using more than 25m cubic metres of gas or 100GW hours of electricity a year, the Commission has ensured that only the largest users, such as aluminium- and steel-makers, and glass and chemicals companies, will benefit. Companies will also have to be using that much power at an individual site rather than on a company-wide basis, before they can canvass alternative suppliers. For instance, Dow Chemical has 35 sites in Europe, but only five or six would qualify for the high energy consumption required. 'This means the Commission is only scratching the surface on competition,' said Mr Francesco Balocco, European energy supply manager at Dow. 'We want a lot of new players to come into the market, but the only way that will happen is if there is a large enough slice of the market to warrant their participation.' Nevertheless, Brussels has had to tread carefully in order to deal with the sensibilities of most member countries. Even consumers are not united in wanting a swift approach to competition. In Germany, where the Vereinigung Industrieller Kraftwirtschaft represents the interests of large and small power users, customers favour a slower pace. One consumer argues that if the whole market is thrown open to competition, the results could be so chaotic that it would justify the opposition of the country's large regional monopoly power groups. Regional power monopolies in Germany are entrenched in law and consumers are calling for a strong legislative framework to overcome the current system. Domestic consumers are unlikely to feel any benefits of a more open market before the end of the decade. In fact, many large electricity suppliers argue that the household customer could initially be paying higher prices for his power to compensate for the increased investment companies will make in competing for large industrial clients. One area where the Commission hopes that competitive advantages may filter down to households is through large energy distributors buying power outside their home country. For example, in France where 22 municipalities account for 4 per cent of gas sales, the largest distributors could band together to ensure their needs are greater than the 25m threshold and buy cheaper gas from, say, the Netherlands. The UK has been most enthusiastic about greater competition in the power market since the main suppliers have been privatised over the past decade. British energy companies are keen to expand on the continent and National Power and PowerGen, the two generating companies, refused to sign a paper put out by Eurelectric, the Brussels electricity lobby group, which opposed the Commission's plans. 'We argued against more competition here (in the UK) when it was first mooted in 1987,' said Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power. 'We said it would not work and that security of supply would be endangered, but we've been proved wrong.'  The Financial Times   London Page 2 Chart (Omitted). Chart (Omitted).  "

It has just agreed its first joint project, an Ecu24m (Pounds 18m) grant to Kozloduy, Bulgaria's troubled nuclear power plant. The grant will be used to import safety equipment for Kozloduy, declared Europe's most dangerous nuclear power station in 1991. It will be paid out of the Nuclear Safety Account which was set up by the G7 at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development last March and had received contributions of Ecu115m by June. In return, the Bulgarians have agreed to shut down the plant's four 440MW VVER (old pressurised water reactor) units - which lack containment to enclose them in an accident - as soon as financially possible, which may be by 1998. The EBRD aims to make the plant as safe as possible until this happens. Unlike many of the region's other nuclear plants, Kozloduy has already received much western attention. 'Until now, we've received around Ecu18m from the EC's Phare programme (funding eastern European projects) and had some 1,000 western experts visiting Kozloduy, but this has been spent mainly on analysing the plant and its problems, and on retraining staff,' says Nikita Shervashidze, deputy chairman of the Bulgarian government's Committee of Energy. 'The EBRD grant will provide us with hard currency to buy foreign safety equipment. This will include process computers to make the system more user-friendly, extra cooling devices, isolation valves, spare parts and ultrasonic inspection equipment for the pressure vessels.' The equipment will be purchased through tenders which the EBRD will help NEK, Bulgaria's state-owned electricity monopoly, to organise. 'One of the weakest points of electricity companies in the former east bloc is organising procurement, arranging financing and dealing with western banks. We have no experience in this and will rely on the EBRD's support,' Shervashidze says. 'We hope we can complete the project within 18 months and set up a model of how it can be done for other recipients of grants.' But it is clear the west must provide much more funding if the project is to fulfil its long-term aim of seeing units one to four closed down. The Bulgarians are adamant the country needs nuclear energy and say Kozloduy supplies between 35 and 40 per cent of the country's electricity. Due to the ageing of the country's non-nuclear plants, this share could rise to 50 per cent, according to Yanko Yanev, chairman of the Bulgarian Nuclear Safety Authority (RNSA). He says the country will not close down the reactors until it can finance the upgrading of Kozloduy's remaining two 1,000MW units. 'We are willing to co-operate but we cannot accept some sort of conditionality. 'We are trying to look for energy options which will permit closure of units one to four, although three and four are relatively new.' But the two 1,000MW units could cost Dollars 500m (Pounds 357m) each to modernise and be made more reliable. They are considered safer than the 440MW reactors as they have containment facilities, but have proved to be a less dependable source of electricity than the older units. Last September a fire in unit six closed the 1,000MW units - they share a common spare power supply. Shervashidze is hoping the EBRD will also help Bulgaria to secure commercial loans for the upgrading work and for a second nuclear project on the Danube at Belene which is 60 per cent complete. But the country looks like having little chance of raising substantial funding from the west - negotiations with the London club of commercial banks over Bulgaria's Dollars 11bn debt broke down again in July. Also, many western countries and institutions, notably the World Bank, believe that nuclear energy is no longer cost-effective and will not finance new nuclear plants. Ivan Uzunov, professor of atomic energy at Sofia University, believes Kozloduy and other Soviet-built reactors in the region can only be made to pay if safety standards are compromised. Uzunov, who has advised western countries such as Austria and Italy on nuclear policy, says a grant of Ecu24m is 'absolutely nothing' compared with Kozloduy's immediate needs. He acknowledges the plant's safety has improved substantially in the past two years, but says he is still not satisfied that units two and three are sound enough to operate or that the plant's 7,000 employees have had enough training. But his main concern is the build-up over the past three years of 600 tonnes of spent radioactive fuel elements at Kozloduy which are being stored in pools of water. In cold war days, these were reprocessed by the Russians at little cost to the Bulgarians. Now, the country faces reprocessing bills of Dollars 1,000 per kg. Shervashidze says Kozloduy has storage space for the spent fuel elements for two more years. He hopes that by then, Bulgaria will have built dry storage facilities - but again, this requires financing. Uzunov would like to see alternative storage facilities built as soon as possible. He says that an explosion at the Soviet Kishtim nuclear plant in the Urals in 1957 was caused after 70 tonnes of spent fuel elements overheated due to a shortage of water; parts of the region are still contaminated. He also believes the Bulgarian authorities have not received enough independent advice and have been influenced by the western nuclear industry, hungry for new orders in eastern Europe due to falling domestic demand. As an alternative to spending on nuclear energy, he is lobbying for western help to improve energy efficiency at conventional power plants and increase Bulgaria's connections to international gas pipelines and electricity networks.

Northern's increase, by 2.2p to 9.6p, is the second highest in this year's electricity results season. All six England and Wales regional companies which have reported so far this year have lifted dividends by more than 20 per cent. Eastern's dividend rose from 6.6p to 8.25p. The payouts, which have come on top of healthy profit increases of 20 per cent or more, will increase the political controversy surrounding the companies. The Labour party has called for a 'windfall profits' tax on utilities, arguing that the power companies were sold off at too low a a price four years ago and have not been regulated rigorously enough since then. Political debate is likely to become more heated before the likely flotation of the National Grid next May or June. The government is opposed to a windfall tax, but is under pressure to act on what many see as the power companies' excessive profits. Northern, based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, said its profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 63.4m, a 20.5 per cent increase. Eastern Group, based in Ipswich, reported a 27 increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 98.1m. Both companies said the high dividend increases were made possible by recent buy-backs of their shares. Northern has bought 10 per cent of its shares and Eastern 5 per cent. Buy-backs allow companies to lift dividends because there are fewer shares in issue. Northern said its underlying dividend increase was 16 per cent while Eastern said total dividend payments would rise 19 per cent. Analysts expect Northern's full-year dividend increase to be around 30 per cent. Some say its willingness to increase dividends is influenced by speculation that it will be the first regional power company to be subject to a takeover bid. The government's 'golden share' in each of the regional companies ends in March, making takeovers more likely. Scottish Power is often rumoured to be interested in taking over Northern. Mr David Morris, Northern's chairman, said there had been no noticeable changes in the company's shareholders recently. Details, Page 24; Lex, Page 20   Companies:-  Northern Electric.

0,FT931-15676 ,"FT931-15676 _AN-DALCKABIFT 930112   FT  12 JAN 93 / Argentina whets foreign appetites: Companies rush to pick up pieces of a dismantled public sector      By JOHN BARHAM   AS Argentina dismantles almost its entire public sector, foreign companies are diving in to pick up the pieces. In little more than three years, the government has privatised 51 companies, raising Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in cash, cancelling Dollars 12bn of foreign debt and transferring Dollars 1.3bn of financial liabilities to the buyers of privatised companies. It has also won commitments from the companies' new managements for investment programmes averaging Dollars 4bn a year up to the turn of the century. In doing so, it has attracted respected international companies to run privatised corporations which have suffered from a lack of investment and years of neglect. British Gas distributes gas in Buenos Aires, France Telecom operates the telephones in the northern half of the country and Chilean companies generate electricity. Foreign companies' incursions into Argentina, an economy suffering hyperinflation a little over three years ago, often reflect wider international strategies. British Gas, which holds 29 per cent of Metrogas, the new Buenos Aires gas distributor, aims to expand substantially its overseas operations, which contributed 10 per cent of the group's 1991 profit of Pounds 921m. Mr Peter Lehmann, who headed the Metrogas acquisition, says Argentina represented an unusual opportunity to enter a large but under-developed gas market. Metrogas, with forecast annual turnover of Dollars 600m, will be among the world's larger distribution companies, yet it also offers significant growth opportunities. Improved maintenance, billing, and marketing techniques at all privatised companies can easily yield profits well in excess of the 12-16 per cent yield on Argentine government debt, the benchmark investment. The risks are still substantial, particularly if today's reasonably stable economy suddenly deteriorated. However, buyers think the government has set the prices they can charge high enough to fund investments and has also linked them to the dollar, reducing inflation and devaluation risks. Foreign investors also hope that participation of a wide group of foreign companies reduces the risks of any arbitrary rule changes for foreign companies. One foreign executive said: 'A government will think twice before intervening in a way that could upset foreign governments.' However one big early privatisation is already in trouble. The national airline, Aerolineas Argentinas, was privatised in 1990 - before a raft of changes to clean up the privatisation programme introduced by the reform-minded economy minister Domingo Cavallo. Spain's state-owned Iberia took 30 per cent. Government officials are now threatening to scrap the sale and start again from scratch because they say Iberia is not running Aerolineas properly. Last July, the government also had to take the place of Iberia's minority local partners when they failed to come up with the capital they were committed to inject into the struggling company. This has heightened concerns that the Argentine companies active in the privatisations as minority partners have paid too much for their assets and are financially overextended. This is denied by the companies. Mr Roberto Roca, president of Techint, a big industrial group, says he is not overstretched despite having spent Dollars 533m on large minority stakes in a railway, highway toll concessions, a steel mill, an electricity generator, a telephone network, oilfields and a gas company. He says Techint's debts of Dollars 450m are only one-third of the group's net worth, but does expect to increase debt by Dollars 100m a year. Mr Oscar Vicente, vice president of Perez Companc, Argentina's largest industrial conglomerate, says his company doubled its net worth to Dollars 1.9bn by buying Dollars 876.9m-worth of state assets. All the same, he says Perez Companc only took on debts of Dollars 350m, and promises that gearing will always remain 'exceptionally low'. Although the trade unions, while subdued, are still powerful, dealing with the legal and regulatory systems could be the privatised companies' biggest problem. Argentina's civil service has never shown much honesty or competence, and the concept of regulatory bodies independent of government policy is alien. The government has created regulatory agencies to supervise the telephone, gas and electricity services. However, only the telecommunications regulatory commission is actually functioning. The gas and electricity regulators have not all been appointed yet. The agencies are meant to be independent of government and their boards appointed for fixed terms. Yet in 1991 Mr Cavallo sacked the entire telecommunications commission board for incompetence, replacing them with his own appointees. The privatisation process still has some way to go. The government will soon begin floating off residual minority shareholdings in privatised companies, worth an estimated Dollars 2bn. And this year will see the beginning of the biggest privatisation of them all: the sale of 70 per cent of YPF, the national oil company and Argentina's largest company, worth in total over Dollars 8.5bn. There is a growing debate over the government's decision to sell YPF as a single unit, rather than breaking it into separate business units as it did to ensure competition in the electricity and gas industries. There is one big government asset that is not on the privatisation agenda - at least in the foreseeable future: Banco de la Nacion Argentina, the government-owned commercial bank and the country's largest financial institution. Officials say they need it because it enables them to oversee and put pressure on the private financial system. This is an explanation received sceptically by some in Buenos Aires, who believe that now that the central bank is independent, the government still wants an arm for discreet borrowing and financial support operations.

Mr Friedhelm Gieske, chief executive, forecast a profit for the year ending June, comparable to last year's DM881m (Dollars 512m) - but promised a higher dividend on the basis of more favourable tax allowances. Both the oil and chemicals division, and RWE Energie, the electricity generator, will make bigger contributions to the outcome, with the buoyant construction division maintaining its position. Two US investments - the Consol mining group, hit by a seven-month strike, and NuKEM, its waste disposal operation - are the main loss-makers in the group so far this year, Mr Gieske said. On the other hand, improved results in east Germany, with rising petrol sales for RWE-DEA and expanding construction activity, helped two important arms of the company to better results. The mining and raw materials division, centred on Rheinbraun, Germany's biggest producer of brown coal for power generation, saw a drop in turnover of 13.6 per cent, without taking acquisitions into account. Mr Gieske said the losses at Consol reached Dollars 42m as a result of the miners' strike, leaving RWE to carry its DM36m share of that amount. However, he promised much more favourable prospects for the US interest in 1994, with Consol strengthening its position in the low-sulphur coal market with the purchase of Island Creek. Waste disposal, an area into which RWE has expanded rapidly in recent years, saw operating losses of Dollars 96m at NuKEM, where a big restructuring programme has been carried out. Mr Gieske said the entire amount had been provided for in the company accounts up to December 31. Overall group turnover increased by 3.4 per cent up to the end of March, although the growth excluding acquisitions was only 0.9 per cent. Electricity consumption stabilised at a growth rate of 0.3 per cent, after 18 months of decline in line with the German recession. However, RWE Energie was the main beneficiary from improved depreciation allowances introduced by the German government to increase corporate competitiveness. In particular, RWE has been able to write off a large portion of the cost of its big environmental programme to reduce emissions from power stations.   Companies:-  RWE.     RWE Energie.

The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 4.14 percent.     Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 1.6 million over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 28, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 24.12, 605.97, 654.55, 677.03, 835.53, 842.83 and   786.97 million barrels, respectively.     5.     Conclusion.

The reason, it says, is that 'considerable uncertainty' surrounds the nuclear industry's ability to pay. Scottish Nuclear will become technically insolvent some time after March 1995 if the government does not intervene, partly because of future decommissioning costs, the NAO said. Nuclear facilities have a limited lifetime and safely dismantling them will be one of the nuclear industry's biggest financial burdens. The report, which is the most comprehensive government study of decommissioning costs to date, estimated it would cost Pounds 18bn to decommission all of the industry's facilities, but said that is 'affected by a wide range of uncertainties'. While it is difficult to estimate total costs, the report said they would be spread over more than 100 years. Some disposal plans have not yet been approved by the regulators, and the UK has not yet decided which method to use for long-term disposal of radioactive waste. However it pointed out its estimates do not discount the amount of money to be spent in the future. It calculated the undiscounted decommissioning costs for Nuclear Electric, Scottish Nuclear and British Nuclear Fuels, which make up most of the civil nuclear sector, to be Pounds 14.5bn and the discounted value at Pounds 5.9bn. The Atomic Energy Authority also has undiscounted costs of Pounds 3.5bn. Nuclear Electric told the NAO that it expected 'to be able to meet all decommissioning liabilities as they fall due'. However the office warned that if operating costs rose - particularly for disposing of waste from regular operations - the generators could be unable to meet long-term decommissioning liabilities. It added that 'the present electricity supply market provides no mechanism through which any increases in costs can be passed on directly to consumers'. Nuclear Electric said yesterday: 'We believe we can cover liabilities without any extension of the nuclear levy' - paid by electricity consumers and worth more than Pounds 1.2bn a year, the levy ends in 1998.

Cristiani said the self-styled  Salvadoran Revolutionary Front will be investigated and those  responsible for the threats will be brought to justice.    According to President Cristiani, the FMLN's internal  problems do not have to adversely affect the country's stability  because it is a matter of differences within a political party.  According to the president, the FMLN should divide itself once  and for all into two parties to end the problem.    [Begin Cristiani recording] If there really are people  within  the FMLN that are solving these types of problems with violence,  they are demonstrating their lack of ability to join a  democratic process and their lack of tolerance for differences  of opinion. [end recording]    In addition, the head of state said labor code reforms  created a tripartite commission that will work as an entity to  advise the Labor Ministry. According to Cristiani, what remains  to be done is to decide if the Forum for Economic and Social  Consensus will continue as it is or if discussions will be  incorporated at the Labor Council, which has been given a  permanent mandate.    [Begin Cristiani recording] Now that this council has been  reactivated, we hope it can become a permanent council so that  talks can be held here. I believe, however, that the decision  will have to be made at the Forum for Concerted Effort. [end  recording]    Cristiani also confirmed that an energy plan has been  proposed to the Honduran Government, which is currently facing  an electricity crisis. The president said this will not  adversely affect the country and there will be no rationing.  The proposal consists of an interconnection with Honduras  because Honduras is the only country in the region that does not  have an energy interconnection with El Salvador. It also  includes the construction by both countries of El Tigre  Hydroelectric Dam. The El Tigre Dam, with the waters of the  Torola and Lempa Rivers, would increase the production of  electricity by 150 megawatts for each country. El Salvador's  three dams together produce 500 megawatts.     "
0,FT934-8131 ,"FT934-8131 _AN-DKQCRAC7FT 931117   FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (9): Away from the fast lane - Japan's expansion plan is proving too ambitious      By FRANK GRAY   JAPAN rarely misses its economic and industrial targets, but it may fall well short of its objective of adding 40,000MW of nuclear capacity between now and 2010. The target, announced by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry at the start of the 1990s, was remarkably bold, but also ominous because of concern over placing so much nuclear capacity in an island nation only a little larger than the British Isles but twice as crowded. Japan's electricity industry, dominated by 10 private regional utilities, has so far towed the MITI line, although many executives now admit that the plan is too ambitious. Equipment exporters, such as General Electric and Westinghouse of the US, which control the licensing for much of the turbine technology used by the Japanese nuclear industry, welcome the potential bonanza, but also expect it to be scaled back over the next two decades. Nevertheless, MITI, and its partner organisation, the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, is sticking to its guns. Japan's nuclear emphasis dates from the Middle East oil prices crises of the 1970s, and its power stations' very high dependence on imported oil, coal and liquefied natural gas. Along with some hydroelectric and pumped storage, the nuclear option would insure against any further upheavals among its chief fuel suppliers. At present, Japan has more than 42 nuclear power stations, with a combined capacity of 35,000MW. Output is 212 terawatt hours (twh), which means that nuclear supplies nearly 30 per cent of all Japan's electricity. Japan is third on a world scale behind the US, with 110 plants, 105,000MW, generating 612 twh; and France whose 54 plants with a capacity of 57,600MW produce 314 twh. The MITI plan calls for 50,000MW by 2000 and 72,500MW by 2010. A certain degree of reality is making itself felt, and the country's utilities now expect a target of 45,000MW by 2000 to be more realistic. A total of 10 nuclear power stations are being built or awaiting construction. Given Japan's fairly fast installation deadline of five years per unit, this means that the modified target looks reachable. Beyond that, however, authorities admit to having much difficulty in establishing sites for new nuclear units. All reactors are at coastal sites - some utilities, such as Tokyo Electric Power Co, Japan's largest with more than a third of all electricity capacity  -operate several nuclear units outside their own service area. In addition, Japan's anti-nuclear lobby has become more effective in sounding alarms against the dangers of too much nuclear. Given the recent change of government, say Japanese energy officials, the anti-nuclear arguments will be more strongly felt, and this will stall clearance of new sites. On top of this, the outcome of the Gulf conflict and the recent Israeli-Palestinian peace accord are seen as having a long-term stabilising effect on Middle East oil prices. While Japan's nuclear programme is likely to fall behind schedule, it is pressing ahead with a long-term partner scheme to develop a full nuclear fuel cycle to give Japan a capacity to undertake nuclear power production with minimal recourse to overseas suppliers, either in terms of equipment or uranium. The first sign of this is the Rokkasho Mura uranium enrichment facility, the first phase of which opened in Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan in March 1992. A nuclear fuel reprocessing facility is to start operating by 2000, according to plans. In line with this, Japan is developing new types of 'breeder' reactors, now at an experimental stage, which would save on uranium imports. The first demonstration Monju fast breeder reactor (FBR) is expected to start operating by 2000. An advanced thermal demonstration reactor (ATR) will be constructed in Ohma-cho, Aomori Prefecture, and will start operating in 2002. It is doubtful that any type of commercial version of the FBR-ATR reactor will be generating electricity before 2010, after the current expansion timetable has passed. Japan's expressed determination to press ahead with its multi-faceted nuclear programme has sparked wide controversy, not least because of the world glut of uranium. This surplus, like that of oil, could slow down Japan's nuclear expansion.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.     P1629 Heavy Construction, NEC.

By ARLEN DEAN SNYDER, Arlen Dean Snyder is a television and film actor who  lives in the Los Angeles community of Sun Valley.      The bright purple, hand-painted Model A Ford was nothing but a slowly moving  dark shadow in the full moonlight. Lights out, transmission growling and four  cylinders laboring, it jolted the five teen-age boys unmercifully as it crept  from one solid clay rut to another over the sun-baked dirt road.    The four passengers giggled and cursed in whispers at the car and the driver  until he turned into a field lane, backed up, headed the car in the other  direction and stopped in the middle of the road. They all piled out, still  giggling and cursing in good humor, and climbed up the embankment to the four  strands of barbed wire that claimed the object of their quest: the property of  a local farmer. They carefully crawled through the wire and, making certain  they weren't trampling the vines, thumped their way toward a ripe, delicious,  illicit feast. They heard the distinctive whine of a bullet just before it  ricocheted off the metal windmill silhouetted in the middle of the field. Two  more bullets pinged as the five boys sped at a dead run for the barbed barrier  and the prayed-for safety of the road beyond.    The engine complained to life and the transmission howled to the moonlit world  as they departed with much less caution than they had employed on their  arrival. In the back, the ""town boys"" shared handkerchiefs as they swabbed the  blood oozing from cuts inflicted by the four strands of discouragement. The two  ""farm boys"" in front needed no such nursing and soon began to giggle anew as  the fear of a rifle-inflicted death faded in the distance behind them. Soon all  five were laughing heartily as they headed for town where, over Cokes, they  celebrated and embroidered the story of surviving their latest exploit.    It was Watermelon Night.    A test of courage. A test of skill. A rite of passage from summer and field  work to fall and school work, and a rite of passage from boyhood to teenhood as  well.

By ARLEN DEAN SNYDER, Arlen Dean Snyder is a television and film actor who  lives in the Los Angeles community of Sun Valley.      The bright purple, hand-painted Model A Ford was nothing but a slowly moving  dark shadow in the full moonlight. Lights out, transmission growling and four  cylinders laboring, it jolted the five teen-age boys unmercifully as it crept  from one solid clay rut to another over the sun-baked dirt road.    The four passengers giggled and cursed in whispers at the car and the driver  until he turned into a field lane, backed up, headed the car in the other  direction and stopped in the middle of the road. They all piled out, still  giggling and cursing in good humor, and climbed up the embankment to the four  strands of barbed wire that claimed the object of their quest: the property of  a local farmer. They carefully crawled through the wire and, making certain  they weren't trampling the vines, thumped their way toward a ripe, delicious,  illicit feast. They heard the distinctive whine of a bullet just before it  ricocheted off the metal windmill silhouetted in the middle of the field. Two  more bullets pinged as the five boys sped at a dead run for the barbed barrier  and the prayed-for safety of the road beyond.    The engine complained to life and the transmission howled to the moonlit world  as they departed with much less caution than they had employed on their  arrival. In the back, the ""town boys"" shared handkerchiefs as they swabbed the  blood oozing from cuts inflicted by the four strands of discouragement. The two  ""farm boys"" in front needed no such nursing and soon began to giggle anew as  the fear of a rifle-inflicted death faded in the distance behind them. Soon all  five were laughing heartily as they headed for town where, over Cokes, they  celebrated and embroidered the story of surviving their latest exploit.    It was Watermelon Night.    A test of courage. A test of skill. A rite of passage from summer and field  work to fall and school work, and a rite of passage from boyhood to teenhood as  well.    The leaders were usually sophomores and old hands at this event. The followers  were freshmen, eager for initiation. The event had its long-established rules:  The knights errant must respect the property, the value of the vines and the  farmer's livestock.

It has earmarked Pounds 1bn as an initial contribution. The company disclosed its decision yesterday as it published its submission to the government's nuclear review. It follows criticism from nuclear industry opponents who say BNFL and other companies are putting decommissioning plans at risk by investing funds meant for that purpose in other nuclear projects. BNFL said it had decided independently that the fund would ensure that the 'necessary financial resources will be available when liabilities become due many years into the future'. Provided ministers approve the company's plans, the government would hold the fund. A newly created BNFL subsidiary would have access to the fund and would take over responsibility for Pounds 10bn of current and future nuclear liabilities arising at its sites. It would have 30 staff. BNFL strongly opposes a proposal by the Atomic Energy Authority that one company manage all the nuclear industry's liabilities. Mr John Guinness, BNFL chairman, said this would create a large bureaucracy and his company preferred a competitive approach. In its review submission, BNFL says privatisation is an issue for government but it seeks 'avoidance of bureaucratic interference and double guessing of the company's commercial judgment'. The submission makes no judgment about pleas by Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear for privatisation. However, Mr Guinness said yesterday that his company supported their view that privatisation would provide a much better opportunity for building new power stations. BNFL wants nuclear power stations to be built. It says there are 'no credible alternatives to take nuclear power's place if global energy requirements, environmental targets, energy conservation and sustainable development policies are to be achieved'. The company calls for a 'level playing field across the energy industry which fully reflects environmental costs'. In a joint submission to the review, electricity unions said that UK dependency on gas for electricity generation could rise to 90 per cent by the year 2020 if no new power stations were built using other fuels. The unions call for the government to authorise the construction of Sizewell C, a planned 2,500MW nuclear station on the Suffolk coast, through a partnership between the private and public sectors.

By the year 2000, the country's nuclear power plants will  have a capacity of 6 million kilowatts while new plants with  another 6 million kilowatts in capacity will be under  construction, You Deliang, a spokesman of the China National  Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) said yesterday.    China's first nuclear power station, at Qinshan in Zhejiang  Province, is now safely and efficiently operating, You added.    And, by the end of this year, experts predict it will have  generated 1.73 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity since it  was linked to the national grid in December 1991.    Work on Qinshan's second phase, two generators with a  capacity of 600,000 kilowatts each, has also begun.    Meanwhile, Generator No 1 at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Station is expected to go into commercial operation soon, while  Generator No 2 will go into commercial operation before next  June.    Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, near Shenzhen in Guangdong  is  the country's first joint-venture nuclear power plant.    Its two generators are designed to generate 10 to 12.6  billion kilowatthours of electricity a year, he said.    The power will be sold to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong  to  support their economic development.    CNNC President Jiang Xinxiong said the establishment of the  two power stations was a milestone for China's nuclear power  industry.    The Chinese began late in this field and must strive to make  advances to fuel the country's economic growth, he said.    China's booming economy has also provided a huge market for  nuclear energy, Jiang said.    Provinces, especially in Southeast China's coastal areas,  consider nuclear power an important means to meet their  increasing energy demands.    Jiang said the corporation had also made big strides in  developing nuclear fuel.    A production line, introduced from France to produce pressed  [as published] water reactor (PWR) nuclear fuel has been built  and is due to go into production next year.    Jiang said CNNC's industrial output in 1993 rose 37.7  percent  compared to last year. In addition, CNNC is trying to grab a  share of the international market by exporting its nuclear power  generators.    Pakistan is negotiating with China to import a second  300,000- kilowatt generator now that the first one is being  built.     "

The venture, one of the largest cable investments in the UK announced this year, will cover Cardiff, Newport and West Glamorgan, embracing more than 300,000 homes and 26,000 businesses. It marks a significant diversification for South Wales Electricity (Swalec), one of the 12 privatised electricity distribution companies in England and Wales. Swalec forecasts that 10 per cent of its earnings could come from the joint venture by the year 2000. The launch follows Swalec's decision earlier this week to buy the cable franchise for West Glamorgan and CableTel's success earlier this month in raising more than Dollars 400m (Pounds 265m) in debt and equity in New York to finance new UK cable ventures. Mr Wynford Evans, Swalec's chairman, said the deal offered 'significant business and domestic potential'. The new fibre optic network would give 'enormous opportunities for expansion'. The joint venture will involve an initial investment of Pounds 75m by the two companies - Pounds 30m from Swalec, Pounds 45m from CableTel. Once the company reaches positive cashflow, it plans to raise another Pounds 125m to complete its network. In addition to equity, Swalec will use its billing and customer service systems for the new venture. CableTel will contribute expertise in cable operation. Swalec expects that within ten years half of the residents in its south Wales area will be taking cable TV and more than a third cable telephone. So far only one other regional electricity distributor has entered the telecommunications market - Yorkshire Electricity, which is constructing a regional fibre-optic network covering Yorkshire and Humberside. However, the National Grid, owned jointly by the 12 distributors, is erecting an optical fibre network on its pylons. Other privatised utilities are also entering the market. In August Yorkshire Water took a stake in a joint venture to build a cable network for Yorkshire. The other partners are Singapore Telecom and Generale des Eaux, the French diversified services group. In the two years since the ending of the UK telecoms duopoly between BT and Mercury, cable operators have recruited nearly 250,000 subscribers to their telephone networks.

FGMs are considered next-generation new  materials capable of producing a high-efficiency energy  conversion system with high-power output. The technology  development in this area has been attracting considerable  attention because of its application potential as a source of  electricity in space stations and direct electricity generation  reactors. This project constitutes comprehensive research funded  by the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and  Technology. It is a 5-year project starting in FY93. The first  phase (3 years) of the project includes: FGMs for various types  of energy conversion such as the ``thermoelectric conversion  element'' which can convert energy efficiently by gradually  changing the composition and the structure of the materials; and  the development of high-efficiency, high-performance energy  conversion. The second phase (2 years) includes the  establishment of the key technology for design and manufacturing  for application in space systems.    FGMs are composite materials created from materials that  perform completely different functions. Joined together, the  materials gradually change in composition and structure from one  side to the other. This is a new concept that originated in  Japan. It results in new materials which share the advantages of  a number of materials. When FGMs are used for thermoelectric  conversion elements that convert high heat into electricity, for  example, the energy conversion efficiency rate increases  tremendously.    This comprehensive research project will pursue development  of manufacturing technology and structural control technology by  focusing on thermoelectric conversion which involves a great  deal of crucial development of functionally gradient structures  among various energy conversion materials. It is theoretically  possible to create materials that perform at high efficiency and  high output by applying FGM technology to thermoelectric  conversion elements which have maximum performance indexes at  particular temperature levels. Furthermore, the project team  plans to examine technical viability of developing an  ``ultra-high efficiency energy conversion system'' which can  combine functionally gradient structured thermoelectric,  thermionic high energy conversion elements at their most  appropriate energy levels.    The participants of the project include the STA, the  National  Aerospace Laboratory, the National Research Institute of Metals,  MITI's National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research of  the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute  of Technology, Kogakuin University, Daikin Industries, Ltd., and  Hitachi, Ltd.

0,FT924-4905 ,"FT924-4905 _AN-CK3BQABYFT 921130   FT  30 NOV 92 / Coal on his Christmas list: Michael Heseltine must wrestle with tough choices as he formulates UK energy policy      By DAVID LASCELLES   Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, may not spend much time with his family this Christmas. The festive season will find him trying to hammer together a plan to save British Coal in time to meet his self-imposed deadline of publishing a white paper 'early in the new year'. He will not lack ideas. In the seven weeks since British Coal triggered a crisis with its announcement of 31 pit closures and the loss of 30,000 jobs, he has been deluged with suggestions from industrial, social and public interests. The parallel hearings conducted by the Commons select committee on trade and industry have also produced hundreds of pages of testimony. With the consultation period now drawing to a close, these will all go into the melting pot. The overall message is clear: Britain's energy policy, insofar as any exists, is in a mess; people are confused and shocked by the decision to shut down half the coal industry, and they think the answer lies in government taking a more active role. But unfortunately for Mr Heseltine, the torrent of words does not contain an easy solution to his dilemma. If anything, the debate has shown that virtually anything he does to try and increase coal's share of the UK energy market will have a knock-on cost, either as higher prices, jobs lost or subsidies. It has also become evident that he will be hard-pressed to save more than a third of the 30,000 jobs at risk. But the result need not be just a short-term palliative. One of the few encouraging points emphasised by the debate is that British Coal might have stronger prospects if it can only be helped over the next three or four difficult years. Mr Heseltine's white paper will have to balance many competing aims. These include: saving a large enough number of coal jobs to quell public outrage, but keeping the cost to a minimum; achieving quick results, but also creating a sensible long-term framework; taking government initiative without destroying the overriding aim of introducing market forces into the energy sector; making the rescue a boost rather than a burden to the economy as it struggles to recover. The fundamental question which Mr Heseltine will have to answer before he considers possible courses of action is who will bear the cost of saving British Coal, the taxpayer or the electricity consumer. The trade secretary himself has put the total cost of keeping British Coal at its present size at Pounds 1.2bn a year. The case for placing the cost on the taxpayer is that saving miners' jobs is essentially a social matter. Coal is uncommercial, and if wider national considerations require it to be saved, the country at large should foot the bill. But having only just agreed the spending cuts needed for the Autumn Statement, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will be in no mood to countenance fresh outlays. Saving coal would add about a half penny to the basic rate of income tax. There is a stronger case for loading the cost on the electricity consumer. Here, the argument is that saving coal is not a social matter but a prudent way of diversifying the country's fuel supplies. A rescue financed by consumers would also save the government a large sum of money by reducing the state's redundancy bill for jobless miners. Mr Heseltine may find it easier to bury the cost in electricity bills. At the moment these are unlikely to rise next year because of the effect of price controls. If Mr Heseltine forces them up, household consumers may not notice much difference, though industrial consumers could kick up a fuss about the threat to recovery: 'What we need is price decreases, not price increases,' Mr Peter Rost, the chairman of the Major Energy Users Council told the select committee. None of the possible solutions would meet all of Mr Heseltine's requirements. Some, such as the suggestion that power generators be asked to hold larger coal stocks, are plainly impractical because their yards are already bulging with coal, and British Coal itself has 20m tonnes lying unsold. Suggestions that imports of coal and electricity should be banned are ruled out by the commercial and diplomatic repercussions. The solution that looks most attractive remains one of the first to be mooted: the extension of the so-called franchise market in which most of the electricity generated from British Coal's output is sold. Those in this market, which consists of all but the 5,000 largest electricity consumers in the country, have to buy power from their local distribution company. It accounts for 70 per cent of electricity consumed, and prices have been maintained at artificially high levels to help coal. The intention was to phase the franchise market out in stages starting in 1994, and to liberalise competition completely by 1998. Mr Heseltine could delay this timetable, either through legislation or with the agreement of the electricity regulator, Prof Stephen Littlechild. Such a move would be welcomed by many regional distribution companies which are not looking forward to tougher competition, and it would place the cost on the consumer rather than the taxpayer. Above all, it would achieve quick results because it would give the electricity industry confidence to sign up for larger deliveries of coal in the new five-year contracts which they are negotiating with British Coal. These contracts, due to start next April, are crucial to British Coal's future. The franchise market could be extended in a further way, along the lines of a proposal by Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the largest generator. He suggested that Mr Heseltine decree that this market could only be served by electricity generated from coal produced in the UK. This would mean excluding the controversial new gas-fired generators which have been accused by large electricity users and the coal lobby of being uneconomic. The present structure of the market allows the regional electricity companies to pass on any higher costs directly to consumers. Mr Baker's suggestion would also staunch coal imports. Although Mr Baker's proposal looks self-serving because National Power is the largest supplier of electricity to the franchise market, it would return that market to the role for which it was originally created - to protect coal. It would doubtless provoke a cry of protest  - and probably legal action - from the gas projects' owners. But it would also put to the test the claim which these projects have always made that gas can compete in a free market. 'They can't have it both ways,' says Mr Baker. Together, these measures could add 15m tonnes of coal to the 40m tonnes currently expected to be burnt for power generation next year. By contrast, the other front-running suggestion - that Mr Heseltine accelerate the closure of the UK's ageing magnox nuclear reactors - has fewer attractions. Although these reactors are currently subsidised to the tune of Pounds 1.2bn a year, their closure would not save this money since it is earmarked for decommissioning costs which will be needed anyway. On top of that, premature closure would deprive the Treasury of the considerable earnings which the magnoxes generate now that their costs have been fully written down. Nuclear Electric puts the potential revenue loss at Pounds 2bn. A further drawback is that nuclear power stations cannot be closed down at a stroke; their closure would not spark any immediate additional demand for coal. While Mr Heseltine will want quick results, he will also need to lay out long-term plans in order to rebuild confidence in the energy sector. The question here is whether he will want to institutionalise a more active government energy policy by creating an energy commission, or even reviving the department of energy which he scrapped only six months ago. There is strong political support for the idea of an energy commission. Public opinion seems to favour making the country's fuel mix a matter of national policy which takes account of social, economic and environmental needs. It also looks as if the select committee will back such a scheme. The committee's hopes that Prof Littlechild would perform this role were dashed when he told them that it was not his job to promote particular types of fuel or save the coal industry. The committee subsequently welcomed a blueprint for an energy agency proposed by Dr Dieter Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates. But Mr Heseltine would have to decide whether closer government intervention marked a large step back from its long-term plan of introducing market forces into the energy sector. For one thing, it would require detailed legislation. The cost of trying to dictate the fuel mix could also be huge because of the subsidies and distortions it would introduce. The economics of the electricity generation and distribution business would be radically altered only two years after privatisation. But are these fears exaggerated? Mr Francis McGowan of the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University, a leading academic centre on energy policy, says it should be possible to adopt a more active policy without falling into the same mistakes as the past. The privatisation of the power industry and the creation of regulators to protect consumers' interests have made the market much more transparent. 'The pendulum has to swing back a bit the other way,' he says. Would a solution that created a market for an extra 15m tonnes of coal production be enough? Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, delivered a gloomy warning to the select committee. Because of the increases of productivity which his company is making, the need for labour will fall anyway. So even though 15m tonnes represents half the amount by which British Coal production was due to be cut, it would at the most save only 10 of the 31 threatened pits, and a third of the miners' jobs. But by the same token, a breathing space would enable British Coal to bring more of its pits up to competitive strength. According to John T. Boyd, the mining consultancy hired by the government to advise on the closures, 28 of the pits could produce coal at an average price of Pounds 1.33 a gigajoule within three or four years, and some could do better. That compares with the current price of Pounds 1.80, and would take British Coal within range of imported coal prices. Mr Heseltine may conclude that it is worth holding back changes in the power market in the hopes of securing these gains, and putting British Coal on a sounder long-term footing, particularly if he can point to wider social benefits. But there will be a hefty price to pay.  The Financial Times   London Page 14  "

0,FT942-16820 ,"FT942-16820 _AN-EDHDEABSFT 940408   FT  08 APR 94 / South leads race to beat VAT on fuel      By MICHAEL SMITH   Householders have paid out a total of Pounds 990m to electricity companies and British Gas to avoid paying value added tax on future fuel bills. People in the south of England have participated far more actively than others in the race to beat the tax collector. A final count among British Gas and electricity companies by the Financial Times shows that 1.1m power consumers and 500,000 British Gas customers made advance payments ahead of the VAT imposition on April 1. The pre-payments will deprive the Treasury of at least Pounds 79m, since the VAT will initially be levied at 8 per cent. A precise figure is impossible to gauge because some of the pre-payments cover more than a year and from April next year VAT on fuel will rise to 17.5 per cent. Sweb, the electricity company serving the south-west of England, appears to have the most financially conscious customers, with 9.3 per cent of consumers paying in advance. Generally the participation rate was high throughout the south, with Seeboard, based in Hove, receiving advance payments from 7.4 per cent of customers and London Electricity from 5.6 per cent. That compares with a nationwide average for power and gas consumers of 4.3 per cent. The lowest participation rate in Great Britain was 2.4 per cent by customers of Northern Electric. In Northern Ireland, only 1.8 per cent of electricity consumers paid in advance. The participation rate among British Gas's 18m customers was also relatively low, at 2.8 per cent. The companies have markedly different policies on what to do with the interest they make on the money they have received. British Gas said it was difficult to speculate 'what the amount might be and therefore to what use it might be put', although it added that it was already involved heavily in community projects. London Electricity said it had 'no plans at present to do anything in particular with the money'. Norweb, serving north-west England, said it would not treat the money in any special way. However, Scottish Power said that none of the money would be added to profits. It will donate all the interest generated from pre-payments to 'disadvantaged groups within our area, particularly those most likely to have been affected by the introduction of value added tax'. Midlands Electricity said that 'as a direct result of pre-payments' it would give Pounds 500,000 to Neighbourhood Energy Action, a charity. Most companies said they had incurred considerable expense in setting up the infrastructure to deal with pre-payments. Southern Electric estimates this at Pounds 700,000 leaving the net interest benefit after tax at less than Pounds 1m in a full year. Seeboard said any surplus after costs would be used to cut prices.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Money to burn?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-payments for domestic fuel                            Amount    As % of      No. of        As % of                          pre-paid     annual   customers      total no.

By the year 2000, the country's nuclear power plants will  have a capacity of 6 million kilowatts while new plants with  another 6 million kilowatts in capacity will be under  construction. You Deliang, a spokesman of the China National  Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), said yesterday.    China's first nuclear power station, at Qinshan in Zhejiang  Province, is now safely and efficiently operating, You added.    And, by the end of this year, experts predict it will have  generated 1.73 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity since it  was linked to the national grid in December 1991.    Work on Qinshan's second phase, two generators with a  capacity of 600,000 kilowatts each, has also begun.    Meanwhile, Generator No 1 at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Station is expected to go into commercial operation soon, while  Generator No 2 will go into commercial operation before next  June.    Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, near Shenzhen in Guangdong,  is the country's first joint-venture nuclear power plant.    Its two generators are designed to generate 10 to 12.6  billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, he said.    The power will be sold to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong  to  support their economic development.    CNNC President Jiang Xinxiong said the establishment of the  two power stations was a milestone for China's nuclear power  industry.    The Chinese began late in this field and must strive to make  advances to fuel the country's economic growth, he said.    China's booming economy has also provided a huge market for  nuclear energy, Jiang said.    Provinces, especially in Southeast China's coastal areas,  consider nuclear power an important means to meet their  increasing energy demands.    Jiang said the corporation had also made big strides in  developing nuclear fuel.    A production line, introduced from France to produce pressed  water reactor (PWR) nuclear fuel has been built and is due to go  into production next year.    Jiang said CNNC's industrial output in 1993 rose 37.7  percent  compared to last year. In addition, CNNC is trying to grab a  share of the international market by exporting its nuclear power  generators.    Pakistan is negotiating with China to import a second  300,000-kilowatt generator now that the first one is being built.     "

The shakeup centres on the restructuring and commercialisation of largely inefficient state utilities and the entry into the electricity supply field of independent power producers to compete with national power companies. Hand-in-hand with this is an accelerated programme to cut electricity tariff subsidies and make such tariffs more commercial. These reforms are being actively promoted by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the various bilateral aid institutions, such as Japan's Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund. They stress that growing commercialisation of Asia's power sector will broaden the financial base of those countries most in need and will make it more possible for them to continue to build up their power programmes to fuel economic growth. The ADB recently pointed out that developing Asia's electricity capacity will have to be increased by 300,000 MW in the 1990s if the region is to maintain its economic growth, now running at around six per cent a year. This would mean a doubling of existing capacity for a region comprising 3.1bn people, 58 per cent of the world's population. By comparison, the US has 600,000 MW of capacity, and its population is 240m. Mr James Rockett, the ADB's senior energy specialist, recently said this would require a capital investment of about Dollars 501bn each year, all the more reason for spurring privatisation. The ADB had lent Dollars 9.2bn to the energy sector since 1969, and annual lending to the sector was now so large that this figure would be eclipsed in only a few years at current rates of lending. The share of all Bank funds for the sector last year climbed by 10 percentage points to 36 per cent compared with 1990, Mr Rockett said. World Bank lending last year to the power sector stood at Dollars 992m, and its Asian energy loans this year were surging ahead and should easily surpass last year's. The various reforms imply that private sector growth will come from thermal power stations, which can be put up relatively quickly by independent power companies, depending on size. There will be much thermal power growth under the long-range plans of state utilities as well. Nuclear, particularly in the cash-rich Asian Far East, and hydro-electric capacity, notably in China and India, also will be expanded. But these also are longer-term projects that must run the gamut of regulatory approvals. They are not private-sector friendly. The pro-privatisation legislative changes have been spearheaded by Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, all of which are now pushing open their doors, to varying degrees, to independent power producers. For its part, China in recent years has contracted out to several Hong Kong companies, particularly Hopewell Holdings and New World Development Group, the construction of coal-fired power stations in Guangdong province. Almost without exception, the reforming nations have announced plans to nearly double capacity by the end of the century. The challenge was underlined by India's Energy Minister, Mr Shri Kalp Nath Rai. He told a recent Financial Times electricity conference in Singapore that India needed to add 48,000 MW of capacity (it now has 69,000 MW) in the next five years, but only 31,000 could be afforded out of state funds. 'The rest will have to come from the private sector.' The combination of big aid flows and the new ingredient of privatisation is prompting aggressive sales drives by the world's leading producers of turbines and boilers. The usual modus operandi of such companies as Siemens/Kraftwerk Union of Germany, the European ABB group; the Anglo-French GEC/Alsthom, the American majors Westinghouse Electric and General Electric has been to establish joint ventures with regional companies, such as India's Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (Siemens), for local manufacture of low- to medium-technology turbine equipment. This would ease pressure on foreign exchange. This practice is now about to change, with big equipment suppliers now poised to start taking equity stakes in Asian private power projects. Mr. According to Andreas Kley, group executive manager for Siemens/KWU: 'The trend towards non-utility power plants ..has encouraged our group to augment our traditional role as a builder and now to participate actively as partner and investor in the planning and development of independent power plants.' The emerging consensus is that Asia's growth will focus on gas turbines and combined cycle, largely because of speed of installation and gas's emergence as the most environmentally friendly fuel for power plants. Mr DW Williamson, vice-president, GE Industrial and Power Systems, says the Asia-Pacific region will account for 29 per cent of the world's capacity additions. 'Japan, Korea and Taiwan alone represent nearly 60,000 MW of new orders between now and 1995,' he says. India is also a major market 'where an emerging middle class of nearly 200m people is driving new load growth, which will require 26,000 MW of uncommitted capacity additions over the next decade'. He sees gas turbines and combined cycle as accounting for 45 per cent of global additions, with steam turbine plants holding at 35 per cent, and hydro and nuclear playing a more limited role.

The first project involves hydro electricity with an  investment of Bt2 billion. The other is an underground thermal  project in Keng Tung, Burma, with an investment of Bt2 billion.  New Zealand will participate in the latter project.    According to Chulaphong Chunlaket, governor of the  Provincial  Electricity Authority, the Thai authority recently agreed with  Brig Gen Kyaw Win, representing the Burmese side, to jointly  invest in a hydro-electricity plant at Mae Sai River costing Bt2  billion, 70 per cent of which will come from the Thai side.    Chulaphong said that the authority will invite the private  sector to provide up to Bt700 million or half the total Thai  investment.    The hydro-power plant will produce 12 megawatts of  electricity. The plant will supply two megawatts of electricity  to Burma at Bt1.75 per unit. The remaining 10 megawatts will be  distributed in Mae Sai district in Chiang Rai.    Chulaphong said that the Burmese side will provide labour  and  construction materials. He added that the Thai government does  not need funding from the Asian Development Bank as private  investment should be enough to fund the project.    The Mae Sai power project is one of seven projects looked at  by the Thai-Burmese border committee. The other six are the  Khlong Kra project, North Salween project, South Salween  project, Moei projects I, II and III.    The Burmese side engaged EPDC [expansion unknown] of Japan  to  study the Mae Sai project one year ago.    Chulaphong said that Thailand has yet to fully study the  Khlong Kra project, and it is expected that a feasibility study  will be started after the study on the Mae Sai project is  completed.    When the Mae Sai project runs at full capacity, it might  have  a capacity of 15 megawatts, Chulaphong added.    The second project is an underground thermal unit in Keng  Tung, Burma, which is expected to have a capacity of 10  megawatts. The project requires an investment of Bt2 billion.  The Burmese side will own 30 per cent of it, the same as the  Mae Sai project.    Chulaphong said that the second project is under  negotiation,  and the Provincial Electricity Authority has invited private  companies from New Zealand to participate in the project.     "

The company said it had bought a 'very small amount' to 'gain marketing and operational experience in the gas market'. It had customers lined up to buy the gas. Rival generator PowerGen already has a toe-hold in the gas market through Kinetica, a joint venture with Conoco, the oil company. Several other successful bidders are joint ventures between regional electricity companies and gas suppliers. British Gas agreed with the Office of Fair Trading earlier this year to sell 500m therms of gas in the first of a series of annual sales aimed at reducing the company's share of the industrial market from 90 per cent to 40 per cent by 1995. British Gas said yesterday that it could not release details of the allocations, but it is thought that 23 suppliers each received 17.8m therms, with nine others receiving the minimum allocation of 10m therms. Some larger suppliers criticised the way the auction was operated, warning that it could impede the development of competition. Mr John Astrop, commercial director of Kinetica, which supplies 1,000 sites, was 'very disappointed' with the allocation. He said: 'It is less than we hoped for, and shows the problems with allocating the gas on a per capita basis without taking account of who are the established, long-term players.' He was worried that the auction may have encouraged smaller companies to buy gas, although they would be unwilling or unable to secure longer-term supplies. This could hinder the growth of longer-term players and slow the development of real competition. The Gas Consumers Council said it was surprised at the number of successful applicants, and welcomed the widened choice for consumers. Many observers said it was inevitable that an 'after market' would develop in gas supplies, with trading between independent suppliers.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Bangkok stockbrokers said yesterday that the company should complete its initial public offering in Nov-ember. Egco, a subsidiary of the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat), has successfully arranged Bt14.75bn (Dollars 590m) of debt financing and plans to raise nearly Bt5bn more by selling its shares. Egco stock is expected to begin trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in December or January. The money raised is to fund the purchase of an Egat power station at Rayong, south-east of Bangkok. Egco also has the option of buying the Khanom power station being completed in Nakhon Si Thammarat in the south of the country. In line with the Thai practice of partial privatisation of state enterprises, only 50 per cent of the shares will be sold to the public, with Egat keeping 48 per cent and 2 per cent going to the Crown Property Bureau. Full details of the offering have yet to be released. Brokers say that demand for the shares is likely be strong. The Thai economy is growing at more than 8 per cent a year, and electricity use has been increasing even faster. Furthermore, the pricing formula agreed between Egat and Egco ensures Egco a predictable income because it is based on Egco's usable capacity and not on the amount of electricity actually produced and sent to the grid. Egco executives say they expect their company to take part in future projects by independent power producers (IPPs), although since Egco will still be controlled by Egat it would appear to enjoy an unfair advantage in bidding for concessions to be granted by Egat itself. The World Bank has therefore recommended that Egco be fully privatised. Egat has asked IPPs to propose by February next year power projects to produce 3,800MW in three tranches from 2000 to 2002. By then, Egat and the metropolitan and provincial distribution authorities are expected to have sold some of their equity to private investors.

0,FT944-3015 ,"FT944-3015 _AN-ELOCSADMFT 941215   FT  15 DEC 94 / Technology: Whispers from the runway - A transport system that will be propelled by magnetic attraction      By MICHAEL LINDEMANN   For the past 10 years a 90-tonne machine has been tearing around an elevated concrete track in north-west Germany, reaching speeds of up to 450kph but making none of the noise made by aircraft travelling at that speed. It is the Transrapid high-speed train, also known as the whispering arrow. Now, after years of debate, the German government has approved plans to build a 284km track between Berlin and Hamburg, Germany's two biggest cities, in a move that is expected to take passengers away from those airlines flying the route. The Transrapid will be the world's first long-distance transport system propelled by magnetic levitation, a technology that Thyssen, the German conglomerate, has been developing. Instead of conventional engines, the Transrapid is propelled by magnetic fields. It has no wheels and rather than run on conventional railway tracks it clutches a concrete runway rather like the runner on a curtain rail. The technology dates from the 1920s when Hermann Kemper, an electronic engineer who ran a meat packing business near the present 32km test site in Emsland, began poring over papers about the theory of magnetic levitation. Kemper developed a model in his cellar where objects were fired along runways by passing mains electricity through electromagnets mounted on the objects and on the runway. In 1934 he registered his patents and tried unsuccessfully to persuade Siemens, the electronics company, to take up his ideas. What was missing, according to Hans Georg Raschbichler, an engineer from Thyssen Henschel, the locomotive builder, was the means to produce and transport large amounts of electricity at split-second intervals. 'They didn't have the sort of high-tech electronics which exist today,' he says in his office in Munich. Now that large amounts of electricity can be passed around a grid and engineers can regulate the 10mm gap between the runway and the vehicle, two key bits of technology are available which mean that Kemper's model can become a real ity. The Transrapid operates on different principles from the maglev technology used elsewhere in the world. Conventional magnetic levitation works by using the repellant force of superconductive magnets of opposite polarities. In the Transrapid, propulsion comes from the force of magnetic attraction. By passing electrical current through a stator pack, the stationary part of an electric motor which is laid out on the underside of a concrete runway, a wandering magnetic field is created. This magnetic field - called wandering because it moves down the runway - is attracted or excited by levitation magnets mounted on the underside of the Transrapid, so propelling the vehicle forward. The Transrapid picks up speed proportional to the increase in electrical current; the opposite happens when the frequency is reduced. If there is a power failure, batteries on board the Transrapid are used to power the eddy current braking system and to guide the vehicle to an emergency stop on the runway. The vehicle glides about 10mm above the concrete runway, a gap which is measured by a computerised sensor: if it becomes smaller, the computer orders more electricity, less if it becomes bigger. The process is repeated thousands of times, keeping the gap constant and enabling the magnet to pull the Transrapid. Raschbichler heads a team of engineers at Thyssen Henschel which ran the Transrapid 07, the seventh prototype, up to a maximum speed of 450kph last year. They are now putting it through 500,000km of tests before it can be licensed to operate. Tests have shown that the vehicle uses less energy and is quieter than the French TGV (Train a Grande Vitesse) or the German InterCity Express (ICE), the two high-speed trains which are its main competitors. Stand 25m away from a Transrapid passing at 300kph, and the maximum noise level recorded is 87 decibels - less than a freight train travelling at 100kmh. Tests by independent engineers recorded about 100 decibels for a TGV travelling at the same speed. Because the Transrapid glides above a concrete runway it does not need to overcome the resistance between track and wheels which traditional railway technology still has to grapple with. That means, according to Thyssen Henschel, that the Transrapid uses around 30 per cent less energy than a high-speed train travelling at the same speed. The government hopes that by 2004 a runway - similar to the present test track - will be built and that more than 14m passengers a year will be hurtling between Germany's two biggest cities. A journey that now takes more than three hours by train will take just 55 minutes by Transrapid. The DM5.6bn (Pounds 2.3bn) needed to finance the runway and infrastructure will be put up by the federal government, and Thyssen has created a company together with Lufthansa, the national airline, and Deutsche Bahn, the state railway, which have to find DM4.8bn to operate the service. The Japanese are working on similar technology but opted in the early 1970s for an electrodynamic levitation system - where magnets repel rather than attract each other. The different system also creates a 10cm gap, rather than 10mm, between the vehicle and the runway which the Japanese say is better suited to deal with earthquake risks. The Transrapid technology creates magnetic fields of about 40 amps - no bigger than those created by an electric razor - while the Japanese have to grapple with big magnetic fields of up to 700,000 amps. About four times as much electricity is needed to control the movement of the Japanese train across such big magnetic fields and Thyssen says they are so powerful it is thought people wearing pacemakers will not be able to use the trains.

0,FT941-1100 ,"FT941-1100 _AN-EC0AVADKFT 940326   FT  26 MAR 94 / Boost for building societies from fuel payment windfall      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   Windfall funds received by some regional electricity companies from customers seeking to avoid value added tax are to be deposited in building societies. The utilities hope the move will deflect criticism that mortgage rates could be driven up as householders draw heavily from their societies to pay power bills in advance. Bills paid before next Thursday will not be liable to VAT. Seeboard, based in Hove, which has received Pounds 51m in the last few days, said yesterday it was aware of a heavy outflow from the societies as householders sought to beat the VAT deadline. Southern Electric, which has taken in Pounds 48m from customers, will also redeposit a portion of these funds, as will Midlands Electricity, according to Mr Peter Chapman, its finance director. The Building Societies Association has reported heavy withdrawals from members this month. It attributed this largely to householders trying to avoid VAT. From April 1 home fuel bills will be subject to 8 per cent VAT. Next year, the rate will be 17.5 per cent. By last night, householders had paid in more than Pounds 400m, depriving the Treasury of about Pounds 40m in tax revenues. But the money is still flowing in, and most electricity companies said they would accept last-minute payments, provided they were made at their shops and offices. However, it emerged yesterday that British Gas passed over an opportunity to save its 18.5m domestic customers part of the new tax. Earlier this year Customs and Excise allowed British Gas to assume, when next billing its customers, that they used 2.5 units of gas each day before April 1 for every one after that date, reflecting the fact that the earlier part of the billing period was colder. But British Gas will count all days the same. The Gas Consumers Council estimated this would cost customers Pounds 23m in extra tax in the two-year transition to full VAT, and accused the company of 'meanly taking the easy way out'. British Gas confirmed that Customs had allowed the more generous weighting, but said it had come too late to be included in its preparations for the changeover to VAT. The GCC advised householders to read their meters on March 31 to ensure that VAT would not be charged on gas used before then.

(Onga-machi, Fukuoka  Pref.; president: Eiji Ishii), a developer of mechatronic  equipment, has developed a low-cost energy-efficient method for  controlling electric vehicles that employs a general-purpose AC  motor (3-phase AC induction motor). The drive units of electric  vehicles are usually DC motors, but QM Software has reportedly  solved the problem of control at low speed that has been  plaguing AC motors, and is now able to use that motor in  electric cars. The company is also looking at the idea of  forming ties with a car manufacturer in order to commercialize  the motor.    In order to test the motor, it outfit an electric car and  golf cart with the motor, a controller, and battery. The motor  used in the electric car had a maximum 10 kW output (15 hp) and  could achieve a maximum speed of 40 km/hr. The motor used in the  golf cart had a 2.2 kW maximum output (3 hp), a maximum 40 km/hr  driving speed, and a hill-climbing ability less than 20 km/hr. A  general-purpose motor is a lot cheaper and more durable than a  DC motor, but at low speeds it is hard to control due to its  rotational unevenness. QM Software, however, has perfected a way  of achieving smooth control at low speeds by a method known as  ""vector control,"" which it has applied to this motor. The  president of QM Software, Eiji Ishii, said that speed variations  per rpm (revolutions per second) in a four-electrode motor were  less than 0.1 percent, which is quite stable. Because the motor  generates strong torque (rotational force) at low speeds, it  enables quick acceleration and is good for climbing hills.    A general-use motor also has the ability to generate  electricity when going downhill or decelerating, so by returning  this electricity to the battery, it is able to conserve large  amounts of energy. Compared to an electric vehicle equipped with  a similar size DC motor and battery, a car outfitted with this  AC motor can travel far greater distances.    In addition to the electric vehicle and golf cart, the  company is also working on a monorail transport vehicle for golf  courses that it plans to outfit with the same motor. Putting the  motor into commercial mass production is beyond their  capability, so it plans to link up with different manufacturers  who have expertise in that area.     "
0,FT942-2084 ,"FT942-2084 _AN-EFUD5AEMFT 940621   FT  21 JUN 94 / State cash needed to build new nuclear power station      By MICHAEL SMITH   Substantial state support will be needed if the UK is to build another nuclear power station, it emerged yesterday as Nuclear Electric, the state-owned operator, published its evidence to the government's nuclear review. The company acknowledged the cost of producing electricity from a third plant at Sizewell would be about 50 per cent higher than current market prices if the plant was funded by the private sector. Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Electric chief executive, said he expected this year's market price of about 2.4p a kilowatt hour to rise in future years but it would still 'take government commitment and support to build any new nuclear power station'. Nuclear Electric's submission, totalling more than 150 pages, pleads the case for the 2,600MW Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast but also raises the possibility of building a third, smaller plant at Hinkley Point. The company already has planning permission for such a plant. Hinkley C would be easier to finance than Sizewell C, due its smaller capital cost, Pounds 2bn compared with Pounds 3.5bn at Sizewell, but it would offer a slightly lower return on capital, said Nuclear Electric. In its submission, Nuclear Electric confirmed privatisation was its 'top priority'. Mr John Collier, company chairman, said: 'We need commercial freedom to compete on equal terms and to develop our business.' The company wants to sell its advanced gas-cooled reactor and pressurised water reactor stations but it said its Magnox stations and their liabilities should remain in the public sector. It backed its case for privatisation by announcing sharp improvements in efficiencies, with operating losses cut to Pounds 224m last year against Pounds 564m in 1992-93 and costs per unit of electricity down from 3.6p to 3.1p. In addition, it said, major progress in quantifying and reducing liabilities for fuel cycle and decommissioning costs had largely removed the original obstacles to privatisation. Nuclear Electric's submission will be strongly contested during the review which is likely to take up at least most of this year. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, condemned the company's case as wishful thinking. Rival power generation companies believe the figures used by the company are optimistic. They dispute its claim that it will soon become the UK's lowest-cost producer of electricity. Mr Mike Kirwan, finance director, said building Sizewell C would need government help in securing long-term contracts.

Proposed paragraphs (g) and (h) would require independently audited and certified statements of the monthly and annual electric energy generated and sold. The content of the certification should be similar to the type of certification supplied by an accounting firm in a company's annual report to shareholders. Paragraph (h) also describes the calculation necessary when the metered number of kilowatt-hours represents electric energy generated from renewable and non-renewable or excluded-renewable energy sources. The proposed requirement for an independently audited and certified statement will minimize the chance of erroneous claims and the need for DOE audits.   Consistent with applicable regulations under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 5 CFR 1320.6(f), proposed paragraph (k) would require a statement agreeing to retain records for a period of three years to provide for prompt access to, or copies of, such records in response to a written request by DOE. DOE is still considering whether the retention period should be the entire ten year period during which incentive payments may be collected. DOE did not propose a longer retention period because the proposed audit and certification requirements would make fraud or mistake unlikely.       Proposed Section 451.9       Proposed 451.9 describes DOE's procedures for processing applications for incentive payments including the statutory formula for initially calculating the amount due and the adjustment for inflation.

This procedure favors emerging technologies which are similarly favored by the tax credit provisions of sections 1914 and 1916. These technologies are close to or in early commercialization stages where the incentive payments can help speed the commercialization process.

When lightning protection systems are installed, the installation, inspection, and maintenance shall be in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association,     Lightning Protection Code,     17  at a minimum.          17     See footnote 12 to 184.259.         184.162        Static electricity and grounding.        (a) Detailed discussions of the hazards of static electricity and ways of reducing it are published by the National Fire Protection Association, Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., the United States Department of Commerce, and the Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior. Where static spark discharge may be hazardous, NFPA Standard No. 77, 18      Static Electricity,     shall apply except as otherwise specified herein.          18     See footnote 12 to 184.259.3         (b) Grounding of equipment. Bonding straps shall bridge contact points where oil, paint, or rust could disrupt electrical continuity. Permanent equipment in contact with conductive floors or tabletops is not considered adequately grounded. Static grounds shall not be made to gas, steam, or air lines, dry pipe sprinkler systems, or air terminals of lightning protection systems. They may be made to water pipes, ground cones, buried copper plates, driven ground rods, or to down-conductors of lightning protection systems. All grounds shall be interconnected if a structure is equipped with a lightning protection system. Metallic bonding and grounding cables, straps, or clamps shall be compatible with the explosives being processed.    (c) Belts. Conductive belting shall be used wherever static is a hazard. Such belting shall have a resistance to ground not exceeding 600,000 ohms. Static combs shall not be used to drain off static generated from belting or pulleys used in the presence of hazardous concentrations of explosives dust or flammable vapors.    (d) Testing equipment grounds. Grounding systems shall be tested for electrical resistance and continuity when installation has been completed and, in the case of active equipment, at locally determined intervals. The ground systems of equipment inactive longer than 1 month shall be tested for resistance and continuity before reactivation. All exposed explosive or hazardous materials shall be removed before testing. All test records should be kept. In ground-resistance testing, equipment should be considered as a unit. All conductive parts of equipment shall be grounded so that resistance does not exceed 25 ohms, unless 10 ohms is required for lightning protection. To ensure compliance with ohmic requirements, resistance of the belting is to be excluded in measuring the total resistance to ground for belt-drive machinery. The rate of static generation should be considered before changes in grounding systems are made.    (e) Conductive floors. Conductive floors and conductive shoes shall be used for grounding personnel at operations with exposed explosives with electrostatic sensitivity of 0.1 joule or less, such as primer, initiator, detonator, igniter, tracer, and incendiary mixtures. Materials sensitive to static sparks, easily ignited or detonated, include lead styphnate, lead azide, mercury fulminate, tetrazene, diazodinitrophenol, potassium chlorate-lead styphanate mixtures, igniter compositions, grade B magnesium powder, and exposed layers of black powder dust. Dust from solid propellants can be ignited from spark energy, making conductive floors and shoes necessary where such dust is present. Air and dust mixtures of ammonium picrate, tetryl, tetrytol, and solid propellants are also sensitive to static electricity discharge. Many flammable liquids and air mixtures tested (ethyl ether, ethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, acetone, and gasoline) can be ignited by human static discharge. Therefore, areas where personnel might come into contact with the kinds of explosives or mixtures enumerated above shall be equipped with conductive floors, except when the hazards of dust/air or flammable vapor/air mixtures are eliminated by adequate housekeeping, dust collection, ventilation, or solvent recovery methods.    (1) Conductive floors are also required when operations involve the following:    (i) Exposed electro-explosive devices such as squibs, detonators, primers, etc.    (ii) Electrically initiated items, such as rockets, with exposed circuitry.    (iii) Hazardous materials that could be ignited by human static discharge.    (2) When a hazard remains localized, conductive floors and footwear are not required throughout an entire building or room. In such cases, conductive mats or runners may be used. These mats and runners shall meet all the specifications and test requirements that apply to conductive floors.    (f) Conductive floor specifications. Conductive floors, made of nonsparking materials such as lead, conductive rubber, or conductive flooring compositions, shall meet the following requirements:    (1) The flooring and its grounding system shall provide for electrical resistance not to exceed 1 million ohms.    (2) The surface of the installed floor shall be free from cracks and reasonably smooth, and the material shall not slough off, wrinkle, or buckle under operating conditions. Conductive tiles are not recommended for areas where explosives dust can cause contamination, because the large number of joints, and the tendency of tiles to loosen, create areas where explosives dust can lodge, not amenable to normal cleanup procedures. Where conductive floors and shoes are required, the resistance of conductive shoes on a person plus the resistance of floor to ground shall not exceed 1 million ohms total. Tabletops used with exposed explosives or dusts should be covered with a properly grounded conductive material meeting the same requirements as those for the flooring. The conductive floors shall be compatible with the particular materials to be processed.    (g) Initial tests of conductive floors shall be followed by others at least semiannually. The test results shall be permanently recorded. Testing shall proceed only when the room is free from exposed explosives and flammable gas mixtures.    (1) The resistance of the floor shall be more than 5,000 ohms in areas with 110 volts service and 10,000 ohms in areas with 220 volts service, and less than 1 million ohms in all areas as measured between a permanent ground connection and an electrode placed at any point on the floor and also as measured between two electrodes placed 3 feet apart at any points on the floor. Measurements shall be made at five or more locations in each room and at least two of the points shall be heavily trafficked areas. If the resistance during a measurement changes appreciably with time, the value observed after the voltage has been applied for about 5 seconds shall be considered to be the measured value. These resistance values do not apply to metallic floors.    (2) The operation and maintenance of test instruments shall be entrusted to competent personnel.    (h) Humidification. Humidification that maintains relative humidity above 60 percent effectively prevents static electricity accumulations and subsequent discharges. This technique involves pre-operational checks and regular monitoring of the humidity levels throughout the day. It cannot be used with metallic powders, some pyrotechnical mixtures, and other materials susceptible to spontaneous ignition in air with 60 percent relative humidity.    (i) Ionization. Ionization is electrical neutralization and serves as an effective method of removing static charges from certain processes and operations. Methods of application can be found in NFPA Standard 77,     Static Electricity.    (j) Neither ionization or humidification may be substituted for conductive floors (where required).         "," FR941216-1-00134   FR941216-1-00012        (f) Flashlights and lanterns. Flashlights and hand lanterns powered by low-voltage dry cell batteries and miners' cap lamps, approved as ``Permissible'' by the United States Bureau of Mines or, for class I hazardous locations, by Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., or other nationally recognized testing agencies, may be used in both class I and class II hazardous locations.        184.161        Lightning protection.        When lightning protection systems are installed, the installation, inspection, and maintenance shall be in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association,     Lightning Protection Code,     17  at a minimum.          17     See footnote 12 to 184.259.         184.162        Static electricity and grounding.        (a) Detailed discussions of the hazards of static electricity and ways of reducing it are published by the National Fire Protection Association, Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., the United States Department of Commerce, and the Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior. Where static spark discharge may be hazardous, NFPA Standard No. 77, 18      Static Electricity,     shall apply except as otherwise specified herein.          18     See footnote 12 to 184.259.3         (b) Grounding of equipment. Bonding straps shall bridge contact points where oil, paint, or rust could disrupt electrical continuity. Permanent equipment in contact with conductive floors or tabletops is not considered adequately grounded. Static grounds shall not be made to gas, steam, or air lines, dry pipe sprinkler systems, or air terminals of lightning protection systems. They may be made to water pipes, ground cones, buried copper plates, driven ground rods, or to down-conductors of lightning protection systems. All grounds shall be interconnected if a structure is equipped with a lightning protection system. Metallic bonding and grounding cables, straps, or clamps shall be compatible with the explosives being processed.    (c) Belts. Conductive belting shall be used wherever static is a hazard. Such belting shall have a resistance to ground not exceeding 600,000 ohms. Static combs shall not be used to drain off static generated from belting or pulleys used in the presence of hazardous concentrations of explosives dust or flammable vapors.    (d) Testing equipment grounds. Grounding systems shall be tested for electrical resistance and continuity when installation has been completed and, in the case of active equipment, at locally determined intervals. The ground systems of equipment inactive longer than 1 month shall be tested for resistance and continuity before reactivation. All exposed explosive or hazardous materials shall be removed before testing. All test records should be kept. In ground-resistance testing, equipment should be considered as a unit. All conductive parts of equipment shall be grounded so that resistance does not exceed 25 ohms, unless 10 ohms is required for lightning protection. To ensure compliance with ohmic requirements, resistance of the belting is to be excluded in measuring the total resistance to ground for belt-drive machinery. The rate of static generation should be considered before changes in grounding systems are made.    (e) Conductive floors. Conductive floors and conductive shoes shall be used for grounding personnel at operations with exposed explosives with electrostatic sensitivity of 0.1 joule or less, such as primer, initiator, detonator, igniter, tracer, and incendiary mixtures. Materials sensitive to static sparks, easily ignited or detonated, include lead styphnate, lead azide, mercury fulminate, tetrazene, diazodinitrophenol, potassium chlorate-lead styphanate mixtures, igniter compositions, grade B magnesium powder, and exposed layers of black powder dust. Dust from solid propellants can be ignited from spark energy, making conductive floors and shoes necessary where such dust is present. Air and dust mixtures of ammonium picrate, tetryl, tetrytol, and solid propellants are also sensitive to static electricity discharge. Many flammable liquids and air mixtures tested (ethyl ether, ethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, acetone, and gasoline) can be ignited by human static discharge. Therefore, areas where personnel might come into contact with the kinds of explosives or mixtures enumerated above shall be equipped with conductive floors, except when the hazards of dust/air or flammable vapor/air mixtures are eliminated by adequate housekeeping, dust collection, ventilation, or solvent recovery methods.    (1) Conductive floors are also required when operations involve the following:    (i) Exposed electro-explosive devices such as squibs, detonators, primers, etc.    (ii) Electrically initiated items, such as rockets, with exposed circuitry.    (iii) Hazardous materials that could be ignited by human static discharge.    (2) When a hazard remains localized, conductive floors and footwear are not required throughout an entire building or room. In such cases, conductive mats or runners may be used. These mats and runners shall meet all the specifications and test requirements that apply to conductive floors.    (f) Conductive floor specifications. Conductive floors, made of nonsparking materials such as lead, conductive rubber, or conductive flooring compositions, shall meet the following requirements:    (1) The flooring and its grounding system shall provide for electrical resistance not to exceed 1 million ohms.    (2) The surface of the installed floor shall be free from cracks and reasonably smooth, and the material shall not slough off, wrinkle, or buckle under operating conditions. Conductive tiles are not recommended for areas where explosives dust can cause contamination, because the large number of joints, and the tendency of tiles to loosen, create areas where explosives dust can lodge, not amenable to normal cleanup procedures. Where conductive floors and shoes are required, the resistance of conductive shoes on a person plus the resistance of floor to ground shall not exceed 1 million ohms total. Tabletops used with exposed explosives or dusts should be covered with a properly grounded conductive material meeting the same requirements as those for the flooring. The conductive floors shall be compatible with the particular materials to be processed.    (g) Initial tests of conductive floors shall be followed by others at least semiannually. The test results shall be permanently recorded. Testing shall proceed only when the room is free from exposed explosives and flammable gas mixtures.    (1) The resistance of the floor shall be more than 5,000 ohms in areas with 110 volts service and 10,000 ohms in areas with 220 volts service, and less than 1 million ohms in all areas as measured between a permanent ground connection and an electrode placed at any point on the floor and also as measured between two electrodes placed 3 feet apart at any points on the floor. Measurements shall be made at five or more locations in each room and at least two of the points shall be heavily trafficked areas. If the resistance during a measurement changes appreciably with time, the value observed after the voltage has been applied for about 5 seconds shall be considered to be the measured value. These resistance values do not apply to metallic floors.    (2) The operation and maintenance of test instruments shall be entrusted to competent personnel.    (h) Humidification.

But the belated correction of the mistake was unable to  improve the situation in power engineering. Moreover, in  February practically all of Ukraine's AES's [nuclear electric  power plant] experienced a shortage of nuclear fuel. The  Zaporozhye AES had to ""unload,"" that is to say lower, the output  of two units so that they could work through this year. The same  thing is happening at the Chernobyl and South Ukraine  plants.    Russia must be paid almost 50 billion rubles for  nuclear fuel elements. And no one knows how much the scarce  equipment for the units that have been brought back up at the  Rivno and Khmelnitskiy AES's costs now. Generally the problems  here are purely economic ones, but some deputies have not ceased  their attempts to blame Yeltsin and his government for our  troubles. Such a stand can only aggravate the crisis. For our  main enemy is ourselves. The populism, unprofessionalism, and  indifference of the parliamentarians and government bureaucrats  costs taxpayers too much.    It is not impossible that on the threshold of the  elections, some candidates for deputy will again try to play the  nuclear card. Voters should know what all this hysteria and  incompetence can cost all of us if this history repeats  itself.    The Reverse Side of the Moratorium    The antinuclear euphoria on the shores of the Dnepr reached  a  peak in the summer of 1990. The republic was declared a hostage  of the atomic department of the former Union. The Communist  Party of Ukraine and communist deputies in parliament supported  the idea of a moratorium.    Hotheads who were superficially familiar with the problem  and  did not inconvenience themselves with proof assured the people  very emotionally that Ukraine would get along without AES's,  that if all the plants were closed no one would notice.    And the fact that 14 energy units with a total capacity of  12.8 million kilowatts are in operation at the 5 Ukrainian AES's  and that in 1990 they provided about one-third of all the  electricity produced in the republic was not taken into account.  Today atomic power plants bear 40 percent of the load.    Certain scientists and the minister of energy at that time,  Vitaliy Sklyarov, threw oil on the fire by trying to convince  everyone that Ukraine should build gas turbine-powered heat  plants rather than nuclear energy units. But what do you burn at  such plants? Ukraine satisfies 24 percent of its gas needs and 8  percent of its oil needs through its own production. And there  are depressing forecasts that this situation will get worse. But  we can be supplied with uranium for centuries.    These and other facts were published in the press at the  time  and rang out from the rostrum of the Supreme Soviet, but the  opinion of the specialists was not heeded. World experience was  also ignored. After all, France, with which people love to  compare Ukraine, produces 75 percent of its electricity at AES's  and, strange as it may seem, the French do not consider  themselves hostages of the nuclear monster.    Ukraine passed its peak of electricity production in 1988  (297.2 billion kilowatt hours). Since that time we have only  been lowering its production. There are two reasons for that:  first, half of the equipment of the heat plants have depleted  their service lives and need to be replaced. Secondly, the  extraction of energy media dropped both in Russia and in  Ukraine, but the prices for them increased. So last year the  republic was short 50 billion kilowatt hours as compared with  1988. But while the TES's [thermal electric power plants] reduce  production, AES's increase it every year. If not for the nuclear  units, back in the winter of 1991 Ukraine would have had to  introduce a scheduled energy delivery.    The symptoms of the disaster which has now begun were more  than obvious back at the time the decision on the moratorium was  adopted. It was also obvious that Ukraine could not do without  atomic energy--only uranium could really alleviate the shortage  of organic fuel. But even so the construction of AES's was  terminated.    You Have To Pay for Everything    I am certain that the decision on the moratorium was adopted  without a serious economic expert study. If the deputies had  known the facts and figures cited below, everything would not  have happened so readily and smoothly.    So, in 1990 three million-watt units with VVER-1000  [water-moderated water-cooled] reactors which were not inferior  to similar Western ones in terms of safety were under  construction at the Zaporozhye, Rivno, and Khmelnitskiy AES's.  The cost of each one was a billion dollars. With international  prices for electricity at 6-7 cents per kilowatt hour, one year  of moratorium costs the country 500 million dollars. It is easy  to figure the direct losses, but the republic's actual losses  are much greater.    By putting up a barrier in the path of AES's, the Supreme  Soviet automatically terminated the development of high  technologies in Ukraine. For an atomic energy unit is the result  of the activity of dozens of scientific and production  collectives. The latest achievements of science and technology  are applied in designing and building it. In one moment they  became useless.    The construction workers were the first to begin to  disperse.  Then it was the turn of the operating personnel of the AES's  themselves. Highly qualified specialists, most of them young,  immediately understood that the moratorium would put an end to  their careers in Ukraine. No new units, no growth. And the  wages? In Russia a control operator earns 300 dollars a month  converted into hard currency, but at the Zaporozhye AES it is  one-tenth that.    A moratorium was imposed in our country, but Russia began to  launch its own nuclear energy program. Recruiters began to work  at Energodar and other AES's of Ukraine. They not only offered  the needed people a decent wage but even apartments. The  professionals whose training takes from 3 to 5 years began to  pack their suitcases. And not just one or two but by brigades  and shifts. Last year alone 325 people left the Zaporozhye GRES  [state regional electric power plant], and about 400 left the  atomic power plant!    Recently the director of the Zaporozhye AES, Vladimir  Bronnikov, announced that if the exodus of specialists is not  stopped, there will be simply no one to run Unit No 6. And will  other units become safer if novices sit at the control panel?    The overall collapse of industry has also had an effect on  the safety of atomic power plants. The moratorium forced plants  producing equipment for AES's to seek other orders, do simpler  things. The quality control system was destroyed and specialists  left. As a result many enterprises can no longer supply  equipment which meets the demands of atomic power engineering.  Ukraine is declining as a high technology country.    So the goals declared by the advocates of the moratorium  were  not achieved. Just the opposite. AES safety declined and  electricity production dropped. In the frozen units not only was  an enormous amount of capital and past labor paralyzed, but  every day they required considerable expenditures to maintain  and guard them. Ukraine's sick economy had a shortfall of  billions of dollars. All these streamlets of wastefulness and  irresponsibility made up the river of present-day inflation and  economic collapse.    Courage Is the Lot of the Wise    The fact that the moratorium accomplished nothing but harm  was already clear in the fall of 1991. Even Zaporozhye Oblast,  which has three very large power plants, Dneproges [Dnepr  Hydroelectric Power Plant], a GRES, and an AES, with a total  capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts, had an energy  shortage at that time. Two of 18 ovens were in operation at  Dneprospetsstal [Dnepr Special Steel] and the aluminum combine  ceased production of silicon and thereby shut down dozens of  enterprises of Ukraine's electrical and radio engineering  industry. Let me remind you that this was 1991.    In 1992 the situation got even more complicated. The  appeals,  verbal and written, of the directors of the industrial  enterprises and power stations to the state's leaders did not  yield results. The parliament, with stubbornness that should  have been put to better use, stood its own. True, some of the  deputies understood the mistake, but most did not have enough  courage to acknowledge it from the rostrum.    But in the lobbies people suggested to the directors of  AES's  that they appeal to the government. Let it by its decree (since  it had the authority) rescind our decision. This shameful  haggling continued for a year! And only when the economy, and  she is a stern mistress in all respects, finally turned her back  on us did the people's chosen ones deign to do anything.    What Is Ahead!    The moratorium was rescinded, but the problems it created  were not. The collective of the Zaporozhye AES is preparing to  launch Unit No 6. In fact this will be done in the coming  months. As for the reactors at the Rivno and Khmelnitskiy power  plants, there are more questions than answers.    In actuality, by 1990 the basic construction work in  Energodar was complete. The Zaporozhye workers provided No 6  with all the equipment, and despite the moratorium completed  installation at their own risk and prevented the unit from  collapsing for 3 years. People simply did not want to sink a  billion dollars into the sand, and, it is true, no one even said  thanks for this.    Construction was not completed on the units at the Rivno and  Khmelnitskiy AES's and all the equipment was not supplied. Now  it will have to be collected in all the countries of the near  abroad or production will have to be set up in Ukraine. It is  frightening to even speak of how much this is going to cost.  Specialists estimate that with strong state support, the units  could provide current in 1995-1996. But there can be no talk of  any support while the Ministry of Power Engineering owes the  Zaporozhye AES alone more than 30 billion karbovantsy for energy  already produced. Where can money be gotten when Ukraine owes  everyone? So the future of these units is very hazy and  uncertain.    The future of Ukraine's power engineering system is just as  hazy. The point is that even now the independent state does not  have a scientifically substantiated program of actions  reinforced with real resources for the sector as a whole or for  atomic energy in particular.    And meanwhile Ukraine's power engineering system continues  to  fall into the abyss. Because of the shortage of fuel, the output  of the Zaporozhye GRES, the largest in Europe, has dropped to  two-thirds its former level. The situation in the other heat  plants is no better either. In turn, because of the shortage of  electricity, many industrial enterprises have sharply reduced  production, or even stopped it, and in some cities of the  republic electricity is supplied to the population by schedule.    Is this really the kind of life we want?     "
0,FT942-3343 ,"FT942-3343 _AN-EFODGADLFT 940615   FT  15 JUN 94 / Don't shoot, I'm only the regulator: The review of the UK's electricity pricing regime must tread a fine line      By MICHAEL SMITH   Good judgment undoubtedly played a part. But shareholders in regional electricity companies in England and Wales would find it hard to deny that they have been lucky since they bought into the sector four years ago. London Electricity, which serves the capital, should kick off the results season today with another set of impressive figures. Its profits performance has contributed to the shares more than doubling in value since flotation in 1990. In spite of recent falls, they have outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share index by 68 per cent during the period. Back in 1990, the power industry was viewed by the City as a safe but dull investment. London is not exceptional among power companies, most of which have performed similarly. East Midlands has outperformed the market by more than its London counterpart, even though its profits for 1993-94 will be depressed by Pounds 130m because of poor acquisitions. However, the good times may be coming to an end. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, will shortly announce the results of a review of the pricing regime which helped the regional companies to make their unexpectedly high profits, and which is now considered to have been too lenient. He is threatening to be tough; 'draconian', according to industry insiders. Prof Littlechild is reviewing the distribution prices of the 12 regional companies and the two Scottish power companies, privatised in 1991. Distribution accounts for more than 80 per cent of the companies' profits in England and Wales, and 40 and 20 per cent respectively at Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric. While the review is important both for the companies and the customers, for whom distribution costs constitute a quarter of their electricity bills, it also has wider implications. Increasingly, countries from the Pacific Rim to South America are privatising their utilities. Since the UK has been in the forefront of transferring electricity, telecommunications and water to the private sector, its regulation model is studied both for its qualities and its shortcomings. The perceived shortcomings have come to notice recently as critics, including Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the main electricity generating company, and opposition Labour MPs have pointed to the idiosyncratic styles of different UK regulators and called for a more co-ordinated and consistent regime. Prof Littlechild, together with Mr Ian Byatt, the water regulator, who is conducting a parallel exercise, will thus be subjected to searching scrutiny in their application of the regulatory regimes. Prof Littlechild must tread a fine line: if he is too tough in setting price targets, he risks the regional electricity companies successfully challenging his decision through the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. At the other extreme, less stringent prices could lay him open to charges that he is favouring already rich companies at the expense of consumers. In retrospect the controls which have allowed English and Welsh companies since 1990 to increase distribution prices by an average of 1.1 cent above inflation every year seem woefully inadequate for an industry which has made significant cost reductions; even the companies admit privately that they have had a relatively easy ride. They deny, however, that they misled the government about what could be achieved after privatisation. 'No one expected to be able to implement the kinds of jobs reductions or efficiency improvements which have been effected,' says one executive. The companies have typically lost more than 20 per cent of staff; Eastern, the largest regional power company in England and Wales, has cut jobs from 8,770 in March 1990 to 6,500. Other efficiency measures have included cutting layers of management, more flexible working, improving purchasing, and setting up business centres where profits, rather than cost, are the focus. In addition, capital expenditure has been lighter than expected because of the recession. The result of these changes and the relaxed price control regime is that the companies and their shareholders enjoy an embarrassment of riches. For instance, London Electricity's forecast pretax profits for 1993-94, at between Pounds 180m and Pounds 190m, compared with just Pounds 126m in the year before privatisation. This has enabled the company to double dividends to shareholders from 10.45p per share in 1990-91 to an expected 22.4p for 1993-94. Similar progress has been made by each of the other 11 regional companies and, to a lesser extent, the Scottish groups with their tighter price controls. But the underlying performances of the regional companies may be even better than the companies are stating publicly. Most of the regional companies have set aside substantial sums to meet future potential costs such as redundancy pay and pension provisions. To charges from consumer groups of profiteering, the companies point out that customers have also benefited from privatisation. Services have improved and prices have fallen in real terms for all but the largest customers. This year domestic tariffs have fallen by 6 per cent in some areas at a time when most European countries are experiencing price rises. Consumer groups say the effect of privatisation is less clear-cut since prices rose prior to 1990 as the government sought to enhance profit levels and thus make the industry more attractive for investors. Prof Littlechild's task is to assess how far the division of post-privatisation spoils needs to be reallocated. The regional companies do not like the way he is tackling it. Their overriding objection centres on his definition of capital invested in the businesses. This is crucial because the price controls which will be set for the next five years will take into account what he considers to be an adequate rate of return on capital. In a letter to the companies he has indicated that he favours a rate of 6 per cent. He has suggested that the definition of capital employed in the business should be the market capitalisation of the companies about a year after privatisation. The companies argue that the true figure for capital employed should be what it would cost them to replace their assets. The distinction between market value and replacement cost is important to the companies: the post-privatisation market capitalisation of the sector was Pounds 8bn, whereas replacing assets could currently cost Pounds 12bn in total. It is in the interests of the companies to win as generous a definition as possible on capital employed. The regulator is suggesting they might earn 6 per cent on a figure less than half that which they estimate is adequate. Observers suggest that if Prof Littlechild is unwilling to compromise on this tricky issue, the regional power companies in England and Wales would be forced to reduce distribution prices next April by up to 20 per cent. He has indicated that in future years they would be able to raise prices by inflation minus 4 per cent. In times of low inflation that would mean price cuts. While this would disappoint some consumer groups, the regional companies say they could not tolerate it. 'Right now we think the MMC would give us a better deal,' one chief executive said yesterday. 'If Prof Littlechild sticks to his line, the returns for us would be woefully inadequate.' Some of the companies are already devising strategy for appealing to the monopolies commission. Prof Littlechild's review is sure to arouse controversy. But it is likely that a compromise on price controls will be reached to placate most, and probably all, the 14 companies. Whether this will satisfy consumer groups, which feel the utilities have profited at the expense of customers, is doubtful. Power companies may continue to reap rewards which many consumer advocates find unacceptable.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4911 Electric Services.

0,FT942-17119 ,"FT942-17119 _AN-EDGDVAHVFT 940406   FT  06 APR 94 / Pakistan prepares for power crisis: Worst-case scenario predicts six-hour electricity cuts each day      By FARHAN BOKHARI   Pakistan is preparing for one of its worst power crises this summer as water levels at Tarbela and Mangla, two of the world's largest earth dams, and a large source of power generation for the country, remain critically low after a long dry spell. The worst-case scenario predicts at least six hours of power cuts a day, senior officials say. That forecast has added a sense of urgency to efforts for attracting new investments in the power sector. The government estimates the country will be short of almost 7,000MW of electricity within the next five years, almost 60 per cent of the present total generation capacity of almost 10,600MW. Efforts to cut waste could save up to 2,000MW. 'The most critical shortage of all in the economic sector is that of power which is holding up our production, investment and causing a lot of inconvenience to people,' says Mr VA Jafarey, adviser to the prime minister on finance. A recent report prepared by a government task force on energy forecasts that investment of up to Rs329bn (Dollars 10.8bn) would be needed to fill the gap. Only some Rs54bn in new private investments is currently projected, it notes. For the public sector to plug the gap 'is totally unrealistic' in view of budgetary constraints, the task force adds. Among incentives to attract investors, the task force has recommended increases in tariffs, and cutting down red tape. Increased domestic use has been partly fuelled by growing imports of air-conditioners and other electrical appliances. Domestic users account for 40 per cent of total generated power, compared with only 10 per cent in 1970. The proportion is estimated to rise to 52 per cent by the end of the decade. 'Every dollar you invest in power is now giving you a lesser return,' says one official, adding: 'This is an unsustainable situation'. The government is also preparing a bill to be sent to parliament this month to punish the theft of electricity with up to five years' imprisonment. Up to 23 per cent of the power generated by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the largest power generation and transmission company, is lost in transmission, breakdowns, leakages and corruption, some officials estimate. The government has also committed itself to privatising thermal power generation units of Wapda, which could together be worth Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn. Mr Shahid Hasan Khan, an economic adviser to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, chaired the energy task force and supports a wider role for the private sector. He acknowledges the success of the initiative will depend on the extent to which foreign private investors can be attracted. Mr Michael Woodruff, chief executive of the Karachi-based 1,292MW Hub power project, expected to be fully commissioned by summer 1997, says that 'almost as important as money is time'. 'If you can put together a project in a shorter time somewhere else offering a similar rate of return, you'll go to that place.' The Hub project, biggest of its kind in Pakistan to be backed by the private sector, took almost six years to move from planning and arrangement of a financial package to the actual ground-breaking last year. Project sponsors had to deal with at least seven agencies. Mr Woodruff commends the government's decision to set up a 'one-window' operation at the Ministry of Water and Power to deal with all the needs of project sponsors. 'You have to convince those coming from outside, in particular, that the bureaucracy isn't going to be a problem,' he says. Other businessmen also want to see if the government is able to resolve political controversies, the most important being that surrounding the Kalabagh Dam project in Punjab province. Objections from Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) that the dam would cause flooding in a part of its territory have held up the project for well over five years. Ms Bhutto's government has recently backed the sacking of the NWFP government led by Mr Sabir Shah, an opposition leader, after a breakdown in the provincial administration due to the defection of at least six provincial MPs. If a new provincial government can be formed which supports Ms Bhutto's government, an agreement with Islamabad on the Kalabagh issue may be in sight. For a country where the lack of generation capacity may in future threaten economic growth, any rainfall in coming weeks helping to raise the water levels in dams would bring only temporary relief.

Shulepina: ""Energy  Systems and Gas Pipelines Are Indivisible""]    [Text] Beating politicians, energy officials were  first to reach agreement on creating an integrated energy space,  which they did two years ago. They serve the Greater Central  Asian Energy Ring. A joint dispatching administration in  Tashkent handles operations--determining station loads,  operating modes, and maintenance schedules. It is subordinate to  a council of energy industry officials of the region's  republics, who meet to agree on who will produce how much and  who will buy it. An agreement has also been reached on  cooperation between gas industry officials.    How are the republics building their relations in the  highly complex fuel and energy complex today? A PRAVDA VOSTOKA  correspondent put this question to Erken Anafin, Kazakhstan's  deputy minister of energy and fuel resources.    We get 600 million kilowatt-hours of Uzbek electricity  annually. More than 3 billion more kilowatt-hours of Turkmenian  and Kyrgyz electricity are supplied to Kazakhstan via  Uzbekistan. For example, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have energy  surpluses, while Kazakhstan has a shortage in winter. And so our  colleagues help us out. We had a difficult situation on our  hands in the spring of this year as well. The Dzhambyl  hydroelectric station was operating a single power unit, while  five others were idled on account of fuel problems. We bought  Uzbek gas on credit, as there was no fuel oil since we had not  received petroleum from Russia.    The Kzyl-Orda Heat and Power Station is powered by Angrei  coal. And another payment problem arose. Energy was cheap in  Kazakhstan until recently, and so the industry operated at a  loss. The tenge dropped in value, and our partners lacked hard  currency too. And so we agreed to keep our mutual accounts in  dollars. But when it came time to settle, we had nothing with  which to pay.    We owe Uzbekistan $98 million for electricity and gas. The  Uzbek side's debt to us is only one-tenth of that. It was a  tough situation. We started looking for solutions. And we took  drastic measures. They were economically warranted and fully in  keeping with the spirit of a market economy. We raised  electricity prices twice in spring, so that the prices were  comparable to production costs.    The gas situation was also resolved in a market spirit. We  cut off the gas to those who had not paid. We cut consumption to  40 percent. Is that a little or a lot? We received 6.2 billion  cubic meters of gas from Uzbekistan via the Gazli-Chimkent gas  pipeline last year. This year we have ordered 4.2 billion, and  we are not even using all of that. We took 1.3 billion in the  first four months, but paid for 400 million. The Uzbek side took  an understanding view of our situation, and said: Take what you  need within the agreed-upon amounts. But we squeezed our  enterprises.    We are in a difficult transitional period. There is no  longer  any rigid state regulation in Kazakhstan. As an experiment we  are introducing the use of bills of exchange to settle accounts.  For example, if you cannot pay in cash, we will take payment in  copper or lead. The legislative basis for this is being created.  The Kazakh president issued an edict in April on securities. The  matter is now being worked out in the Economics and Finance  Ministries.    In the meantime we are trying to utilize clearing  settlements. This is not all that easy. We are unable to fulfill  many of our obligations for reasons beyond our control. What is  the situation, for example, with shipping petroleum products to  Uzbekistan from the Chimkent Refinery? We try to keep on  schedule, but Chimkent began operating at normal levels only in  May. Before that there had been unbalanced relations with  Russia, from which it gets the oil. We finally reached an  agreement with Russia. We are shipping it oil from Mangizstau,  and receiving Tyumen oil in Chimkent via the oil pipeline from  Omsk and Pavlodar. And we are selling part of the oil to Fergana.    The Fergana Refinery supplies us with transformer and  turbine  lubricants for our power stations. Again you have an  interdependence. It is very important to maintain good relations  with our partners. We are dependent in very many areas both on  each other and within the country. Let me return to  clearing-based deliveries and settlements for them. We agreed in  an intergovernmental accord that Kazakhstan will pay for energy  resources with tinplate and iron ore pellets. The products come  from the Karaganda Metallurgical Plant. But Karaganda is  dependent on Dzhambyl, whose hydroelectric station was idle for  virtually the entire month of April.    Uzbek gas is extremely important to us. We lease the  Gazli-Chimkent gas pipeline, which runs through Uzbek territory.  And the Uzbek side cannot do without the Poltoratskoye  underground gas storage facility, in the vicinity of Chimkent.  Its reserves guarantee vital services in Tashkent. And here the  Uzbek side leases from us.    We also have problems with operations. This used to be  handled in Central Asia and Kazakhstan by Sredazgazprom [Central  Asian Gas Industry Association]. Since the Soviet Union broke  up, we have divided its facilities and equipment. We established  the Kazakhgaz [Kazakh Gas] State Holding Company. The gas  pipeline is operated by a subsidiary know as Dzhetisugaz. The  gas pipeline is 312 kilometers long. Our specialists have  experience in operating such installations, as we used to  service the Bukhara-Ural gas pipeline and its compressor  stations. But here we have dual responsibility. We have to  ensure the gas pipeline's operation on foreign territory. Our  lease agreements provide for mutual control and inspections. We  undertook to deal with any accidents that might happen. But it  is important to prevent them!    Now we are running into the problem of rising water tables  in  the pipeline's vicinity. This problem has to be solved with the  local Ministry of Water Resources, which has to raise the dams  and lower the groundwater level.    In general, the ties have remained strong at bottom level.  All of us power- and gas-industry workers have worked together  for many years. And today too we help each other whenever we  can. We began producing fittings and oil-field equipment at  converted enterprises in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Petropavlovsk, and  Almaty, and we immediately informed our Uzbek colleagues.  Partners in Pavlodar used to supply caustic soda. But last year,  on account of environmental concerns, the enterprise was closed.  And not only for us, but also for our neighbors. The situation  is the same with lubricants, which no one in the region  produces. For example, for 300-megawatt units. So we bought them  abroad for energy workers throughout the region.    Our outlook? The economy will get on its feet. And our task  is to maintain our fuel and energy potential and expand it.     "

Investments in fixed  assets were up 15 percent from 1992 to reach 1.59 billion yuan,  guaranteeing a sustained and healthy development of the regional  economy.    Judging from a comprehensive analysis of the situation last  year, remarkable achievements were made in the capital  construction of telecommunications in Tibet. In communications,  achievements were made mainly in upgrading the existing highways  and ensuring their traffic. Investments in energy were focused  on the construction of the (Yanghu) and (Chalong) power  stations. As Tibet's electricity is mostly generated by  hydroelectric power plants, the region paid particular attention  to ensure power supply during winter drought season for the next  two years. In transport, the annual plan for renovating major  highways was completed on schedule. Last year the region  invested 300 million yuan in highway capital construction.  Maintenance and construction proceeded relatively smoothly on  the Qinghai-Tibet, Sichuan-Tibet, and China-Nepal highways, the  three major national highways in which the Ministry of  Communications invested and are covered by the state's Eighth  Five-Year Plan and the 10-Year Program. The reconstruction of  the (?Xigaze-Gonggar) highway, a key regional construction  project, was started last October. After completion, the  highway will improve the traffic condition between Lhasa and  Shannan. In aviation construction, expansion of the Gonggar  Airport was completed and put into operation. The project to  upgrade the main runway of the (?Baingoin) Airport was basically  completed.    Last year, construction of the (Yanghu) and (Chalong) power  stations, two key regional projects, overfulfilled the annual  construction plan with good quality. An investment of 240  million yuan was made in the construction of the (Yanghu)  water-pumping and pumped storage station; and the station's  first generating unit is expected to generate electricity on  schedule at the end of 1995. At that time, the problem of power  supply for production and everyday life in Lhasa will be solved  once and for all. The (Chalong) power station in Nagqu was  throttled last year ahead of schedule. The whole project is  expected to be completed and put into operation in 1996. To  alleviate the current power shortage, the Lhasa thermal power  plant, in which 14 million yuan was invested to upgrade its  technology, was put into operation last December. The total  investment scale in 1994 will reach 2.05 billion yuan, and most  of the investment will be spent on projects related to  infrastructure.     "

At least such a harsh suggestion was  heard at the regular conference of the first deputy chairman of  the Government of Russia, Oleg Soskovets. The measure is highly  favored by economic managers since it sometimes enables them to  solve operational problems. At this one they were considering  various ways of stabilizing the financial situation of nuclear  power plants and enterprises of the nuclear fuel cycle.    The situation is such that nuclear power plants may be  transformed quickly and easily from energy producers to energy  consumers. Many of the plants are threatening to shut down.    Representatives of nuclear power plants state that they have  no money for fuel because the Russian Joint-Stock Company  Unified Energy System Rossiya owes them 450 billion rubles [R].  The latter, in turn, does not consider itself to blame--the  direct consumers of energy owe it even more.    The government has promised credit in the amount of R50  billion to settle the accounts of the nuclear power plants. But  that will apparently not solve the basic problem. The money will  be spent on plugging up holes, and after a month or two the  situation will return to its original impasse. Therefore, in the  opinion of the majority of those present, it is necessary to  change the system: to create a market for electric energy. It  must be sold and not ""released.""    The conference earmarked a number of immediate measures  which  could possibly help to emerge from the crisis. Among them are  deferring payments on taxes to the republic budget and granting  nuclear power plants the right to conclude direct agreements for  the delivery of electric energy to regional consumers.    There was an amusing side to this. A representative of one  of  the nuclear power plants who was among those picketing the White  House was interested to hear a proposal from the Ministry of  Nuclear Energy to find additional funds by reducing the wages of  the workers at the plants. He said something to the effect that  for the sake of the country's safety he could take such a  measure if he received his ""gigantic"" wage of 200,000 every  month. But for now he cannot, since the last time he was paid  was in February.     "
0,FT931-11995 ,"FT931-11995 _AN-DA4ASADVFT 930130   FT  30 JAN 93 / Leading Article: The committee and the colliers   GIVEN THAT it only had 90 days to complete its work, the select committee's report on the coal industry is a thorough enough analysis of a tortuous subject. Possibly more important, it strives to be free of political bias, which means that Mr Michael Heseltine will be obliged to take it seriously as he formulates his own proposals for next month's White Paper. That is a pity, because the package of subsidies and other regulatory measures which the MPs propose is greatly in excess of what is required to bring sense to the UK energy scene. If fully implemented they would add to the thick layers of aid and protection which have been granted over the years. Who can believe yet another promise that one last heave will get a state-owned British Coal up on its commercial feet? A simple example illustrates this: the report not only recommends a five-year subsidy programme costing up to Pounds 500m to enable British-mined coal to compete with imports. It also suggests that electricity distribution companies be obliged to buy power generated from domestic coal on pain of losing their licence. If the proposed level of subsidy is sufficient to make British coal competitive, why this second measure? Answer: because no-one really believes the figures. Other adjustments The report's 39 recommendations reveal unwillingness to face the facts that stared the government in the face when it proposed to cut coal last autumn. Tinkering with one part of the energy market merely creates a need for compensating adjustments all down the line. There is also a worrisome proposal that the electricity industry regulator should have the power 'to consider the legitimate long-term interests of indigenous fuel producers' - another open invitation to allow producers to inflict higher than necessary costs upon UK industry and consumers. All this suggests that while the overt subsidy may amount to Pounds 500m (a relatively small figure compared with many that have been mentioned), the hidden costs in perpetuating the present arrangements will be much higher. It is disingenuous of the committee to claim that the cost can be borne by redirecting the proceeds of the levy which subsidises the nuclear industry. This device would only throw nuclear's costs on to the Treasury and thus the taxpayer. Since, however, the political realities make subsidy inevitable there is some comfort to be drawn from the committee's desire at least to limit financial support for British Coal in size as well as time. The continuation of subsidies would be linked to progress in cost-cutting - though the report does not spell out how this would work, nor what would happen if British Coal fell behind its targets. Sense of realism The committee has also wisely resisted the temptation to cut back the natural gas industry, having failed to discover decisive evidence in the arguments of the coal lobby that gas is much costlier than coal. In addition, it has left the capacity of the nuclear power industry untouched, believing that the nuclear review which the government has already promised should be allowed to run its course, albeit next year rather than in 1994. There is also realism in the committee's refusal to recommend barriers against imports, though it does nurse hopes that government can do something to reverse the flow of electricity from France through the Channel link. This sits ill with the leading role that Britain is playing in trying to open up and liberalise the EC's single market in energy. The political importance of the report is that it tells Mr Heseltine the number of jobs and pits the House of Commons expects him to save. He should counter this offer with a proposal for wholly transparent subsidies, a tighter timetable, and as few as possible ancillary controls. He should also pick up the committee's anxieties about the duopolistic tendencies of PowerGen and National Power, which resulted from a flawed privatisation and which will in the end need to be countered either by firmer regulation or break-up. But above all, Mr Heseltine should announce that British Coal will join the private sector and be subsidy-free by the next election in 1996-97.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT923-9498 ,"FT923-9498 _AN-CHGBIABRFT 920805   FT  05 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Fuel cells' chance to take charge      By HILARY DE BOERR   The battle by the London Regeneration Consortium to gain planning permission for its redevelopment project at London's King's Cross could hold an unexpected silver lining for the environment. The long delay means alternative energy technologies will be available for incorporation when the project gets under way. LRC is looking at fuel cell technology to provide at least some of its projected power needs of about 80MW. Fuel cells would be suited to running its articulated bus network, and possibly even provide some of the buildings' electricity, said Hugh Delap, LRC infrastructure manager. 'It can be cheaper, more efficient and its pollution levels are a fraction of that arising from current means of producing electricity.' Fuel cells produce electricity from the electrochemical reaction produced when hydrogen and oxygen combine to make water. Oxygen comes from the air and hydrogen from such fuels as natural gas, methanol and coal gas. New research shows fuel cells can be used in about 90 per cent of cases where conventional energy sources are employed, according to consultants Arthur D Little. Their use would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 60 per cent, and noxious emissions by between 50 and 90 per cent. The environmental benefits of the alternative energy source are therefore many, say proponents. Emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides cause acid rain; those of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide cause pollution and related health problems; carbon dioxide emissions contribute to global warming. All would be reduced significantly. The efficient nature of fuel cells would also mean lower demand for non-renewable fuels like coal and oil, with the additional environmental benefit of reduced risk of oil spills. In the longer term, hydrogen for use in fuel cells could itself be derived from renewable energy sources, like landfill gases. Finally, fuel cells can be sited within cities and near load centres, reducing the need for electricity transmission and distribution equipment, which are criticised for health concerns related to electromagnetic radiation and for marring the countryside. The big drawback with fuel cells - as with many other alternative sources of energy - is the high start-up costs. Generation currently costs about Dollars 2,500 (Pounds 1,300) per kilowatt for a 200kW plant, making it too expensive for most applications. The largest plant currently operating is 11MW, supplying electricity for up to 5,000 homes in Tokyo. But production levels would have to approach 200-300MW a year - when the cost would fall to about Dollars 1,500/kW - before they are economically viable, says Arthur D Little. The World Fuel Cell Council, which is busily promoting the technology, is therefore campaigning for government subsidies such as tax credits to help kick-start the technology. Japan, which imports almost all of its energy resources, has taken the lead with a national goal to install 2,250MW by 2000 and 8,300MW by 2010. In Britain, the Department of Trade and Industry has set up a programme aimed at accelerating the development of fuel cell systems for early applications in the UK. California, meanwhile, has introduced a requirement that 2 per cent of each motor manufacturer's sales should be zero emission vehicles by 1998, rising to 10 per cent by 2003. Several companies in the US are developing fuel cell powered vehicles, with Ballard Power Systems, for example, due to demonstrate its hydrogen-operated bus later this year.

The measures provide that all documents on land and  construction projects approved ultra vires or through the abuse  of power are invalid, that all approved documents and blueprints  for such projects which have yet to begin must be withdrawn for  cancellation, that all such projects under development must be  immediately stopped and given the maximum fine by the relevant  departments in accordance with laws and regulations, and that  all units which have undertaken to design or develop such  illegal projects will be ordered to stop designing and  development and will have their professional grade lowered or  their professional licenses canceled.    If a unit stubbornly develops an illegal project to make it  an accomplished fact, the authorities in charge of the land will  not recognize its property rights and must not allow it to be  bought or sold, inherited, given as a present, rented out,  transferred, or mortgaged; the notary office will not notarize  it; the water supply company will not supply water to it; the  electricity supply company will not supply electricity to it;  the police station will not allow it to be occupied; post and  telecommunications departments will not offer postal services or  telecommunications service to it; the industrial and commercial  department will not issue a business license to it; and the fire  service, environmental protection, and public health and  quarantine departments will not grant it professional  recognition.    Relevant persons said: According to earlier surveys, it was  discovered that in the districts of Baiyun, Huangpu, and Fangcun  in the suburbs of Guangzhou, foreign businessmen have been  deceived. They had invested hastily in projects and built  standard plants or apartments without obtaining valid documents.  Their projects were eventually found to be illegal through  inspection, and they were fined and ordered to cancel  development and planning for their projects.    Moreover, relevant persons reminded people that they should  be cautious about exaggerated advertisements in newspapers and  on the radio and said that if the property had no legal  documentation or documents were lacking, consumers would always  fall victim.

Zhu Senlin, the provincial governor, said yesterday that  construction will soon begin on a nuclear power plant in  Yangjiang and on the second phase of the newly-build Daya Bay  reactor.    He made the remarks at the ongoing Provincial People's  Congress.    The second phase of the Daya Bay plant is set to begin late  this year. It includes installation of two units each with a  capacity of 900,000 kilowatts.    Situated five kilometers away from the main plant, the  generators are expected to be in operation within five years.    The plant in the coastal city of Yangjiang is expected to  cost over 6 billion yuan ($689.6 million) and have four units  with a combined capacity of 4 million kilowatts. Construction on  the project is expected to begin in the next two years and it is  expected to begin operation before 2000.    When the three plants come on line, Guangdong will have a  nuclear power installation capacity of 10 million kilowatts.    The Guangdong provincial government has begun to raise funds  for the two nuclear projects, which will cost several billions  of dollars.    Advanced equipment and technology imported from abroad will  be used, Zhu said.    ""We also intend to build a fourth and the fifth nuclear  power  plant to sustain the province's economic boom, but we have to  wait for the approval of the central government,"" the governor  added.    The electricity supply in Guangzhou is 30 percent short of  demand.    Guangdong's first nuclear power plant, the Daya Bay plant in  Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, opened on February 6, when its  first nuclear power generator started operation.    The $4 billion plant has two nuclear power generating units  with a capacity of 900,000 kilowatts each. Its second set of  units will come on stream in the next four months.    Developed by Guangdong and Hong Kong, the plant will  generate  10 billion kilowatt hours every year. However, only 30 percent  of the electricity will be supplied to the provincial power  grid. The rest will be sold to Hong Kong to repay overseas loans  totalling $3.6 billion.    The Daya plant was designed by the French and uses reactors  and other equipment imported from France and Britain.    China's first nuclear station, Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant  in  East China's Zhejiang Province, began operation in 1991.    The station, with a capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, was  designed by China.     "

Michael  Graetzel of the Physical Chemistry Institute of the Federal  Technical College in Lausanne has succeeded in developing  dye-coated titanium dioxide elements which are far simpler to  make than conventional silicon solar cells.    Graetzel told an international convention on solar and  hydrogen technology in Freising a few weeks ago that the new  solar cells are already being used in electronic bathroom  scales. They are also used in solar-powered wrist watches, the  material replacing the watch-glass. Although the output is only  a few microwatts, it is quite sufficient for the watch mechanism.    The starting point for Graetzel's idea was photosynthesis,  the photochemical principle used by plants to obtain energy from  sunlight. Graetzel's ``photoelectrochemical'' cell uses a dye  to capture light quanta like chlorophyll does in plants.  Graetzel found titanium dioxide to be a semiconductor material  which transmits the photon charge as electricity in the form of  electrons; tests have shown it to be extremely stable.    The essential trick is to roughen the titanium dioxide  coating to increase its surface area and thus the number of  photons captured. In direct light the new solar cell currently  achieves a 10 percent voltage efficiency. Graetzel believes the  efficiency can be doubled in the next few years. By comparison,  cells made from amorphous silicon, currently the cheapest  material, reach an energy efficiency of only around 5 percent.    In diffuse light, where silicon cells provide hardly any  power worth mentioning, the efficiency of the titanium dioxide  element is now already around 18 percent. This is chiefly  because the titanium dioxide's rough nanocrystalline surface is  suited to the spectrum of diffuse (longer wavelength) light.  This makes the new technology of interest for applications in  our latitudes since the solar cell can provide electricity even  with a cloudy sky.    Graetzel describes manufacture as relatively simple,  requiring neither high temperatures, vacuum, nor nitrogen  pressure chambers. Titanium dioxide can be applied to glass by  screen printing. Titanium is also a common natural element, and  titanium dioxide is nontoxic, unlike the semiconductors cadmium  tellurite and copper indium diselenite, which are also used for  solar cells.    Graetzel said that a Gelsenkirchen plate glass firm intends  to make 100 watt solar modules. A pilot plant for mass  production will be ready there in three years' time. The  material is expected to cut the current high costs for solar  modules to one tenth.     "
0,FT933-11982 ,"FT933-11982 _AN-DG0CFAC4FT 930727   FT  27 JUL 93 / Fuel to power the future: South-east Asian countries are increasingly turning to nuclear energy      By VICTOR MALLET and WILLIAM KEELING      JAKARTA   Power cuts are the bane of industrialists in south-east Asia from Manila to Johor, but visiting executives from companies such as France's Framatome, Germany's Siemens and Atomic Energy of Canada can be forgiven for smiling when the lights go out. South-east Asia's fast-growing economies are increasingly looking to nuclear power to meet growing demand for electricity, a trend that offers attractive opportunities to suppliers of western nuclear technology and equipment while arousing concern among environmentalists. Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines have all announced recently that they are contemplating the development of nuclear power stations, and the idea has also been discussed in Malaysia. Their more advanced east Asian neighbours - Japan, Taiwan and South Korea - already have nuclear power programmes, as does China. 'The Asia-Pacific region has by far the greatest market potential in the next decade,' said Mr Woodrow Williams, manager of advanced reactor commercial programmes for GE Nuclear Energy, part of the US power engineering group, speaking at an FT power conference in Singapore recently. 'We are talking in terms of Dollars 160bn over the next 15 years.' Taiwan and South Korea are already established markets for nuclear suppliers, but it may take time and effort to convince other south-east Asian countries that nuclear energy is cheap enough and safe enough to be worth pursuing. 'Can the Thai public be sure that a nuclear power plant built and operated in Thailand will be well managed and attain the safety standard as in France?' asked Mr Pisit Pakkasem, secretary-general of Thailand's National Economic and Social Development Board, a state think-tank, in a speech to Canadian businessmen. Thailand is unusual in south-east Asia in that its electricity generating authority has invested enough in conventional power plants to be able to meet the demand for electricity so far, although that demand has almost doubled in the past five years. Thai officials, however, feel they are reaching the limits of what they can do with non-nuclear power. They believe electricity demand will increase by 10-15 per cent annually in the next decade, equivalent to about 1,000MW a year. Thailand is therefore planning to build six nuclear power plants with a total capacity of some 6,000MW; final approval to go ahead will be needed by 1997 if the first two units are to be commissioned on schedule in 2006. The authorities acknowledge that public concerns about the risks of nuclear power, the problems of waste disposal and the potentially high capital costs will have to be allayed before a final decision is made. Thai officials have suggested that countries supplying radioactive material to Thailand may have to take back the spent fuel because the country lacks storage facilities. 'We can't hide it in the klong (canal),' said Mr Pisit. Some Thai and foreign conservationists doubt that a bureaucracy incapable of enforcing basic environmental and safety regulations will be able to establish a viable supervisory authority for a nuclear power industry, or make it cost-effective. 'Cost will be the big problem,' said one foreign energy expert. Thailand's vocal but ineffective environmental groups recommend gas-fired power stations or lignite plants fitted with emission treatment systems. They say Thailand could shave at least 3,000MW from future demand by promoting energy efficiency. Mr Witoon Permpongsacharoen, director of the Project for Ecological Recovery, a lobby group, says government forecasts of a 10-15 per cent rise in electricity demand over the next few years are too high. Fewer qualms about public opinion or safety issues appear to be found in Indonesia, a less open society than Thailand, which has gone further down the road to nuclear power. President Suharto backs nuclear energy and has played down the possibility of an accident: 'With careful planning we should not have to worry too much about such a risk.' A 1,200MW nuclear power complex costing an estimated Dollars 2.4bn is expected to be built at Muria in central Java by 2005. This will be followed by the gradual installation of a further 5,800MW of nuclear capacity, despite a complaint from Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, that Java's record of seismic activity meant that the country 'could be heading for another Chernobyl'. In Malaysia, the atomic energy debate is at an early stage. Last year Mr S Samy Vellu, the minister responsible for energy, announced that the country would opt for nuclear power generation and that the first power station would be on stream within a decade. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, subsequently contradicted this and put a stop to any nuclear plans for the time being, saying there was no need for nuclear energy because the country had plenty of gas, oil, coal and hydro-electricity. If anything should discourage south-east Asians from investing in nuclear power it is the experience of the Philippines. Construction by Westinghouse, the US power engineering group, of a 620MW, Dollars 2.1bn plant at Bataan began in 1976. But it was mothballed on completion 10 years later because the government alleged that Westinghouse and Burns  Roe, the engineering consultants, had bribed Ferdinand Marcos, the late dictator, to win the contract. There were also reports that the plant had been built on an earthquake-prone fault line. A Philippine inquiry last year concluded that the plant did not lie on a geological fault, and this year the Philippines lost its US court case against the American companies, which were found not to have bribed Marcos. Manila has spent millions of dollars on the case and continues to spend millions on interest payments for the plant, which lies idle while the main island of Luzon is subjected to black-outs up to 10 hours long. Officials say a further Dollars 400m will have to be spent over 30 months to upgrade the plant to 1992 safety standards, only slightly less than the cost of a new conventional power station of similar capacity. The Philippine government seems undeterred by this financial disaster. Last week President Fidel Ramos ordered his government to prepare a nuclear power plan by November. Mr Pablo Malixi, the former chief of the National Power Corporation, the state-owned utility, said he doubted if either the Indonesians or the Thais would backtrack on their commitment to nuclear energy. 'It's going to be the fuel of the future,' he said.

Falling oil prices have cast a pall on large-scale solar energy production  projects nearly everywhere but here in the Mojave Desert, where a Los Angeles  firm just doubled its power output to 196 megawatts.    The Luz International Ltd. system, which began in 1983 with a 14-megawatt solar  energy generating plant in the nearby community of Dagget, now has seven ""solar  farms"" that use 650,000 parabolic mirrors to convert sunlight into enough  electricity to power more than 100,000 homes. Two of those ""solar farms"" were  started in late December.    Luz, which has a permanent work force of 250 people ranging from computer  processors to mirror washers, operates the largest commercial solar energy  plant in the world.    ""We represent 95% of the world's production of solar power right here at Luz,""  said Walter Smith, a vice president. He said the company ""takes its name from a  place in Israel where Jacob had a dream of building a ladder linking heaven and  earth.""    The way Smith sees it, the privately held company is poised to take advantage  of an inevitable oil shortage.    ""We are assuming that oil won't be $15 a barrel for the rest of our lives,""  Smith said. ""Obviously, the higher the price of oil, the more attractive  becomes alternative sources of energy.""      Creating Superheated Steam    Luz's solar fields, which were built on 1,000 acres of desert with $750 million  raised from private and utility investors, consist of arrays of curved mirrors  that individually track the sun with microprocessors and light-sensing  instruments, Smith said. Each mirror focuses the sun's light onto a steel pipe  mounted inside a vacuum-insulated glass tube.    Inside the pipe is a synthetic oil that is heated to 735 degrees Fahrenheit.  The oil flows through a heat exchanger, generating superheated steam for a  traditional turbine generator.    All the electricity produced by the system is being purchased by Southern  California Edison Co., which distributes it to households and businesses  throughout Southern California, a spokesman for the utility said.    William von KleinSmid, supervising engineer at Edison, acknowledged that Luz's  196 megawatts of power barely add up to 1% of the utility's peak demand load of  20,000 megawatts.    Nonetheless, ""I've got to give them credit for what they've done out there,""  von KleinSmid said. ""A lot of people thought they couldn't build those plants.""    Luz's first solar energy plant in Dagget is situated a few hundred feet away  from an experimental 10-megawatt plant that Edison built in 1982, primarily  with U.S. Department of Energy funds at a cost of $141 million. That plant,  which used 21,816 mirrors to direct the sun's rays to a giant boiler atop a  300-foot-high tower, was shut down late last year after operating as a research  project for six years.    ""It wasn't economic to operate it without subsidized funding,"" von KleinSmid  said of Edison's solar plant, which local residents had dubbed ""steam on a  stick.""    The Luz technology is based on one of three dominant forms of solar energy  production in use today throughout the world, according to Scott Sklar,  president of the Solar Energy Industries Assn., a lobbying group in Washington.      Huge Plant Planned    Most common is the solar panel, which is often fixed on or near a house to heat  water. Still in the embryonic stage of commercial development are  photovoltaics, which use specially treated silicon wafers to generate  electricity on contact with sunlight. Photovoltaics are used to produce power  on some satellites, Sklar said.    Chronar Corp. of Princeton, N.J., is awaiting final approval to begin  construction of a $125-million, 50-megawatt photovoltaic plant in Lancaster. In  a telephone interview, Chronar founder Zoltan J. Kiss said the plant, which  would be seven times larger than any existing photovoltaic plant, could be  completed by the end of 1992.    Luz's success amid a current oil glut and proliferation of independent gas-fire  generators is connected to its lucrative 30-year power contracts with Edison,  and its track record, according to Mike Henderson, an engineer with the  consulting firm of R. W. Beck & Associates of Denver, Colo., which recently  completed a review of Luz's solar projects for its investors.      Tied to Oil Rates    Paul Savoldelli, a spokesman for the company, said investors are getting a 13%  to 14% return on their investment after taxes. Luz had revenue in 1988 of $155  million, Savoldelli said, compared to $108 million the year before.    ""Luz's contracts for solar plants 1 through 7 are tied to fixed-cost  projections (for oil), which they got when their power sales contracts were  signed with Edison back in 1985,"" Henderson said. At that time, projections for  oil prices were significantly higher than they are today, he said.    Company officials emphasized, however, that all its future power plants will be  built on contracts based on going market rates for oil.    ""In addition, of the half dozen solar power plants I have reviewed over the  past five years, Luz is the pre-eminent in terms of performance and installed  capacity,"" Henderson said. ""I can't think of anyone else around the world with  more than 10 or 20 megawatts.""    ""Luz built a better mousetrap,"" agreed Charles R. Imbrecht, chairman of the  California Energy Commission. ""We believe they have produced what is today  clearly the most efficient solar thermal electric generation system in the  world.""    Bill Meyer, adviser to the president of the California Public Utility  Commission, said although ""you really have to stretch to find fault with these  guys,"" the company has the ability to produce nearly 25% of its electricity  from gas-fire boilers.    ""They are allowed to do that under federal regulations, and some people  complain that is cheating,"" Meyer said. ""To me that is not cheating, since they  are still producing 75% of their power from solar sources and that's pretty  damn good.""    Beyond that, Myer said that Luz provides most of its power output during those  hours when Edison needs it most, for example, the middle of summer when air  conditioners are running throughout the day.    Still, Smith cautioned that ""we'll never replace nuclear power, gas and coal,  but we will have a market niche where we will be competitive with oil prices.""    Luz plans to triple its energy production over the next five years by building  four 80-megawatt plants and one 60-megawatt plant at the Kramer Junction site  where five of its solar fields are.    ""By 1993, we will be producing an additional 400 megawatts of power,"" Smith  said, ""which will be a third of the power produced at the San Onofre Nuclear  Power Plant.""    Separately, Luz hopes to build similar plants in Sunbelt states such as New  Mexico and Arizona, as well as in countries including India, Spain and Israel,  where the company's research laboratory was founded in 1979, Smith said.

0,FT924-1825 ,"FT924-1825 _AN-CLPCOACPFT 921216   FT  16 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Purity in a cold climate - Icelandic companies are trying to capitalise on a pollution-free environment      By ROBERT CORZINE   Bacteria which originated with the Vikings and 2,000-year-old water may seem an odd combination on which to build a modern export-oriented food industry. But skyr, a thick yoghurt-like product first made by Iceland's early Viking inhabitants and bottled water from glaciers are just two elements of an ambitious effort by Icelandic companies and government to exploit the country's status as one of world's most pollution-free environments. The strategy stems in large part from a sharp fall in recent years of the cod catch - the mainstay of Iceland's post-war economy - and the subsequent pressure on the government to develop alternative export industries. Efforts at export diversification have also emerged from private-sector companies frustrated at the small size of Iceland's domestic market. New ideas range from massive power generation schemes to natural food products and health spas. The common thread is that all capitalise on Iceland's enviable environmental credentials and all are aimed at the growing international demand for products and services that are 'pure' or non-polluting. Government efforts have concentrated on promoting Iceland's potential for generating large amounts of cheap electricity through clean and renewable means. Only 10 per cent of Iceland's economically viable hydroelectric and geothermal potential has been tapped, according to Landsvirkjun, the national power company. It estimates that the average cost of power from future hydro development for mainly industrial users would be lower in Iceland than elsewhere, including large projects such as Itaipu in Brazil and James Bay in Canada. The government's priority is to lure energy-intensive industrial users, such as aluminium smelters and other metal industries. It emphasises, however, that any developments would have to adhere to strict environmental standards, the costs of which it believes will be offset by secure access to cheap electricity. Landsvirkjun officials believe Iceland could also be a competitive European site for the production of non-polluting hydrogen fuel for vehicles, another energy-intensive process. Research has also been conducted into the direct export of electricity to mainland Europe. A detailed study of the likely performance of a proposed 500MW, 950km-long direct current submarine cable to Scotland will be completed by the end of the year. Landsvirkjun officials believe most technical obstacles can be overcome, and that power from such a cable would be competitive in the UK electricity market, even against relatively low-cost natural gas-fired plants. The possible imposition by the European Community of a carbon tax amounting to Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent would further enhance the competitiveness of the project, the officials say. They concede, however, that the unusual depth (up to 1,000 metres) and length of the Pounds 1bn submarine cable, its high initial capital cost and the long lead-time needed to build additional dams, power plants and the cable itself considerably increase the risk profile of the project. But the officials believe their greatest advantage lies in growing public opinion in western Europe favouring electricity that is generated without adding to greenhouse gases, but without having to resort to nuclear power. Iceland is also hoping to sell its extensive experience in using geothermal energy, which accounts for a third of the country's total energy consumption and provides most of its space heating and hot water needs as well as some electricity production. Marketing efforts have been directed mainly at eastern Europe, with particular emphasis on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, which Icelandic officials say has tremendous geothermal potential. Private-sector attempts to capitalise on Iceland's environmental reputation are more modest but are generally closer to fruition. The food and drink industry has been a market leader in exploiting the 'cold, clean and pure international image of Iceland,' according to Porarinn E. Sveninsson, the director of the Akva spring water company based in the northern town of Akureyri. It has recently begun selling bottled water in selected northeastern states of the US, even though the competition from domestic and European producers is fierce. Sol, a Reykjavik-based food and drink producer, also sells bottled water in the US and Europe. But in addition it has succeeded in entering the market for 'New Age' soft drinks, which eschew the use of chemical preservatives and which place a premium on pure ingredients, especially water. David Thornsteinsson, Sol's chairman, cites the success of the Icelandic-canned Seltzer brand of fruit-flavoured drinks in the UK. Sales of the drinks rose from Dollars 900,000 in 1990 to an estimated Dollars 2.9m (Pounds 1.90m) this year, confirmation, Thornsteinsson says, that consumers are willing to pay a premium for assured purity of ingredients. He rejects suggestions that competitors could emulate Seltzer's success by shipping Iceland's glacial water in bulk to bottling plants elsewhere. 'The tanks and the need to process it at the other end would alter the taste too much', he says. 'Besides, Iceland enjoys inexpensive back haul freight rates to the US and Europe, so the cost of shipping the finished product is minimal.' Icelanders believe there could also be potential to emphasise the natural qualities of more traditional food products, such as the country's distinctively-flavoured free range lamb. Those raised along the coasts have a diet consisting mainly of moss and seaweed, while those reared in mountain pastures eat mainly herbs. A study on establishing a big health centre in Reykjavik is under way, according to Markus Orn Antonsson, the city's mayor, who believes the absence of air and water pollution will appeal to European, and especially German tourists.

0,FT921-11800 ,"FT921-11800 _AN-CA3BUABFFT 920130   FT  30 JAN 92 / Technology: Light at the end of the tunnel - Newly privatised UK utilities are expecting IT to give them a competitive edge      By DAVE MADDEN   Thames Water's customer information system is one of its biggest capital investments - second only to the London Ring Main, the three-metre diameter tunnel surrounding the capital. Although the project is one of the more ambitious information technology developments undertaken by a UK utility, it is not unique. Rather it illustrates the vast scale of IT investment in the newly privatised water and electricity industries - and the pivotal role that investment is playing in creating a competing, and competitive, utilities sector. The water industry has some Pounds 25bn to spend on capital projects in the decade to 1999 - of which around 10 per cent will go on support systems. The Water Services Association, which represents the 10 big water and sewage companies in England and Wales, says that Pounds 275m of the industry's Pounds 2.29bn capital expenditure last year went on 'miscellaneous projects', of which IT constitutes the bulk. It is tempting to view this as some sort of 'privatisation dividend', a reaction to years of public sector starvation. But money is not just being spent for the sake of it. First, individual systems face rigorous cost-benefit analysis. 'There is no question in my mind - the National Power board takes a highly commercial view of return on investment,' says John Handby, IT director. Second, some of these projects are driven by pre-privatisation IT strategies: Thames Water set its agenda in 1986; Welsh Water is building on its integrated business information system, conceived in 1985. There is no doubt, however, that privatisation accelerated programmes and changed priorities. 'Privatisation was not the catalyst but it fuelled the process,' says Jeff Maynard, Welsh Water's IT manager. But what is happening now says Declan Good, managing associate of consultants CSC Index, is that these companies are shifting emphasis from mandatory projects to more glamorous competitive initiatives. This transition is nowhere more evident than at National Power, the biggest electricity generator. National Power inherited a fragmented IT infrastructure. It had lost IT and telecommunications assets, including its central mainframe, to Nuclear Electric in the dismantling of the Central Electricity Generating Board. Its remaining technology was complex, often incompatible and, says Handby, its core business systems were incapable of meeting the demands of its new commercial environment. After a 'survival phase', in which it secured short-term solutions to keep the business running, National Power committed itself to a substantial investment in a radical IT infrastructure to underpin the new company. The programme is one of the largest computing and telecommunications projects ever undertaken by a company in Europe. It comprises core hardware and systems software - Amdahl mainframe and Digital Equipment Vax machines, a new company-wide network, applications, tools and procedures. When it is completed 70 Vax machines will be distributed across the company linked to 3,000 networked Compaq personal computers. Handby's priority has been to devolve computing to the remotest parts of an unusually dispersed organisation. In technological terms that has meant single-screen access to an integrated network. But its effect is farther reaching. 'We are building a true networked organisation,' says Handby, replacing the formal hierarchical culture of a public utility with a 'flatter, highly responsive' structure, which has shifted power from corporate headquarters to the power stations themselves. Distributing technology 'is as clear a signal of intent', Handby says, 'as getting rid of the executive loos'. National Power's IT strategy was developed in just three months. It is now 18 months into an aggressive three-year programme. This has seen it: Implement a company-wide communications network, called Unity; Install new hardware and systems software in new data centres; Design, build and roll out a series of applications: office systems, procurement, work management, financial reporting - and an innovative operational information system which gives the business access to a reservoir of operational power plant data. National Power's experience is exceptional but its conviction that IT will prove an agent of cultural change is shared. Maynard expects IT to 'empower Welsh Water workers' - but that does not translate into a uniform approach. Good says the scope and ambition of IT initiatives across these utilities is conditioned largely by the management style they inherited, and their relative sophistication when they 'hit' privatisation. But there are clear priorities emerging. The first is customer service systems. At first sight this is hard to fathom. Water companies retain a monopoly, as do the electricity suppliers in the domestic market, until full deregulation in 1998. So is their interest in customer service systems more than just a fashionable import from the US? 'We simply would not survive very long under the new regime if we didn't take this seriously,' says Maynard. Customer service initiatives address three interrelated issues: inflexible billing systems; scattered, and often incompatible customer databases; and inferior customer service organisations. Of these there is no doubt that privatisation has concentrated minds on the inadequacy of existing billing arrangements in both industries. As Maynard says, Welsh Water's customer accounting system 'handles our most important customer contact'. Yet, says Good, these same systems are elsewhere 'bogging companies down' to the extent that they can only introduce creative service products or complex tariffs with great difficulty, because they cannot bill for them. But while the motivation is the same, the approach varies greatly. Severn Trent Water turned to IBM imaging technology as the basis of its customer service effort. Ian Hislop, director of computer systems, says the systems were built to deliver immediate improvements in the speed and quality of its response to customers. Thames Water, on the other hand, is building a 'one-stop customer contact point' at its customer centre in Swindon - from the bottom up. This strategy, says project manager Peter Ratcliffe, is dependent on a complex computing and telecommunications infrastructure which will integrate all Thames's customer service contacts. A second priority is for 'work and asset' management systems. Asset management in both the water and electricity industries demands not just proper job or workflow administration but geographical information systems (GISs) to keep track of the network. Thames Water is three years into its own IBM mainframe-based GIS project (it has 20,000 maps loaded so far). But, says Ratcliffe, it will take another five years to digitise Thames's own water and sewer network on top. The ultimate trick, he says, will be to give its customer and job management centres direct access to that integrated model. In part these GIS initiatives are driven by legislation: the Street Work Act and respective customer charters oblige utilities to take better control of their physical infrastructure as well as their field workforce. In the longer term, the emergence of an IT-based customer service culture among UK utilities raises the prospect that, ultimately, providing the service could be decoupled from owning and running the physical infrastructure.

Figures from the regional industrial electricity department  show that Tibet has one-eighth of China's total area, but its  entire electric power generation is only 173,400 kw, 0.096  percent of the country's total.    The lack of power is attributed to the underdeveloped social  and economic conditions in Tibet, especially the low  industrialisation, according to Liao Ximing, vice-director of  the department.    One of the region's leading electricity projects under way  is  a 90,000-kw pumped hydro-electric storage station at the Yamzhog  Yum Lake. When completed, it will raise the total installed  capacity in Tibet by 50 percent. The first 25,000-kw generating  unit will go into operation by the end of next year.    Tibet now has 405 small electric power stations, but most of  them have a generating capacity of only hundreds of kilowatts.    ""The vastness of land and dispersion of population and  natural resources in Tibet have led to having these small-scale  and scattered stations,"" the vice-director said. In the coming  years, more stress will be put on the construction of big  hydro-power stations above 10,000 kw of generating capacity.    Tibet is rich in water resources. The region's potential  water energy is 200 million kw, 30 percent of the country's  total, and 56 million of this is exploitable. The Yarlung  Sangbo River and the eastern mountainous areas possess most of  the energy.    A 10,800-kw station is going to generate power next year,  and  the design work for several electric power projects are well  under way.    In addition to hydro-electric power, the region will also  promote the development of solar and geothermal power.    So far, more than 600 places which have underground heat  have  been found, with an estimated prospect of 800,000 kw installed  capacity.    The 25,000-kw Yangbajain geothermal power station near Lhasa  is the biggest power station in Tibet. Geological prospectors  are exploring terrestrial heat 2,600 m underground nearby, and  local electric power officials estimate that a new 50,000-kw  geothermal station might be set up.    Not long ago, the United Nations Development Programme  helped  build a 1,000-kw geothermal power station which went into  operation last year.    Situated on a plateau dubbed ""the roof of the world"", the  region also enjoys abundant sunlight all the year round. Now  Tibet is applying for international aid to establish a modern  30,000-50,000 kw solar power station near Lhasa.     "
0,FT911-3411 ,"FT911-3411 _AN-BDYBFAAHFT 910425   FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (8): Investment will cut the bills - Demand for energy efficiency is focusing on the generators      By LUCY PLASKETT   SOME 20 per cent of the UK's energy bill could be saved by investing in 'cost-effective energy efficiency measures', according to Mr William Rickett, director-general of the UK Energy Efficiency Office. The scope for reducing energy use is not in doubt. Nor is the need to do it. Carbon dioxide (CO), the main 'greenhouse' gas causing global warming, can only be tackled by reducing energy consumption. Rather than meeting increasing energy demand with increasing supply, existing supplies must be used more efficiently. Demand for change will focus on the electricity industry, an important contributor to CO emissions. The UK has radically re-structured its electricity industry over the past two years in preparation for the private sector. The restructuring arguably offered a unique opportunity to incorporate incentives for energy efficiency into the licences and the regulation of the new companies. The opportunity was not taken. Under the system in England and Wales, it is in everyone's interests to sell electricity, and in no one's to save. The profits of the generators depend on maintaining their market share. The profits of the 12 regional electricity companies (RECs) depend on the amount of electricity they distribute and sell. The duty to 'promote', not enforce, energy efficiency lies with the regulator, Professor Littlechild. So far this regulation consists of ensuring the RECs provide their customers with adequate information on ways to cut consumption. What privatisation may do is open up the generation side of the market for new, more efficient technologies. Nearly all of the plant being built or proposed today is based on combined cycle gas-fired turbines (CCGT) which achieve greater efficiency levels than conventional coal-fired plant. It has also raised the profile of combined heat and power (CHP), which has potential efficiency levels of more than 80 per cent. Critics point out that by splitting generation and distribution, and by the regulatory formula used, the government has removed the potential to introduce measures to curb demand, such as least-cost planning. This involves a utility considering whether improving the end-use efficiency of its customers is more cost-effective than building new generating plant. Least-cost planning is being 'aggressively pursued' in about 20 US states, according to Mr Mike Foley of the US National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC). Some state regulators require utilities to explore both demand and supply-side options before licensing new capacity. In most cases, utilities are then allowed to claim back a rate of return on their investments in energy efficiency. The employment of demand-side management is due to be expanded as part of the new US National Energy Strategy (NES). Although the power industry at first resisted this approach, many utilities are now finding it profitable. These include New England Electric, Boston Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, three large, privately-owned utilities. According to Mr Mike Monahan of Boston Edison, such demand-side management is Edison's main focus because at 'the bottom line it is more cost-effective to buy back electricity than it is to build new generating plant'. Boston Edison will spend Dollars 250m (Pounds 139.6m) to 1995 on energy conservation measures for its customers, including distributing compact fluorescent lightbulbs, and offering free energy audits. In this way, it shaved some 130MW off its peak demand growth in 1990; by 2000, it expects the figure to be closer to 300MW-400MW. One of the reasons this strategy works is that most US utilities are vertically integrated and have a mandate to serve a particular area. They therefore have an incentive to cut demand. The UK RECs, on the other hand, are distributors and suppliers whose franchise market is due to disappear over the next eight years. An attempt by the House of Lords to enable the regulator, under the Electricity Bill, to enforce energy efficiency measures before approving tariff increases was overturned in the Commons. The structure of the European electricity supply industry is diverse, and consequently the potential for least-cost planning patchy. Swedish state-owned utility Vattenfall believes it could cut 12TWh-19TWh out of a commercial and residential demand of 70TWh a year. The next phase, due this autumn, is to discover how much of this potential can be realised. According to Mr Morgan Andersson, project manager, the recent decision by the Swedish government to delay the phase-out of nuclear power means that 'it is still vital to keep conservation measures going, but the commercial incentive has changed'. Vattenfall now has no need for new generation until 2000. Other Swedish utilities, notably Stockholm Energi, and some German utilities have implemented demand-side management measures. Italy's state-owned utility ENEL is a vertically-integrated monopoly supplier faced with growing demand and increasingly unable to site new plant due to environmental opposition. It has started to look at how to cut domestic demand by working with manufacturers to promote more efficient electrical appliances. A recent study for the UK Energy Department by the March Consulting Group estimates that in the UK alone, replacing appliances with the best available on the world market could save 24,000GWh of electricity. The MCG report, along with the recently released Energy Select Committee report on energy efficiency, comes to the now familiar conclusion that improvements are unlikely to happen without government intervention. Schemes to label appliances according to their efficiency have been introduced by France, Denmark, and Germany with varying degrees of success, but no European country has implemented labelling fully. Again, the US record is impressive, with the 1987 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act setting minimum standards for domestic appliances. The recent NES is set to expand this. A number of US utilities also offer customer rebates for buying efficient electrical appliances. Meanwhile it may be left to international legislative moves to take energy efficiency to the top of the agenda. Movement may be slow, but environmental legislation is set to grow increasingly stringent. The European Commission has already issued a directive setting standards for SOx and NOx emissions from power plants. An EC draft directive calls for compulsory labelling for most domestic appliances in member states from July 1992. Minimum standards are set to follow. Future pressure from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climatic Change to cut global CO emissions may force utilities and governments to try a little harder.

0,FT944-1610 ,"FT944-1610 _AN-ELSDLAFJFT 941219   FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (8): Nuclear deadline looms - Christopher Brown-Humes examines energy policy      By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES   Sweden is a country with one of the safest nuclear power industries in the world - and yet it has committed itself to phasing out nuclear power entirely by the year 2010. Perhaps only in a country of such dogged environmental idealism could so dramatic a move be contemplated when nuclear power accounts for close to 50 per cent of electricity production. Nuclear power has been a hot potato in Sweden for 20 years. The issue has nagged away with varying degrees of intensity in the political debate, even helping to decide the outcome of one general election. It has gained added urgency every time there is a nuclear spillage beyond Sweden's borders, such as the 1979 Three Mile Island disaster in the US and the Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine in 1986. Now, as the 2010 deadline looms, a new urgency has developed and a new political crisis may be in the offing. If the final deadline is to be met, a date for the phase-out of the first of the 12 reactors has to be fixed soon. In many countries, the practicalities of the matter would decide the issue. Most of Sweden's nuclear power plants are nowhere near the end of their technical lives. Replacing them would be extremely costly, there are no easy alternatives, and there is an obvious risk of higher electricity prices. But in Sweden there is a strong political will to phase out the controversial energy source completely. The Centre, Christian Democrat, Left and Environment parties have all tied themselves to the anti-nuclear mast. More importantly, the Social Democratic prime minister, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, is personally committed to the phase-out, saying 2010 is 'a realistic commitment.' His party, however, is split on the question. The 2010 date was set by parliament in 1980 after a national referendum in which Swedes voted to dismantle their nuclear industry. The date chosen was 25 years after the last of Sweden's reactors was commissioned in 1985. Why 25 years? Because that was assumed to be a nuclear plant's technical lifespan just because it is the standard depreciation period for Swedish nuclear assets. The issue again came to the fore in the late 1980s when parliament decided to dismantle the first two plants in 1995 and 1996. However this commitment was side-stepped as part of a three-way accord between the Social Democrats, the Centre Party and the Liberals in early 1991. The 2010 target, however, remained in place. The importance of nuclear power to Sweden is not contested. Last year it generated 58.9 terawatts of power, or 41.8 per cent of the country's electricity needs. Hydro-electric power produced 73.3 TWh, or 52 per cent. Ironically, the improving efficiency of Swedish nuclear plants and the expected re-commissioning of a plant that has been out of service means the nuclear contribution is predicted to rise over the next two years. Next year, nuclear electricity output could reach 69.0 TWh, 48 per cent of the total. This is a huge hole for other power sources to fill. The difficulty has been exacerbated because 'renewable' energy sources such as wind, solar energy and biomass have not become as commercially viable as was expected at the time of the 1980 referendum. In fact, Sweden is being forced to try and reconcile a number of mutually incompatible objectives. It wants to be rid of nuclear power, but it is not prepared to dam more rivers in the north of the country to increase hydro-power generation. It cannot insist on renewables, but it knows that falling back on coal and gas would increase carbon dioxide emissions. Finally, it wants to maintain internationally competitive energy prices and protect jobs. In other words, there are no easy answers. Heavy investments in coal and gas-fired power plants look to be the only realistic alternatives, but that could cost the country a staggering SKr200bn, according to some estimates. The problems might eventually be eased by a broad deregulation of the Swedish, Nordic and even north European power markets. But the Social Democrats have just postponed deregulation of the Swedish market, which was due to take effect on January 1 1995, and the deregulation of the north European market still looks to be some way off. For the moment, the issue is again on hold. A commission has been established to map out a realistic Swedish energy policy, covering everything from nuclear power to deregulation. Its task will be to detail the costs and environmental implications of the different solutions before the end of next year. Power industry experts are convinced that the 2010 date will be dropped. 'I have never thought the politicians would go ahead with the phase-out,' says Dr Karl-Axel Edin, president of Tentum, a Stockholm energy consultancy. 'The safety of nuclear power has increased more than tenfold since the referendum and energy sources like wind-power and biomass are not going to fill the gap.' The assessment may well be correct - but that does not mean there will not be another political crisis over the issue or that one or two nuclear plants will not be sacrificed along the way. Mr Sigfrid Leijonhufvud, author of A History of Swedish Nuclear Power, believes there could be another referendum on the issue. Alternatively, he suggests the deadline could be postponed as a gesture to some future political partner, such as the Liberals, if the minority Social Democratic government was ever forced into a coalition. But Mr Leijonhufvud notes that Mr Carlsson is 'morally bound' over the 2010 deadline and believes it could even prove to be the issue on which the 60-year-old party veteran eventually decides to step down.

0,FT942-6513 ,"FT942-6513 _AN-EE3BUACSFT 940530   FT  30 MAY 94 / Through gas and high water: The regulators of the UK's privatised utilities are feeling besieged. John Willman explains why      By JOHN WILLMAN   Last week was one that Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the UK gas regulator with a disarming giggle, will be anxious to put behind her. From a position of relative obscurity, she found herself splashed across Britain's tabloid newspapers as 'the laughing gas regulator'. This unwelcome exposure was sparked off by spurious allegations - denied with great seriousness - of an improper relationship with a civil servant involved in her appointment. But the addition of Ms Spottiswoode to the cast of regulars in the tabloid soap opera reflects more than the traditional British obsession with hanky-panky, real or imagined, in public life. The UK's utility regulators are finding themselves increasingly in the limelight as they revolutionise the industries they regulate. They are also attracting growing attention from the politicians as it becomes clear that their decisions have far-reaching consequences for society. Yet the UK's utility regulators were created to take complex pricing and competition judgments away from the meddling of MPs. 'Politicians made such a hash of running the nationalised industries,' says Sir Christopher Foster, adviser to the government on privatisation and author of a book on regulation. 'Detaching them from the day-to-day interference of politicians has been an incontrovertible good.' Until recently, the consensus was that the regulators had made a good fist of their jobs, especially in the two utilities - telecommunications and gas  -that were privatised first. In telecoms, prices have fallen by more than 30 per cent in real terms since 1984. BT, the privatised company that formerly enjoyed a monopoly in telephony, now faces more than 40 competitors in different sectors of its market. If there is disquiet, it is among companies in the industry rather than consumers. BT has complained of over-regulation: Mr Don Cruickshank, the regulator, is now tackling the smaller obstacles faced by new entrants to the market, such as access to directory inquiries. Mercury, the second largest operator, has taken Mr Cruickshank to court over his approach to regulating the charges BT makes for carrying other operators' calls. Gas prices have also fallen in real terms, by more than 20 per cent since the privatisation of British Gas in 1986. The next stage of regulation, opening up the industry to competition, is proving more controversial, however. One consequence of liberalisation could be differential pricing, if charges rose for customers furthest from the North Sea gas fields. Before last week's events, Ms Spottiswoode had incurred the wrath of opposition MPs for appearing with Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, at the launch of the consultative paper on gas competition. 'She has adopted a Thatcherite interpretation of competition that will lead to higher prices for consumers furthest from the points where gas comes ashore,' says Mr Peter Hain, the left-wing Labour MP, who advocates far-reaching changes to the regulatory system. In the water industry, prices have risen above the rate of inflation to finance modernisation and clean up water and beaches. There is also less scope to introduce competition to keep prices down. In the south-west of England, Conservative candidates are already blaming water price increases 50 per cent above the national average for their expected poor showing in next month's European elections. Experiments in water metering, encouraged by the regulator to curb demand in areas of the country where supplies are under strain, have also proved controversial. The burden of metered charges falls more heavily on families, pensioners and low-income households. 'It's illusory to believe that politics can be removed from the utilities,' says Mr Dieter Helm of Oxford Economic Research Associates. 'They are central to the performance of the economy as a whole, there is a strong monopoly element and they have a large impact on living standards.' The impact of utility regulation on the economy can be seen in the electricity industry. Prof Stephen Littlechild, the regulator, refused to halt the expansion of gas-fired power stations, a development largely responsible for the sharp fall in demand for coal that has led to widespread pit closures. The decision is described by Mr Hain as 'an effective veto on coal'. 'The idea that regulation is a value-free, technical exercise is nonsense,' he adds. 'Regulators may hide behind the mantle of competition, but they are right in the thick of political controversy.' The view that regulation is too important to be left to the regulators is increasingly heard in the City. Investors are concerned that the water and electricity regulators, who are conducting reviews, will crack down on price rises. In April, Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the privatised electricity generator, called for curbs on regulators' power. Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management and Prudential, the UK's largest institutional investor, have urged water companies to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission rather than accept much tougher price limits. One cause of concern is regulators' different approaches. 'The regulation of the water and electricity industries reflects the personalities of their regulators,' says Mr Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Hoare Govett. 'Mr Ian Byatt (Ofwat regulator) is in favour of intensive regulation. He demands lots of information from the water companies and has assembled a massive database. Prof Littlechild takes a free-market approach (to the electricity industry) and believes in profit. He wants regulation to be light-handed and therefore asks for relatively little information from the companies.' There is also concern that regulators feel they must act tough. 'Mr Byatt's review of the price caps for water companies will inevitably be judged by ill-informed commentators on the number of companies that squeal,' says Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, water analyst at County NatWest. 'If none of them appeal to the MMC, he'll be seen as a wimp.' These differences in approach are an inevitable consequence of the way the UK's regulatory system hands power to one individual, according to Mr Helm. 'If you give individuals great power, it will become intensely personalised. Just look at how different the approach of Clare Spottiswoode is compared with her predecessor, Sir James McKinnon. Yet both were appointed under the same legislation. 'A future Labour government could appoint someone completely different who could overturn the system without further legislation.' Such concerns have led to similar prescriptions from different quarters. National Power's Mr Baker, for example, has called for a common organisation of regulators, to raise the quality of support staff and transfer experience between industries. Labour's Mr Hain makes a similar proposal. Both also support the idea of defining more precisely the role of the regulator and the establishment of strategic plans for their industries. Both want the regulatory process to be more open to scrutiny. The only comfort for the regulators is that no one appears to want to return to the bad old days of Whitehall administration of the utilities. It is perhaps a compliment to their success that even the more radical voices in the Labour party would preserve the system of independent regulation, albeit with greater accountability to Parliament.

0,FT943-227 ,"FT943-227 _AN-EI3DUACSFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / Tight price curb on Scots power groups: Shares fall on regulator's move      By MICHAEL SMITH   Share prices in the two Scottish electricity companies fell sharply yesterday after Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, announced price controls which he said would save consumers Pounds 300m over the three years from next April. If accepted by the companies, the controls would mean a saving of Pounds 91 over three years to a family with a Pounds 400-a-year ScottishPower bill. Scottish Hydro-Electric household customers would save Pounds 74 on average. The controls were tougher than some analysts had predicted, with Hydro-Electric judged by most to have come off worst. At the close yesterday Hydro-Electric shares were down 45p at 327p while ScottishPower was down 31p at 349p. The review contrasted with Prof Littlechild's recent review of the English and Welsh electricity companies which were criticised as being too lax - and prompted significant rises in share prices. Direct comparison is difficult because the Scots companies are generators, suppliers and distributors while the controls south of the border were applied only to distribution. In distribution, the one area where comparison is possible, the Scottish companies appeared to have been treated less harshly. ScottishPower must cut distribution prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms in the next five years and Hydro-Electric by 1 per cent. The English and Welsh companies were required to make cuts of between 11 per cent and 17 per cent in the first year and 2 per cent thereafter. The Scots had argued that they were entitled to better treatment because price controls for the first year of privatisation were tougher on them than on English and Welsh companies. Hydro-Electric had pressed to be able to increase its distribution charges in real terms to compensate for a formula which will require it and ScottishPower to lower their generation charges in stages to match those in England and Wales by 1998-99. Prof Littlechild also proposes to tighten controls on the companies' supply businesses which buy and sell electricity. He wants reductions of 2 per cent in real terms for three years until the market is opened up to full competition. ScottishPower said the review was broadly in line with expectations and 'would not alter our stated aim of sustainable real dividend growth of 5 per cent to 6 per cent a year.' Mr Roger Young, Hydro-Electric chief executive, said the review document was extremely complicated. The board would decide on 'acceptance or otherwise'. Some analysts downgraded dividend growth forecasts although most consider 5 per cent achievable for the rest of the decade.   Companies:-  Scottish Power.     Scottish Hydro-Electric.

0,FT921-6743 ,"FT921-6743 _AN-CBZA5AESFT 920226   FT  26 FEB 92 / GEC breakthrough improves prospects for superconductors      By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor   UK RESEARCHERS have developed a 'high-temperature' superconductor which may be suitable for large-scale applications such as cables carrying electricity for hundreds of miles without losing energy. The discovery at General Electric Company's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley, north-west London, followed a two-year search using a robot which made and tested materials with 15,000 different chemical compositions. The work was part of a collaborative project involving six European companies under the European Community's Brite-Euram programme. The original excitement about high-temperature superconductors - ceramic materials first made in 1986 which lose all electrical resistance at the temperature of liquid nitrogen ( - 196 deg C) - waned as scientists learnt more about their disadvantages. Most serious is that they cannot carry the large currents required for power engineering or to make magnets powerful enough to lift trains. They are called 'high temperature' because previously superconductivity was known only at temperatures close to absolute zero ( - 273 deg C). GEC says its new material promises to be 'superior to the known high-temperature superconductors in important respects, especially for high-current applications'. Details of the compound, which includes seven chemical elements including cadmium, lead and copper, will be published later this week in Superconductor Science and Technology, a specialist journal. The compound resembles the best superconductors discovered so far, the thallium series, but without their drawbacks of toxicity and volatility. Only a few grammes have been made but scientists have established that it is a stable and reproducible material which becomes superconducting at - 181 deg C. The next step will be for GEC to transfer the material to the other participants in the EC project: BICC, ABB, Alcatel Cable, Pirelli Cavi and Siemens. They will work to develop superconducting cables from it, though these are unlikely to reach the market for 10 years. According to an EC estimate, Europe could theoretically save Pounds 2bn a year on energy losses by replacing its power-transmission system with superconducting cables cooled by liquid nitrogen. Another large-scale application is energy storage - electricity can flow indefinitely around a superconducting coil.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Air-conditioners, refrigerators and juice extractors make life more comfortable for those who can afford them, but put a huge extra burden on generating capacity. With energy use climbing steadily and no natural fuel resources of its own, Japan has long put its faith in nuclear power, a policy reinforced by the oil crises of the 1970s. More recently, the government and the nuclear industry have gone to great lengths to win the population over to the idea of yet more energy from uranium and plutonium. Already accounting for 30 per cent of electricity generation - the country has 46 nuclear power plants with seven more on the way - the scale of the nuclear commitment is set to rise further. Yet several factors have combined to slow down the nuclear energy drive. Concern over nuclear proliferation, especially after North Korea's reluctance to allow international inspection, has focused foreign attention on Japan's technological prowess in the nuclear field, despite protestations from Tokyo that it has no intention of using plutonium to make weapons. Japan's growing environmental consciousness is also playing a role. So is the fact that uranium, used in the present light water reactors, looks likely to be in plentiful supply for many years. Thus the government has just decided to hold back on further development of the fast breeder reactor (FBR) programme, based on plutonium, and on building a second nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. This plant, on which a decision will not now be taken until 2010, would follow one being built some 700km north-east of Tokyo in an area of lush fields and low hills near the town of Masawa at a cost of Y1,250bn (Dollars 12.5bn). Chattering school children and attentive adults tour the visitors' centre at the Rokkasho reprocessing and waste disposal plant near the Pacific coast. In the smartly designed centre, the workings of the facility are demonstrated - from the treatment of spent fuel and the enrichment of uranium to the storage of radioactive waste. A smiling hostess points to a display of yellow drums in which low-level waste from power stations will be buried in concrete; some 3m drums will eventually be stored. Although the Japanese people broadly accept the case for nuclear energy, they have reservations. The government says 70 per cent believe in its necessity but only 40 per cent think it is safe. Also, said a recent report by a nuclear advisory sub-committee of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), 'the public has a low degree of confidence in information on nuclear power generation provided by the government and electric utilities'. The 7.5m sq m Rokkasho site, partly completed and partly a hive of round-the-clock construction activity with tall cranes piercing the skyline, is central to the government's aim of providing security of energy supply for resource-poor Japan. The enrichment facility, in which the concentration of heat-generating U-235 is increased, is building up its operations, while the first huge pit for storing the drums is now in use. Reprocessing will not start until around 2002, also a slight delay. But Rokkasho is already a symbol of both the nuclear industry's ambitions and the concern in and outside Japan over how far it intends to go down the nuclear road. Despite constant reassurances from Tokyo, suspicions about the possibility that the country may one day build nuclear weapons persist. It certainly has the skills to do so. Even the previous prime minister, Mr Tsutomu Hata, whose minority government collapsed last month, admitted as much. Yet anyone who has visited the Peace Museum at Hiroshima with its horrific exhibits from August 1945 when Japan became the only country to suffer atomic bombing, will understand its reluctance to enter the nuclear arms race. 'We have to show foreign countries how we are keeping to peaceful uses of nuclear power,' says Mr Teruaki Masumoto, head of communications at Tokyo Electric. The overseas concern, especially in the US, has arisen mainly over Japan's nuclear fuel cycle policy - with uranium reused after spent fuel is reprocessed - which would result in the production of plutonium, which could be used to make nuclear weapons. 'The idea that surplus plutonium could be used to make a bomb is very controversial,' admits Mr Harushige Takeuchi, a general manager at Rokkasho. 'Japan has no intention of doing that; the point is to use the nuclear fuel resources in the most practical and economic way.' Officials at Miti echo this. But while stressing the absence of military ambitions, they argue that Japan's nuclear policy is vital to secure long-term electricity supply in a country which is a voracious consumer of energy. Japan used to be heavily dependent on imported oil, which accounted for around 70 per cent of its needs. Today, this is down to some 30 per cent. At Tokyo Electric, the share of electricity produced from nuclear power units, of which it has 15, is set to rise to 43 per cent in 2003 from 37 per cent last year. The company appears unworried about the FBR delay. The Y600bn Monju prototype facility has now begun operations after technical problems. But commercial use of fast breeders has been postponed by 10 years to 2030, with the planned demonstration plant (to be built by industry) put off from the late 1990s to early in the next century. The slowdown in policy will lessen the supply of plutonium and should thus abate concern over non-peaceful uses. But Tokyo Electric's Mr Masumoto thinks the FBR will eventually go ahead. 'No-one knows if a third oil shock will come. We have to prepare something as insurance.' So while the FBR programme is on hold, RD work will carry on at full stretch.

0,FT944-8966 ,"FT944-8966 _AN-EKQEIAE9FT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: To buy back or pay out - David Wighton examines the distribution of cash piles      By DAVID WIGHTON   Boots' decision to spend more than Pounds 500m buying in its shares has fuelled a fierce, if arcane, debate about the best way for companies to reduce excess cash holdings. Boots is following a trail blazed by the regional electricity companies which have spent more than Pounds 750m buying back their shares over the last year. Last month East Midlands Electricity took a different tack by paying out Pounds 186.5m as a special dividend. Both methods have their pros and cons, most of which relate to tax. One advantage of the special dividend is that its tax treatment is certain. East Midlands obtained prior clearance from the Inland Revenue, which said the payment would be treated like an ordinary dividend - having a tax credit attached worth 25 per cent of the payment. Tax exempt shareholders, including pension funds, can reclaim the tax credit from the Inland Revenue. The company pays the same sum to the Revenue in advance corporation tax which it can then set against its mainstream corporation tax bill. In theory, if a company buys back its shares directly from investors most of the sum received is treated in the same way. But this only applies if the company buys the shares in the market or through a stockbroker acting purely as an agent. If it merely buys them from a market maker, as some of the electricity companies did, there is no tax benefit for the shareholders. There is another potential snag. The Revenue has given no commitment that shareholders accepting repayment will get their tax credit and it can refuse to pay if the investor sold for tax reasons. Tax experts believe it is likely that a few institutions who took advantage of electricity buy-backs may fall foul of this rule. Those who sold shares to the company only to buy them back in the market are particularly vulnerable. The Revenue could easily argue that the institution acted purely to get the tax credit. But buy-backs are more tax efficient, assuming institutions get their tax credits. In most recent examples the companies' brokers merely stood in the market buying shares until the money had been spent. Since the tax credit is only available to non-taxpayers, they buy most of the shares. The total amount claimable from the Revenue will therefore be almost 25 per cent of the purchase price. Yet a special dividend goes to all shareholders. Basic rate taxpayers get no credit, while top rate taxpayers face a bill of 20 per cent of the dividend. So the total net flow from the Revenue to shareholders is likely to be less. Supporters of special dividends counter that they are more equitable than buy-backs where only institutions are offered the chance to sell. But because of their different tax statuses shareholders do not receive equal value from dividends, while under a buy-back all shareholders receive the benefit of the changed capital structure. For example, because of the different tax treatment of interest and dividends, analysts calculate that by switching Pounds 500m of its capital from equity to debt Boots will boost its post-tax profits by more than Pounds 10m a year. Most observers agree that Reuters adopted the ideal solution last year. It distributed Pounds 350m to shareholders by offering all of them the opportunity to sell part of their holding. Not only did the company treat shareholders equally, it gave them the option of receiving cash or enhancing their investment. It also gave investors time to decide in contrast to what has been described as the 'unseemly scramble' over Boots' buy-back. Unfortunately the Revenue has since refused to give any other company clearance for such a scheme. If there is an interval between the announcement of the buy-back and the closing date, the market price could rise above the offer price. So shareholders who accept the company's offer, rather than sell in the market, are clearly doing so for tax reasons. A way around this is unlikely to be found before the Budget, which is expected to change the taxation of dividends.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT944-6748 ,"FT944-6748 _AN-EK1C5AE1FT 941128   FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (3): The bird that would not fly  -Bronwen Maddox describes the fate of a bold Whitehall initiative      By BRONWEN MADDOX   Energy efficiency can be a remarkably slippery policy to promote. That is the experience of the UK government which has seen the Energy Saving Trust, an election manifesto pledge and one of the fondest creations of its environmental policy, fail to get off the ground. According to Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, the trust's progress is 'a severe disappointment - it originally represents one of the soundest programmes in the UK for delivering higher levels of energy efficiency'. The trust is intended to help the gas and electricity utilities identify projects which will help their customers use less energy. Ministers planned that the money to fund the projects would be passed on to all customers of the utilities through their bills. In January, Mr John Major, the prime minister, made clear in a high profile speech to spell out the UK's environmental strategy that he was giving the trust a central role in the UK's plans for meeting the Rio targets on global warming. Those targets specify that the UK must draw up plans to bring emissions of carbon dioxide, which is implicated in global warming, back to 1990 levels in the year 2000. According to estimates compiled by the Department of Trade and Industry, that means that the UK needs to cut around 10mtC (million tonnes of carbon) from the projected 170mtC in the year 2000. The government hopes that most of those savings will be generated by measures - themselves controversial - to raise the price of heating fuel and petrol. However, ministers have put a quarter of the burden - 2.5mtC, the biggest single element - of the required cuts on the trust's shoulders. They have also estimated that the trust will need to identify about Pounds 400m of projects a year by the end of the decade in order to reach that target. It needs to raise nearly Pounds 2bn by the end of the decade to meet government targets, according to its business plan, published in April. However, so far the trust is not on course to reach anywhere approaching that figure. According to its chief executive, Mr Eoin Lees, it has looked at 55 projects, which would cost Pounds 14m to implement. Of these, 25 have been approved by Offer, the electricity regulator. Last year, it spent Pounds 4m on pilot projects. Mr Lees says: 'I think we are on course to spend between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m in the year to March 1995.' The projects cover more efficient light bulbs, and all night lighting for security purposes in communal housing, which has proved popular with local authorities and housing associations. However, although he points out that this spending figure is in line with the spending the trust had planned to make this year, the obstacles in the way of further progress, up towards the Pounds 400m level, are considerable. According to Mr Warren, the projects approved so far 'are tiddlers. This is no more than money which was agreed 18 months ago'. Those hurdles lie in the position of the gas and electricity regulators. They are uncomfortable about allowing the costs of such projects to be passed on to all customers, even those who have not benefited from the schemes. On the electricity side, Offer has capped the amount which the utilities can spend on such projects to Pounds 22m a year until March 1998, when the industry pricing will be reviewed. The position of Ofgas, the gas regulator, is even more trenchant. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, made clear her uneasiness to such 'cost-pass-through' at repeated hearings before parliamentary select committees. She argued that regulators should not be used to impose charges which were essentially taxes. Moreover, she made clear, such a tax would be regressive, hitting the poorer families hardest. Ministers have also shown uneasiness in private about these implications. The government's separate proposal to levy value added tax on heating fuel started a still-simmering political row. Ministers are concerned that an additional hike in fuel bills would stir the controversy again. One casualty of the conflict with Ms Spottiswoode is the progress of Homes 2000, a proposed scheme to subsidise home improvements such as insulation for lofts and external walls, and energy-efficient lights and boilers. The project, which would pay up to half of the costs of these projects, would need Pounds 8m next year and Pounds 120m by 2000, the trust has indicated. There have been other concerns with the trust. It directs almost all its schemes at owner-occupiers, but, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has pointed out, owners of accommodation for private rental make the least investment in energy efficiency, and their tenants could greatly benefit from such schemes. For the moment, there is an uneasy peace. Parliamentary committees and Ofgas have concluded that in deciding whether to approve such projects, Ms Spottiswoode must balance the regulator's responsibilities to protect the customer from rising prices with those to promote energy efficiency. The trust argues that the extra sums on fuel bills need not prove controversial. Although estimates suggest that households which do not benefit from the schemes could see annual fuel bills rise by nearly 2 per cent on top of inflation by 1998, the trust says that most projects will pay for themselves through energy savings within five years. But while in theory this allows some projects to progress, the energy industry and some within the trust feel that in practice few significant ones are likely to progress. According to Mr Lees, 'the only way forward now is through new legislation. The government has to decide how it wants energy efficiency to be taken forward in the competitive market.' For that reason, he takes considerable comfort from the fact that gas regulation was included in the Queen's Speech at the opening of parliament this month. This offers the chance that regulators could be directed explicitly to allow such cost-pass through. Until then, however, the trust is effectively stalled, and its executives must devote much of their time to pleading behind the scenes with politicians to clearing a way forward. According to Mr Warren, 'of course the trust can be saved if there is political will'. It is far from clear, however, that the political will exists.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Guido di Tella, Argentine foreign minister, met representatives of British companies and financial institutions, including Baring Brothers, the merchant bank, and ICI, in London yesterday, to discuss the privatisation programme and encourage UK investment in Argentina. 'We are very interested in the British experience of privatisation,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times. 'Britain has great expertise in this matter, particularly in the creation of regulatory mechanisms to monitor companies after privatisation.' The first phase of Argentine privatisation was criticised for its haste and dogged by rumours of corruption. The gas, water and electricity industries, including SEGBA, the greater-Buenos Aires area electricity company, are next in line, and Argentina is eager to ensure adequate regulatory frameworks and maximise competition. Mr di Tella, who met Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, on Wednesday, was optimistic on relations with Britain. 'We have a specific problem with the (Falkland) Islands and the fisheries issue, but commercial relations are excellent.' Trade with the UK was growing very quickly, he said. 'Exports from the UK to Argentina, which had been lagging, have been picking up.' Trade between the two countries had recovered only slowly after the 1982 Falklands conflict. However, after Britain and Argentina established full diplomatic relations last July, Argentine exports grew quickly to a monthly average of about Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.7m) by the end of last year, against only Dollars 3m previously. UK exports stood at about Dollars 13m a month. Mr di Tella was adamant that Argentina would not relinquish its claim to sovereignty over the Falklands. 'We think we have right on our side. We think we will eventually convince the British government and the islanders to accept a different sort of settlement. However, we are aware of the peculiarities of the islands and their history and this is something we want to respect.

0,FT922-696 ,"FT922-696 _AN-CFZBBACSFT 920626   FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: First price cut wins approval - Profits surge at Southern Electric and South Wales Electricity      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   SOUTH WALES Electricity will drop electricity prices by up to 2 per cent from January, after cutting more than 450 jobs - around 15 per cent of its present workforce - and reducing costs by about Pounds 4m. The announcement, which makes the Cardiff-based regional electricity company the first to cut electricity prices since privatisation two years ago, won approval from the Department of Trade and Industry. 'I believe these reductions demonstrate that the benefits of privatisation are coming through,' said Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. The cuts, which mean about Pounds 1.50 to Pounds 2 off the average Pounds 80 to Pounds 90 quarterly electricity bill, were possible because South Wales had cut costs by 6 per cent, the company said at its annual meeting yesterday. That was the highest cut so far from any regional company. South Wales, which is the smallest of the 12 regional companies, did not rule out another tariff cut in future. Southern Electric, which also announced its annual results yesterday, faced questions from the City as to why it had not rewarded customers with a similar move. The contrast was sharp, because Southern only cut 3.7 per cent or Pounds 8.5m from its costs, but gave shareholders a dividend of 16.66p, up 15.3 per cent, compared with South Wales' 14.8 per cent increase to 19.4p. Southern Electric's pre-tax profit of Pounds 166.3m for the year ending March 1992, up 57 per cent on last year's pro forma figure, also looked high compared with the 28 per cent increase in South Wales' figure, to Pounds 72.5m. Southern's earnings per share rose by 51 per cent to 47.8p and South Wales' by 26 per cent to 50.3p. But the companies' underlying profit growth - excluding exceptional items and distortions - was closer. Southern Electric's profit grew by an underlying 30 per cent, and South Wales' by 23 per cent. This came almost entirely from the core distribution business, although sales were depressed. Southern Electric sold a modest 2.2 per cent more electricity, and sales in South Wales were stagnant. Growth came from cost cutting, and higher tariffs, which gave South Wales a Pounds 70.4m operating profit in the core business, compared with Pounds 47.5m the previous year. Southern Electric's core business made an operating profit of Pounds 172.5m, a rise of 34 per cent. Both companies incurred exceptional charges as they restructured their retail operations and shed jobs in the main business - Pounds 11.2m for South Wales and Pounds 8.5m for Southern Electric. However, while Southern merged its retail operations with Eastern's in April 1992, South Wales sold its business to South Western Electricity, shedding 355 jobs. Southern's retail business showed a Pounds 3.3m loss, and is not expected to break even until the year ending March 1994. Contracting was loss-making for both companies. Southern lost Pounds 2.6m on the business, and South Wales about Pounds 1m. Both companies plan to take more costs out of the core business, though Southern gave a firmer target of 500 more jobs to go or 6.3 per cent of the workforce next year. However, South Wales is targeting a 1 per cent cut in costs overall, while South Wales is forecasting a dramatic 5 per cent real cut. Turnover for the smaller South Wales Electricity amounted to Pounds 590m (567m) while Southern Electric achieved Pounds 1.75bn (Pounds 1.55bn). COMMENT Whether or not the halo South Wales was strategically wearing yesterday slips in future scarcely matters. The company's price cut will please the City even if it is a temporary sop to the regulator, and the company's cost cutting was tangible enough. And while Southern's promise of 'critical mass' from its retail merger made South Wales' decision to ditch the whole lossmaking outfit look happily straightforward and likely to keep Welsh Water from making more predatory moves on the company. Southern - with its seven new businesses and new retail venture - inevitably looks somewhat uncertain by comparison even though the company has a strong management record. That uncertainty casts a shadow over the company's hefty dividend rise, which the company implied would be a one-off. Analysts forecast pre-tax profit of between Pounds 170m and Pounds 200m for Southern Electric, and Pounds 85m to Pounds 95m for South Wales. That puts the companies on a prospective p/e of 6.5 to 7.7 for Southern, and 6.6 to 8.3 for South Wales. A dividend of between 18p and 18.7p is forecast for Southern, and 21.2p to 21.8p for South Wales.  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "

0,FT942-1794 ,"FT942-1794 _AN-EFVDUAFRFT 940622   FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Energy arm powers Veba turnover  -Sales at PreussenElektra have surged 28%      By JUDY DEMPSEY   Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate, began a roadshow in the US on Monday - its second in two years - and will travel to Canada later this week as speculation mounts that it might be about to follow Daimler-Benz on to the New York Stock Exchange. Its arrival in the US coincides with a 14.6 per cent increase in turnover for the first quarter of 1994, to DM17.49bn (Dollars 10.9bn). The biggest contributor to the overall result came from the group's energy sector, led by the PreussenElektra subsidiary. PreussenElektra's turnover for the quarter jumped 27.8 per cent to DM4.3bn. Mr Hans-Dieter Harig, chairman of PreussenElektra, exudes a quiet confidence about the sales gains. Significantly, he is confident that PreussenElektra, the second-largest force in the German energy market behind RWE Energie, can respond to growing pressure from both Brussels and Bonn for deregulation and liberalisation of the industry. 'I support these plans for deregulation. But Germany should not go it alone. We should have reciprocity for third-party access,' said Mr Harig. Mr Harig believes that PreussenElektra is well placed to defend its position when the German energy sector opens to outside competition, partly because of geographical location. It enjoys a dominance in energy distribution from Frankfurt to Kiel, and across the northern swathe of eastern Germany. 'This means we do not share a border with France, so we do not have to worry about competition from Electricite de France, the state-owned utility,' he says. PreussenElektra earlier this year concluded a deal with the Treuhand privatisation agency to acquire five units in eastern Germany, cementing its regional monopoly. The company, which last year made profits of DM968m on turnover of DM12.4bn, is keen to defend its position against future competition by tapping Scandinavian markets. In 1991, it set up Baltic Cable, a joint venture with Sydkraft and Vattenfall, the Swedish utilities. The venture will build and operate a 250km undersea cable between Germany and Sweden. The link, costing DM500m, is due to be completed in 1994 and will allow direct exchange of electricity between the two networks. Under the deal, Preussen-Elektra will import hydro-electric power during the day and deliver power back to Sweden at night. PreussenElektra believes it will benefit from the ability to import low-cost hydro and nuclear power, while the Swedish side will have have access to nuclear and coal-fired generation power in times of low rainfall. PreussenElektra has been working with Norwegian utilities since last year to build another undersea cable across the North Sea. These cable links play two roles: apart from increased co-operation with Scandinavia, they open up the possibility for PreussenElektra to expand in Poland and the Baltic States. 'We are not rushing in there. We have to consider economic viability. But we are very interested.' Closer to home, the company faces problems: opposition to nuclear power and falling energy consumption in eastern Germany. Of the electricity generated by public utilities in western Germany, about 37 per cent is sourced by nuclear power. PreussenElektra's share of nuclear power accounts for 47 per cent of that. Yet due to local opposition in Lower Saxony, the company has not been able to recommission its two nuclear power stations at Brunsbuttel, off-line since late 1992, and Krummel, at a standstill since mid-1993. These two units are costing Preussen-Elektra DM10m a month. 'I really see no end in sight to these problems,' says Mr Harig. However, Mr Harig adds that its five other nuclear power stations last year operated with an average availability of nearly 90 per cent, well above the average for the past 10 years. The other problem is that PreussenElektra's 51 per cent stakes in five regional utilities in eastern Germany coincide with a continuing fall in energy consumption in the east, and an increasing use of gas. PreussenElektra paid DM800m for its stakes and will invest DM8bn upgrading the region's power stations over the next several years. Energy consumption in the east fell by 45 per cent between 1989 and 1993. 'Our investments will pay off in the long term,' says Mr Harig. But he does not expect electricity sales to grow by more than 1 per cent a year, implying that no new power station capacity will be needed until 2005. For the moment, the period of expansion has ended. However, PreussenElektra will continue its research into electric vehicles. It has already set up a station on the island of Rugen. 'We are in the very early stages,' said Mr Harig. And like PreussenElektra's investments in Scandinavia and eastern Germany, he believes it is a long-term project.

A joint statement reiterated their shared concern about the evolution of a Kurdish state, despite repeated assurances from the Kurdish leadership that it does not seek to divide Iraq. Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iranian foreign minister, said the situation in the Kurdish regions was chaotic, with a total absence of responsible government, despite the election of a Kurdish assembly in May. Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkish foreign minister, warned the situation 'should not become consolidated or legalised'. In the run-up to the Gulf war, Turkish President Turgut Ozal had warned Syria and Iran not to exploit the power vacuum if Iraq was defeated. The latest meeting is the first time Turkey has broken ranks with its western allies by seeking a common stance with its regional neighbours on the Kurdish issue. Iran and Syria both expressed concern about the 'interference' of outside powers, an apparent reference to the air exclusion zone over Kurdish areas provided by British, French and US aircraft flying out of Turkish bases. The UK has proposed a meeting to discuss an extension of the operation, which must be approved again by the Turkish parliament this year. It is certain to be discussed during Turkish Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's visit to London next week. Turkey, like Iran and Syria, fears moves to establish a separate Kurdish state could fuel separatist tendencies among its own Kurdish minorities. Turkey is also concerned that the security provided by the allies has allowed the Kurds to further their political goals. Turkey is to link its electricity power grid to Iran's, in a further move aimed at strengthening Turkey's economic links with its neighbours. Turkish and Iranian officials meeting in Tehran decided to join their power lines within two months, according to Turkey's official Anatolian news agency. The project follows a protocol signed in Damascus in October to create a common grid among Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq. Turkey is close to agreeing financing for a 692MW hydro-power plant at Biricek on the Euphrates which will provide electricity to Aleppo in Syria - the first leg of this five-country project.

Minasligas reported the replacement cost of monthly electricity for the month in which the bill was received. Each month's bill reflects the cost of electricity purchased in the prior month. Therefore, the reported replacement cost of electricity is understated since it lags the actual cost by one month. We have corrected for this understatement by matching each month's bill with the month that it covered.       Comment 19:     Petitioners contend that Minasligas's allocation of GA expenses is incorrect. (Minasligas allocated monthly GA expenses to individual products based upon the number of furnaces used in the production of each product.) Petitioners contend that the Department should allocate GA expenses to total COGS as was done in the preliminary results.   Minasligas contends that a larger portion of its operation is devoted to ferrosilicon than to silicon metal. Minasligas contends that allocating GA expenses to total COGS overstates the amount of GA expenses relating to silicon metal.       Department's Position:     We agree with petitioners. GA expenses are period expenses which relate to the operation of the company as a whole and are not customarily associated with a particular product or process. Therefore, we recalculated GA expenses on a company-wide annual historical basis and, in order to avoid overstating GA expenses and to neutralize hyperinflationary effects, we applied the GA ratio to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis.       Comment 20:     Petitioners contend that the Department should calculate Minasligas's interest expense as the consolidated expenses of Minasligas and Delp Engenharia S.A. (Delp). Petitioners note that Delp controls over 93 percent of Minasligas's common stock and thus has a controlling interest in Minasligas. Petitioners suggest that the Department use Delp's 1991 and 1992 financial statements to perform this calculation.   Minasligas contends that Delp and Minasligas are separate entities, maintain separate financial statements, and have their own interest expense and income. Therefore, Minasligas asserts that it would be improper to calculate interest expense on a consolidated basis.       Department's Position:     We agree with petitioners that Minasligas should report interest expense on a consolidated basis. See our response to comment 2.   In the case of Minasligas, Delp does not consolidate its accounts with Minasligas. In addition, because there are no significant intercompany transactions between the two companies, we combined the financial expenses of the two companies and calculated an interest expense as a ratio to cost of sales, effectively creating consolidated accounts. The Department only allows income generated from investments of working capital, which the company documents as short-term in nature, to offset interest expense (see,     e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Cellular Mobile Telephones from Japan,     54 FR 45447, 45455 (October 31, 1985), and     Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan,     55 FR 335, 342 (January 4, 1990)). Minasligas was able to substantiate only a portion of the investments to be short-term; consequently, we have allowed only the documented portion of interest income as an offset. We did not allow an offset to Minasligas's parent, Delp, for interest expense because the information required to substantiate such an adjustment is not contained in the record of this review.   In order to avoid overstating financing charges, we applied the interest expense ratio (    i.e.,     the ratio of net interest expense to cost of goods sold) to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis rather than to amounts computed under the replacement cost basis. This is consistent with the methodology used in the remand determination in the underlying investigation.       Comment 21:     Petitioners contend that Minasligas did not submit information regarding short-term interest income at the consolidated, parent company level. Accordingly, the petitioners contend that it is not feasible to ``compute interest expense using the sum of Minasligas's and Delp's financial expenses adjusted for intercompany interest transactions'', as suggested by the Department's cost verification report. Finally, petitioners assert that the Department should apply this allocation to COM to properly account for Brazilian hyperinflation.       Department's Position:     We agree with petitioners that the record does not contain information regarding short-term interest income at Minasligas's parent company, Delp. Accordingly, we have not allowed any such offset for Delp's interest income in our calculation of combined interest expense. Consistent with our practice in the     Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Fair Value; Ferrosilicon from Brazil,     59 FR 732, 736737, January 6, 1994, we have applied the calculated interest expense ratio to the monthly COMs calculated on a historical basis rather than amounts computed under the replacement cost basis.       Comment 22:     Petitioners contend that Minasligas's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses is flawed because Minasligas failed to properly ``layer'' inventory according to the month that the merchandise was placed in inventory. Petitioners contend that Minasligas's calculation reflects one level of inventory even though Minasligas held merchandise in inventory for at least two preceding months. Petitioners contend that this flaw makes Minasligas's calculation unusable. Accordingly, petitioners contend that the Department should disregard Minasligas's calculation, and make no adjustment for inventory holding gain or loss in the final COP calculations.       Department's Position:     We agree with petitioners. Minasligas's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses did not account for merchandise that spent multiple months in inventory.

Short of its own oil, gas and coal, France was crippled by the first 1973 oil shock. One of the first actions of Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, on becoming president a year later, was to launch the most ambitious nuclear energy programme in western Europe, continued with little change over the past 11 years by his successor, President Francois Mitterrand. By the turn of this decade, up to 80 per cent of France's electricity was nuclear-generated, making France the most nuclear-dependent country in the world and the second biggest producer of nuclear electricity after the US. Since then, the proportion has dipped slightly, to 72 per cent last year, as some of the earliest power stations neared the end of their lives. Nuclear energy represents 37 per cent of overall energy consumption, still the highest of any western industrialised nation. Over the long term, Electricite de France (EdF), the monopoly power supply, wants to keep nuclear energy at around 75 per cent of electricity production, partly to keep a balance with other power sources such as oil and hydroelectricity but also because EdF's government owner needs to take account, more than ever before, of the rising influence of France's two ecology movements, the Verts and Generation Ecologie (GE). The ecologists do not deny that France needs secure energy supplies, but they do force the government to be extremely cautious over how the nuclear programme is to develop. The ecologists' problem, however, is that they are deeply split and they are both unsure whether they want to make an alliance with a mainstream party, let alone which one. Nowhere are the divisions between GE and the Verts deeper than on energy policy. GE, led by Mr Brice Lalonde, a former environment minister in the Socialist government, wants a moratorium on new nuclear plant - not too far out of line with government policy - and permanent closure of a controversial 1200 MW fast breeder reactor at Creys-Malville near Lyon. Mr Antoine Waechter, head of the Verts, wants all nuclear plants closed within 15 years, an idea dismissed by the government as outrageously impractical. Mr Waechter repeatedly refuses GE overtures for a merger, on the grounds that this would be selling out to the moderate establishment. The government's attitude to the ecologists is being tested as it agonises over the future of Superphenix, the fast breeder at Creys-Malville. The reactor, the world's most powerful of its type, was closed in July 1990 after repeated safety problems and the government has said it will decide, in the light of independent technical advice, on its future by July 3. In spite of France's determined reliance on its own nuclear energy, it remains even more dependent on oil than Britain or Germany, which have bigger coal and gas resources. This is why the government continues to keep a firm hold of the two state owned oil companies, Elf Aquitaine and Total, in spite of its recent privatisation programme. At both companies, the emphasis is on increasing reserves. Total is concentrating its sights on the Middle East for Total, where it is the largest western oil producer, while Elf has ambitions in Kazakhstan and Russia, where it recently become the first western oil company to sign production sharing deals.

0,FT911-3063 ,"FT911-3063 _AN-BDZA8AC9FT 910426   FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: The power of a public sector hero - Endesa's future under Spain's electricity shake-up      By PETER BRUCE   SPAIN'S big private sector electricity generators have nightmares about Mr Feliciano Fuster trampling over their territory with the might of the state behind him. Mr Fuster, a 66-year-old Mallorcan industrial engineer, is president of Endesa, the state-controlled electricity utility that commands nearly a quarter of Spain's generating capacity. He is a hero in the public sector and the central figure in a sweeping and increasingly combative reorganisation of Spanish utilities by the government. He is irritated that two of his biggest private sector rivals, Hidrola and Iberduero, are thinking about merging in order to confront the reorganisation ordered by Madrid. 'It would not promote competition,' he says. 'In fact, it would be against competition. I cannot compete with a group that has practically all the (low-cost) hydroelectric capacity in the country.' Spain's electricity is generated by more than 20 companies, many of them small with tiny regional distribution rights. Most own only a half or a third of a power plant. Because tariffs have been unified, the government has had to erect a frighteningly complex compensation system where low-cost producers pay out to high-cost rivals according to standard asset values held by the companies. The reorganisation 'which uses the new British model as a form of confirmation', says Mr Fuster, is designed to create just a few large generators. 'The efficiency of the sector has not been exactly fantastic,' he says, pointing out that the industry has short and long-term debts of around Dollars 40bn, even though final tariffs are roughly similar to other European countries. 'We are a collection of geographic monopolies. Why should the sector stay as it is simply because it has traditionally been that way?' If that sounds defensive, it is. Endesa has been fiercely criticised for abandoning its role as a wholesale power supplier to the private utilities, which are obliged to buy some of their power at a rate fixed by the government. In 1989, it bought 9.2 per cent of Sevillana, the Andalucian generator and distributor. Earlier this year it bought 80 per cent of Electra de Viesgo in northern Spain, and smaller packages of shares in Union Fenosa, also in the north, and Fecsa, the Catalan utility. The president of one Spanish bank with large holdings in the sector says this amounts to little more than the nationalisation of the industry. Nonsense, says Mr Fuster. 'If we wanted to control Sevillana we would have bought it. What do they accuse us of? Buying 10 per cent of Sevillana? Banco Bilbao Vizcaya bought 10 per cent just after us and no one said a thing. We bought that stake because we and Sevilla have a lot of business together.' 'We should not be talking about whether we are public sector or private sector. We should be talking about whether we are efficient or not. Endesa is not the state. We are a company in which the state holds a 75 per cent stake. (The other 25 per cent was floated in Spain and New York three years ago). We are not nationalising. We are offering public sector management.' That management has not served Endesa badly. It is the state holding company, the Instituto de Industria's (INI), most profitable company, earning some Pta80bn (Dollars 741m) after tax last year. The fact that Endesa, when it was the sector's ugly duckling, was forced to concentrate on coal-fired thermal power, while the private sector was allowed to build hydro-electrical and nuclear plants, has been turned on its head. Even independent analysts believe it is the most specialised and efficient thermal power generator in the country now. However the carping from the private sector will not go away, largely because Mr Fuster's acquisitions have placed Endesa in a strong position to head one of the two or three groups - he would rather see Hidrola and Iberduero each controlling a separate combine - that emerge from the reorganisation. Any reorganisation of the sector will involve a huge interchange of assets between the final sector leaders in order to ensure they have roughly similar production mixes. Holding on to 11.5 per cent of Fecsa, 5.7 per cent of Union Fenosa, and 9.2 per cent of Sevillana means Endesa has something to swap. Viesgo, Mr Fuster says, will probably be sold on again as part of an asset swap. Whatever the private sector and its banking partners do, Endesa is probably unstoppable. Mr Fuster and the government are convinced that larger generating companies will allow the industry to cut costs and replace over-regulation with real competition.

Consumers owe the  industry more than 2 trillion rubles. Nonetheless, our unique  power complex continues to function smoothly, without  disruptions.    The 50-hertz reading on the central control panel of  Russia's  unified power grid indicates that the power grid is operating  stably. The stable operation is the result not just of good  equipment and the harmonious operation of the collective, but  also of credits, big credits. Will these, together with the  fairly steep interest rates, not have to be shouldered by  consumers next year?    [A.F. Dyakov, president of the ""Russia's Unified Power Grid""  Russian Joint Stock Company] The bill for the credits should be  footed by defaulters. In that case disciplined consumers would  be protected. Their electricity rates would remain unchanged.    [Omelchenko] Despite all the financial difficulties, new  capacities totaling 3,000,000 kW have been commissioned during  the current year. That is quite a lot. There are big plans  also for the coming year. Russo-German joint-production modern,  economical gas turbines are being assembled in St. Petersburg,  the North Caucasus, and Novgorod. Construction is continuing of  the state regional electric power stations at Khoro-Nor in Chita  Oblast, Nizhnevartovsk in Tyumen Oblast, and in Pskov, and also  the Severnaya Heat and Electric Power Station in Moscow.    Power engineers are paying a lot of attention to energy  saving. So, for example, the (?Cryocor) Joint Stock Company is  planning to commission a turbo-expander installation at the No.  21 Heat and Electric Power Station in the capital in the new  year. This installation converts the gas energy in trunk gas  pipelines into electricity and in addition produces cryogenic  products -- nitrogen, oxygen, argon, xenon, and so forth.    [Dyakov] We have 600 such power stations. So there is a  great deal of scope for employing these turbo-expanders as  energy-saving technologies.    [Omelchenko] You have a new control panel here at the  central control room. This is a showcase of the electronic  equipment which is operating in Russia's power grid today.    [Dyakov] What is important is not just the hardware but also  the software, and we have developed it ourselves.    [Omelchenko] The intellectual basis of the power industry is  being created by the sector's leading scientific research  institutes in cooperation with the Professor Solomatin Software  Institute.    [Dyakov] Thanks to our comprehensive collective we have been  able to operate reliably, and I hope that we will always be able  to operate reliably.     "
0,FT942-8487 ,"FT942-8487 _AN-EETCSACLFT 940520   FT  20 MAY 94 / Nuclear power review given wider scope: The new terms reflect persuasive lobbying      By MICHAEL SMITH   Nuclear Electric yesterday finally won its year-long battle to persuade the government that its privatisation should at least be considered. But it could be many years before it and Scottish Nuclear are in the private sector. Many observers believe they will remain state concerns for ever. When the government promised in 1989 to hold a review this year, it was assumed its main focus would be whether to lift the moratorium on building new capacity. Privatisation of nuclear power stations had, after all, just been withdrawn because the City said it would not buy them. The wide-ranging terms of reference announced yesterday appear to put privatisation back on the agenda, if only as a possibility later in the decade. The government's decision to consider it is in part a recognition of the extraordinary strides the industry has made in improving its efficiency. It is also testimony to the persuasive lobbying of Nuclear Electric, which wants to be free of ministerial interference and believes its only real chance of adding to its 11 operating stations is to get money from the private sector rather than a cash-strapped state. The Treasury likes the sound of its arguments. But the Department of Trade and Industry remembers the City's arguments of 1989: that the government would have to underwrite future costs which could arise from regulatory change and from decommissioning nuclear plants. It is also acutely aware of the political damage which could be inflicted on the government during a privatisation debate. Labour might be prepared to reconsider its opposition to building new nuclear power stations later this decade but it will remain implacably opposed to privatisation. The stance of environmentalists will also play a part in government thinking. Ms Bridget Woodman of the pressure group Greenpeace said yesterday her organisation would not oppose a simple privatisation as that might be the best way of ensuring that no more nuclear plants were built. But privatisation of the nuclear generation industry would be anything but simple, as Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, acknowledged yesterday when he said privatisation this side of an election was extremely unlikely. Few analysts believe that a privatisation of Nuclear Electric would be possible without a significant restructuring. Mr John Reynolds, analyst at James Capel, said yesterday the issue of liabilities from the six operating Magnox stations would have to be addressed, either by splitting them from the five advance gas cooled reactor stations and the soon-to-be-commissioned pressurised water reactor, or by agreeing fixed-price contracts with British Nuclear Fuels for reprocessing their fuel. 'Privatisation is possible but it would take a major effort of government will,' he said. But if early privatisation is unlikely, what about Nuclear Electric's plans to build a series of pressurised water reactors on the model provided by its Sizewell B reactor in Suffolk? It has already applied for planning permission to build another there. Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear are likely to argue that it cannot be left to the market, and in this they will play the environmental card. 'The UK will need to invest in new nuclear stations to ensure security and diversity of supply, and to meet its global environmental commitments,' Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, said yesterday. He said Sizewell C was the 'most cost-effective way of doing that'. Such claims will be attacked during the review by rival generators such as National Power and PowerGen, which are building stations capable of producing electricity at about 2.7p per kilowatt hour at present gas prices. Nuclear Electric says it can produce power at 2.9p per kilowatt hour and that the costs of the raw material - uranium - are less volatile than gas. Even that estimate makes what most people regard as extremely optimistic assumptions on costs of capital and potential load factors. More important, it is considerably higher than the price of electricity in the wholesale trading pool where the average price has been capped at 2.4p for the next two years. There is no guarantee that they will rise significantly above that level later in the decade. Even some industry executives accept that attracting investors to Sizewell C may therefore require some kind of intervention by the government. Although they are not specific, this could come in the form of underwriting liabilities; extending the nuclear levy on consumers beyond its proposed 1998 termination, or guaranteeing a fixed proportion of the power market for the nuclear industry. The Tory government would have to swallow pretty hard to accept any of these ideas, particularly when other energy sources appear to be in such plentiful supply. One possibility is that the government will conclude the review by telling the industry to see if it can attract private-sector funds to build new power stations, leaving a decision on the role the state should play until later in the decade.                          *      *      *  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         UK NUCLEAR INDUSTRY: CLEAN POWER BUT NOT WITHOUT TEARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- KEY DATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1945 Government decides to undertake atomic energy programme  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1947 Work begins on Windscale (now Sellafield) for military plutonium and energy programme developments.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1950 First Windscale reactor starts to produce military plutonium.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1955 Construction of fast reactor starts at Dounreay, Scotland  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1956 World's first commercial nuclear power station opens at Calder Hall, Windscale.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1957 Windscale fire.

Amrollahi: We are witnessing a psychological war  in the world by the news media of certain countries. If you  watched CNN a few days ago you would have seen that a CNN  correspondent came and asked one of the officials of our country  -- I think it was Mr. Kharrazi [Iran's permanent ambassador] in  the United Nations. He said: First, you have purchased  submarines? Second, You have increased your defense budget.  Third, you have nuclear capability. In other words, they have  a number of presuppositions. It does not matter what the  answers are. They only wish to instill certain ideas in the  minds of their listeners. We see this very clearly. At least,  I and all my colleagues feel this with all our being that they  are not after finding out the truth. They only wish to  indoctrinate those who are unfamiliar with our works, those in  foreign countries, and wish to tell them that Iran wishes to do  this or that.    I wish to ask a few questions of those who make such  insinuations: Have we not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty? Are we not a member of the IAEA? Do we not accept the  nuclear treaty of the IAEA [as heard]? Why does the usurping  Zionist regime not sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty?  Why does it not accept the IAEA's nuclear treaty? Why do they  not ask such questions of the latter? This shows that they have  some ulterior motives, and they wish to insinuate certain things  in the minds of the people abroad who are not in our country and  who are not reached by our mass media. In brief, let me say  that such hostile propaganda will have no effect on our work.  However, I do not deny that they will influence the minds of  the people who have nothing to do with us and who live outside  our borders. [passage omitted answering a question about a small  number of solar energy reactors which are planned for some  remote villages outside the electricity grid].    Announcer: There was a question about the use of  nuclear energy in Iran.    Amrollahi: See. All our people know more or less  that our most important aim is to complete our nuclear reactor  which we have, which is incomplete. Eighty percent of its work  is completed, and by today's estimate more than $10 billion has  been invested in it. In my view, in any country where there is  such an investment in a project eighty percent of which has been  completed, any sane person would try to complete it so as to  generate electricity by it. We have made this huge investment,  and the whole world knows that a nuclear reactor only produces  electricity. This is what we are after. Our country is short  of electricity and the best return on our investment is to  complete it and to make use of it.    Let me also answer the other question which was asked about  who is completing it. Unfortunately, the Germans fell short in  this connection. They did not help and did not finish this  project. They have kept us waiting for 14 or 15 years. Finally,  we signed a contract with Russia. Work has been started for  some time and they are finishing it. [passage omitted on history  of nuclear energy in Iran].    Announcer: Dr. Amrollahi, when do you think the  Bushehr reactor will be completed?    Amrollahi: God willing, according to the talks  which we have with the Russians, it will be definitely completed  in less than four years and will produce energy.    Announcer: Concerning [nuclear] disarmament --  although of course we cannot call it disarmament, let us say  about nonproliferation -- Dr. Ayatollahi and Dr. Mashayekhi can  you please tell us something in this connection?    Ayatollahi: [passage omitted on the dangers of  nuclear weapons for the environment, the use of atomic weapons  at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the nonproliferation treaty;  asserting that not only the countries which do not have nuclear  weapons should not produce them, but the big powers which also  have them should get rid of them]. Concerning this western  propaganda and the motivation behind that propaganda, all our  nation, every hezbollahi member of the society knows the truth.  However, let me refer to just one reason behind all this  propaganda. This is my own personal analysis, and I may be able  to produce some evidence for what I am saying.    After the collapse of the former Soviet Union the American  spy agency [CIA] was made bankrupt. This is why you see the CIA  director going to the U.S. Senate and beginning threats against  the Islamic Republic of Iran. He engages in this propaganda  claiming that the Islamic Republic of Iran is pursuing a policy  for the production of nuclear weapons and that Americans should  be vigilant. There he is trying to save himself from bankruptcy,  he wants to prevent the closure of his organization, he wishes  to safeguard the budget of his organization, and wishes to  safeguard his own prestige. At the same time, he wishes to  initiate a new propaganda line that the Islamic Republic of Iran  poses a threat.    Yes, Iran objects to the western democracy which is  following  a domineering policy in the world in such an absurd way. It  questions that system and threatens it with its logical  arguments. The whole world knows this. However, in an attempt  to cast aspersions on the Islamic Republic of Iran and to  distort the truth and achieve their goals at least in the short  term, they are engaged in this propaganda. Let me also say that  we do not pay any attention to all this propaganda. It will not  have the slightest effect upon the decisions of the Islamic  Republic of Iran and Iran's nuclear industry. We know that  their propaganda is flimsy and no one will believe them. The  IAEA is the only official international agency which is composed  of various nations and the Islamic Republic of Iran is also an  active member. That organization expresses its views. We have  also announced truthfully and bravely that we are not after such  a policy. From the outset we have believed that the policy of  [acquiring] nuclear weapons is wrong and we will not pursue a  wrong path. If you are suspicious and have some evidence for  your suspicion, come and inspect. We have no objection. So  far, they have also come. We have invited them. They have come  and inspected and have admitted and confessed [that Iran does  not have nuclear weapons]. The admission of this official  organization as an international authority as regards the  nuclear industry is sufficient for us, even though western media  engages in all sorts of propaganda.    Unidentified citizen: I would like to ask a  question about the role played by the country's Atomic Energy  Organization in supplying our electricity requirement? I would  also like to ask what happened to the Bushehr nuclear power  station, and will it boost the power generation when it is  completed?    Mashayekhi: Bushehr nuclear power station  comprises two 1250 megawatt units. It was started by the  Germans before the revolution and it was 85 percent complete  during the last days of the Shah's regime. Unfortunately it was  abandoned by the German side. [passage omitted giving reasons  for interruption of the project during the Iran-Iraq war].    Today we are trying to reach an agreement with the Russian  Government to complete the project. Of course work has started  already and the Russians are studying the project so as to  install their own equipment. God willing we will then see  completion of the first project during the coming years. We can  probably begin the operation of our first nuclear power station  in four years time.    Announcer: God willing. Is it economical to  depend on nuclear energy in Iran?    Mashayekhi: The world has answered this question  already. You witness that most of the world countries are today  striving to expand their nuclear power stations to generate  electricity. Fossil fuel pollutes the environment and will run  out. The world in the 21st century will have to face the  problem of generating its electricity requirement by nuclear  power. We are also one of those countries which should make the  necessary investment today. [passage omitted]. The Supreme  Energy Council has approved that we should supply 20 percent of  the country's energy requirements by nuclear power stations.    Amrollahi: I wish to conclude the discussion by  mentioning something about our proposal for the creation of a  nuclear free-zone. The Islamic Republic of Iran is pursuing  this proposal every year and has been doing so for a number of  years. It is appropriate to mention here that the regional  countries are siding with us gradually on this issue. The only  real saboteur of this proposal is the regime occupying  Jerusalem. May God's peace and mercy be upon you all.     "

This is how the situation  was described by participants of an extraordinary meeting of the  Council of the Maritime Trade Union Federation and the  Coordination Committee for Joint Actions, which took place here  today. The meeting discussed the extraordinary situation in the  territory, which is deteriorating with every passing day.    More than one-third of the territory's production capacities  have already come to a standstill. The number of unemployed has  topped 10,000, according to official figures. Unofficial  sources claim their number is five times bigger.    The average monthly cost of a basket of 19 staple foodstuffs  now equals to 100,000 rubles in the maritime territory as  against 46,000 rubles in the Russian capital and in the rest of  the country. According to the most modest estimates, forty per  cent of the territory's population are now below the poverty  line.    The cost of power-carriers is growing and the sum of default  payments has grown to astronomic figures due to this. For  instance, the local enterprises owe only ""Dalenergo"" (far  eastern power society) as much as 200 billion rubles. The main  power supplier is on the verge of bankruptcy. It has no money  even to carry out current repairs and to prepare for the winter  season.    The cost of coal has increased. The local consumers were  compelled to give up using imported and liquid fuel. The local  resources, which have to be regularly augmented, have diminished  to a critical level. The participants of the meeting pointed  out that the Russian government, overlooking the region's  specific features, was continuing to increase taxes and tariffs  on electricity, thereby contributing to the boosting of  socio-economic tension in the maritime territory.    The centre's latest instruction to raise the cost of one  kilowatt of electricity makes the situation in the territory  simply explosive. This view was shared by the heads of urban  and district administrations of the territory, executives and  managers.    In their opinion, preferential tariffs for electricity  should  be fixed to pull the maritime territory out of the social, fuel  and power crisis. They also called for the territory's  inclusion in the list of regions of the far north and  application to it of the law on privileges to their population,  paid from the federal budget. Moreover, they believe it is  necessary to change the taxation system by differentiating it  and substantially reducing the taxes on profits, collected from  enterprises.    The meeting recommended Vladimir Ignatenko, the presidential  representative, to urgently inform Boris Yeltsin on the  situation in the maritime territory.     "

Bastos said that to repair the lines a program of rotational  cuts of between 20 and 30 minutes has been prepared.    In a news conference Bastos explained that last night,  between 1945 and 2120, three different acts of sabotage were  carried out on the power lines coming from the El Chocon and  Salto Grande dams, leaving some 800,000 people in this capital  and an unspecified number of inhabitants in the country's  interior without electricity.    Since repairing the damage will require between 24 and 48  hours, a plan of cuts in electricity service during ""peak""  consumption hours had to be implemented. Bastos denied that the  cuts could be extended until 31 December.    The secretary said the energy supply through a line that  links the Salto Grande hydroelectric dam with the locality of  Santo Tome, Corrientes Province, was interrupted at 1945 on 28  December. When the failure was investigated, it was discovered  that it was caused by a chain thrown on the high-tension power  line.    Later, at 2020, a second sabotage was carried out, this time  on a pylon for a power line from El Chocon, in a place called  Unanue, near the intersection of National Route 35 and  Provincial Route 215, La Pampa Province.    In this manner, the power supply was cut from one of the  lines that link the dam with the cities of Puelches (La Pampa)  and Henderson (Buenos Aires).    An hour later, at 2120, a third attack was recorded only 12  km from the site, on the other high-tension power line that runs  parallel to the first.    Bastos said that although the reasons are not known so far,  he did not rule out the possibility that the objective of these  attacks might be the ""disruption of the development of events in  the energy field or the total political environment"" in the  country.    ""So far we have no evidence to attribute the responsibility  for these attacks, but we fully rule out that they could have  been instigated by Light and Power Union leaders,"" Bastos said.    He added: ""Since the repair work will demand between 24 and  48 hours by the Transener company, it is probable that  rotational cuts will take place during peak hours, affecting 2  percent of the demand.""    The plan for cuts has been imposed because ""since the links  with the generating plants are cut, the distribution companies  are restricting the supply to preserve the system.""     "

0," FR940304-1-00092   FR940304-1-00014        Impacts on Utilities       Several comments addressed the Department's proposed analysis of the   impacts of energy conservation standards on electric utilities. Natural   Resources Defense Council stated that the utility analysis needs to consider   that under the base cases, there will be less forecasting certainty than would   occur under new and revised standards, and a greater probability that   utilities would misforecast electricity demand. (Natural Resources Defense   Council, No. 13 at 32). The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council also   suggested that the utility analysis should consider the value of reduced   uncertainty in utility forecasts as a result of standards. In addition, the   Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council gave references to a methodology. (Ohio   Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 6).   Increased demand certainty after standards is an effect that was not   captured in the utility analysis. It results in substantial benefits to   electric utilities, particularly when demand growth is rapid. These benefits   accrue because demand growth is uncertain, and if the utility misforecasts   demand, it may build too few or too many power plants. This risk of capital   misallocation can be substantial in certain cases.   With regard to the appropriate measure of dollars to use in the utility   impact analysis, Natural Resources Defense Council stated that ``DOE needs to   do the utility impact analysis in nominal dollar terms, using actual utility   assumptions for depreciation and rate of return. Utility rates and finances   are computed in nominal dollars, not real dollars, and this can have a   dramatic impact on how new power plant construction will affect rates.''   (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 32).   It is true that utilities calculate rates in nominal dollar terms. The   Department, therefore, calculated utility impacts in both real and nominal   dollars, in order to determine how adding an inflation factor would affect the   results.   With regard to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Pub. L. 101549,   November 15, 1990), Natural Resources Defense Council stated that utility   expansion plans will need to be consistent with the Act, which will require   more controls as the demand for electricity grows. Appliance standards will,   all other things being held equal, make compliance with the Clean Air   Amendments less expensive for utilities, as it allows them to meet the cap on   emissions more easily. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 32, 35).   The utility analysis and the environmental analysis are consistent with   the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The Department collected forecasts of the   value of marketable permits for sulfur, estimates of the other effects of the   Clean Air Act Amendments, and assessments of future utility generation by fuel   type. The Department assessed these estimates and assimilated them into the   analysis. (See Technical Support Document, Environmental Assessment, Section   2).   The Florida Energy Office stated that capacity cost credit (for avoided   capacity) should not be limited to combustion turbines but should match the   load characteristics of the subject appliance, categorized into peaking,   intermediate, and baseload groups. Air conditioners should be categorized   according to their load duration characteristics. (Florida Energy Office, No.   42, at 2).   The Department agrees that load shape characteristics should be included   in an assessment of air conditioner (and other appliances) avoided peak   demand. The current utility analysis accounted for these effects. The   Department investigated separating energy savings into peaking, intermediate,   and baseload categories, to determine if this would have a significant effect   on the results. The utility analysis assumed a combustion turbine proxy,   which values all peak demand savings at the cost of a combustion turbine.   This is the most widely used approach by U.S. utilities.   The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council stated that the utility   analysis should consider transmission and distribution capacity savings.   (Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 5).   The Department agrees that transmission and distribution capacity   savings should be included in the utility analysis, and did include them.   Avoided transmission and distribution costs were based on the value assigned   to this avoided transmission and distribution capacity by many different U.S.   utilities.   Two commentators stated that off-peak water heaters (those that heat   water only during off-peak hours) save energy, and that this should be   included in the utility analysis. (National Regional Electric Cooperative   Association, No. 17 at 1; Vaughn Manufacturing Company, No. 75 at 1).   In response, the Department notes that where utilities offer time-of-day   rates, the economics of off-peak water heating change dramatically and may be   very attractive. However, the Department does not have the authority to   require utilities to offer such rates, and believes the lack of these rates   offered nation-wide precludes consideration of off-peak water heaters in a   national standard.     Several comments discussed the impacts of appliance conservation   standards on natural gas utilities. The Washington Gas Light, Inc. urged the   Department to dedicate a similar level of analytical effort to the utility   cost consequences of standards on natural gas appliances as it devotes to   impacts on electric utilities from standards on electric appliances.   (Washington Gas Light, Inc., No. 37 at 12).   The Department initially studied the potential impacts of standards on   electric utilities and not natural gas utilities because there were more   abundant data on the former. Furthermore, significantly more residential   energy consumption is electricity rather than natural gas.                "," FR940304-1-00092   FR940304-1-00014        Impacts on Utilities       Several comments addressed the Department's proposed analysis of the   impacts of energy conservation standards on electric utilities. Natural   Resources Defense Council stated that the utility analysis needs to consider   that under the base cases, there will be less forecasting certainty than would   occur under new and revised standards, and a greater probability that   utilities would misforecast electricity demand. (Natural Resources Defense   Council, No. 13 at 32). The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council also   suggested that the utility analysis should consider the value of reduced   uncertainty in utility forecasts as a result of standards. In addition, the   Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council gave references to a methodology. (Ohio   Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 6).   Increased demand certainty after standards is an effect that was not   captured in the utility analysis. It results in substantial benefits to   electric utilities, particularly when demand growth is rapid. These benefits   accrue because demand growth is uncertain, and if the utility misforecasts   demand, it may build too few or too many power plants. This risk of capital   misallocation can be substantial in certain cases.   With regard to the appropriate measure of dollars to use in the utility   impact analysis, Natural Resources Defense Council stated that ``DOE needs to   do the utility impact analysis in nominal dollar terms, using actual utility   assumptions for depreciation and rate of return. Utility rates and finances   are computed in nominal dollars, not real dollars, and this can have a   dramatic impact on how new power plant construction will affect rates.''   (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 32).   It is true that utilities calculate rates in nominal dollar terms. The   Department, therefore, calculated utility impacts in both real and nominal   dollars, in order to determine how adding an inflation factor would affect the   results.   With regard to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Pub. L. 101549,   November 15, 1990), Natural Resources Defense Council stated that utility   expansion plans will need to be consistent with the Act, which will require   more controls as the demand for electricity grows. Appliance standards will,   all other things being held equal, make compliance with the Clean Air   Amendments less expensive for utilities, as it allows them to meet the cap on   emissions more easily. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 32, 35).   The utility analysis and the environmental analysis are consistent with   the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The Department collected forecasts of the   value of marketable permits for sulfur, estimates of the other effects of the   Clean Air Act Amendments, and assessments of future utility generation by fuel   type. The Department assessed these estimates and assimilated them into the   analysis. (See Technical Support Document, Environmental Assessment, Section   2).   The Florida Energy Office stated that capacity cost credit (for avoided   capacity) should not be limited to combustion turbines but should match the   load characteristics of the subject appliance, categorized into peaking,   intermediate, and baseload groups. Air conditioners should be categorized   according to their load duration characteristics. (Florida Energy Office, No.   42, at 2).   The Department agrees that load shape characteristics should be included   in an assessment of air conditioner (and other appliances) avoided peak   demand. The current utility analysis accounted for these effects. The   Department investigated separating energy savings into peaking, intermediate,   and baseload categories, to determine if this would have a significant effect   on the results. The utility analysis assumed a combustion turbine proxy,   which values all peak demand savings at the cost of a combustion turbine.   This is the most widely used approach by U.S. utilities.   The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council stated that the utility   analysis should consider transmission and distribution capacity savings.   (Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 5).   The Department agrees that transmission and distribution capacity   savings should be included in the utility analysis, and did include them.   Avoided transmission and distribution costs were based on the value assigned   to this avoided transmission and distribution capacity by many different U.S.   utilities.   Two commentators stated that off-peak water heaters (those that heat   water only during off-peak hours) save energy, and that this should be   included in the utility analysis. (National Regional Electric Cooperative   Association, No. 17 at 1; Vaughn Manufacturing Company, No. 75 at 1).   In response, the Department notes that where utilities offer time-of-day   rates, the economics of off-peak water heating change dramatically and may be   very attractive. However, the Department does not have the authority to   require utilities to offer such rates, and believes the lack of these rates   offered nation-wide precludes consideration of off-peak water heaters in a   national standard.

0,FT944-10922 ,"FT944-10922 _AN-EKHDPAH5FT 941108   FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (25): Battle against black-outs - Foreign groups join drive to electrification      By GORDON CRAMB   For Mr R Vasudevan, power secretary in the Indian government, there are 'no push-button solutions' to the country's electricity shortages. Achieving the needed output, he says, will require 'a long gestation period'. His vision is helping bring private operators, including foreign companies, into an industry which until now has often been politically manipulated by state and central governments. A parliamentary and legal challenge held up agreement on the first flagship project, a Dollars 2bn plant being built by Enron of the US to supply Bombay. At issue was central government's right to grant guarantees that the State Electricity Board (SEB) in Maharashtra, of which Bombay is the capital, would pay for the power it received. Without these, Enron said it could not raise financing for the facility. The way the power ministry has conducted negotiations with prospective entrants has won praise even from beyond their ranks. The task ahead, though, is enormous. Growth in installed capacity for power generation has averaged 6 per cent annually since independence and currently stands at some 77,000MW. Mr Vasudevan told an energy summit convened in Madras in August by the Confederation of Indian Industry that 'the capacity addition as planned is short of the need-based requirements and, what is more disturbing, even the achievement of this target is dogged by serious resource constraints'. In short, public sector suppliers are at best treading water - capacity being added is enough only to keep pace with economic growth rather than redress structural shortages, and many SEBs do not have the capital to meet expansion commitments envisaged under the current five-year plan which runs to March 1997. Overall power shortages are around 10 per cent, with unmet demand at peak times nearly double that. Private sector involvement, largely foreign, is seen as the only escape from 'load shedding', the intermittent blackouts experienced daily by virtually all businesses and households. Only key government installations and export industries in some states are protected. According to Mr Vasudevan, a programme to bring reliable electricity to all India would mean additional capacity of 142,000MW by 2007, nearly trebling the available total. He agrees with private sector estimates that making a start on this will require at least Dollars 6bn a year worth of plants over the next five years. The largest project so far agreed is a Dollars 12.7bn plan by an offshoot of Mr Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong to provide an eventual 10,560MW of capacity through two coal-fired plants in a deal with Powergrid, a central government agency. The first of these 16 units is to come on stream by early 1999, with full operation scheduled for 2003. Powergrid is a minority supplier to SEBs, and India does not yet have a national grid, though one is intended to evolve as part of the restructuring of the sector. In the short term, three main ways in which the centre is seeking to improve power availability by getting the most out of existing capacity are: encouraging demand-side management, limiting transmission and distribution losses, and increasing power station efficiency. But each of these runs up against entrenched attitudes at the SEBs, which currently provide three quarters of the country's power, and at the offices of their political masters in state capitals. First, the tariff structure does not sufficiently steer larger users into making optimal use of off-peak periods, and many smaller commercial customers, notably farmers, are supplied at a loss. Second, some 23 per cent of generated electricity disappears before it reaches the customer, commonly through illegal link-ups, and few governments are prepared to arouse the ire of slum dwellers by severing their pirate lines. Third, headway has been made in improving use of installed capacity (official figures show that average plant load factor, a measure of this, rose from 57 per cent to 61 per cent last year) but such an improvement may not be sustainable without spending on modernisation by the cash-strapped SEBs. That would have to form part of a programme for the longer run, one which also offers opportunities to foreign suppliers. States are turning towards schemes whereby they lease an uneconomic facility to a private operator which upgrades it and, where required, eventually returns it to public hands. Mr S Sangameswaran of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering combine, estimates that the market for modernisation could itself deliver 30,000MW in extra capacity. He enumerates several areas of concern for developers entering the Indian market. Prime among these are the tardiness in establishing a transparent bidding and evaluation procedure for projects, together with a complex and slow decision-making process. Under the Indian constitution, electricity is the dual responsibility of the centre and the states. The two levels of government are seldom of one mind on priorities or cost, and SEBs are not conducting open tenders. Furthermore, the sheer number of projects now being contemplated - 86 at latest count - may lead to a dilution of efforts. Mr Vasudevan admits his department has had problems even processing the proposals. Duties on imported equipment stand at 20 per cent, although these have been reduced sharply from a previous 85 per cent. ABB is in talks with Delhi to take over a government boilermaking factory and is planning to build turbine generators at a greenfield site, aiming to produce its first Indian-made machinery by 1997-98. A main plank in the government's efforts to improve supply is a greater reliance on hydroelectric generation. Officials estimate that only a fifth of a potential 84,000MW capacity is being exploited, and wish to increase the contribution of hydropower to some 40 per cent of the total from a current 28 per cent. This will depend to some extent on the fate of the country's flagship Narmada Dam project in central India, which has been reviled by aid agencies because it would entail uprooting of thousands of rural communities. Although the World Bank has withdrawn support, Narmada remains on the drawing board. On a different level, the World Bank in July cancelled Dollars 750m in power loans to a small number of SEBs because of their poor financial performance. There were little or no knock-on effects on other projects, and in the past year half a dozen states have agreed to reform their power regimes with World Bank help. But Mr Heinz Vergin, head of the Bank's India department, was quoted as describing some of the local remedies for the SEBs' ills as 'Band-Aids'. No wonder central guarantees were sought, and are being granted, for the first seven large, fast-track projects in which foreign companies are involved. While foreign operators fret about the remaining risks, such as construction delays and cost overruns, nationalist politicians maintain that too much has been given away.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               ANNUAL ELECTRICITY OUTPUT 1950-93 (BN KWH)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Year        Hydro   Thermal    Nuclear     Non-utility     Total  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1950-51      2.5       2.6        -            1.5          6.6 1960-61      7.8       9.1        -            3.2         20.1 1970-71     25.2      28.2      2.4            5.4         61.2 1980-81     46.5      61.3      3.0            8.4        119.3 1990-91     71.7     186.8      6.1           24.1        288.7 1991-92     72.5     208.6      5.6           27.5        314.2 1992-93     69.8     224.4      6.7           30.0        330.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Asea Brown Boveri  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

The only alternative to them is a regime of total international  confidence. This is stated in a report of the Russian  delegation submitted to the 27th conference of the Japanese  atomic industrial forum underway here. The report has been  drawn up by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. It believes  that the Russian nuclear complex which is experiencing difficult  times should export more electricity generated by nuclear power  plants and should heavier rely on the export of technologies and  a number of materials. It should be open to international  cooperation.    In view of the unstable situation in the world, while  nuclear  disarmament is in progress, the complex of nuclear arms is under  certain obligations, says the report. More stable, easier  verifiable and predictable strategic arms systems should be  preserved while surplus, morally and obsolete provocatively  dangerous kinds of nuclear arms should be eliminated.    Russia spends up to one thousand billion roubles a year to  dismantle such armaments, according to the information of the  Ministry of Atomic Energy. The basic stocks of arms are worn to  over 50 per cent. A large-scale modernisation is required in  keeping with contemporary demands, also in order to dismantle  and utilise nuclear arms.    The Ministry of Atomic Energy regards as a way out a broader  use of vast scientific and technological potential accumulated  over the decades of the development of the atomic industry.  ``In addition to large state investment, Russia's participation  in the market of high technologies and scientific and  technological progress with drawing foreign capital in  reasonable and mutually advantage proportion would be useful to  all sides,'' says the report. ``The ministry annually receives  80 million dollars of additional financing for scientific and  technological projects. As a result of external financing of  projects carried out at enterprises of the Ministry of Atomic  Energy with the subsequent joint use.''    The new generation of nuclear power and thermal stations  with  fuel recycling and deactivation of waste, including slow-neutron  and fast-neutron reactors with the use of uranium-plutonium fuel  and the uranium-thorium cycle also requires considerable  outlays. These power plants will be much more safer because of  features of their design including an uncontrolled chain  reaction of nuclei. Russia views as an additional source of  investment into the area the expansion of the export of  electricity generated by nuclear power plants, of equipment and  fuel for power plants, including products for the utilisation of  weapon-grade uranium and plutonium, as well as rare-earth  metals, medical isotopes and high-calory fertilizer which are  produced in the framework in the nuclear complex. This  investment will reach one billion dollars this year.     "

Although theoretically, any one furnace could be used to produce any of the products that CBCC sells, this does not make the furnaces fungible. The Department's determination should not be based on what could theoretically be produced in a furnace, but rather what was actually produced in each furnace. Regardless, if the Department considers the furnaces fungible, this would result in a lowering of CBCC's depreciation expense as furnaces one through six are fully depreciated.         DOC Position:     We agree with CBCC. Its methodology of matching furnace depreciation with the product actually produced in each furnace is an acceptable methodology. Accordingly, no adjustment has been made for the final determination.         Comment 9:     Petitioners claim that at verification CBCC's reported consumption and cost of electricity attributed to FeSi were understated for October 1992. Therefore, petitioners believe that the Department should increase these costs for each month of the POI.     CBCC maintains that the Department verified that only the month of October contained an error of 5.7 percent with respect to the electricity consumption and cost; such error was incurred in transferring expenses from one cost report to another. Thus, CBCC concedes only that the Department should adjust its October, 1992, electricity consumption and cost by 5.7 percent, rather than making monthly adjustments.         DOC Position:     We agree with CBCC. At verification we established that this was an isolated error and not a methodological problem.

Accordingly, petitioners believe that the reported values cannot be relied on for purposes of the final determination and the Department should apply BIA.

With respect to the inventory holding gain/loss calculation for iron ore, the Department verified that CBCC maintains no more than its immediate requirements in inventory. Thus, CBCC submitted no inventory holding gain/loss information on this raw material because there is none. CBCC's monthly purchase of iron ore is consumed during that month.         DOC Position:     We agree with respondent. In reporting on a FIFO basis, CBCC followed prescribed Department practice. The Department verified that CBCC had no gain or loss on the iron ore because it completely consumed its purchases in the same month as production.

0,FT944-17484 ,"FT944-17484 _AN-EJGDBAF8FT 941007   FT  07 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Magma bid wins Peruvian copper prize      By SALLY BOWEN      LIMA   Tintaya, Peru's second biggest copper producer and owner of the country's highest-grade copper deposits, was sold at a keenly-contested auction in Lima yesterday. After seven bids were received, Tintaya was knocked down to Magma Copper of Tucson, Arizona for Dollars 218m plus Dollars 55m in Peruvian secondary debt paper. Magma's winning bid was just Dollars 4m ahead of its nearest rival Metall Mining Corporation of Toronto. The third highest offer of Dollars 191.6m came from Britain's RTZ. The minimum set by Peru's privatisers was Dollars 60m cash, an investment commitment of Dollars 85m plus a fixed Dollars 55m in debt paper taken at face value. Tintaya will be Magma's first operating unit outside the US. Company representatives at the sale called the mine - at 4,100m above sea level in the department of Cuzco, some 400 miles south-east of the capital Lima - 'a wonderful opportunity'. They said the company was 'extremely confident about operating in Peru'. The sale of Tintaya marks another milestone in Peru's aggressive privatisation process. It is the first time debt paper has been used as part of the purchase price. Under new legislation, bidders may choose between offering a fixed amount of secondary debt or a cash equivalent. The same procedure will be followed with next month's sell-off of the Cajamarquilla zinc refinery. Tintaya's new owner faces a major investment commitment, which may be well in excess of the minimum Dollars 85m over five years specified in the conditions for bidding. Reserves in the main open-pit mine - where ore averages 2.04 per cent copper - are down below 12m tonnes and will run out in around three years. Development of as-yet untouched but highly promising surrounding deposits will be a matter of urgency. Three of these - Chabuca Este, Chabuca Sur and Coroccohuayco - together have some 56.5m proven reserves averaging around 2.3 per cent copper, higher than Tinataya's main mine. In addition, Tintaya has some 10m tonnes of oxide ore already mined and stockpiled ready for leaching. The Tintaya processing plant is one of Peru's most modern and most ecologically sound. Expanded, it could serve other privately-owned mines in the same area. Water supply is abundant and electricity seems not to be a problem. Privatisation should bring happier times for Tintaya. It is often cited as a choice example of state mismanagement of a prime asset, having posted losses consistently since coming on stream in 1985, despite being well-designed and equipped. Next on Peru's mining privatisation agenda is the zinc refinery of Cajamarquilla, located in the province of Lima and less than 40km from the port of Callao. The sale date has been set for November 4 and the privatisers are asking for Dollars 40m in debt paper and a minimum of Dollars 120m in cash (Dollars 8m on signature of contract and the remainder in deferred quotas). There is also an immediate investment commitment of Dollars 20m. Cajamarquilla is one of just half a dozen zinc refineries in the Latin American continent. It was constructed by Sybetra of Belgium at a cost of Dollars 309m and started operations in 1981. Installed capacity is 101,500 tonnes of refined zinc and under normal conditions the plant produces at between 90 and 95 per cent of that. Last year's sales topped Dollars 85m, with zinc ingots accounting for Dollars 70m. Cajamarquilla also produces up to 180,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid - which brought in Dollars 4.4m last year. Fourteen companies have pre-qualified for the purchase, two of them Peruvian operations that buy zinc for industrial transformation. The front runner looks to be Canada's Cominco, which has associated with Marubeni of Japan. There is considerable scope for increasing local zinc refining capacity. Peru is the world's fourth largest zinc producer behind Canada, the former Soviet Union and Australia. But only a third of the 600,000 tonnes of concentrates produced annually in Peru is refined inside the country. Until recently, unreliable electricity supply made expansion possibilities remote. Not-infrequent droughts have always meant unavoidable cuts in production. But under Peru's new liberal economic regime, privatisation of the energy sector is already under way. The new owner of Cajamarquilla will be free to contract electricity supply from either the recently-privatised Lima distribution system, or directly from a privately-owned and operated generating plant in the hinterland. 'This will mean a revolution for Cajamarquilla,' said Mr Carlos Malaga, the refinery's general manager. After rationalisation, which has halved the workforce from 1990's high of 1,100, Cajamarquilla looks a leaner and more efficient operation. In 1993 production costs were Dollars 712 a tonne, with still-high energy costs. If zinc prices hold firm, next month should see another successful privatisation.

Those technologies were determined to have negligible water or solid waste impacts, as discussed in the previous     Federal Register     notice (56 FR 5488).   In the proposed NSPS, activated carbon injection is the technological basis for controlling Hg emissions. Activated carbon injection does not produce a wastewater stream, and it would have a negligible solid waste impact.   As with the 1991 NSPS, the EPA concludes that MWC ash disposal is adequately addressed by waste management standards so that considerations of ash quality do not play a role in this rulemaking.       3. Energy Impacts       The energy impact of applying acid gas/PM controls to small plants and applying Hg controls to both small and large MWC plants will result in a total national energy increase of about 27 gigawatt hours per year (GW-hr/yr) of electricity. No increase in the use of natural gas is anticipated.   Many of the small plants covered under today's proposal produce steam that is used to generate electricity for sale. For example, a typical 100 Mg/day MWC plant would generate about 12 GW-hr/yr of electricity. Such an MWC would require additional energy to operate pollution control equipment. The required energy would be about 0.7 GW-hr/yr of electricity, which has a relatively small impact on energy generated at the plant (about 6 percent of energy generated).         4. Control Cost Impacts       The EPA estimates the incremental annual social cost of control of the proposed NSPS over the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS to be about $43 million per year and the incremental national average cost per unit of waste combusted to be about $1.95/Mg. The incremental capital cost of control in the first 5 years of application is estimated to be $156 million over the cost of the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS.       B. Impacts of the Proposed NSPS Over a Pre-1989 Baseline       The following provides a discussion of the impacts of the proposed subpart Eb NSPS over a pre-1989 baseline. Since the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS has been effective for 3 years, the impacts presented below provide a useful account of the total impact of the NSPS, based on both the 1991 subpart Ea and proposed subpart Eb standards.       1. Air Impacts       The air emission reductions discussed below are nationwide impacts that would result from full implementation of the NSPS in the fifth year after adoption. These are not incremental impacts relative to the February 11, 1991 NSPS (see section III.A for a description of incremental impacts).   In combination, today's proposed standards and the 1991 NSPS would reduce nationwide emissions of dioxins/furans by about 29 kg/yr, total mass. Emissions of dioxin/furans on a TEQ basis would be reduced by about 480 g/yr. This represents an overall reduction of about 97 percent compared to baseline dioxins/furans emission levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS.   Under the proposed standards and the 1991 NSPS, nationwide emissions of PM would be reduced by about 6,500 Mg/yr. This represents an overall control level of over 80 percent for PM emissions compared to baseline levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS.   Nationwide emissions of Cd and Pb would be reduced by 10 and 157 Mg/yr, respectively. This represents an overall reduction of about 94 percent for Cd emissions and about 98 percent for Pb emissions, compared to emission levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS.   As a result of the 1991 and proposed NSPS, nationwide Hg emissions would be reduced by about 27 Mg/yr over baseline levels. This represents an overall reduction of about 80 percent for Hg emissions compared to baseline levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS.   Nationwide emissions of SO    2     would be reduced by about 38,000 Mg/yr, and nationwide emissions of HCl would be reduced by about 50,000 Mg/yr. The 1991 and proposed NSPS would reduce MWC acid gas emissions by about 94 percent compared to baseline emission levels.   Nitrogen oxides emissions would be reduced by about 10,500 Mg/yr. This represents an overall nationwide   reduction in NO    X     emissions of about 35 percent as compared to levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS.       2. Water and Solid Waste Impacts       As discussed in section III.A.2, the technologies used to comply with both the 1991 subpart Ea and proposed subpart Eb NSPS do not produce a wastewater stream; therefore, no significant water pollution impacts are projected to occur. Additionally, the application of these technologies would result in a negligible solid waste impact.       3. Energy Impacts       As a result of the proposed and 1991 standards, total national usage of energy is estimated to increase by about 290 GW-hr/yr of electricity above baseline. No increase in the usage of natural gas is anticipated.   The majority of the MWC's covered under the proposal produce steam that is used to generate electricity for sale. Those MWC's would require energy to operate pollution control equipment, but such energy requirements have a relatively small impact on energy generated at the plant (about 4 to 6 percent of total energy generated).

0,FT921-15452 ,"FT921-15452 _AN-CAJARAA9FT 920110   FT  10 JAN 92 / Personal View: More power needed in electricity competition      By DAVID NEWBERY   The extensive restructuring of the English and Welsh electricity supply industry in March 1990 was meant to make the industry more competitive. With growing public antipathy to the replacing of public monopolies with private ones - as with BT and British Gas - the government was under pressure to design a more competitive industry. Now, against the wishes of the Central Electricity Generating Board, England and Wales have 12 private regional distribution companies, two private generating companies and the publicly owned Nuclear Electric. The distributors jointly own the National Grid Company (NGC), which in turn owns the transmission system and co-ordinates the generators. The regional distribution companies are closely regulated by the Office of Electricity Regulation, as they are natural monopolies, but the two private generators, National Power and PowerGen, are not regulated. Together with Nuclear Electric, they submit price bids one day ahead for each power station to the NGC controller. The controller computes the least-cost combination of stations to meet demand, informs the companies which plants to hold ready for despatch and then, on the day, despatches power to meet the varying demand. The 'pool' price for each half hour is then normally the price of the most expensive plant to be called on to meet demand in that period. This practice of generators bidding against each other was presumably the argument for not regulating them, as they would be induced to undercut one another. If they failed to compete aggressively, new suppliers might enter the market with combined cycle gas turbine plants. These are cheap, quick to build, and more efficient than existing coal and oil-fired generators. Upon privatisation, the generators were fitted with a set of contracts for the supply of coal to the generators, and for the sale of electricity to the distributors. While these contracts remain in force, they have a powerful effect on electricity prices; in the first few months of privatisation, pool prices were rather lower than expected. Recently, however, as some of these contracts have expired, prices have edged up by about 20 per cent since last year, although demand and fuel prices are both lower. What is likely to happen when the generators come to renew their contracts? What should we expect to happen to the price of electricity in 1993, when the present price caps are relaxed? Electricity consumers are unlikely to sign contracts at prices much above pool prices, and generators would be imprudent to sign contracts below the expected pool price, so future contract prices are likely to approximate the expected pool price. To predict the pool price without contracts, we have built a simple model* of the pool to see whether the generators are compelled to behave competitively, or whether they can exercise market power. At low levels of demand, both generators will bid close to fuel costs to ensure that their base-load plant is despatched, but at higher levels of demand it becomes profitable to bid a price that leaves a larger margin over fuel costs. In periods of very high demand, National Power, the largest generator, knows that the demand cannot be satisfied by the remaining suppliers, and so it has a monopoly in this residual market. If National Power bids in its more costly plant at a very high price, it may not be called until demand is high, but then it will be highly profitable. PowerGen, observing this, can afford to raise its bids. The pool will be in equilibrium if each generator has no wish to change its bids, given the schedule of bids of the other. In such an equilibrium, raising bids would mean lower supply and profits, while reducing bids would mean higher supply but lower prices and profit. What about the threat that such high prices would tempt new generators to enter? This does reduce the temptation for the generators to raise their prices. The best strategy for National Power and PowerGen results in an average pool price about 35 per cent above variable costs, but this is still sufficiently high to attract some 8GW of entry by 1994. At these prices, National Power and PowerGen together have an operating surplus more than twice as high as in their last year under public ownership. How might the privatisation have been better managed? If the fossil-fuelled stations had been divided into five equal-sized companies, each would have had a well-balanced set of power stations. The effect would have been dramatic. The incentive to raise prices would have been almost eliminated and, looking to 1994, competition between the five would have kept prices low enough for no extra entry to take place. The average price in 1994 would have been 10 per cent lower than with the duopoly, but the main saving would have been on the extra investment cost of unnecessary new capacity. The country as a whole would be Pounds 250m better off each year. The profits of the generators would be slightly lower (by about Pounds 100m), but the consumers benefit by Pounds 350m. Put starkly, there are two ways to increase competition. The best way would have been to create an initially competitive industry. Failing that, entry by new companies will achieve similar results, but at the cost of unnecessary spare capacity and higher prices. If our predictions are correct, consumers have further price rises to look forward to as contracts are renegotiated, all because of a failure to get the original structure correct. *Competition in the British Electricity Spot Market, by Richard Green and David Newbery, Centre for Economic Policy Research, 6 Duke of York Street, London SW1Y 6LA.

0,FT941-6115 ,"FT941-6115 _AN-ECCCVACXFT 940303   FT  03 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Paper tiger versus the paper tiger - Eco-labelling      By ANGUS FOSTER   Brazil's virgin wood pulp producers ought to be happy. The country's climate and soil mean fast growing species like eucalyptus take about seven years to mature while a pine in northern Europe takes 35. This, combined with low labour and energy costs, gives the Brazilians a product they believe is internationally competitive in terms of price and environmental standards. Instead of celebrating, however, they are worried annual exports of more than Dollars 500m to the European Union are threatened by planned environmental legislation. They argue that the proposals are protectionist and discriminate against developing countries. The problem stems from proposals in Brussels to introduce 'eco-labelling' on paper products, to inform consumers of the product's origin. The scheme would start with tissue paper, and tissue producers would incur penalty points if their raw materials or manufacturing processes were deemed environmentally damaging. Producers who notched up too many points would not get a label. This month Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EU environment commissioner, said he was also keen to look at eventually introducing a tax on timber to discourage felling in virgin tropical forests. EU member states are due to vote on the eco-labelling proposals in the next few weeks. Brazil fears the use of virgin wood pulp in paper products will incur penalty points. It is also worried the eco-labelling system devised for tissue paper, which has a low virgin pulp content, will later be applied to photocopying and writing paper, where the content is much higher. To the Brazilians, such penalties are acceptable if they prevent the cutting down of 100-year-old hardwoods or the Amazon rain forest. But most of Brazil's virgin wood pulp exports come from replanted forest 'farms' thousands of miles from the Amazon. According to the Commission, the Brazilians are overreacting. The best producers, who have been awarded a label, may benefit from the scheme if consumers prefer their products, but imports will not be shut out because they lack a label. But Brazil's Cellulose Exporters Association argues the proposals do not give its members credit for being environmentally less damaging than European producers. In particular, it points out that Brazilian paper companies draw more than 90 per cent of their electricity from hydro-electric sources - a renewable form of energy which does not cause air pollution - where Europe's electricity is generated largely by oil and gas power stations. Brazilian analysts acknowledge that the impetus for the European proposals came largely from environmental lobbies rather than competitors in Europe.

The Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project is claimed to be the  second-largest water-conservancy scheme after the Three Gorges  Dam on the Chang Jiang river.    There will be a 154-m-high dam with 15 large tunnels and a  spillway to divert the river, handle floods, generate power and  control sediment.    In April this year the World Bank approved a loan of 570  million U.S. dollars for the project, which will take nine years  to complete.    Flooding problems along the Yellow River date back thousands  of years, as do China's efforts to harness the river.    Each year 400 million tons of silt is deposited downstream,  raising the riverbed.    It took half a century for experts on water conservancy to  identify Xiaolangdi, where the middle and lower reaches meet, as  the ideal place for a dam to harness the Yellow River. The  project got the go-ahead from China's National People's Congress  in 1991.    Located about 130 km downstream from the Sanmen Gorges Dam  in  central China's Henan Province, the Xiaolangdi Reservoir will  have a designed storage capacity of 12.6 billion cu m.    Zhu Yunxiang, who oversees the entire project, said that  when  completed, the dam, together with other reservoirs nearby, will  enable the lower reaches of the river to withstand floods of a  magnitude that occurs only once in 1,000 years.    In the first 36 years after it is put into use the dam will  be able to prevent 7.3 billion tons of silt from flowing  downstream, reversing the present buildup trend.    The project will also help control the ice jams which occur  every spring downstream.    The reservoir will pump an additional four billion cu m of  water a year for agricultural and industrial use along the lower  reaches. It will generate up to six billion kwh of electricity a  year.    The Xiaolangdi Dam is one of the most costly projects funded  by the World Bank, which since 1988 sent 15 delegations to  conduct assessments before giving it the nod in April this year.    In May this year two Chinese, one French and one Italian  company won bids to construct the three main parts of dam.    Zhu Yunxiang said, ""for all competitors, the huge investment  is a money-making opportunity.""    Zhu added that there are complicated technical problems in  the construction of the mammoth project.    Preparatory work, which cost about 1.2 billion yuan (about  137 million U.S. dollars), was completed last month after two  years' effort by a workforce of 15,000. It includes facilities  for transportation and telecommunications, water and electricity  supplies and accommodation for workers.     "
0,FT934-13386 ,"FT934-13386 _AN-DJVCQAAEFT 931022   FT  22 OCT 93 / Ministers blamed for Pounds 56m extra cost of Malaysian aid      By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor   THE NATIONAL Audit Office yesterday fiercely criticised the government for approving aid funding for a Pounds 417m hydro-electric power plant in Malaysia against the overwhelming technical and commercial advice of civil servants. Its report says the funding arrangements, chosen by the government, will add at least Pounds 56m to the aid provided by the UK taxpayer over the 14-year life of the project, led by Balfour Beatty, the UK construction group owned by BICC. The total Pounds 234m cost to the taxpayer is the largest cash sum ever provided by the British government for a single aid-funded scheme. The report traces how Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, gave the green light in July 1991, overriding more than two years of advice to the government that the hydro-power project, on the Pergau river in peninsular Malaysia's eastern state of Kelantan, was uneconomical. It will mean Malaysians pay Pounds 100m more in electricity costs than less expensive alternatives. The report makes it clear that foreign policy factors, rather than any commercial logic, dictated the decision to go ahead. The government was anxious to patch up relations with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, who had followed a 'buy British last' policy for almost a decade in retaliation against increases in fees for foreign students at UK universities. If the government had followed the most economical financing arrangements, UK taxpayers would be spending not Pounds 234m in aid support for the project but Pounds 108m. 'Even if costs were discounted to their present values, the chosen method of implementation would cost the UK Pounds 56m more than it might otherwise have done,' the report says. From as early as 1987, when a World Bank report concluded that Malaysia should concentrate entirely on gas-fired electricity generation until the turn of the century, all technical advice to the government pointed to the Pergau hydro-power project being uneconomical. In 1989, after increases in the project cost, the Overseas Development Administration, which manages the UK aid programme, concluded the project would be 'a very bad buy' and a burden on Malaysian consumers. Government budget constraints apparently blocked the most sensible funding arrangement - providing a large grant in the early years of the project in the form of mixed credits. This would have involved a commitment of about Pounds 70m in the peak payment year. Instead, soft-loan funding was arranged. The ODA's accounting officer 'emphasised to ministers that his responsibility was to ensure that aid funds were administered in a prudent and economical manner, and believed that providing funds for Pergau would not be consistent with this'.

0,FT931-14481 ,"FT931-14481 _AN-DASCGAG2FT 930118   FT  18 JAN 93 / German waste disposal industry under fire      By QUENTIN PEEL      BONN   JUST a few weeks ago, Germany's flourishing waste disposal industry was reported to be one of only two sectors in the entire economy showing any optimism about prospects for the coming year. Today, the industry is under attack from two directions. The feisty Federal Cartel Office in Berlin says it is opening proceedings against the Duales System Deutschland (DSD), the nationwide rubbish recycling venture, for seeking to extend its monopoly position from consumer packaging to the business sector. At the same time a leading parliamentarian has charged that the big electricity utilities, led by RWE and VEW, are buying up small waste-disposal contractors, and rapidly bringing the industry under their control by the back door. Caught in the middle are the 16 Lander governments who, it transpires, have actually been encouraging the monopoly process. It was they who asked DSD to extend its operations from house-to-house collection of packaging, into the small business sector. The cartel office says it has long been concerned about the monopoly position of DSD in collecting and recycling consumer packaging. However, the monopoly is effectively written into the packaging law passed by the Bundestag last year, so the cartel office has been forced to accept it. Since December, however, DSD has moved into the collection of packaging from small businesses, hotels, restaurants and hospitals, which are not covered by the packaging law. That is now the subject of the cartel action. DSD, covering more than 600 of Germany's largest consumer manufacturers, packaging companies and packers, runs the 'green point' system to organise recycling of packaging. Companies pay a fee to print a green point on their cartons and containers, which are then eligible to be collected and recycled. Companies which are not signed on to the system are required to arrange for the disposal or recycling of their packaging themselves. 'We tolerate the DSD monopoly in collecting household packaging, because the legislature decided the system would not work otherwise,' Mr Jurgen Kiecker of the cartel office said. 'We are not prepared to tolerate them moving into the business area.' The other charge against the industry has been raised by Mr Reinhard Gohner, chairman of the constitutional commission of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. He summoned a press conference to accuse RWE, the Essen-based semi-state electricity utility, of leading a move to effectively re-nationalise the waste disposal industry, sold off by local authorities in the 1970s. He said that RWE had bought 70 such contractors in the last four years. The cartel office has also confirmed that it is concerned at the rapid concentration of contractors collecting and processing waste on behalf of DSD. But the degree of concentration had not, so far, undermined competition in the industry. 'We are watching the situation closely,' Mr Kiecker said.   Companies:-  Duales System Deutschland.

The new objectives for  these two steps were recently stated by the Northeast Electric  Power Group's director general Huang Jinkai [7806 6855 0418]  during a meeting with reporters.    The Northeast China Electric Power Group will build 10 power  plants distributed through the Heilongjiang coal-fired power  base, the Eastern Nei Monggol coal-fired power base, and the  railroad center and port power bases in Liaoning and Jilin,  giving these three areas newly installed capacities of 12  million, 36 million, and 17 million kW, respectively. In  addition, it will use the water resources of the region to build  large and medium-size hydroelectric stations, including the  Songjiang River cascade and the Lianhua power plant, and will  carry on vigorous, safe development of the hydropower resources  of the main channel of the Heilongjiang River, which forms the  Sino-Russian border. This extraordinary scale of electric power  construction will also include nuclear power plants with  capacities of 10 and 8 million kW and a pumped-storage power  plant. In addition, extensive refitting of existing  high-coal-consumption older generator sets will be carried out,  and as an adjunct to electric power construction, a 500-kV power  grid covering the entire region will be built.    Huang Jinkai stated that in order to carry out the above  conceptions, the Northeast China Electric Power Group will  follow the general principles of ""a world orientation, extensive  cooperation, mutual benefit, and joint development,"" and will  engage in various types of economic and technical cooperation  and exchange with domestic and foreign friends in an extensive  range of activities in order to expand the influx of funds,  technology, equipment, and management experience into China and  to strengthen its electric power capabilities.    The Northeast China Electric Power Group, an electric power  consortium, has a fixed capital of 26.7 billion yuan; its  subordinate organizations include the Jilin Province Electric  Power Corporation, the Heilongjiang Province Electric Power  Corporation, 48 generating plants and 33 power delivery  companies. At the end of 1992, the total installed power  generating capacity in the Northeast China power grid, which the  group operates, was 25 million kW.    North China Electric Power Corporation    By the year 2000, it is expected that the North China region  will need an output of between 251 and 278 billion kWh of  electricity each year, which presupposes an installed generating  capacity of between 45 and 50 million kW. To meet this need, the  North China Electric Power Group has decided to add to its  existing 25 million kW of capacity an additional 17 fossil-fired  plants with a combined capacity of 35.5 million kW, several  hydroelectric plants with a combined capacity of up to 1.08  million kW, and a pumped-storage power plant with a generating  capacity of 1.4 million kW.    This grand program was revealed at a recent meeting by the  North China Electric Power Group's director general Jiao Yian  [3542 2011 1344]. In the near term the North China Electric  Power Group plans to carry out construction projects  representing a total of more than 600,000 kW of capacity,  including: stage 2 of the Shalingzi power plant, stage 2 of the  Ji Xian power plant, the Dou He No 2 power plant, and the Handan  power plant in Hebei; stage 2 of the Datong No 2 power plant in  Shanxi; and the Daqi and Daihai power plants in Nei Monggol.    Jiao Yian stated that North China's electric power industry  still falls somewhat short of the world state of the art in its  technical and management standards and that in order to  implement its grand development objectives, it will have to  engage in extensive mutually beneficial economic and technical  cooperation with many organizations in China and abroad. As a  consequence, the North China Electric Power Group will  enthusiastically welcome domestic and foreign friends who wish  to build power plants in the North China region on a  single-proprietorship basis or to initiate power industry  development with sharing of benefits on a joint-capital or  cooperative basis or by providing loans; the group will also  engage in cooperation and exchange in the technical sphere and  in various types of technological and labor cooperation on  various projects abroad.    The North China Electric Power Group is one of the five  large  electric power groups that were created in China at the  beginning of 1993. It is a large enterprise consortium that  unites electric power production, design, construction,  adjustment and testing, equipment manufacture and repair,  research, and education and training organizations, along with  diversified organizations. It has 250,000 employees, 63 power  plants, 4 site surveying and design institutes, 19 electric  power construction companies, 5 electric power research  organizations, 11 electric power equipment manufacturing or  repair enterprises, and 12 schools of various types. The North  China Power Grid, which it operates, supplies electric power to  Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Nei Monggol, covering a  total area of 1.47 million square kilometers and serving 120  million persons.    Central China Power Corporation    In the wake of the world-renowned Three Gorges project,  during the next seven years the Central China power system will  also build close to 10 hydroelectric power stations and more  than 30 other generating plants in Hubei, Henan, Hunan and  Jiangxi, so that by the end of the century the system's  installed capacity will have doubled to about 50 million kW.    This prospect was revealed by Liu Jinlong [0491 6855 7893],  director general of the Central China Electric Power Group,  during a recent interview in Beijing.    The Central China Electric Power Group, a large consortium  composed of more than 180 power generation, power delivery,  construction, equipment manufacture and repair, design,  research, and educational organizations in Hubei, Henan, Hunan  and Jiangxi, operates the Central China electric power grid,  which supplies electric power to these four provinces; its  coverage is 730,000 square kilometers. By the end of 1992, the  system's total installed capacity was 24 million kW, and the  annual output of electricity reached 113.5 million kWh.    In order to achieve these goals by the year 2000, Liu  Jinlong  stated that the Central China Electric Power Group will warmly  welcome friends in all fields, both from China and from abroad,  who wish to invest in the Central China region or to engage in  technical and economic cooperation.    In addition, a nuclear power plant program for the region  covering the period through 2020 was announced at a recent  Central China power system long-range planning meeting.    According to the development program for the entire Central  China power system, nuclear power development will begin in  Jiangxi before the year 2000 and a 1.2-million-kW nuclear power  plant will be built by 2010. Subsequently, two 3-million-kW  nuclear power plants will be built in Jiangxi and Hunan by 2020.  The installed nuclear power generating capacity in the Central  China system will then be 7.2 million kW; but this figure will  still represent less than 5 percent of the total generating  capacity in the grid.    The Central China power system, one of China's major power  systems, covers the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and  Jiangxi, with a total area of 730 million square kilometers. Its  current generating capacity is 25.45 million kW and its annual  output of electricity is 116.1 billion kWh.     "

However, the commission left open the possibility of the dam being constructed under the next administration, which begins on December 1 in 1994.

WEINTRAUB and GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writers      SACRAMENTO      If the government took over San Diego Gas & Electric Co. today, the new  municipal utility might be able to buy lower-cost electricity from the Pacific  Northwest, but it would be difficult to transmit that power to San Diego County  customers, utility industry observers say.    Investor-owned utilities control most of the power lines that link California  with the Pacific Northwest. For 20 years they have effectively blocked most of  California's municipal utilities from using the lines to transmit power from  other western states. Only the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the  nation's largest municipal electric utility, enjoys significant transmission  access.      Better Off With Merger    Gaining access to those transmission lines is so difficult that, under today's  conditions, San Diegans who favor hydroelectric power might be better off under  the proposed merger of San Diego Gas & Electric with Southern California  Edison, the Rosemead-based utility that controls a hefty portion of the  transmission system that links energy-hungry Southern California with the  power-rich Northwest, say SDG&E officials.    But state Sen. Larry Stirling, who is trying to block the SDG&E-Edison  merger and replace it with a municipal buyout of SDG&E, said he believes  the power blockade could be broken by the construction of a new,  ""consumer-owned"" power line. Eventually, Stirling added, the state could even  condemn existing lines and purchase them for the regulated use of public and  investor-owned utilities across the state.      Hydropower as Main Plank    Stirling, a San Diego Republican, is using the hydropower issue as a main plank  in his argument for a government takeover of SDG&E. He contends that a  municipal utility would be better positioned, and more inclined, to buy clean,  cheap power from the Northwest rather than investing more heavily in  non-renewable and air-fouling fossil fuels.    That hydropower, Stirling argues, could come from the federal Bonneville Power  Administration and from BC Hydro, a Canadian company owned by the province of  British Columbia. Hydropower is typically cheaper than electricity produced by  oil- or gas-fired electrical generating plants.    ""This is a decision for the next 100 years,"" Stirling said. ""It's really an  attitude or a process that says, 'We have a right as San Diegans to address our  energy future.' ""    Spokesmen for Bonneville and BC Hydro said their agencies have or plan to have  sufficient surplus power to ship to Southern California.    The agencies market their electricity in two ways. One is a simple energy sale,  where the purchaser buys the electricity for money. The alternative is what is  known as a ""capacity-energy exchange,"" where utilities transfer electricity  back and forth to meet each other's needs during peak hours.    BC Hydro is on the verge of a major expansion aimed at the U.S. market,  according to Doug Forrest, vice president of marketing for POWEREX, a BC Hydro  subsidiary. He said the company is watching the San Diego situation closely.    ""The province wants to get into the long-term business of selling power to the  U.S.,"" Forrest said. ""Initially, we would be looking at 400 to 600 megawatts.  But we think that's just a start.""    According to Steve Wright, manager of Bonneville Power's California marketing  office, BPA has a dwindling supply of energy that it can put up for simple  sale. But the agency has a surplus of 1,500 megawatts of capacity and is  ideally suited to trading it with Southern California.    When Southern California needs energy to power its air conditioners on hot  summer days, the cooler Northwest usually has plenty to spare, Wright said. The  California utilities can return the borrowed energy at night, when needs are  lower, or in the winter.      Utilities Still Benefit    Although the California utilities typically return more energy than they  receive, they still benefit because the transfers allow them to postpone or  avoid building new, expensive power plants.    ""As long as the cost of energy they're providing to us is less than what it  would cost them to meet their capacity needs without us, then they're getting a  good deal,"" Wright said.    Federal laws give California's municipal utilities a slight advantage over  investor-owned companies in bidding for Bonneville's power. While the price is  the same for either entity, an investor-owned utility would have its supply  curtailed sooner in the event of a shortage, Wright said.    But SDG&E officials downplay the value of hydropower for Southern  California. The San Diego utility currently has no long-term contracts for  hydropower, and, in 1988, when low rainfall limited the supply of hydropower on  the spot market, SDG&E used the resource for just 2.5% of its needs.    Even if SDG&E used all the hydropower it could now transmit to San Diego,  the supply would only meet about 10% of SDG&E's total customer demand for  electricity, according to SDG&E Power Contracts Supervisor Mike Strong.      'Loaded Up as Best We Can'    ""If we continued to be independent, we would continue to use hydropower as we  have in the past,"" said Jim Kenney, SDG&E's manager of fuels and power  contracts. ""We have loaded up as best we can during times when hydro is  plentiful. I suppose during times when certain hydro contracts come up for  renewal, we will probably put in to get an allocation of it.""    Kenney added that the proposed merger with Edison, which has access to roughly  1,500 megawatts of hydropower, would probably bring more of the resource to San  Diego than either the status quo or a government takeover of SDG&E.    ""San Diego will wind up with a higher mix of hydro than it has today,"" he said.    Even if hydropower were available and a San Diego customer wanted to buy more  of it, getting the electricity to the county would be difficult, many in the  industry say.    Part of the problem is that California's north-south transmission system --  like the state's freeway system -- is old and crowded. Building new  transmission lines is an expensive and time-consuming process because local  residents usually oppose them as undesirable land uses.      Additional Problem    There is an additional problem: The public owns the state's freeway system, but  the Pacific Intertie, the only north-south high-voltage transmission system  connecting California and the Pacific Northwest, is controlled largely by  Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.    The two investor-owned utilities control about two-thirds of two lines that  travel through California to the Oregon border. Edison, PG&E and the Los  Angeles Department of Water & Power, the nation's largest municipal system,  control 86% of a third line that cuts through Nevada on its way to the Pacific  Northwest.    That ownership structure has severely limited use of the lines by other  Southern California municipal utilities such as Anaheim, Riverside and Azusa.    Ten years ago, the municipal systems initiated a federal court battle to gain  access to the intertie. Transmission has gained in importance because ""we're  like islands in the middle of Edison,"" according to Gordon Hoyt, general  manager of Anaheim's municipal utility.    Peter Matt, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who has represented the municipal  utilities in their fight to gain access to the intertie, said the municipals  are basing their legal claim on a St. Louis railroad case decided in the early  1900s. A judge in that case determined that one train company could not refuse  to give competitors access to a bridge over a river.      10-Year-Old Battle Continuing    ""Without that bridge, you couldn't reach the train terminal, and without that  terminal, you didn't have a business,"" Matt said.    The 10-year-old federal court battle is continuing.    Edison critics contend that the Rosemead-based utility simply doesn't want to  give publicly owned competitors in California access to cheaper hydropower  available in the Northwest.    ""It's sort of like saying there's so much food in the world that nobody need  starve,"" according to Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers  Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. ""Supply isn't the problem --  distribution is.""    Edison declined to discuss available capacity on the intertie lines that it  owns. ""That is something that will be discussed in (upcoming) regulatory  proceedings,"" Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps said last week.      340-Mile Line Proposed    Concern about future access to transmission lines led 15 municipal utilities in  Northern California to propose a 340-mile transmission line that could become  operational by 1993, according to Steve McClary, a staff person with the  Sacramento-based Transmission Agency of Northern California.    The 15 municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District  and the Modesto Irrigation District, would own 42% of the proposed  ""California-Oregon Transmission Project."" Municipal utilities in Southern  California -- such as Anaheim, Riverside and Banning -- would own about 7.5% of  the new line.    The state's three largest investor-owned utilities would own 40% of the  project. Edison would own 17.5%, PG&E would own 20.4% and SDG&E would  own 2.9%. However, the state Public Utilities Commission has yet to grant  required permits that would clear the way for the investor-owned utilities to  take part in the $400-million project.    Sen. Stirling suggests that a municipal utility in San Diego could dramatically  increase SDG&E's share of that line or work to build yet another. He also  said he will support legislation first proposed last year to require all  utilities to provide access to their lines to ""wheel"" power around the system.    Beyond that, Stirling advocates a public takeover of all the state's  long-distance power lines, an idea that would be fiercely fought by the  investor-owned utilities that built the lines.      State Should Condemn Interties    ""The idea that the interties are public networks is to me the right answer,""  Stirling said. ""There are some things that it is just better to have a consumer  network do. This is one of them. The state ought to go ahead and condemn all  the interties and pay for them, and make clear that the interties are available  to anyone who wants to transport electricity, north or south.""    That politically Draconian solution would give municipals access to cheaper  hydropower produced by the Bonneville Power Administration. But it still would  be difficult to transmit power from BC Hydro, because transmission through  Washington and Oregon is largely controlled by Portland Power & Light, a  subsidiary of Portland-based Pacificorp, which recently merged with Utah Power  & Light.    In that merger, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission required the newly  created utility to open up transmission access to competing utilities. But the  utility contends that there is no room on the lines for its competitors.    California's municipal utilities have asked federal regulators to order similar  transmission access in the proposed merger between Edison and SDG&E. Not  surprisingly, Edison is opposing any federal attempt to broaden transmission  access.    Stirling acknowledges that today's conditions are not the best for a municipal  utility hoping to gain access to Northwest power. But he brushes aside many of  the problems by saying that he is ""dealing not in what is, but what can be.""    The cost of investing in hydropower would be nothing compared with the price  the United States has paid to keep oil flowing into this country from abroad,  he said.    ""We have polluted our beaches, we have distorted our economy, we have subjected  ourselves to Middle Eastern warfare, sacrificing the lives of our servicemen,""  Stirling said. ""It has been an incredible national effort.    ""Getting a power link from here to Bonneville pales in comparison.""

0,FT943-8950 ,"FT943-8950 _AN-EHODDAAGFT 940815   FT  15 AUG 94 / Proposals drawn up for 'spot' market on gas prices      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   The gas industry regulator Ofgas is taking further steps towards creating a US-style 'spot' market for setting daily prices when Britain's household supply business is opened to competition in 1996. Proposals for the system, which would operate on similar lines to the UK electricity industry's pool, have been drawn up by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, with the aim of ensuring balanced supplies when British Gas loses its monopoly and broadening competition among suppliers. Ofgas is keen to see the development of such a market and will issue a consultation paper on the proposals by the end of this month. 'We'd like to see the creation of a daily 'spot' market, but if it's to be successful it must be what people want. We can't impose it on the industry,' said Mr Mark Higson, director of network operations at Ofgas. Morgan Stanley's proposal, which was formulated jointly with regional electricity companies Eastern Electricity and ManWeb, both of which have gas supply arms, would set up a daily commodity market for gas sales and purchases. Almost half the gas used in the US is traded on this daily spot basis following the deregulation of gas distribution more than 10 years ago. A natural gas futures contract also trades on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Independent gas companies already trade small amounts of gas with each other on the telephone, but once the household market is opened up, there will be a need for larger quantities to change hands in a more formal marketplace. By the end of this month, Ofgas will ask gas companies to give their views on Morgan Stanley's proposal and how this would operate with British Gas's suggestions on how to balance supply and demand on a daily basis. The need for a daily spot market arises from the necessity to iron out fluctuations in the amount of gas in the national pipelines network when British Gas's monopoly over domestic supply is removed in April 1996. If an imbalance is created by rival suppliers putting too much or too little gas into the national network, households could find they are cut off. In the worst case, an explosion could be caused. Since it is difficult for suppliers to find out whether they are providing an adequate amount of gas to the system each day, British Gas has suggested it makes emergency purchases of gas and later charges those companies which were not balanced. Morgan Stanley's approach envisages a much wider market where all participants will be able to buy and sell gas at a centrally-cleared price. 'The advantage of this system is that it could provide a liquid market with a transparent pricing structure,' said Mr Higson. Spot gas futures, Page 7   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Such a deal  can only be carried out if the Cuban Government offers a letter  of credit to Colombia -- that is, if an international bank  finances its debt.    According to a study to which EL TIEMPO has gained access,  the banks are not interested in backing Cuban debts. In fact,  countries such as Iran and Libya suspended their supply of crude  because of a lack of financial guarantees.    Although the situation improved somewhat after Russia  resumed  the commercial exchange of oil with Cuba in January 1994, Cuba  still is not in any position to pay for imports. Russia will  sell Cuba 4.0 million tons of unrefined crude in exchange for  1.5 million tons of sugar this year.    The government of Fidel Castro prefers to offer Colombia a  three-way exchange system. This means that the companies to  which Cuba sells sugar would, in turn, pay Colombia for the  crude. Many of the countries that receive sugar in exchange for  oil have suspended these kinds of deals because of Cuba's  enormous debts and because there is a surplus of sugar, and  future production is in jeopardy. This suspension of imports  heightens the already difficult energy situation. Cuba only has  resources to supply 40 percent of its oil needs.    Even with Colombian oil, the crisis would not be resolved.  Rather than crude, what Cuba needs is fuel, particularly fuel  oil and diesel, to generate electricity and to compensate for  its lack of hydraulic sources of power. This is because Cuban  refineries are also in a state of crisis.    The plants in Havana and Santiago (built by Exxon and Shell)  reportedly produce 30,000 bpd but are currently at a standstill.  The Havana plant requires investments in the order of $100  million, while the Santiago plant needs a $75 million investment  to operate efficiently. Another Soviet-built plant, with the  same capacity, and another located in Matanzas (which reportedly  generates 5,000 bpd) are also at a standstill because of a lack  of maintenance.    The new refinery located in Cienfuegos has the capacity to  produce 60,000 bpd, but it is not operational right now and  requires an investment of approximately $200 million to produce  commercially viable gasoline.    Difficulties in generating electricity have forced Cuba to  obtain gasoline through four international companies (Marc Rich,  Vitol, Mabanet, and Totisa) which receive sugar and nickel as  payment for their exports. According to the document, however,  even refined imports have been reduced. These are now limited  to the volumes of sugar and nickel that Cuba can offer. For  this reason, the document questions Colombia's willingness to  sell oil to Cuba ""while other countries have decided to suspend  sales.""     "

Halton Borough Council in Cheshire yesterday announced that it had signed a 20-year joint venture with Biomass Recycling, a recently-formed waste management group, to re-use 98 per cent of the contents of household dustbins by 1995. The contract is the most radical response to the Environmental Protection Act, which set councils a target of recycling 25 per cent of refuse by the turn of the century. Mr Tony Barratt, the council's development manager, said: 'We thought the 25 per cent rule would require us to put in Pounds 500,000, which we haven't got. The Biomass scheme will save the council Pounds 10m over 20 years.' Halton council claimed that the scheme would 'totally eclipse' the government targets, but the Department of the Environment said only material that was strictly recycled - as opposed to used for energy generation - would count towards the quotas. Many recycling schemes have been uneconomic, given the cost of sorting rubbish, but Biomass said it expects to make 'rapid profits' from Halton's 40,000 tonnes of annual domestic waste. Recyclable material - mainly metal and plastic - will be sorted centrally, avoiding the costs of collecting different types of rubbish separately. Biomass has signed a 20-year contract with Norweb, the regional electricity company for north-west England, to sell it the gas from the decomposition of waste. Norweb will use the gas to generate electricity. Mr Tim Midgeley, a Biomass director, said 'the technology we're using is as old as the hills'. He added: 'It's crackers no one has done this before.' Biomass will use water warmed by the decomposition to farm prawns and crayfish. It wants to use the eventual compost for enriching soil to grow Christmas trees. Set up by the Jardine Matheson Group to help local authorities meet the Environmental Protection Act, Biomass will invest Pounds 1.6m in the first year on the central sorting technology. Mr Midgeley said: 'Each tonne of waste is worth around Pounds 40 to us, including about Pounds 5 from reclaimable plastics, Pounds 10 from metals, and around Pounds 12 from energy.'

One of the questions arising from this is to make  further and better achievements in the electrification of  railway lines.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: ""It is  necessary to complete electrifying the still-unelectrified  sections of railway lines and to quickly introduce heavy-duty  cars to the railway lines by producing many eight-axle electric  locomotives and 100-tonne freight cars.""    To make further and better gains in the achievement of  electrification of the railway lines is one of the important  tasks for solidifying the material and technological foundation  of the railway lines.    An important factor indicating the material and  technological  foundation of the railway lines is railway transport capacity.  Railway transport capacity largely depends on the kind of power  used.    Electricity and internal combustion are examples of power  sources used for railway transport. Generally speaking, the  efficiency of steam power and internal combustion power is much  lower than that of electricity. Therefore, to help further  increase the proportion of usage of electric power by making  further and better achievements gained in the electrification of  the railway lines serves as an essential demand for solidifying  the material and technological foundation of the railway lines.  This can increase railway transport capacity.    To make further and better achievements in the  electrification of the railway lines makes it possible to  actively introduce heavy-duty cars to the railway lines, thereby  helping solidify the material and technological foundation of  the railway lines.    To accelerate the introduction of heavy-duty cars into the  railway lines is one of the ways to increase the transport  capacity by solidifying the material and technological  foundation of the railway lines.    When we introduce heavy-duty cars to the railway lines, we  can quickly increase the transport capacity even without laying  many new railway lines.    The introduction of heavy-duty cars into the railway lines  will increase the capacity of railway transport, and an  important condition for this is the electrification of the  railway lines.    If the haulage capacity of locomotives is low, they cannot  properly haul heavy-duty cars. To increase the haulage capacity  of locomotives, it is necessary to use electric power.    From an early day on, our party has actively pushed for the  electrification of the railway lines by putting forth a chuche-  oriented policy to suit the actual conditions of our country,  which has abundant electric power resources. Under our party's  leadership, our country has already achieved great success in  the electrification of the railway lines. In recent years  alone, a total of 800 km of railway lines has been electrified.  Therefore, the main railways lines have basically been  electrified. The feeder lines have also been electrified to a  considerable extent.    When we electrify some still-unelectrified feeder lines and  industrial lines by making further and better achievements in  the electrification of the railway lines, we can transport more  cargo more quickly with the existing transport means, thereby  smoothly guaranteeing the demands for transport in the people's  economy.    To increase the production of electric locomotives is a  high-  priority demand for making further and better achievements in  the electrification of the railway lines.    Importantly, the extent railway lines have been electrified  is indicated by the amount of cargo hauled by electric power,  and electric locomotives are the basic means of hauling cargo in  the electrified sections. Thus, when we increase the number of  the electric locomotives, we can haul more cargo with electric  power.    Under the party's wise leadership, when more railway lines  have been electrified quickly, we can haul an enormous amount of  cargo with electric power if we are equipped with more electric  locomotives.    It is important to produce a proper mixture of various  kinds of locomotives, including electric locomotives used for  the railway lines that have not yet been electrified and the  electric locomotives used for switching cars; as well as to give  priority to producing more eight-axle electric locomotives used  for hauling heavy-duty cars. When this is realized, we can  further increase the scope and proportion of cargo hauled by  electric power without suffering from various kinds of  restrictions.    What plays a vital role in electric locomotives is the  electric motor for power. Electric locomotives largely depend  upon the electric motor for power. Therefore, in order to  quickly increase the production of electric locomotives, it is  necessary to give firm priority to the production of highly  efficient electric motors.    One of the important factors to make further and better  achievements in the electrification of the railway lines is to  increase the supply of electricity to the electrified railway  line sections in conformity with the practical demands.    At the moment, heavy-duty cars, such as the eight-axle  electric locomotives and 100-tonne freight cars, are being  widely introduced into railway transport in accordance with the  policy of introducing heavy-duty cars into the railway lines;  and a struggle to have each car haul more cargo than the haulage  draft is being vigorously staged under the flame of ""the 5.18  no-accident, on-time, traction- standard-surpassing movement.""  This reality demands eagerly that the supply of electricity be  further increased. To this end, it is necessary to actively  push ahead with the construction of new intermediary electric  power substations between the operating sections of the  heavy-duty cars, while mapping out a series of technological  countermeasures to increase the capacity of the existing  electricity supply facilities.    The work of electrifying some still-unelectrified lines  should be accelerated.    What is important here is to map out a detailed, concrete  plan to implement a correct priority order, and to implement the  plan in a useful fashion through the finish-one-by-one method.    The success of completing the electrification of some still-  unelectrified lines largely depends upon how to lay more tracks  and set up electric poles. Therefore, it is necessary to carry  out the technological guidance in a substantive way so as to  help work out a wonderful design for this and carry out the work  in accordance with the demands of the technical regulations and  the standard manufacturing procedure. In particular, it is  necessary to work out a measure to secure railway tracks and  electric poles in a foresighted way and pay special attention to  preventing corrosion of structures caused by the electric field.    The work to make further and better achievements in the  electrification of the railway lines can successfully be carried  out only with the vigorous support from various sectors of the  people's economy.    The metal industry is the sector that takes the biggest  share  in this support. When this sector provides, in a timely  fashion, sufficient supply of various metal materials, including  copper wiring, aluminum wire, silicon steel sheet, and rolled  steel, according to the kind, quality, and gauges of those  materials, we can increase the production of electric  locomotives, increase the capability of electricity supply, and  quickly push ahead with the laying of new electric railway  tracks.    To make further and better achievements in the  electrification of the railway lines is one of the important  tasks which should be carried out in smoothly solving problems  in transport to suit the practical demands for thoroughly  carrying through the party's revolutionary economic strategy.    The railway transport sector should achieve innovations in  making further and better achievements in the electrification of  the railway lines with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance  and fortitude, thereby more smoothly guaranteeing the growing  demands for transport and making active contributions to the  implementation of the party's revolutionary economic strategy.

0,FT934-9072 ,"FT934-9072 _AN-DKLCNAB8FT 931112   FT  12 NOV 93 / Power companies cautious on VAT      By MICHAEL SMITH   BRITAIN'S electricity companies have warned ministers that the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel bills will lead to a sharp rise in disconnections. They are pressing for 'further' financial help for customers with low incomes. They have also advised the government that the VAT changes, due to be implemented in April, will increase bills by more than the tax element because of costs associated with a significant increase in bad debts. The industry's concerns are expressed in a private letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and other ministers by the Electricity Association, which represents the UK's 20 largest power companies. The letter is an unusual foray into the political arena and reflects industry fears that the consequences of VAT will be far more severe than ministers acknowledge. Electricity company anxieties have increased following speculation that the chancellor will impose the full 17.5 per cent tax in April, rather than 8 per cent then and the rest the following year as previously announced. The association's letter will add weight to the campaign by some Tory backbenchers for the VAT plans be scrapped or for relief for less well-off consumers to be increased. In the letter, Mr Roger Young, the association president, warns that the imposition of VAT will reverse the trend of falling prices and disconnections set in motion by privatisation three years ago. The letter says 'One possible complication will be refusal by some customers to pay the specific VAT elements of their bills. After the normal counselling process, this will lead to our member companies using their powers to disconnect supply to obtain full payments from customers.' Mr Young, chief executive of Scottish Hydro-Electric, says companies are also concerned about additional account collection workload and costs 'which will flow through to all our customers'. Yorkshire Electricity estimates at Pounds 6m the cost of installing token meters likely to be needed to help customers with difficulties paying VAT-inflated bills, says Mr Young. The company estimates that an additional 75,000 will experience difficulties, around 80 per cent of whom will need a token meter at a cost to the company of Pounds 100 each. 'Against this background the steps the government takes to protect the position of customers on low incomes are of key importance and we would urge you to provide further help to them in the best way you can.' If the estimates of Yorkshire, one of 15 regional distribution companies, are typical and correct, more than 1m power consumers would experience payment difficulties and the cost of metering would be more than Pounds 90m. The letter says that since privatisation three years ago the number of disconnections for non-payment of bills has fallen by 84 per cent. Domestic electricity bills have fallen 4 per cent in real terms between 1985 and 1993.   Companies:-  Yorkshire Electricity.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Dire warnings are sounding again about imported oil. The  Department of Energy said last week that within the next 20 years the United  States could be dependent on imports for two-thirds of its oil supply.    And William Webster, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, underscored  that message, saying in congressional testimony that ""dependence on Persian  Gulf oil will rise dramatically.""    The implied threats were all too believable after December's bitter cold snap,  when heating oil and natural gas were suddenly in short supply in the  Northeast.    But is the threat real? Are we in for a rerun of the 1970s, a long period of  scarce energy and high prices? Should we prepare to line up at the gas pumps  again and put on more warm clothing indoors?    No, not really. The first consoling fact to keep in mind is that the United  States remains secure in energy, with enormous and diverse supplies of coal  (enough for hundreds of years) and natural gas (60 years' supply and possibly  more). The nation will make a lot more use of its natural gas in the decade  ahead, and possibly its coal also.    But beyond this fuel or that, the ultimate consolation in energy is that  something else always happens -- economics changes demand or technology changes  supply.    Sure, domestic oil is slated for a long, slow decline -- more than a third of  U.S. production will vanish in the next two decades, the Energy Department's  forecast says. But that's not necessarily a calamity. Either we will import the  oil that we need, or something else will give us the equivalent energy.    The big use for oil, after all -- accounting for one-quarter of all U.S. energy  usage -- is motor gasoline. And it's a good bet that, for environmental  reasons, cars are likely to be burning entirely different fuels at some point  in the next 20 years. Perhaps we'll see electric cars, powered by electricity  produced from natural gas or coal.    That unpredictability is why gloomy forecasts of energy crises and attempts at  energy policy so often turn out wide of the mark.    Recall Project Independence, proclaimed by President Richard Nixon in 1973 to  encourage both conservation and production of oil to free us from dependence on  imports. The policy wasn't wrong -- just irrelevant. Seventeen years later, we  are importing as much as ever and will import more because the United States  simply can't produce all the oil that it uses.    But that doesn't mean energy conservation failed. Not at all. More  fuel-efficient cars, lowered thermostats and energy-saving machines -- helped  by microchip technology that wasn't even developed when Project Independence  was declared -- have given the U.S. a much bigger bang for its energy buck than  before 1973.    For another example, take the fiasco of natural gas in the 1970s. Use of  natural gas to produce electricity was restricted until two years ago by a law  passed in 1978 at the height of concerns about energy policy. The thinking back  then was that natural gas -- a versatile substance that can be used to make  petrochemicals as well as heat homes or generate electricity -- was too good,  and too scarce, to use in electric power plants. So the Industrial Fuel Use Act  of 1978 restricted its usage, and electric companies cut back. But they did so  just as drillers, spurred by 1970s high prices, found vast new gas supplies.    The resulting oversupply bankrupted gas producers, disrupted pipeline companies  and generally added to the economic suffering of the Southwest in the 1980s.    And after all that, the Fuel Use Act restrictions were repealed in 1987 -- nine  years after they were passed -- to relieve the oversupply and to give electric  power companies an economic, clean-burning fuel.    Technology, in the form of increased understanding and concern for the  environment, has changed the energy equation again. Natural gas emits no sulfur  dioxide and only one-third the carbon dioxide of coal combustion. That's why  the Energy Department pegs it as the fastest-growing fuel of the 1990s -- and  proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act could increase its market even more.    New pipelines and expansions of old ones are planned to try to keep up with  demand from the Northeast, and California will shortly need more gas. All of  which spells rising prices and new wells drilled to increase production.    ""The industry is still in the early stages of a boom,"" says analyst David  Braunstein of Lovett Underwood Neuhaus & Webb, a Houston-based brokerage  house. But industry leader George Mitchell, of Mitchell Energy &  Development, says he'll keep his powder dry. Mitchell has been through booms --  like that of the early '80s that made him a billionaire in Mitchell Energy  stock -- and busts -- like that of the late '80s that reduced him to a  half-billionaire.    He knows that too much of a boom in natural gas -- tight supplies and rising  prices -- will only speed the day that technological breakthroughs make coal  environmentally acceptable. The Energy Department says coal will replace gas as  the growth fuel of the early 21st Century. Or something else will happen --  renewable energy, or nuclear may be perfected by then.    The only confident prediction one can make is that change will continue -- and  probably dire warnings will too.

Natural gas emits no sulfur  dioxide and only one-third the carbon dioxide of coal combustion. That's why  the Energy Department pegs it as the fastest-growing fuel of the 1990s -- and  proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act could increase its market even more.    New pipelines and expansions of old ones are planned to try to keep up with  demand from the Northeast, and California will shortly need more gas. All of  which spells rising prices and new wells drilled to increase production.    ""The industry is still in the early stages of a boom,"" says analyst David  Braunstein of Lovett Underwood Neuhaus & Webb, a Houston-based brokerage  house. But industry leader George Mitchell, of Mitchell Energy &  Development, says he'll keep his powder dry. Mitchell has been through booms --  like that of the early '80s that made him a billionaire in Mitchell Energy  stock -- and busts -- like that of the late '80s that reduced him to a  half-billionaire.    He knows that too much of a boom in natural gas -- tight supplies and rising  prices -- will only speed the day that technological breakthroughs make coal  environmentally acceptable. The Energy Department says coal will replace gas as  the growth fuel of the early 21st Century. Or something else will happen --  renewable energy, or nuclear may be perfected by then.    The only confident prediction one can make is that change will continue -- and  probably dire warnings will too.

Northern Laos  is rich in lignite -- the first deposit found has a lignite  reserve of the same amount found at Thailand's Mae Mo mine in  Lampang Province. Yet, there are still many more lignite  deposits in Laos believed to be larger than what has been found  in Thailand. The assessment was made by a subsidiary of the  Ngan Thawi Group in Hongsa of Laos whose lignite mine can  generate power for over 60 years. Also based on the old French  maps, Laos has iron ore deposits in Luang Nam Tha; zinc and  copper mines in Xieng Khouang; and gems, especially a large  amount of blue sapphires, in Bokeo. The central part of the  country is covered with forests and water sources suitable for  building hydroelectric dams. The Nam Ngum hydroelectric dam is  now providing electricity for Thailand. In southern Laos, there  are oil deposits and forests and water sources, good for the  construction of a hydroelectric dam. There are already two dams  there -- Nam Theun 1 and Nam Theun 2. There is a vast area still  untapped, and it is possible that there are abundant resources  in the area.    Dr. Wiraphong noted that, from assessments, the potential of  Laos' energy production could turn the country into one of  richest in terms of economic potential since that means the 4  million inhabitants of Laos can export 20,000 megawatts of power  annually, in other words, a highest per capita income. The  country would become ""a second Brunei."" That is why Laos is  focussing on investment in energy development. The program is  incorporated in the fourth national economic and social  development plan, which will begin on 1 January 1995. Based on  the assessment, the best way to earn an income for the country  and to attain an economic stability is through exports of  energy. Meanwhile, Thailand would be a major customer of Laos,  because Thailand can no longer expand production of energy,  while demand is always increasing. Thailand therefore needs a  power supply from Laos.    Anyway, Dr. Wiraphong said he prefers to see Thailand buying  power from Laos for direct consumption instead of buying bunker  oil from Saudi Arabia for power production. By importing power  from Laos, Thailand is helping a brother country. The money  spent will remain circulated within the region and could one day  return to Thailand.    In conclusion, he said: ""Whether Laos would be successful in  economic development and become a second Brunei also depends on  Thailand, since Thailand will be the sole country to buy  electricity and power from Laos. Vietnam is self-sufficient in  this area and can rely on local production; the same is true for  China. The customer of Laos is Thailand.""     "

Turnover of the integrated utility, which generates, transmits and distributes electricity, increased 6.8 per cent to Pounds 301m (Pounds 281.9m). Earnings rose 55 per cent to 7.93p and the interim dividend is being lifted by 10.8 per cent to 3.6p. Hydro-Electric's sales volume in Scotland showed underlying growth of 2 per cent, and there was a 20 per cent rise to Pounds 60.3m in sales to customers in England and Wales. The operating margin improved to 16.7 per cent, thanks partly to the arrival of 'sour' untreated gas from the Miller field in the North Sea at the company's Peterhead power station, and partly to the high Scottish summer rainfall, which permitted more hydro-electric generation. But these lower costs were partly offset by higher bills from Scottish Nuclear. Interest charges fell to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 15.7m) as gearing was cut to 20.6 per cent through strong cashflow. It plans to redeem Pounds 116m of government debt, saving Pounds 1m in interest this year and Pounds 4m thereafter, although a redemption charge of Pounds 12.5m will appear in the full year's accounts. COMMENT Hydro-Electric has the second lowest tariffs in Britain and its sales in the English market will increase as the interconnector upgrade and Keadby come onstream. Like Scottish Power, it is better insulated than other power companies from the present energy review. If the government were to make consumers pay more for electricity to support the coal industry, Hydro-Electric would get higher income. If it tried to limit the pass-through to the consumer of the costs of gas plants like Keadby, the burden would fall on the regional generators, and Hydro-Electric is not a regional company. Analysts forecast full-year pre-tax profits of between Pounds 142m and Pounds 146m, and a full-year dividend of about 11.3p, compared with this year's 10.16p. The shares closed yesterday up 3p at 240p. With another 70p to be paid up next May, gross dividend yield on a fully paid basis is 4.8 per cent, reflecting the greater potential of the Scottish companies. The shares should be bought.

The closures represent more than half British Coal's remaining 50 pits, and are part of the reshaping to prepare the company for privatisation. The closures will cost more than 20,000 jobs, one of the largest set of redundancies ever announced at once. The government will try to soften the blow with promises of aid, although the prospects for that are slim given the present state of the budget. Although the bulk of the job losses will affect the mining communities, there will also be many lay-offs among administrative staff. The announcement will come even though British Coal has yet to sign new supply deals with the electricity industry on which its prospects now depend. Negotiations have been delayed by disagreements among the electricity distributors. However, the government is keen to press ahead with the privatisation schedule. British Coal refused to confirm that the closure programme would be announced today, but Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, are both due to spend the day at their London offices. Union leaders in the biggest coalfield decided yesterday to press for a strike in protest at the planned pit closures. The Yorkshire executive of the NUM mineworkers' union said the demand was made 'with great reluctance'. Mr Ken Capstick, NUM Yorkshire area vice-chairman, said: 'We feel industrial action is needed to protect jobs and mining communities and especially because many of the redundancies will be compulsory, We are likely to lose 30,000 miners' jobs and another 60,000 in related industries. 'We also envisage 17 coal-fired power stations having to close very rapidly,' he said. The NUM Yorkshire area said it would put a motion calling for industrial action to a special delegate conference in Sheffield on Thursday. British Coal has been fined Pounds 20,000 with Pounds 6,410 costs for breaches of the Radioactive Substances Act 1960 relating to radioactive material held at Marine Colliery, Cwm, Gwent. The Pollution Inspectorate said that, after the closure of Marine Colliery there was no record of the fate of a caesium source used on a bunker level gauge and investigations had failed to discover its fate after the site had been cleared.

0,FT922-8299 ,"FT922-8299 _AN-CENCNAA2FT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (17): All eyes on Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia spearheads sell-offs in Asia      By FRANK GRAY   BY the end of this month the first stage in the privatisation of Malaysia's state electricity board will be completed when 23 per cent of the company's shares begin trading on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. The minority flotation of the state-owned utility, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), is the biggest yet in Asia's developing countries, where most of the region's utilities are under state control. Malaysia's experiment in privatisation is being closely watched in view of widespread moves in the region to make the power sector operate more commercially. The TNB flotation involves the allocation of 625m of its 3bn shares to the private sector, with most of the shares going to domestic institutions, the public at large and to employees and a further 60m allocated to international investors. Baring Brothers, the UK merchant bank, lead managed the international offering. The offering was heavily oversubscribed and 'grey market' indications are that official share trading will see TNB shares hitting the market well above their offer price of MDollars 4.50 per share. The TNB flotation dates from the late 1980s when the Malaysian government began soliciting advice on how to privatise the utility, then known as the National Electricity Board (NEB). At that time, Mr Samy Vellu, the energy minister, hoped to float a majority of the shares, leaving the government as a minority shareholder, but retaining overall sovereignty for the utility through control of a so-called 'golden share'. That plan was abandoned given the complexity of trying to ensure a fair distribution of the shares among Malaysian institutions and the ethnic Malay, as opposed to the Chinese, public. It has been a cornerstone of Malaysian domestic policy since 1969 to broaden the Malay share of national corporate wealth to match the more commercially successful ethnic Chinese population. Malays comprise 58 per cent of the population of 18m, the Chinese and Indians comprising 33 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. Critics of the privatisation scheme argued that the TNB was almost too good to put on the marketplace. Malaysia is technically self-sufficient in energy with large gas and oil reserves and abundant hydroelectric potential. It now delivers piped gas to Singapore and is at the crossroads of a partially completed trans-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Nations) gas pipeline grid, extending from Thailand to Indonesia. With an installed capacity of 5,000 MW, Malaysia is not burdened by the population demands of Indonesia (180m, 9,000 MW) and its 1:3.5 ratio of kilowatts per head of population far exceeds the Asian average of 1:10 (the European average is roughly 1.5:1). The government has argued that injections of private capital were needed to improve the TNB's efficiency and meet the demands of new industry. It has set an ambitious target of adding a further 3,000 MW of new capacity to reach 7,834 MW by 1995, largely through the addition of hydroelectric and combined cycle power stations to the national grid. Mr Vellu recently declared that Malaysia wanted 'to become Asia's powerhouse'. The TNB's restructuring required it to be removed from governmental control. This necessitated its corporatisation, which took place in September 1990. After that, it was up to national and foreign bankers to put together an action plan that could be sold to the public. As well as an impressive boost in generating capacity, the TNB is predicting a sharp increase in profits. Last year, its turnover was MDollars 3.7bn, with after-tax profits of MDollars 501m. It foresees an after-tax profit rise to MDollars 820m this year and MDollars 969m in 1993. With electricity tariffs forecast to remain stable, this could mean a sell-off of some of the utility's assets, particularly thermal power stations which would be run by private operators. It is already in talks with Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong to build a MDollars 4.6bn (Dollars 1.7bn) thermal power station on a build-operate-transfer basis. Hopewell would run the station for a specified number of years, recouping its installation costs from the sale of electricity into the TNB grid. To the alarm of some, TNB's long-range programme includes a closer examination of nuclear. When the flotation was first mooted, Mr. Vellu, commenting on the problems facing Britain's electricity privatisation, said: 'Thank goodness, we do not have nuclear.' Analysts suggest that this position really has not changed and that nuclear was put into the current flotation prospectus as a demonstration of the utility's technological prowess, rather than as an indicator of true, long-term intent. With the minority flotation just being completed, there are no immediate plans to float any more shares, though the TNB - with the government holding a golden share - may decide to do so later in the decade. The possibility that shareholders might have to fund a showpiece (and probably unnecessary) nuclear power station might provide a big disincentive to a further devolution of the utility.

Bits of it - like trimming the fat from the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) - have been good. And bits of it - like failing to give the industry any incentive to conserve energy - have been bad. But the very worst bit of the egg, everyone from accountants to politicians agrees, was the decision to create only two large privatised generators, National Power and PowerGen, out of the CEGB's generation business. Offer, the electricity watchdog, summarised the market's worries about the 'duopoly' position of the two generators in its December report on the operation of the 'pool' or wholesale market in electricity. Although some competition had emerged, Offer said, 'emerging experience in the Pool suggests that the dominant market position of the two major generators gives them the ability to influence and control Pool Prices. This is not likely to inspire confidence in the Pool, nor be conducive to further new entry.' Offer did not, it said, rule out referring the two large generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). Offer's fears were echoed by the Commons Energy Select Committee, in its February report on electricity privatisation. Offer, it said, 'should take steps as soon as possible to reduce the dominance of the two generators,' and by not later than 1995 it should decide if they should be referred to the MMC. But neither the Commons committee nor Offer suggested a satisfactory solution to creating more competition to challenge National Power and PowerGen. So far, the following strategies have been suggested: Break up the generators: The most extreme solution, and one often suggested by large electricity consumers, and British Coal. 'It is physically and operationally feasible,' says an accountant closely involved in the privatisation. But although the recent sale of Northern Ireland Electricity's power stations showed there would be no shortage of buyers for individual stations or groups of stations, it would be difficult. A break-up would mean a loss of value for existing shareholders, who could take legal action and call for compensation. It would also be disruptive, in an electricity market that has scarcely found its feet. Swap the government's 40 per cent stake in the generators for assets, then sell the assets to industry buyers: It has been rumoured that the government might cancel its 40 per cent shareholding in the generators, take over power stations of that value instead, and then sell them to other generating companies. This would create more competition and put pressure on the generators to keep their prices down. The idea has been discredited by the generators, who point out that this would be against the interests of the other 60 per cent of shareholders, because it would make the generators less competitive. It would also be hard to find assets which equal the Pounds 2bn market value of the government's stake without seriously damaging the generators' business, they argue. Force the generators to sell off stations which they intend to close or mothball: This would stop them from manipulating supply and demand in the market by opening and closing stations, and would give other generators a chance to win more market share. But, the generators have pointed out, if they cannot run plant, no smaller generator will be able to do so. And if they can, they will keep it open. Regulate the generators' costs/profits: This would ensure that the generators do not overcharge the regional companies and large customers who buy from them on contracts. Some large customers have suggested the generators are already keeping too big a margin over costs, while the generators insist they could not make money if they sold contracts more cheaply. But regulating costs or profits would be time-consuming - the regulator would have to examine the power station business in detail. It would also go against the principle of the new market, which was that the generators would operate like private sector companies, and competition would keep their costs down. Change the rules in the pool and the contract market: There are a number of proposals for modifying the pool, and the method whereby contracts to buy and sell power are agreed outside the pool - most power is still traded in contracts. These include making contract negotiations more transparent, so that customers have a sense of the market price. Changing the way Nuclear Electric, the third generator with substantial market share, sells power under contracts has also been suggested. At the moment, the company invites tenders for the contracts and then sets a price that customers argue may bear no relation to underlying costs. Making the price for Nuclear Electric's contracts more transparent and cost-reflective is important because National Power and PowerGen have used it as a benchmark for their own deals with customers. It might also help to have a more active market in contracts. There is already an embryo market, set up by Gerrard and National, but so far trading has been moderate. A liquid market in contracts would help promote transparency and give the generators' consumers more information about the market. Encourage competition to enter the market by making sure the pool gives clear supply and demand signals: An important criticism of the pool is that it is not a good mechanism for giving generators signals about whether to build new stations or not. The way the price of electricity in the pool is set means that at times of peak demand or short supply, a 'capacity' premium is triggered, pushing the price up. This is an erratic message, which makes it hard for companies to plan investment in new power stations by assessing the demand for more power. It thus inhibits competition to the two big generators. Also, because withdrawing plant from the pool will push up the 'capacity' element of the pool price the generators have an incentive to manipulate supply and demand by closing plant. The Commons select committee suggested that this system for rewarding generators for building capacity should be changed, but had no exact plans for how this would be done. Wait and see: The government's answer to the problem so far has been to wait for the market to mature, and for competing generators to emerge, and challenge the big two. But the Commons energy select committee has argued that that is not happening. Although privatisation brought a rash of new independent generators who announced they were building gas-fired power stations, many of their projects have foundered because of a shortage of gas at the right price. More worryingly, it now looks as if many of the new stations that are built will fail to provide the competition the government expected. That is because the stations have secured long-term contracts to sell their power to regional electricity supply companies, who then sell it on to captive domestic consumers. Because these consumers buy power regardless of the market price, the stations will not have to compete in the market. Worse, they may capture demand that existing coal stations could have supplied more cheaply. This, the select committee argues, must be urgently investigated by Offer. Even if Offer scrutinises every independent power project, the question of whether it will produce power at a market price in 15 years time is highly speculative. At best, Offer could assess how competitive the project's gas price, site, and technology were relative to other projects. So far, the independent power stations due later this decade show every sign of using modern technology and bargaining hard for competitive gas and the best financing package possible. It is true that they rely on long-term contracts rather than the pool price  -but most power is still sold in the contract market, if on shorter contracts. There is even a chance that the pool itself will become marginal to the electricity market.  The Financial Times   London Page VII  "

0,FT923-8042 ,"FT923-8042 _AN-CHQBDAE2FT 920813   FT  13 AUG 92 / Pitfalls of putting a price on coal: Juliet Sychrava looks at what may prove to be the most complex privatisation yet      By JULIET SYCHRAVA   AS THE government prepares to sell British Coal, it is becoming clear that making money from the privatisation is not, for once, the main priority. That is partly because British Coal is virtually impossible to value accurately and partly because the approximate valuations look depressingly low. Analysts have suggested figures of less than Pounds 1bn. British Coal has fixed assets - including 50 coal mines and plant and machinery valued at Pounds 1.68bn - but it has Pounds 2.6bn of liabilities. It made a profit of Pounds 170m in the year to March this year, but that figure says virtually nothing about future profitability. At the moment the corporation earns almost all its money by selling 65m tonnes of coal a year to the electricity generators at special high prices which are enshrined in the contracts put into place by the government before the electricity industry was privatised two years ago. Those contracts expire in March next year. The new contracts, which are being negotiated now, are expected to be much tougher on British Coal. The price it receives will fall from Pounds 1.85 a gigajoule - the unit of energy from coal - to about Pounds 1.50 a gigajoule. According to estimates from McCloskey Coal Information, the coal consultancy, had British Coal had to sell at that price last year, it would have lost Pounds 456m. The volume of coal in the contracts is expected to be 45m tonnes in the first year, declining to 30m in the third year and possibly less thereafter. British Coal has indicated that if that happens it will have to start closing pits soon after the contracts are signed. McCloskey estimates that might lead to nearly 30 pits closing immediately unless the corporation can reduce its deep-mine costs further. More pits may close to match the declining volumes in the contract. According to one observer, only the 12 pits shortlisted last year by NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the government on the privatisation, would be viable. The new contracts will force British Coal to write down its assets, perhaps to about Pounds 500m, because it will not be able to service them from future income. In addition to the difficulty of valuing British Coal while its asset and cashflow value decline, the government faces pressing practical and political headaches. Closing mines is politically uncomfortable. Since the end of the 1984-85 miners' strike, 119 pits have closed and 130,000 miners have lost their jobs. Both the government and British Coal have said they would like to sell the largest possible economic coal industry. If that is true, and the corporation does not simply close all but 12 mines after the new contracts are signed, it will have a hard time finding a trade buyer for the others. Some mines may improve their performance given time, but a large chunk of British Coal's deep-mine production will never be profitable. Even if loss-making mines are sold bundled up with more profitable opencast or surface mines, a private-sector purchaser would not carry them for long. At the same time, the government does not want to fragment the industry too much - British Coal needs critical mass to negotiate with the electricity generators. Although the present board would like British Coal to be sold intact, a suitable, adequately large buyer would be hard to find. Picking an international company may anger the many small British coal companies that would like a slice of the business. Offering them, and the miners themselves, parts of the corporation would smooth the privatisation. There are more obscure issues that may make it hard to sell the corporation safely. Resolving those issues is at least as important for the government as maximising proceeds. The first practical question is who will own the mines themselves. British Coal owns the UK's coal reserves and leases some reserves to small mining companies, which pay it a 'rent' or royalty. If the government sells British Coal freehold, so that the purchaser owns the land on which it mines coal, it will have to allow other coal companies the option to buy their freehold. If it sells it leasehold, it will have to decide on the value of the lease. Then it may face the same arguments over what the royalty should be that British Coal has faced for many years. The royalty is theoretically linked to the value of the coal assets, and when the coal price falls, small mining companies fight for a lower royalty. If the government keeps the freehold, British Coal will lose the royalty of about 40p a tonne from private deep mines and Pounds 4.50 to Pounds 5 a tonne from opencast mines it collects today - a revenue of Pounds 14m. It would have to pay a royalty itself, and the government would have to set up a body to grant licences to other lessors. The royalty question needs to be settled quickly. Small, private mining companies are already finding it hard to plan, because they have no idea how much future royalties will be. Another issue is British Coal's pension funds, worth a total of about Pounds 13bn - Pounds 6.5bn each for the miners' fund and the staff fund. They have surpluses of about Pounds 1.4bn each that would allow a future owner to take a pension holiday worth about Pounds 100m a year. The government will want to ensure that the funds are safe for existing employees, which might mean closing them off or taking them over. Deciding how to administer the funds may take time and negotiation with the miners' unions. British Coal's biggest liability is concessionary coal - its historical obligation to supply miners, working or retired, with about 5 tonnes a year. This costs it Pounds 1.62bn. Like the pension funds, the liability could be taken on by the government and managed separately - the corporation already gets a government grant to cover the annual liability. But finding a body to administer the liability might take even more time and money. British Coal also has provisions for damage to hearing, amounting to Pounds 273m. Those could also be taken out of the company and managed, but the question of a cut-off point arises. What happens to claims that arise after the company is privatised, but possibly relate to earlier injuries? The same question arises for the liability - Pounds 219m - relating to subsidence and surface damage caused by mining. Managing that may mean setting up another quango with an almost indefinite life. Before the government can value or sell British Coal, it has to resolve all those issues. All that, and the seemingly intractable matter of getting the electricity industry to sign contracts with the company, must make it one of the most complex privatisations ever.  -------------------------------------------------------- BRITISH COAL  -------------------------------------------------------- Simplified balance sheet*                                          Pounds bn  -------------------------------------------------------- Fixed assets                                1.68 Current assets              4.24 Short-term liabilities     (1.54) Net current assets                          2.70 Total assets less current liabilities       4.38  -------------------------------------------------------- Long-term liabilities      (0.57) Provisions                 (2.59)          (3.16)                                             1.22  -------------------------------------------------------- Loans under the Coal  Industry Act               1.02 Profit and loss account     0.02                                             1.22  -------------------------------------------------------- * Unconsolidated 1991-92  -------------------------------------------------------- DEEP MINES  -------------------------------------------------------- Scottish 1 mine Output 2.2m tonnes  -------------------------------------------------------- North-East 5 mines Output 7.5m tonnes  -------------------------------------------------------- Selby 8 mines Output 14.6m tonnes  -------------------------------------------------------- South Yorkshire 12 mines Output 13.4m tonnes  -------------------------------------------------------- Midlands  Wales 12 mines Output 16.0m tonnes  -------------------------------------------------------- Nottinghamshire 12 mines Output 17.3m tonnes  -------------------------------------------------------- Number of deep mines                         50 Total deep mine output (m tonnes)            71.0 Number of opencast sites (at end 1991-92)    58 Opencast output (m tonnes)                   16.7  --------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

0,FT944-3280 ,"FT944-3280 _AN-ELNEAADCFT 941214   FT  14 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Drive to overcome electric car barriers - John Griffiths is persuaded of the potential valueof a zinc-air battery powered vehicle      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   The scene: a Los Angeles petrol station, in a few years' time. A medium-sized family car pulls in from the highway and hums up to the line of pumps. The driver ignores the petrol and diesel nozzles. Instead, he reaches for the one marked potassium hydroxide. Five minutes later, just like its petrol-fuelled counterpart which has filled up at the adjacent pump, the battery-powered car is on its way. By applying some lateral thinking, California's SRI International  - still best known by its old name of the Stanford Research Institute  - and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories believe they may have the answer to two of the biggest technological hurdles which for years have bedevilled attempts to produce viable battery-powered cars. The hurdles are the lack of mileage provided by batteries between recharges  - few of the prototype cars so far developed have proved capable of more than 60-100 miles  - and the length of time needed for a complete recharge; usually several hours. Seeking to improve these performance parameters has led vehicle and battery makers and government research teams around the world into multi-billion dollar efforts to develop 'super-batteries'. These efforts have been made more urgent for car makers by California's adoption of legislation requiring 2 per cent of new car sales to be of non-polluting 'zero-emission vehicles' in 1998, rising to 10 per cent in 2003. Thirteen other US states are soon to follow suit. More powerful 'conventional' lead/acid batteries have been developed, as well as new types of battery using different materials for the process  - electrolysis  - by which electrical current is generated. But all fall far short of providing the range and versatility of a petrol car and most have other drawbacks. Some use materials that would be too costly to put into mass production, others have technological problems, such as the sodium-sulphur batteries that need to operate at several hundred degrees centigrade. SRI and Lawrence Berkeley Labs have opted for a 'zinc-air' battery, which generates its power by reacting zinc and oxygen in an electrolyte comprising zinc particles suspended in potassium hydroxide. This battery has a good, but not outstanding, performance  - with a mileage of just over 100 miles in a medium-sized vehicle  - compared with other new battery technologies, and has the advantage of using cheap and readily available raw materials. What makes SRI's approach radical, however, is the concept of not recharging the battery electrically. Instead, the spent electrolyte is physically drained and fresh electrolyte simply pumped in as 'fuel'. SRI maintains that not only does this quick 'refuelling' eliminate the biggest impediment to driver acceptance of the battery car, but it also allows the potentially huge infrastructure problems of electrical vehicles to be swept away. There would be no need to dig up city streets to install a roadside charging infrastructure; no need for festoons of power cables from houses to cars; no need for businesses to provide recharging facilities for employees' cars to make sure their cars can reach home. Garages would merely have to add two more tanks to their fuel storage systems. One would pump in the new 'fuel', the other would take the spent electrolyte to storage tanks for collection. The spent electrolyte collected from a network of garages would then be regenerated at central recharging stations in a safe and controlled setting, using off-peak electricity, before being redistributed. 'This feature is so attractive that one major oil company has become a key supporter of our concept,' according to Joe Rudzinski, one of SRI's executives involved with the project. SRI, one of the world's biggest independent research and consulting organisations, is starting a Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.4m) prototype programme to prove the concept's overall practicality. Its projected cost of a battery pack is around Dollars 3,000. It also forecasts a forecourt refuelling cost of Dollars 12.30, compared with Dollars 11.35 for a petrol vehicle of the same size travelling an identical mileage  - a premium which Californian legislators and citizens are likely to regard as a small price for relieving the state's notorious air pollution. Sixty-three per cent of Californians said in a survey recently they would probably or definitely consider buying an electric car. The survey of 400 Californians, commissioned by specialist newspaper Automotive News, was taken immediately before EVS-12, the biennial symposium on electric vehicles currently taking place in Los Angeles. Fifteen per cent said they were prepared to pay up to Dollars 5,000 more than for a conventional car. North America's electricity utility industry is expected to watch the SRI developments with mixed feelings. Whichever battery-powered car proves most commercially successful, the electricity supply industry will benefit  - from extra electricity demand arising from a large battery vehicle population. But it also sees a considerable business opportunity in the development and provision of an infrastructure for the electrical recharging of a battery car population, and has been working within the US Advanced Battery Consortium  - a federal government-backed, Dollars 1bn project linking US car and battery makers and utilities  - on how best to provide one. If SRI's radical approach is successful, much of that opportunity could slip from its grasp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P8731 Commercial Physical Research.

0,FT942-1348 ,"FT942-1348 _AN-EFXC1AENFT 940624   FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Singed fingers among the recs - Michael Smith on the diversification lessons for power companies      By MICHAEL SMITH   The contrast could be instructive. After electricity privatisation four years ago, East Midlands Electricity was intent on broadening its horizons and became the most acquisitive of the 12 regional power companies. Manweb, however, stuck to its core businesses, even to the extent of holding back from the dash for gas in which all other 11 regional companies invested in generation plants. The two companies were this week displaying the results of their policies. East Midlands was not flattered by the comparison. While Manweb's pre-tax profits rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 126m, East Midlands reported a Pounds 100m fall to Pounds 51m after taking an exceptional hit of Pounds 130m as a result of diversifications into contracting and home security and write-offs on its retailing interests. It seems to have learnt its lesson. Mr Nigel Rudd, recently appointed chairman, made his name as the head of the acquisitive Williams Holdings, but he says electricity companies should stick to what they know about and concentrate on their core activities. East Midlands has ruled out for now the possibility of following other regional power companies in providing other utility services. But what about other companies? Are there more non-core problems ahead? Almost certainly there are; but the worst fears are about what the companies will be tempted to diversify into in the future, rather than what they have already grown or bought into. After seeing the disastrous results of the privatised water company's forays outside their main business, the power companies have been relatively restrained. SG Warburg Securities estimates that total investment on non-core activities by the 12 regional companies is less than Pounds 650m, compared with their market capitalisation of more than Pounds 12bn. Water companies, by contrast, have spent about Pounds 1.4bn. And whereas some of the water companies' most calamitous acquisitions were overseas, the recs have ventured seriously outside the UK only recently. This month Norweb paid Dollars 36m (Pounds 23.6m) for a 50 per cent stake in two gas-fired co-generation facilities in Virginia. Yorkshire Electricity is to pay an undisclosed sum, thought to be about Pounds 100m, for a 17.3 per cent stake in Stockholm Energi. Norweb's investment is viewed in the City as safe, if unexciting. Yorkshire's foray into Sweden offers opportunities because of the deregulation of that country's power market and is welcomed by analysts. Other companies are also considering moves abroad. Midlands Electricity and Eastern are looking at buying stakes in distribution companies in the Czech Republic. City reaction would depend on the regulatory regime, which is still being formulated by the republic. But even here the outlays are likely to be relatively small, perhaps between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m for a stake. In the UK, where most of the diversification has occurred, the biggest acquisition was made by London Electricity, which paid Pounds 90m for the electricity distribution networks of its three London airports. This is performing above expectations, contributing Pounds 11m operating profit last year. Again, the City approves because it is so close in nature to London's core business. Similarly there is only limited downside in the recs' moves into power generation. It is possible that Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, could rule that these are too expensive later in the decade and prevent the companies from passing on the costs of what could be expensive power to customers, but the likelihood seems slim. He has already said that the deals do not conflict with the companies' obligation to buy power economically. There is perhaps more concern among investors about rec ambitions to become broad-based utility companies. While it may make sense to sell gas and telecommunication services to customers who already buy power from them, the competition is intense. Most of the companies have joined the race to get into the gas market before it is opened up to competition in 1996, but telecommunications have attracted fewer recs. 'We looked at it very seriously, but decided it was too risky,' says the chief executive of one company. 'There are some very big players out there - BT's profits are the same as our turnover - and they can afford to take big losses to crowd competitors out of the market.' Heavy competition is also responsible for extremely tight margins and in some cases losses in the retailing and contracting businesses. These are not businesses which most recs would choose to be in were they starting up from scratch, but which are difficult and expensive to withdraw from. Retailing and contracting are likely to provide most of the difficulties for recs in the next year or so. More losses and write-offs are expected by analysts, although few expect losses of the scale reported by East Midlands. But perhaps the recs' biggest problems stem from the amount of money they have. Buying back shares is one way of dealing with the money, but there is strong pressure to do more than that. 'On the one hand the City says diversification is bad for regional power companies,' says one analyst. 'On the other people say managements lack imagination if they do nothing. 'The recs cannot win either way, but there are bound to be one or two that trip up by taking the diversification route.'   Companies:-  East Midlands Electricity.     Yorkshire Electricity.

The  drop is huge and concentrated. A total of 75.12 million kW of  installed capacity is possible, capable of producing 355.5  billion kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds  respectively to 20 and 19 percent of the capacity and power  production to be developed nationally. It is the most  concentrated water resource in the world. In the past, this  ""lode"" was not developed due to its geographic location and  regional economy. As our economy grows, speeding up the  development of the Jinsha Jiang Hydropower Base will have a  major effect on alleviating the severe power shortage in the  southeast, improving our energy structure, industrial structure,  and ecology in the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang, and  promoting economic growth in southwest and southeast China.    In response to a recommendation made by the Southern  Electric  Utility Corporation, the China Electric Power Association and  the China Society of Hydropower Engineering organized a visit to  the middle and lower reaches of the Jinsha Jiang. Experts and  top officials of different departments from the central,  regional and provincial government and in the area of survey and  design, participated in this effort. The primary purpose of the  visit was to invite our comrades from the southeast, where a  severe energy shortage exists, to take a first-hand look at the  energy resources available on the Jinsha Jiang and to explore  the possibility to jointly develop this resource to supply  electric power from west to east.    (I) Jinsha Jiang Resources Are Abundant and Easy To Develop    The Jinsha Jiang is a branch of the upper reaches of the  Chang Jiang and flows from Yushu, Qinghai, to Yibin, Sichuan. It  flows through Qinghai, Xizang, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and is 2,290  kilometers long. It covers a basin of more than 490,000  km[.sup]2[/]. The flow is abundant and steady and the head is  huge and concentrated. The average flow is 4,920  m[.sup]3[/]/s and the mean annual discharge is 155 billion  m[.sup]3[/]. There is not much fluctuation in the annual  discharge. The ratio of the wettest to the driest year is merely  1.38. The main stream has a drop of 3,280 m and the mean drop is  1.43 percent. It can accommodate a total installed capacity of  75.12 million kW and produce 355.5 billion kWh of electricity  per year, corresponding to 20 percent of the capacity to be  developed nationwide and 19 percent of the electricity to be  generated. The amount of electric power generated per year is  equivalent to 128 million tons of standard coal. It will play a  pivotal role in balancing our primary energy resources. It ranks  first in the world in terms of abundance and concentration of  hydropower resource.    The middle and lower section of the Jinsha Jiang, from Shigu  to Yibin, is the focus of research and development. After  repeated surveys, proofs of concept, and planning in the past 30  years, according to the ""Briefing on Comprehensive Utilization  of the Chang Jiang Basin Plan"" and the development plans  prepared by the Kunming Institute and the Chengdu Institute, the  middle and lower reaches of the Jinsha Jiang can be developed in  10 stages. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the cascade  development. Figure 2 shows the cross-section view of the  cascade development. Major specifications of the power stations  are shown in the table. After additional surveys and studies  done in 1992, the Kunming Institute proposed to build at  Jinanqiao instead of Zhili and at Yanke instead of Hongmenkou.  The accompanying table illustrates that this development project  will result in tremendous benefits.              Figure 1.

Tremendous Power Generating Capability    On the basis of the plan that the water level at the  Hutiaoxia Reservoir is 1,950 m, 51.98-58.58 million kW of  generators can be installed to produce 263.7-275.4 billion kWh  of electricity annually. If the 2,012 m scheme proposed by the  Kunming Institute is adopted, an extra 1.5 million kW of  generator capacity can be installed at the Upper and Lower  Hutiaoxia hydropower stations and an additional 11 million kW of  capacity can be built downriver to produce an extra 21 billion  kWh of electricity a year.    2. Excellent Regulating Effect    The ""spigot"" reservoir at Upper Hutiaoxia and two additional  huge reservoirs at Baijidu and Xiluodu will regulate the river  flow to ensure good power-generating quality.    3. Good Overall Benefits     The development will also result in other benefits such as  flood control, silting, irrigation, navigation and soil  preservation.    4. Better Geologic Condition    Although the region is frequently struck by earthquakes,  dams  can be built in relatively stable sites with better geologic  conditions. Each cascade has the geologic condition to build a  tall dam.    5. Superior Technoeconomic Indicators    The hydropower station at each cascade has superior  technoeconomic indicators such as the amount of engineering  work, construction cost, flooding loss, and population  relocation.    6. Major Improvements in Transportation at Most Hydropower  Station Sites    National or provincial highways pass through sites such as  the Upper Hutiaoxia, Jinanqiao, Guanyinyan, Xiluodu, and  Xiangjiaba. Lower Hutiaoxia and Baihetan are accessible by local  roads. In addition, most hydropower station sites are located  near towns and villages.    (II) Development of the Jinsha Jiang Has Major Strategic  Significance    1. Deliver Electricity From West to East To Alleviate Energy  Shortage in the Southeast    Energy resources are in short supply in the eastern, central  and southern regions. The shipping of coal produced in the north  to the south puts a tremendous strain on transportation. With  sustained economic growth, there is a rising demand for energy  and electricity. If we continue to rely upon coal alone, it will  be difficult for our production and transportation system to  meet our demand. Pollution is a major problem and it is  impossible to build a large number of costly nuclear power  plants to solve our energy shortage problem. The abundant water  energy resource in the southwest, especially the delivery of  electric power generated from the Jinsha Jiang eastward, is an  important energy resource for the southeast. On the basis of our  analysis, if the cascades of the Jinsha Jiang Hydropower Project  are completed in 2040, 50 million kW of power can be supplied to  the east. This will have a major impact on alleviating the  energy shortage and improving the primary energy structure in  the southeast.    2. Developing Hydropower To Lead Economic Growth in the  Southwest    Since the reform, although there has been some economic  growth along the Jinsha Jiang, with the exception of a few  cities such as Panzhihua and Yibin, the growth is still very  slow, particularly in minority areas. Nevertheless, there is an  abundance of hydropower, mineral and biomass resources. Speeding  up the work to develop the Jinsha Jiang can drive up the  development of other natural resources in the region and improve  the local economy and cultural standard. It will convert its  resource advantage to economic advantage and can improve the  layout of our industrial structure. Developing the Jinsha Jiang  can also improve the ecology in the upper reaches of the Chang  Jiang. In addition, it will bring a fortune to our minorities.  This helps solidify us as a nation to secure our southwestern  border. It carries a great deal of political and economic  significance.    3. Development of the Jinsha Jiang Hydropower Base Will Make  the Three Gorges More Economically Beneficial    The completion of the Jinsha Jiang cascades will produce a  total water storage capacity of 77 billion m[.sup]3[/], a  regulating capacity of 36 billion m[.sup]3[/], and some flood  control capacity. By regulating the reservoirs, the flow  downstream will increase in the dry season and decrease during a  flood. Furthermore, it will also block sand from washing down  the river.    (1) After the Xiluodu reservoir is constructed, by way of  regulating the flow, the city of Yibin will have the capability  to deal with a 100-year flood, instead of the current 20-year  flood. In addition, it can also reduce the flow of floodwater  into the Three Gorges to improve its flood control capability.    (2) After the Xiluodu reservoir is completed, the dam will  block the movement of suspended material from upstream. In 30  years, it can intercept 67 percent of the suspending materials,  the equivalent to reducing the suspension at Yichang by 30  percent. As a result, it will slow down the rise of flood levels  at the end of the Three Gorges caused by silting.    (3) According to an analysis done by the Chengdu Institute,  regulation provided by the Xiluodu reservoir can produce an  additional 880,000 kW of capacity to the hydropower stations at  Xiangjiaba, Three Gorges, and Gejiaba and generate 1.6 billion  kWh of electricity per year.    (4) By the regulating power of the Xiluodu reservoir, the  minimum flow during drought season can be increased from 1,060  m[.sup]3[/]/s to 2,000 m[.sup]3[/]/s to improve the  navigation conditions down the Jinsha Jiang and along the upper  reaches of the Chang Jiang.    (III) Progress in Early Stage Work on Jinsha Jiang  Hydropower Base    1. Hutiaoxia Cascade. The Hutiaoxia gorge is approximately  22  km in length and has a 200 m drop. It has numerous shoals and  rapids and steep cliffs on both banks. Most exposed rocks are  marble and quartzite. Some geologic survey and planning work was  done by the Chang Jiang Water Conservancy Commission in the  1960s. The South China Institute has established a hydrology  station at the Longpanba site in Hutiaoxia to conduct planning  stage survey work. As for the development of Hutiaoxia, the  schemes studied in the past include a two-stage approach,  building two tall dams at upper and lower Hutiaoxia, and a  hybrid approach, building a tall dam at upper Hutiaoxia and  leading water from the right shore to a power plant in lower  Hutiaoxia. Specifically, with reference to the fact that the  original upper Hutiaoxia dam site is too narrow, designers also  proposed to move the dam upstream to Longpan where the river is  wide. These approaches are being studied as a part of the  planning work.    Normal water level should be selected primarily based on  Yunnan's ability to absorb flooding of farmland and relocation  of people. Presently, Yunnan is leaning toward a high water  level plan. This not only can generate more electricity along  different stages but also can bring water to irrigate  approximately 1.2 million mu of farmland in central Yunnan.  These are issues to be investigated in the planning stage. The  next step is to study and demonstrate the scale and method of  development at Hutiaoxia and to determine the normal water level  in the Upper Hutiaoxia reservoir. This front end work needs to  be accelerated to ensure that it plays a ""lead"" role after  hydropower stations at Xiangjiaba and Xiluodu are put on line.    2. Jinanqiao Cascade. With the support of Yunnan, on the  basis of a comparison of terrain, geology, transportation, and  construction conditions, the Kunming Institute proposed to  replace Zhili with Jinanqiao. It has also completed a planning  survey. The dam site is primarily covered with dense basalt and  a small amount of tuff. It is a better site. The station is to  be built behind the dam. Initially, a 2.5 million kW station  with a guaranteed production of 1.273 million kW is planned. The  scale appears to be appropriate. If possible, this early stage  development proposal by Yunnan should be supported.    3. Guanyinyan Cascade. This dam site, primarily covered by  quartzite and silt, will be developed with a power plant behind  the dam. The Kunming Institute has completed the planning survey  work. The plant is of an appropriate size and has the necessary  conditions for development. The city of Panshihua hopes that  construction can begin as soon as possible. Regardless which one  of the three proposed sites is chosen, Huaping County in Yunnan  will be flooded by the reservoir. A comprehensive technoeconomic  analysis should be done in the early stage to choose the most  appropriate site.    4. Baihetan Cascade. As early as the 1950s, under extremely  difficult circumstances, the Kunming Institute conducted survey  and design work with experts from Czechoslovakia on this site.  The East China Institute has built roads and erected cable  bridges to conduct surveys for the planning stage. This site is  primarily covered with hard basalt. It stands on solid bedrock  that offers an excellent geologic condition. Other conditions  for development are also outstanding. It is a key project to  deliver electric power from the Jinsha Jiang eastward. Moreover,  it regulates the flow downstream at Xiluodu and Xiangjiaba.    5. Xiluodu Cascade. Here, the river channel is straight in a  V-shaped valley. Bedrock, mostly basalt, is exposed on either  bank. It is hard and solid. Geologically, it is perfect for the  construction of a tall dam and underground buildings. Developing  conditions such as construction and transportation are good.  Xiluodu is the largest hydropower station on the Jinsha Jiang.  Its reservoir has the ability to regulate the river flow year  round. The Chengdu Institute has conducted a great deal of  survey and design work for several years. If the front-end cost  is assured, a dam site selection report can be prepared by the  end of 1993. A feasibility report can be finished in 1995.  Development of Xiluodu is an ideal first phase project for the  delivery of electricity from the Jinsha Jiang eastbound. Local  global governments want an early development.    6. Xiangjiaba Cascade. The Chengdu Institute began site  surveys in 1975. These were followed by geological surveys done  by the Wujing Hydropower Survey Team. In 1985, the design survey  responsibility was switched to the South China Institute. In  1990, the Institute of Water Conservancy held a site selection  meeting for the dam. Site VII is preferred and site III is the  alternate. The dam site base is sandstone. The South China  Institute is working on the hub layout at the selected site,  performing hydraulic model experiments, conducting geologic  survey work, and mapping navigation channels. This station has  the best conditions for construction and transportation. In  addition, cities such as Yinbin and Shuifu are close by. The  overall benefit of the power station is substantial.  Furthermore, it works as a reverse regulating reservoir for the  Xiluodu hydropower station. It will benefit both the power grid  and navigation. If the preliminary phase funding can be secured,  a feasibility report may be completed in 1984.    Xiangjiaba and Xiluodu are sister power stations. They  should  be included in the first phase of construction on the lower  reaches of the Jinsha Jiang.    (IV) Preliminary Understanding of the Development of the  Jinsha Jiang    Since the 1950s, organizations such as the Chang Jiang Water  Conservancy Commission, Kunming Institute, Chengdu Institute,  South China Institute, East China Institute, and the Chinese  Academy of Sciences have conducted a great many surveys and  planning and design work on the Jinsha Jiang and acquired a  tremendous amount of data. In 1981, the Chengdu Institute  prepared a plan to develop the lower reaches. Since feasibility  studies of Xiluodu and Xiangjiaba are in progress, as time goes  by, many new findings will surface. As for the middle reaches,  the Kunming Institute is conducting full-scale planning work.  The survey and design work in the planning stage for the  Hutiaoxia cascade is being conducted by the South China  Institute. In recent years, the China Electric Power Association  and the China Society of Hydropower Engineering have also done a  great deal of work on the development of the Jinsha Jiang. The  following is a discussion on strengthening the early-stage  effort.    1. Sticking to a Basic Construction Process    We must stick to a basic construction process despite the  fact that our economy is growing at a fast pace and the depth of  reform is getting deeper. Preparation of a hydropower planning  report is an important stage. It determines the scope, phases  and sequence (selection of first stage work) of the development  effort. It is the foundation required for a feasibility study of  every hydropower station. We must do a good job to prepare a  hydropower planning report for the middle and lower reaches of  the Jinsha Jiang.    2. Study Major Technoeconomic Issues in Depth    The Jinsha Jiang is China's largest hydropower base. We must  rigorously perform the front-end preparation work and study  related major technoeconomic issues in great detail.    (1) On the basis of the overall development plan of the  Chang  Jiang Basin, the Jinsha Jiang is supposed to be developed for  hydropower, navigation, irrigation, water supply, and flood  control for areas downriver. There are different requirements  for the different cascades. Various industries also have  different requirements for the development of the Jinsha Jiang.  Some of them are extremely demanding. It makes the planning and  early stage work very difficult.    (2) Although there is an abundance of resources along the  Jinsha Jiang, there is only a limited amount of land available  for development. This makes the relocation of people more  difficult. Furthermore, the region belongs to minorities. We  must clearly understand the degree of difficulty in relocating  the population.    (3) The Jinsha Jiang valley is narrow and the river is  swift.  It also contains a great deal of mud and sand. The riverbed has  a thick overburden layer. It is located in a high earthquake  frequency zone. In addition, there are problems such as high  slopes and reservoir bank stability. Individual reservoirs may  leak. These natural conditions make the engineering design and  construction more difficult.    (4) From the standpoint of the scale of the project, all  hydropower stations are more than 2 million kW. Technical  requirements for tall dams are very stringent. Many issues such  as tall dam construction, high capacity water turbine  generators, ultrahigh voltage power transmission technology and  diversion in high-flow situations must be investigated. Some  issues may require considerable development.    (V) Suggestions on Accelerating Jinsha Jiang Hydropower  Development    The rapid growth of our economy, particularly in the  southeast, presents an urgent need to resolve the power shortage  problem. Developing the Jinsha Jiang is a way to actually  deliver electricity to the east. Moreover, development of the  Jinsha Jiang is an important component in the control and  development of the Chang Jiang and the economic strip along the  Chang Jiang. To this end, the author has the following  suggestions.    1. Stronger Government Leadership. Development of the Jinsha  Jiang is a strategic project that will have a significant impact  on the economy. It should be treated as serious as the project  to divert water to the north from the south. Under the guidance  of the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Electric  Power Industry, a Jinsha Jiang development office should be  established to study major policy issues such as hydropower  development schemes, capital-raising approaches, electricity  pricing policy, rights and benefits related to provinces that  own the resources and those that consume power (plus power  station ownership and distribution of benefits of hydropower  stations bordering two or more provinces), and shouldering  investments for overall utilization, and provide its finding to  the government in the decision-making process.    2. Expanded Publicity. In order to accelerate the Jinsha  Jiang, the project should be more aggressively promoted through  a variety of channels by different means to make more people in  more departments and industries aware of the significance of  building a hydropower energy base in the southwest to allow the  appropriate authorities and departments to adopt the necessary  economic, legal and administrative measures to help implement  and support this project. This will bring more organizations and  more people to support the development of hydropower along the  Jinsha Jiang.    3. Securing Early Stage Funding. The scale of the project to  build the Jinsha Jiang hydropower stations is enormous. There  will be a great deal of work at the front end for a considerable  period of time. If construction is to begin in the year 2000,  early stage work should start now, otherwise it will be too  late. It will seriously impact the development effort. To  accelerate the development of the Jinsha Jiang, the focus now is  to begin early stage planning work of key hydropower stations  and sites along the river. To speed up this early stage work, we  need to increase the level of funding. The Planning and Design  Academy is very much concerned about the early stage work for  the Jinsha Jiang project and has scheduled several design units  to get involved in the early stage work on the river sections  and hydropower stations at Xiangjiaba and Xiluodu. Nevertheless,  progress is hampered due to a severe shortage of funds. To solve  this problem, a special request was submitted to the State  Planning Commission, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and  the National Energy Resources Investment Corporation. In  addition, based on the principle of a market economy, the  authority should negotiate with the electric utilities in  central, eastern and southern China to invest in the project for  future consumption in order to raise money to cover the front  end work and the construction cost.    Furthermore, the suggestion that the Three Gorges  Development  Corporation invests in the Jinsha Jiang project should also be  followed up and nailed down. Upon completion of the Three Gorges  project, it is a natural for the cooperation to immediately  develop the Jinsha Jiang. If this suggestion is accepted, early  stage funding will be secured and ownership of the project will  be clear. It will further facilitate the progress of early stage  work.    Under the premise of increased funding, through strengthened  leadership and coordination, requirements on quality and  progress can be further defined. Different tasks can then be  assigned and various units can relatively quickly produce  quality planning design reports. If funding cannot be increased,  then all our efforts on proof of concept and schemes will be in  vain.    4. Speeding Up the Planning Report. This report should  include details such as voltages of eastbound electricity, stage  development plan, and development sequence. It should be  officially reviewed by the government to serve as the basis for  the design of various stages of hydropower stations. It should  be pointed out that an approved river hydropower planning report  is a necessity to attract capital from other provinces and  countries.    Development of the Jinsha Jiang is a monumental task that is  going to take place between this and the next century. As long  as the government provides stronger leadership, increases the  level of funding for early stage work, relies on science and  technology, takes control over planning and design, formulates  appropriate policies, and obeys the principle of a socialist  market economy in raising construction capital, there is a  possibility that the Jinsha Jiang Hydropower Base project may  start in 2000. By 2010, electricity will be transmitted  eastward. The Jinsha Jiang Hydropower Base will be completed by  2040.     "

0,FT944-17165 ,"FT944-17165 _AN-EJJD1AC5FT 941010   FT  10 OCT 94 / Personal View: Sleepless and irritable in suburbia      By TIM CULLEN   At the height of Washington's long hot summer, my house was without power for 48 hours as storms swept through the area. It brought home to my family the extent to which we rely on electricity for air conditioning, television, to keep food fresh - even to make a hot drink. After two sleepless nights and irritable days, we felt we had been through a major disaster. But we had simply experienced a few inconveniences. We knew we could escape to the car's air conditioning, we could buy fresh food at the supermarket, we could go to the cinema if we became bored with family conversation. As an employee of the World Bank, which is committed to improving the quality of life of the world's poorest people, I could not help comparing our 'devastating' inconvenience with the reality of daily life for the 2bn people in developing countries who have no electricity. The same number of people lack adequate sanitation - at least our bathrooms continued to function during our blackout. We did not much enjoy our lukewarm water and beer, but 1bn people do not have access to safe water. It is little surprise, therefore, that every year more than 3m children in developing countries die of diarrheal disease, not to mention all the other illnesses that result from their living conditions. The 17 per cent of World Bank lending that supports investments in population, health, nutrition and education helps people in ways that are easily recognised. These investments tend to be mutually supportive: educated women, for example, have smaller families and healthier and better-educated children. Such projects often have obvious appeal to the public. An example is the World Bank-financed project which will enable 8m blind people in India - one-fifth of the world's blind - to see again as a result of cataract surgery. Less appealing is that portion of World Bank lending that pays for the provision of electricity, clean water and sewerage. In the last decade the bank has committed Dollars 25bn to electric power projects and more than Dollars 8bn to water and sanitation. The fact is that, in the past 30 years, life expectancy in developing countries has been extended by some 15 years, the number of children dying before the age of five has been halved, and literacy has increased dramatically. Most of the credit must go to the people of the countries themselves, but the investments the World Bank has supported have made a valuable contribution to improving living standards and reducing the incidence of disease. Why then does the World Bank come in for so much criticism - especially over its lending for dams that create electricity and for other large projects? Small can often be beautiful but, for all the advances of the last few decades, the number of people who lack the basics in life is massive. Many can be helped by small-scale, grass-roots efforts, but these must be complemented by the big investments that will bring electricity, water and sanitation to very large numbers of people. Similarly, irrigation projects have contributed to a doubling of food production and an increase in average nutritional intake per person of 20 per cent over the past quarter century. Unfortunately, such larger efforts have the potential to cause environmental damage, and people may have to be resettled. The challenge for the bank and its partners in development is to work with the countries it is trying to help, to keep negative effects to a minimum. The bank has not always been as successful as it would wish - and its own self-critical reports, designed to improve future performance, provide ample fodder for critics. But a vocal minority does not want the bank to do a better job. This group would like the bank to steer clear of any activities that challenge the right of people to live in pristine poverty if there are any negative side effects. Unfortunately, the bank does not have the luxury of turning its back on that which may be controversial or difficult. In 1651, Thomas Hobbes, the English clergyman and philosopher, characterised the life of people living in a simple world of nature - without industry, without trade, and without the benefits of modern inventions - as 'poor, nasty, brutish, and short'. The inconvenience of a few hours without electricity in suburban Washington is a modest reminder of what life is like for the millions without electricity, clean water or sanitation in Bangladesh, Bolivia or Burkina Faso. They must not be condemned to the state described by Hobbes. The author is chief spokesman for the World Bank   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT921-7030 ,"FT921-7030 _AN-CBYA2ADBFT 920225   FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: South American problems lift copper and zinc prices      By LESLIE CRAWFORD and KENNETH GOODING      SANTIAGO, LONDON   COPPER AND Zinc prices rose strongly on the London Metal Exchange yesterday following news of wildcat strikes in Chile and supply problems in Peru. Analysts thought prices of both metals were likely to continue rising in the next few days. Copper for delivery in three months, which yesterday reached Dollars 2,237 a tonne, its highest level for two and a half months, could jump by another Dollars 100 a tonne, driven up by technical factors, they said. In Chile the world's biggest underground copper mine, El Teniente, owned by the Chilean Copper Corporation, was hit by a protest against the weekend sacking of 150 miners. About 2,000 of El Teniente's 9,500 employees downed tools for an hour to demand the their colleagues' reinstatement. The stoppage affected production at the mine, the crushing and concentrating plant, and at the Caletones smelter. Union leaders were due to meet today to consider further action. The protests were sparked by Codelco's attempts to impose a voluntary redundancy scheme to reduce overmanning. The state-owned company says it wants to shed 800 workers at El Teniente by mid-year. But Mr Jose Donoso, a union leader at the mine, said Codelco was victimising miners who had been ill in the past. 'Workers are being forced to take the redundancy package. The scheme is not voluntary at all,' he said. El Teniente's refined copper output in 1991 totalled 278,765 tonnes, about 25 per cent of Codelco's total. The mine was also hit by pay strikes last year. Production has declined in recent years because of the exhaustion of reserves and rock bursts that have closed down important sections of the underground tunnels. Meanwhile, Peru's biggest zinc refinery, Minero Peru's Cajamarquilla, declared force majeure on metal shipments. It said output was being cut by power rationing. Cajamarquilla raised production last year to 93,000 tonnes of zinc from 60,964 tonnes in 1990 when Minero Peru suffered a two-month strike and frequent electricity cuts. Power supply problems are caused mainly by attacks on electricity pylons by the Shining Path, an extreme left-wing guerrilla group. On the LME zinc for immediate delivery closed last night at Dollars 1,120 a tonne, up Dollars 11.50, while three-month metal was Dollars 1,139.50 a tonne, up Dollars 12. Copper ended Pounds 16.25 up at Pounds 1,277.50 a tonne for spot metal while three-months metal was Pounds 13.50 ahead at Pounds 1,298.75 a tonne. Analysts suggested that copper's reaction to potential supply problems was reasonable in that stocks were low and falling on both the LME and the New York Commodity Exchange. However, zinc stocks were likely to go on rising.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

0,FT924-12707 ,"FT924-12707 _AN-CJTB8AA7FT 921020   FT  20 OCT 92 / Leading Article: A government on the run   EVEN AS formidable a politician as Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, cannot make yet another retreat look like a victory. Last week the government insisted that 31 pits should close at once. Now it offers at least a three-month reprieve to 21 of those previously condemned. Regardless of the merits of the case, such a defeat must be damaging. The UK would not be better off under a mob rule of craven Conservatives and backward-looking socialists, baying for more inflation and the preservation of any job, however unneeded. The government has to impose itself upon events once more. The dangers of a total loss of credibility are now severe. A firmly worded commitment has once more proved to be written on water. Will a government so terrified of its backbenchers be able to carry the Maastricht treaty through the House of Commons? Will it be able to close redundant London hospitals, any more than redundant pits? Will it be able to control public spending? Will it, in fact, be able to govern? Even over coal, more defeats may be on the way. First, the government will have to get its revised programme through the House of Commons. Then it will have to endure months of questioning over the closure of the pits that have been given a reprieve. These will be months of demonstrations, months of petitions, months of dismay on the Conservative backbenches and months of wobbling on the frontbenches. Long-term goal The coal saga demonstrates the political advantages of privatisation. It is partly because the government is held responsible for the coal industry that a fairly straightforward industrial decision has created such a political storm. It is partly because adjustment to economic reality was resisted so long that much of the coal industry still seems to be unviable. Neither consideration exculpates the political ineptness of the announcement of these closures. But it does justify the government's longer term aim of creating a normal private industry out of nationalised British Coal. The economic case for closures seems equally persuasive, at least at first sight. Keynes once argued that, short of any better cure for a recession, people should be paid to dig up bottles full of pound notes that had first been sunk into the ground. Paying people to dig up coal that is destined for ever growing stocks would be just as foolish. By now it should have been accepted, even in the UK, that it makes better sense to pay people to produce goods and services that someone actually wants, even in a recession. Independent review Unfortunately, the government's economic case has a large hole in it. Because of the botched electricity privatisation, it is impossible to be confident that the 'dash for gas' is economically sensible. Moreover, while the past militancy of the miners may justify some diversification of energy supplies, the subsidising of nuclear power can hardly be justified at anything like current levels. It is because of the disquiet over the structure of the electricity industry that the Labour party's proposal for an independent review of the coal closures is appealing and may prove persuasive. If the political costs of yet another government climb-down could be ignored, it would make good sense to postpone the decision on coal until after a public review of the implications of the structure of the electricity industry for the efficient use of alternative fuels. Politically, a review would also postpone the evil day of further closures, perhaps to a time when an economic upswing is in evidence. Economically, a thorough review would be the occasion for remedying the defects in electricity privatisation. On its merits, this is an option well worth considering. It would also be another defeat. Since the government has picked a fight with the wrong enemy at the wrong time, further defeat may even be inevitable. All such defeats are damaging to the capacity to govern, which is why it is important to choose one's ground wisely. But what the government most needs is an overall economic strategy. With one, its effectiveness might survive still more compromises over the coal closures. Without one, it is in serious trouble.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "
0,FT923-4412 ,"FT923-4412 _AN-CIGBWAC2FT 920907   FT  07 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK utilities   Using a price cap formula to regulate privatised utilities has brought significant benefits. Companies have exploited this incentive to cut costs, and in many cases shareholders have seen the results in dividend payments. However, the RPI-X system has thrown up some anomalies, where apparently similar businesses currently offer very different rates of return. British Gas's pipeline operation, the regional electricity companies and the National Grid are all reasonably comparable businesses with similar risks and growth prospects, yet on a current cost basis the RECs return around 10 per cent, the grid is said to earn around 6 per cent and the Ofgas regulator wants to pin British Gas to 4.5 per cent. True, there are some reasons for the difference. It is arguable that Gas's assets were privatised too cheaply, so the return on existing assets ought to be correspondingly lower. But the company is unlikely to invest in new pipelines at a return no better than that on index-linked gilts. British Gas clearly hopes that the monopolies inquiry will take the point, though it faces an uphill struggle because any improvement in pipeline returns will have to come out of gas marketing margins or customers' pockets. Part of Gas's problem is historical. The company was told to encourage competition after flotation, and so kept pipeline profits down and marketing margins up to attract a limited amount of competition. However, it has since been forced to give up far more of the gas market than it anticipated, cutting into profits. There is probably room for Gas to expand pipeline returns at the expense of the marketing competition, though unless and until the MMC sees things that way, the shares are in limbo. For the electricity companies, life is brighter. Although it is not formally targeted, their rate of return is bound to be cut in the Periodic Review in 1994. But by then dividend cover will be over three times, and the companies can maintain progressive dividends by simply cutting cover. Shareholders may not even notice the bump to profits.

To manage this increase, more facilities must be  built in the interior of the country.    For mountain enthusiasts, the Hirtstein is a thoroughly  insignificant hill in the Erz Mountains. In contrast, Dr.  Wolfgang Daniels, Director of the Dresden firm of SachsenKraft  GmbH, perceives a milestone in the hill. Not only are the first  wind energy installations of Saxony there. But for the first  time in Germany, after trials in the Eifel, a privately run wind  field was developed on the crest of a low mountain range.    Connected to the power supply grid a good year ago, the  mills  already provide two million kilowatt hours--more than the 750  inhabitants in neighboring Satzung can use. Wind power could  admittedly play a much greater roll in Saxony. Wolfgang Daniels,  together with the Dresden engineering firm of Joerg Kuntzsch    Partner, co-initiator of the Hirtstein wind field, worked out a  wind atlas for the free state (publication date: March 1994).    Wind Fields In the neighborhood of the Hirtstein  alone, 12 additional wind fields could be established. Four  projects are actually already in the planning and authorization  stages; among them are those at the Oberwiesenthal border and in  Joehstadt, where installations with a total rated output of 3.5  MW are to be erected.    ""Naturally it is not our goal to plaster the upper Erz  Mountains nature preserve with modern windmills,"" says Wolfgang  Daniels to ward off objections. But there, where it is possible  and economically sensible, the mountain wind should be used to  produce clean energy. Decentralized wind power installations  could, according to Daniels, meet up to 50 of the  electric  power needs in some administrative districts in the Erz  Mountains. Saxony's Minister of the Environment Arnold Vaatz  even considers half the state to be suitable.    Without opening up new regions of the interior to wind  energy, the goal of the Federal Ministry for Research and  Technology cannot in any case be achieved. According to  assertions from Bonn, the 2,000 MW limit should be reached in  the year 2,000. Wind energy would then still only come to a  modest 0.2 to 0.4 of the electric power produced in  Germany  today. Still, that would mean an annual reduction in  COinf 2/inf  emissions of around four million metric tons.    Oekostrom Project in Saxony: Windmills On the Hirtstein.    Germany's neighbor to the north, Denmark--the world market  leader in the business of wind energy--is much further along.  Finn Hasted, certified engineer and Director at Elkraft, the  Danish producer of energy installations, knows that by the turn  of the century 2.5 of the country's electricity needs  should  be met by windmills. The Danes are increasingly going into the  ocean--they are even already experimenting with 1 MW off-shore  installations.    In order for Germany to make progress in the business of  wind  energy, it is especially important, according to Bernd Neumann,  the Undersecretary of State in the Federal Ministry for Research  and Technology (FMRT), to further reduce the costs of energy  production from wind installations. Even without government  promotional measures--the FMRT development program is to expire  in 1995--they must become competitive. Because of the high cost  of the installations, wind energy today still costs, relative to  the kilowatt hour, up to five times as much as conventionally  produced electricity.    Promotional rates and conditions for the installations  costing between 1,000 German marks (rated output: 0.07 kW) to  1.5 million German marks (600-800 kW)--almost 100 types are  available on the market--have until now varied greatly from  state to state. Dr. Daniels is also skeptical then regarding the  effectiveness of federal promotional politics: ""It doesn't lead  to any real introduction into the market."" Getting on the market  is also hampered by the slow process of obtaining authorization  and by resistance on the part of public utilities to the  unwelcome competition from private wind power operators.  Although obligated for more than a year by the energy supply law  to pay producers 16.53 pfennigs per kilowatt hour, the public  utilities continue to try to push down the price; or they pay,  but slowly.    Wind power installations in the interior, according to  Daniel's counterproposal, should in general be compensated by  150 percent of the avenge end-user price (27 pfennigs) per  kilowatt hour. For example, Aachen: here, since September 1992  per council decision, Oekostrom must be compensated for  costs--still against continuing resistance on the part of local  producers of electricity.    Such compensation would also help the eastern part of  Germany  to catch up with windmills. At the end of 1992 the propellers of  around 1,200 wind power installations were rotating in Germany,  only a few of these in the new states. The leader here, as west  of the Elbe, has long been the North. By April 1993 there were  43 installations in the costal state of  Mecklenburg-Vorpomerania, according to the Institute for Solar  Energy Production Technology at the Polytechnic in Cassel  (ISEPT). In Sachsen-Anhalt there were just eight, in Saxony  seven and in Thueringen only two.    In Brandenburg five windmills have by now fed 1.5 MW of  electricity into the public grid.    In summer the Potsdam Ministry of the Environment presented  a  study on the wind potential of the country, which was worked on  by the Kraftwerks- und Anlagenbau AG [power station and  installation construction company] in Berlin, the Kuntzsch  engineering firm in Dresden and the Green League. The first wind  field in the Brandenburg brown coal region is to be on the tip  of a 300 meter tall overlay near Cottbus. Ten wind power  installations each with a 500 kW output will send electricity  over a five kilometer long underground cable to the Jaenschwalde  power station, from where it will enter the VEAG grid. This  capacity--five Danish and Dutch wind power installations--was  placed on the Hirtstein within a period of a year by the  Daniels/Kuntzsch duo. Rated output: 1,025 kW at a wind velocity  of 10 to 13 m/s.    Unexpected stresses from the weather and surprising  technical  difficulties created problems. ""Quickly changing wind  directions, frost, snow accumulation and sleet made it hard to  manage rotor wings and control technique,"" Daniels remembers.  The operators defrosted the rotors with 300 W halogen lamps, and  in the future UV lamps are also supposed to be installed.    With the mills made by the producer Micon which have  actually  been tested in practice, switching generator levels did not work  at first and the hydraulics of the windbrakes leaked. Downtimes  quickly grew to 15--two million kWh less than predicted.    Still, Daniels is certain that wind energy production on the  crest of the Erz Mountains is proving its worth: ""A few hundred  windmills could soon be turning on both sides of the  German-Czechoslovakian border. This could check the poisonous  fumes coming from the brown coal power plants in the Bohemian  basin, which are killing the forests in the Erz Mountains.""    In the meantime, the wind power pioneers have even won the  support of the locals in the Erz Mountains. At first they had to  take a good look at a citizen's initiative. The most important  counter arguments: Windmills are too loud, they have a negative  affect on the landscape, and they are a danger to birds.    Shutter Mills    The last objection has been refuted by studies carried out  since 1984 in Holland and Lower Saxony and by experience in  Denmark and Sweden: High-tension lines and lighthouses kill more  birds. As for noise, Daniels concedes that ""the beating of the  rotor wings can be heard at distances of 200 meters."" Improved  operation, higher aerodynamics of the wings, and soundproofed  gondolas are still challenges for engineers.    Through personal conversations and the invitation to  evaluate  and discuss the wind field project, the project planners are  finally bringing about a swing in opinion. Since it is been  clear that the project is useful to the community and is not  costing them money, acceptance is assured. When the mills stop  now, Daniels reports, ""the people living in Satzung call me even  in Dresden and ask why Snub-nosed Karl, White Lady, Jolly Hans,  Mazzebille [as written] or Old Hannes are not running.""

It is the main hardship of the so-called special period  in the aftermath of the sudden fall of eastern European  socialism, particularly the fall of socialism in the former  Soviet Union. This lack of oil has had a widespread effect on  all types of transportation services, because Cuba has largely  relied on automotive transportation, which requires not only  fuel, but also lubricants and other important products.    The sugar industry, the most important industry in Cuba,  which is the world's largest sugar exporter, cannot run without  petroleum. However, many sugar refineries are using bagasse as  the main source of fuel for their boilers.    In addition, the country's electrical industry also needs  hydrocarbons to generate energy. Cuba, a small country that  lacks large rivers and waterfalls needed to build hydroelectric  plants, has only two alternatives: thermoelectrical plants,  which also need oil, and nuclear plants. The construction of  the nuclear plant in Juragua, in the central region, was halted  when it was almost finished, because the mighty Soviet state,  which was helping Cuba build its first nuclear plant, suddenly  disappeared. Thus, the Cuban Government is feverishly  negotiating with other countries to complete this project vital  to the national economy. This lack of electricity introduced a  new predicament to the Cuban population, which is exposed to  daily power outages that last several hours, usually at times  when it is most needed.    These brief examples allow us to visualize the problems the  Cuban nation is currently facing, because the world's largest  power is economically blocking and harassing it to subjugate the  political resolve of the Cuban population. Cuba, along with  several European and American countries, has given oil  exploration a large impetus. Cuba has also been able to  significantly increase national crude production since 1959,  when the revolution succeeded.    Oil production is expected to amount to 1.3 million tons  this  year and will continue to grow in the future. Large amounts of  this oil used to generate electricity are too heavy and require  special treatment to reduce the number of breakdowns in the  industry's already worn-out equipment.    Cuba also signed an important agreement with Russia to  exchange 2.5 million tons of oil for 1 million tons of sugar  this year. In addition, a joint operation with Mexico is  already under way to jump start the Cienfuegos oil refinery,  part of whose output will be bought by and consumed in that  country.    After the incident of an alleged meeting that Colombian  guerrillas held in Havana, which jeopardized the recently  established relations between the two countries, there is a  possibility that Colombia will sell some 120,000 barrels of  crude oil daily to Cuba within the framework of a transaction  exclusively regulated by international trade guidelines. Other  efforts are already under way but have yet to materialize. It  is expected that the Cuban economy will experience some kind of  relief this year and will begin surmounting the crisis caused by  the latest political upheavals.     "

0,FT933-2241 ,"FT933-2241 _AN-DITBZACWFT 930920   FT  20 SEP 93 / No reason for a warm glow: A look at UK efforts to meet Rio Summit commitments on global warming      By BRONWEN MADDOX   The UK's progress on meeting targets on global warming will come under the spotlight this week in Manchester at a grandly titled 'Partnerships for Change' forum. The forum is the initiative of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who offered to hold the event for more than 350 environmental pressure groups at last year's Rio Earth Summit. But government officials are wondering whether the guests will bite the hand that feeds them: the meeting will draw attention to whether the UK can meet the Rio targets on global warming at an awkward point in the development of its environmental policy. Under particular scrutiny is the UK's strategy for meeting the Rio commitment to cut emissions of gases which might cause global warming. Although scientists may take decades to establish whether warming is occuring, governments decided at Rio that the threat was so great that immediate action was necessary. Mr Major has called global warming one of Britain's environmental priorities. At Rio, Britain promised to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the main 'greenhouse' gases, to 1990 levels by 2000. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, this means a cut of 10m tonnes of carbon (mtC) on projected levels of emissions, or about 6 per cent. In the past six months the government has published several accounts of how it will make those cuts (see table). But environmentalists - many of them in Manchester today - argue that the government's explanations are inadequate. Tory backbenchers, mindful of the party conference in three weeks, also fear that the proposals are a political minefield. According to the government's latest plan, measures announced in the March Budget - the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and increased road and petrol taxes - will cut emissions by 3mtC, by reducing consumption. But some economists and environmentalists argue that these taxes will not have have much impact on emissions because people's use of transport and household energy is relatively insensitive to price. 'VAT is blunt and its application will produce little by way of a demand response,' says Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates, a forecasting group. In addition, the VAT move has provoked the summer's biggest political storm. Road and car lobby groups have also warned the government that plans to raise vehicle tax will be unpopular. In spite of these concerns the government is likely to press ahead with these revenue-raising measures because of its Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement. Environmentalists have also questioned the likely effectiveness of the Energy Saving Trust, a newly-formed partnership between government and the utilities designed to encourage households to save energy. Headed by Lord John Moore, a former cabinet minister, the trust's brief is to deliver a quarter of the Rio target cuts in emissions. But the trust has had a slow start. In the current year it is likely to invest only a few million pounds in energy-saving projects such as encouraging householders to install more efficient boilers. According to government estimates, the trust needs to invest some Pounds 450m a year in such projects to achieve its share of the carbon emission cuts. The trust's director, Mr Eoin Lees, acknowledges that it 'will be something of a challenge' to expand the trust's annual investments to the level stated by the government by 2000. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the London-based Association for the Conservation of Energy, puts it more bluntly: 'It is hard to see how the trust is on course to achieve a fraction of the targets the government has set.' However, if the trust is successful, it also could, paradoxically, stir up more political trouble: for the cost of its investments will be passed on to all households - including those which have not benefitted from its projects  -as an extra charge on their gas and electricity bills. The government says that if the trust invests the Pounds 450m annually needed to meet the emission targets, the result could be an increase in domestic energy bills of some 4 per cent - on top of the VAT on domestic fuel that is causing such political uproar. This calculation has attracted less attention than the VAT move, but it nevertheless contains the seeds of future trouble. Besides these central planks of its carbon-saving plans, the government hopes that four smaller schemes will collectively save an extra 1mtC - one tenth of the Rio target. The four initiatives are a change in UK regulations on new buildings to encourage better insulation, government backing for a small increase in the share of electricity generated by solar, wind and wave power, and two EC projects known as EMAS and SAVE, which are designed to promote 'green' management and energy efficiency respectively. Together, these measures - the Budget proposals, the Energy Saving Trust and the four smaller schemes - should, the government says, save more than 6.5 mtC in total, two-thirds of the Rio target. Environmentalists, already sceptical of these proposals, were even more startled in July when the prime minister asserted that 'our plans are now complete'. The remaining one-third of the Rio target, he said, would be met by enhanced energy efficiency in business, households and transport, though he refused to spell out the measures. Mr Major's statement raises more questions than it answers. In particular, steadily rising volumes of road traffic - and the government's programme to build more roads - threaten to increase carbon emissions. The government has said it will not address the issues raised by its critics until the end of the year, when it will publish a full and detailed explanation of how it will meet the Rio targets. Does it matter if the government's plans to cut carbon emissions are inadequate? It has invested much of its environmental reputation in publishing a credible plan. Without such a plan the UK government would, in effect, be excluded from the growing debate about whether global warming should be combatted through investment in energy schemes in developing countries, rather than in industrialised ones. However, as far as meeting the Rio 2000 target is concerned, the government may find that recession and the decline of the coal industry cut emissions more effectively than its disparate collection of small carbon-saving schemes. The DTI's forecast that a 10mtC cut is needed to reduce emissions to 1990 levels was based on the assumption of an annual growth in gross domestic product of 2.5 per cent between 1990 and 2000. However, in 1991 GDP fell by 2.3 per cent, and in 1992 by 0.4 per cent, and economists now predict only a sluggish recovery over the next few years. The UK may therefore not need to cut 10mtC to bring emissions back to 1990 levels by 2000. At the same time, the electricity industry may switch more quickly to gas-fired power stations than is assumed in the DTI models. Gas emits less carbon than coal-burning stations, so this will help. So as far as meeting the letter of the Rio targets goes, the government's task may be easier than it first thought, which could compensate for weaknesses in its carbon-saving plans. But what happens beyond 2000? Ministers have acknowledged that although the Rio target is commonly described as 'stabilisation', emissions are likely to rise sharply after that year as the economy continues to grow. If government critics are right, and the UK's schemes to cut carbon emissions are ineffectual, then the country will be poorly placed to tackle those long-term trends. That will be true even if it manages, by virtue of a sluggish economy, to meet the Rio targets by 2000.  ------------------------------------------ BREAKDOWN OF GOVERNMENT PLANS FOR CUTTING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS  ------------------------------------------                                       MtC**                                       saved  ------------------------------------------ VAT on fuel                             1.5 Higher road taxes                       1.5 Energy Saving Trust                     2.5 New building regulations  EC schemes (EMAS, SAVE)  more renewable energy                  1.0 More energy efficiency  in business, transport  and households*                        3.5  ------------------------------------------ Total                                  10.0  ------------------------------------------ ** million tonnes carbon * including installation of 'combined heat and power' generators to supply electricity and heating to blocks of flats, hospitals and businesses  ------------------------------------------   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Now  that the lunar energy station study group of the Foundation for  Promotion of Material Science and Technology of Japan (MST) has  completed its report based on a year-long investigation  conducted by specialists from industry, government, and academic  circles, the first meeting will be held on the 21st at Kogakuin  University's Shinjuku campus in Tokyo.    The plan for the new nuclear power plant, which is the  central theme of this energy development initiative for infinite  space, will likely draw much attention. The new power plant is  supposed to be able to convert electric energy directly from the  thermal energy emitted from its reactor, using a functionally  gradient material (FGM) ultra high efficiency energy conversion  system for the reactor core structure.    The lunar energy station development initiative was based by  several assumptions, including the inevitability of an energy  crisis in the future, the need to promote the safety of ground  nuclear power generation, the importance of an economical source  of power for space development, and progress on development of  FGM that can be used as a high efficiency thermoelectric  conversion material.    The solar energy plant employs a new nuclear reactor concept  that converts energy directly into electricity without using  turbines and water like current nuclear power plants do. This is  where FGM plays its role.    According to the plan, the electric energy thus produced  will  be transmitted to an energy relay station which travels in earth  orbit in the form of a high transmission efficieny waveband  laser beam. Then its wave length will be changed to a high  atmospheric transmission efficiency waveband laser and sent to  an energy receiver on the ground. From here, the electricity  will be distributed to various places through a ground  transmission system.    At the meeting, papers will be given by specialists who took  part in the study. They will include the ``Energy and LEP (Lunar  Energy Park) Initiative in the 21st century'' (by Masayuki Niino  of the National Aerospace Laboratory) and subjects such as  transportation systems to the moon, the lunar energy station,  energy transmission to the earth, and ground receiving system.    FGM is a next generation new material with highly  sophisticated functions. The idea originated in Japan.  Production of FGM calls for a gradual change in the composition  of the material from one side to the other. As a result, the  properties on either side of the material are completely  different. It is drawing much attention as a material useful for  heat resistant structural materials for space as well as for the  development of high efficiency and high power output energy  conversion systems.              Graphic       Although the idea is still in the formative stage, giant  projects such as this in space development require nationwide  discussion and formation of a consensus, as well as a system of  international cooperation. The lunar energy station study group  hopes that communication on this subject will continue after  this conference.     "

0,FT924-933 ,"FT924-933 _AN-CLUB4ACTFT 921221   FT  21 DEC 92 / International Company News: City welcomes electricity sale - Welsh Water can now change its direction      By ANGUS FOSTER   LAST week's sale by Welsh Water of its 14.9 per cent stake in South Wales Electricity is a mark of how serious the company has become about putting its house in order ahead of the 1994-95 review by Ofwat, the regulatory authority, which will decide pricing levels until the end of the decade. The move should blunt criticism of Welsh's ambitious diversification policy. It follows a decision in June to voluntarily give up some price increases, ahead of other water companies, and silence critics of its profit levels. The electricity stake was always controversial, even though Welsh made more than Pounds 17m profit on the investment. Mr John Elfed Jones, chairman, claimed the two utilities could make savings by combining functions like billing and information technology. Unfortunately, in the narrow world of Welsh business, the aggressive style in which the stake was taken led South Wales to treat it as hostile and reject all advances on co-operation. Welsh's decision to sell was welcomed in the City, which feared the company's expansion plans could lead to conflict with Ofwat. 'It shows it is possible to admit you've got something wrong and get out with credit,' according to Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, analyst at County NatWest. The sale clears the way for Welsh to change direction on its unregulated business. Mr Jones steps down as chairman in April and strategy will be led by his successor, Mr Iain Evans, and group managing director Mr Graham Hawker. Welsh's unregulated business, which includes engineering consultant Wallace Evans, hotel and leisure group Hamdden and an 'enterprise' company with pipeline and waste contracting, will probably become lower key. Plans to develop Hamdden are likely to remain on hold. Some analysts believe Welsh would sell the division if hotel prices had not fallen so much. This will leave Welsh to concentrate on its core, regulated business ahead of Ofwat's review and gradually develop its enterprise businesses, most of which were spun out of the core following privatisation and are lower risk. According to Mr Hawker: 'We intend to give our non-regulated businesses more focus, and only in areas where our core skills are relevant'. Most analysts agree that because Welsh's capital investment targets were less onerous than others, its price rises agreed at privatisation were generous. Its post-1995 price increases, initially set at 5 per cent above inflation, look vulnerable to regulatory review. The electricity sale, and the voluntary abatement of some price increases earlier this year, will go some way towards improving Welsh's regulatory image. 'This reduces the chances of them being harshly treated at the review, although they are not totally out of the woods,' one analyst said. The sale may also mark a watershed for the water sector generally. Because the regulated environment is expected to become tougher following Ofwat's review, companies argue that unregulated businesses will become more important as a source of profits to maintain dividend growth. Welsh's expansion outside water-related fields was the most high profile, but few other water companies have been successful developing non-core businesses. Some, such as Southern Water, are making profits from businesses like pipe-laying which have been transferred out of the core. But others, Severn Trent among them, which expanded more aggressively have yet to make money. Severn Trent last year paid Pounds 212m for Biffa, involved in waste management, and which is expected to make operating profits of about Pounds 12m this year, compared to interest costs of Pounds 25m. Main problem with Biffa, and engineering ventures made by other companies, is the recession. Welsh regularly complained that some of its enterprise businesses were at the start up stage and during recession should not be expected to make money. Because of the pressure to maintain dividend growth, water companies will continue to try and develop unregulated businesses, even moving into unrelated fields. However, following Welsh's tactical withdrawal, companies are unlikely to make high-profile acquisitions to diversify ahead of the 1994 review.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

The Channel tunnel has arrived. Most of the construction and electrical installation has been completed apart from the odd bit of concreting, painting, landscaping and, most important, the fitting-out of the control towers. Commercial services are due to start next year. The terminals - at Coquelles in northern France and Folkestone in Kent  - look much as they will when public services are running, down to the foundations and overhead gantries for the toll booths. The main structures, including control towers and amenity and rest areas, have been completed. Facilities for customs and immigration have been provided, even though it is not clear what border controls will be required following the removal of trade barriers between European Community countries. The electricity sub-station at the Folkestone terminal which will provide power - using French electricity - is partially operating. Hiring and training of train crews and traffic controllers started last year. They will be expected to speak fluent English and French. Even toll-booth operators will attend a two-week language course. Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, has hired 1,100 of the 2,650 full-time staff it will need. There will be about the same numbers of British and French workers, with 5 per cent drawn from other nationalities. Some big problems remain. The system has to be tested thoroughly before Eurotunnel can receive an operating licence from a specially established Franco-British inter-governmental commission. Full-scale fire and evacuation tests will have to be conducted underground. Managers will have to be satisfied that control and signalling systems will work properly when connected up and that procedures for loading and unloading vehicles on shuttle waggons will not delay services. Passenger shuttles, each carrying up to 120 cars and 800 passengers, are expected to run every 15 minutes at peak times. The 50km journey will take about 35 minutes, at a maximum speed of 130kph. There will also be mainline passenger and freight trains run by BR and SNCF, the British and French rail networks, which could mean trains entering and leaving the tunnels every three minutes. Delivery of locomotives and wagons has already been delayed. A dispute over costs between Eurotunnel and Transmanche Link, the consortium of five British and five French construction companies building the Pounds 8bn-plus project, could delay further commissioning and testing. The opening date, originally planned for May, has been put back to December and Eurotunnel says it could open either side of Christmas. Some construction companies say it may not open until March or even later next year. No matter who wins in the row over costs, the system is built. Even in the unlikely event that Eurotunnel failed, somebody would take over the project. All that is needed is the passengers and the cars and history will have been made.

Is it really more energy-efficiency and more  maintenance-free as the contractors tell me?    ANSWER: The most recent major design innovation for central air conditioners is  a high-efficiency scroll compressor in place of a standard piston-type  compressor. A new scroll compressor air conditioner can cut your electric bills  significantly and minimize maintenance costs.    Several air conditioner manufacturers are now using scroll compressors with  seasonal energy efficiency ratios (SEER) up to 12. Your old unit may have a  SEER as low as 6. SEER relates the amount of cooling output of a central air  conditioner to the amount of electricity it uses.    By its design, the scroll compressor is very reliable. Unlike conventional  compressors with many moving parts, pistons, valves, seals, etc., a scroll  compressor has only four moving parts.    As it gets older, the few moving parts of a scroll compressor actually wear in  and operate better. It is also more tolerant of foreign matter and fluids in  the system.    Without the pistons and valves used in a standard compressor, a scroll  compressor operates more quietly and more vibration-free. This is an advantage  both for you and your neighbors.    The operating principle of a scroll compressor is simple. Two spiral-shaped  members fit together. One remains stationary, while the other orbits relative  to it. This creates gas pockets which gradually decrease in size to compress  the Freon.    Since several pockets of Freon are compressed simultaneously in the scroll  members, it produces a smooth and nearly continuous compression cycle. In  contrast, a standard piston compressor produces fewer and larger compression  pulses per cycle.    When you select a new central air conditioner, have your contractor do a  detailed heat gain analysis for your house. Many use computers and  sophisticated programs. An improperly sized central air conditioner not only  wastes electricity, but doesn't provide the best comfort level.    You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 042, showing a list of  manufacturers, model numbers and SEER's of air conditioners using scroll  compressors, a chart showing the electricity saving by installing a  high-efficiency unit and more detailed information on the scroll compressor.

Alarms Required to Have Battery, Power    Q: I have heard that some areas require smoke alarms that are powered by both  batteries and regular house electricity. Since these operate continuously, will  they be expensive to operate?    A: The amount of current usage is very low and the operating cost is  negligible. The reason for requiring two power sources, batteries and house  current, is that people often let the batteries run down. They plan to replace  them, but never get around to doing it, and then they forget. Without power,  the smoke alarm provides no protection.    To keep people from removing the batteries to avoid annoying false alarms when  cooking, some new smoke alarms offer a hush control. This allows you to press a  button to temporarily decrease the sensitivity of the alarm. It resets to  normal sensitivity automatically.

The reason for requiring two power sources, batteries and house  current, is that people often let the batteries run down. They plan to replace  them, but never get around to doing it, and then they forget. Without power,  the smoke alarm provides no protection.    To keep people from removing the batteries to avoid annoying false alarms when  cooking, some new smoke alarms offer a hush control. This allows you to press a  button to temporarily decrease the sensitivity of the alarm. It resets to  normal sensitivity automatically.

0,FT934-6948 ,"FT934-6948 _AN-DKWCOAAMFT 931123   FT  23 NOV 93 / Ukraine shivers as energy dwindles      By JILL BARSHAY      KIEV   Ukraine's rapidly dwindling energy supplies have prompted the prime minister, Mr Yefim Zviagilsky, to call for an 'economic state of emergency' to force energy saving measures. The energy ministry has warned that Ukraine has reserves for just one month. If nothing was done to help import gas and oil, the ministry said, Ukraine 'could expect an Armenian winter' - referring to last winter when Armenians lived without heat and electricity during their war with Azerbaijan. Ukrainian enterprises have already been asked to reduce the gas they use by 30 per cent, and some factories have been ordered to halve their energy consumption. Bankrupt Ukraine, reliant on Russia for about 90 per cent of its oil and gas, owes its eastern neighbour about Dollars 700m (Pounds 470m) for energy. Negotiations to swap debt for Ukraine's share of the Black Sea fleet have stalled and the republic has no money for energy shipments. According to the energy ministry Dollars 300m worth of oil and gas is needed immediately, and it is urging the government to resume negotiations with Russia for special winter deliveries. It calculates that Dollars 9bn worth of oil and gas will be needed to get through 1994 without factory closures. Russia has been raising energy prices in an effort to stop its subsiding of former Soviet republics. It currently charges Ukraine about 70 per cent of world prices - in roubles, rather than Ukraine's currency, which has lost more than 80 per cent of its value in the past three months. But the Ukrainian economy has been too weak to absorb these price shocks. Kiev subsidises electricity for the domestic market by about 90 per cent, and is thus unable to cover the cost of energy imports with receipts from its sale. Instead, the republic's leaders have used export earnings from agriculture and metals. But their recent currency control policies have discouraged official exports, leaving state coffers empty. Ukraine is only earning Dollars 15m a week, and it needs around Dollars 20m a day for energy. Ukraine's domestic energy sector provides about half the country's needs, but is experiencing difficulties. Nuclear power stations are plagued by shortages of fuel and safety concerns. Coal mines are nearly exhausted and are controlled by politically active unions who frequently strike. The energy crisis is now dominating parliament, and has prompted a special energy producers' congress and an emergency cabinet meeting on the subject. Some argue that the government needs to issue more credits, but as the parliamentary chairman, Mr Ivan Plyshch, points out: 'If you want paper, the so-called legal currency, I can give the order for the printing presses to start running right away. But that would only add to hyperinflation.' Ironically, the energy crunch is forcing Kiev's Soviet-style leaders to contemplate the previously unthinkable: closing down inefficient industries. 'Since we can't stop heating homes or supplying agriculture with fuel, we must close down a number of high-energy-use enterprises,' said Mr Vilen Semenyuk, energy minister. 'The only other choice is to get more fuel.' Meanwhile, with temperatures touching minus 20'C, Ukrainians are adjusting to power cuts and colder homes and offices in the worst winter for 50 years.

At that time, Americans raised the price  of a liter of gasoline by 10 cents, and there were incidents of  shooting at gas stations. Estonia's energetics has survived a  major price shock over the past two years. Coal, heating oil,  natural gas, diesel fuel and gasoline have been brought to world  market prices. ""Oil shale and electricity are not at world  market prices,"" says Niitenberg, satisfied that Estonia has  moved into world economy. The price of gasoline in Estonia and  the world price of unprocessed crude are now linked.    One dramatic example of relentlessly rising prices is the  754-time jump in the price of natural gas, as compared to the  Soviet era. The minister believes that our energy policy which,  in its formative stages, drew praise from its teachers like the  World Bank, the European Bank of Development and Reconstruction,  and other organizations, will make Estonia stronger in the  future. The days of wasting cheap energy are over.    No More Sudden Price Hikes    ""As is happening elsewhere, the price of energy in Estonia  will still be going up, but I don't foresee any sudden jumps,""  says Niitenberg and finds that the price of electricity, for  example, is favorably low, compared to some of our neighbors. He  does not believe that the price of electricity will ever go up  to Finland's level (5 times higher than ours), and that Estonia  will always have an advantage. Electricity is unnaturally cheap  in Russia but, compared to other neighboring states, Estonian  producers enjoy a certain advantage.    While the consumption of electricity has been going up  lately, the demand for liquid fuel has been dropping. During  1993, only 600,000 tonnes of heating oil were consumed, compared  to its previous consumption levels of up to 1,600,000 tonnes a  year.    ""Part of that difference is attributable to user economy,  the  rest to a general economic decline. I believe we can increase  production without drastically increasing the demand for energy.  We have to reduce the energy loss that currently amounts to  roughly one third of the total. If that part of the energy could  be used to develop the economy, energy expenditures would not  have to go up for the time being,"" Niitenberg says. As an  example, he cites Denmark, where energy consumption goes up by  less than 1 percent, yet the economy is developing at a much  faster rate. This is the result of energy conservation programs.  The Danes have made a transition to more modern heating systems,  they have financing. Estonia, by contrast, is plagued by lack of  capital.    The Proportion of Domestic Fuel Is Small    ""For the development of energetics, we have received loans  from the European Community totaling 76.7 million Estonian  kroons. With that money, more than 140 energy-related projects  have been carried out in different parts of Estonia. These have  been mostly small plants for local parish use, installed to make  a transition to domestic fuel, and to reduce energy loss,""  Niitenberg says.    The proportion of domestic fuel sources is currently not as  great in Estonia as it is in our neighboring countries. Timber  and peat provide 3.5 percent of the necessary energy. In the  Nordic countries, this share is roughly 7 percent; in Finland  between 12 and 13 percent.    ""It would be possible to increase the share of timber and  peat to 10 percent. It is interesting to note that, even though  Estonia imports much of its fuel, close to 70 percent of the  energy is obtained locally. In this respect we are much better  off than Latvia or Lithuania. We have oil shale, electricity,  timber and peat, only liquid fuel and natural gas are brought  in,"" Niitenberg says.    Estonia Needs an Explosives Plant    Out of the production cost for oil shale, one third goes for  explosives which, for the time being, are still coming from our  eastern neighbors. Prices of explosives and fuses have gone up  and that, in turn, has jacked up the price of oil shale. Eesti  PÅolevkivi [Estonian Oil Shale] is in the process of  negotiating with a Swedish and a German firm for putting up an  explosives plant in Estonia, specifically for mining. Depending  on technology, this will require an investment of roughly $5 to  $10 million. A study is being conducted to show how fast the  plant can pay for itself.    ""Last year, 13.5 million tonnes of oil shale were produced  in  Estonia, and I cannot see that volume going down in the near  future. We can tell potential foreign buyers that the market is  stable, and give them certain guarantees,"" Niitenberg thinks.    Send Us Pressure Pipe, Not Experts    Both firms are interested, but are still busy looking for  marketing possibilities in other nearby regions. Niitenberg  thinks there are certain advantages to investing in Estonia. It  is not like dealing with the Third World countries, who cannot  manage on their own. We have technical know-how and an  industrial infra-structure. All we need is modern technology.    ""In my dealings with foreigners, I have had to repeat, time  and again, please believe me, we also have experts. We would  rather have 300 meters of pressure pipe than seven experts,""  says Niitenberg, convinced that Estonia can offer some excellent  specialists in the area of energetics. In addition to capital,  we also lack the skill of organizing the work.    A Strategic Reserve Would Be Necessary    Lack of capital also stands in the way of creating a  strategic reserve of fuel. Niitenberg is a believer in having  strategic reserves, the only question being what is the most  effective way of using the financial resources available. For  Estonia to to maintain a three-month reserve of liquid fuel,  would tie up $300 to $400 million.    ""Estonia is not rich enough to let such amounts sit idle.  First, a decision needs to be made how much of a reserve should  be maintained. This presumes that we know what we want to be  insured against. We have the facilities for storing liquid fuel,  but not for natural gas, 100 percent of which comes in from  Russia. Putting those up would take an extremely large  investment, the closest usable storage facilities are located in  Latvia,"" Niitenberg says, adding that the question of strategic  reserves has been discussed in government and has been assigned  to the working group of the Economic Ministry. The problem is  wider in scope, and includes the areas of medicine, food and  other such.    Refining Plant To Cost $1 Billion    Canada, where Niitenberg worked for many years in leading  positions within the energy system, had a relatively low level  of reserves. Emphasis was placed on infra-structure, making sure  that fuel could be moved immediately whenever needed. The  reserves of liquid fuel were distributed between big oil  companies, with the state keeping track of how fast some company  or other could obtain a certain quantity of fuel. Most of the  responsibility was borne by Petro Canada, a company similar to  our Eesti KÆutus [Estonian Fuel]. There is always the  question: Can the state place an obligation on a private company?    ""In case of a possible crisis, we have two choices. Either  we  have barrels stored somewhere, or we have a firm plan for how to  transport the necessary amount of fuel from some refining plant  in Denmark or Poland to Estonia within three days. Putting up  our own plant would require a capital outlay of $800 to $900  million, whereas transportation, storage and other support  services for import have improved significantly as of late.    ""In Canada, I dealt with electricity that could not be kept  in reserve. For unexpected situations, alternatives had to be  found,"" Niitenberg says.    A Nuclear Plant Does Not Have To Be Hazardous    Among specialists, there has also been talk about putting up  a nuclear power plant in Estonia. Speaking of money, Niitenberg  volunteered the cost of the Darlington nuclear power plant as an  example. Ontario Hydro, the Canadian company where Niitenberg  worked before coming to Estonia, and where he still has a  position waiting for him, invested 14 billion Canadian dollars  in building this 3,600 MW capacity power plant. This project,  designed for an operating life of 30 to 40 years, is not  expected to turn a profit for the first 10 years.    ""The possibility of putting up a nuclear power plant should  be analyzed, above all, from an economic point of view. If the  potential profit is a mere two cents per kilowatt, it will  obviously not be worth the risk. It would be a completely  different situation, however, if the nuclear plant would enable  us to produce electricity at half the previous cost. One of the  biggest burdens imaginable is a nuclear plant that does not work  efficiently or does not have a sufficient load. However, atomic  power plants can turn out to be extremely profitable. We should  not dismiss any of the alternatives on simply emotional grounds,  even though we know what happened at Chernobyl and what is going  on in Paldiski, where the biggest danger is over by now,"" says  Niitenberg, who was in charge of 20 nuclear power plants in  Canada, and who has a daughter involved in liquidating nuclear  power plant accidents.    ""As long as everything is well organized, this field is not  as dangerous as it is thought to be. If that were not so, I  would not have allowed my daughter to work in this field. It is  significant that, in accordance with international agreements,  information should be disclosed on any accident so that  appropriate conclusions could be drawn by nuclear energy  specialists in neighboring countries and throughout the world.  At Chernobyl, this agreement was violated,"" Niitenberg explained.    Future Will Bring New Solutions    Niitenberg thinks that this issue will not come up on  Estonia's agenda before the year 2000, for sure, and that it  will take a political decision, in principle, either by  politicians or by a referendum.    As far as the future of energetics for the whole world goes,  Niitenberg does not deign offer anything specific.    ""If I knew the solution, I would become a very rich man,"" he  laughs and thinks that bio-energetics will develop, for sure.  Also feasible is the so-called fusion method, which  is the next step in harnessing nuclear energy, based on the  ability of heavy hydrogen isotopes to combine into helium at  extremely high temperatures, yielding energy from the neutron  thus released.    To the question about current fuel reserves and how long  they  will last, Niitenberg replies with another question: For what  kind of money? Canada has supposedly more crude oil than all  Arab countries combined but, due to natural conditions, pumping  it out would cost 30 times more than the current norm.     "
0,FT924-1396 ,"FT924-1396 _AN-CLRBYAB7FT 921218   FT  18 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs may back extension for coal      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   POSTPONING the deregulation of the electricity market is likely to be the centrepiece of the proposals of the Commons select committee on trade and industry to boost the coal industry. MPs believe this would provide a necessary three to four year 'bridge' for British Coal to raise productivity to a level where it would compete on world markets. MPs finished two months' of hearings this week and aim to have their report ready by mid-January, ahead of a white paper by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Postponing deregulation would extend present arrangements which give British Coal protected access to 70 per cent of the domestic power generation market. Under the current timetable, its protected access will be reduced to 50 per cent of the market in 1994. The all-party committee, chaired by Mr Richard Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, is also warming to the idea of an energy commission to set policy and provide long-term stability. Members are concerned that the government does not have adequate powers to manage the energy market, and that it is leaving the regulators in command. Other measures the committee is considering include: Making the cross-channel link with the French electricity grid revert to its intended role as a balance to cover peaks and troughs, rather than as a source of imports. Stopping the switch to orimulsion, derived from coal waste, as a power station fuel. Diverting part of the nuclear levy into the coal industry, but as a subsidy for cleaner coal technology rather than a price support. This would get round EC limits on energy price subsidies. Requiring British Coal to squeeze the last coal out of doomed pits. This could be done cheaply as part of a 'rape and pillage' exercise, and the coal offered on the export market at world prices. These measures could boost coal demand by over 30m tonnes a year, though between 20-25m tonnes is more likely. MPs seem unlikely to support other widely canvassed options such as cutting back the nuclear power industry to make more room for coal. This would involve heavy decommissioning costs. But in return for being spared the axe, nuclear power could be made to give up a portion of its levy income. Making an outright subsidy for coal is unlikely to be suggested because of the state of public finances. It also looks as if the committee will leave gas alone because of the lack of clear evidence that it is stealing market share from coal.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

That should help to overcome the  bureaucratic obstacles within the Union. Rexrodt wants to use a  team of independent experts, composed of scientists,  businessmen, and lawyers, to examine these issues. They should  check EU provisions to establish whether companies and consumers  are being burdened with unnecessary costs. The minister did,  however, say that the subject was ""dynamite in Europe"" and would  be rejected by Jacques Delors, the EU president.    Rexrodt talked about the main tasks that he envisaged when  Germany takes over the EU presidency on 1 July. Those tasks  included overcoming unemployment and strengthening competition.  An unemployment figure of over 17 million in Europe sounds an  alarm bell in Europe, said Rexrodt in Bonn. Fortunately,  economic recovery had started in many EU member states. This  positive development has to be secured and developed. The  European Council action program for growth, competitiveness, and  employment can provide a basis for this. It seemed to be  particularly important to Rexrodt to oversee the implementation  of this plan. It would be sensible for the European states to  report to the Council of Minister on successes and failures.    In individual laender -- while considering the specific  situation in each of them -- the issue is one of consolidating  public budgets, developing labor market policy instruments, and  reducing bureaucracy. Next year, the European Commission is to  expand the number of its members from the current 17 to 21.    Rexrodt also said it is important to liberalize the European  electricity and gas markets: When that happens, competitive  distortions between member states will have to be eliminated.  In the case of energy production, companies should experience a  healthy degree of competition. In this respect, an EU guideline  is necessary, one that would increase the possibilities for  transferring gas and electricity through foreign networks and  would result in the disappearance of the current demarcation  agreements. There are substantial differences on this issue  within Germany. Thus, municipal authorities want to retain their  rights to issue exclusive permits for the supply of energy. The  Environment Ministry feels that it has been disregarded by the  Economics Ministry, because Rexrodt's ministry has not accorded  sufficient attention to environmental considerations and because  coordination between the ministries does not function.    Further, Rexrodt thinks it is necessary to create clear-cut  prospects for Central and East European states. In this  respect, Germany has a particular duty. Thus, the negotiations  on the free trade agreements with the Baltic states should be  concluded during the German presidency. The Commission could  then shortly present the draft of a mandate for the conclusion  of an agreement with those states. As far as the applications  for membership submitted by Poland and Hungary are concerned,  membership negotiations are conceivable only when the situation  in those countries would permit that. In the meantime, the  European Union will have to develop its policy of opening up  markets by dismantling tariffs and other restrictions. Rexrodt  does not consider the ideas that he has outlined to be ""a list  of wishes,"" but sees there being good prospects of real progress  in the areas in question.     "
