The report, entitled Tobacco Trade or Aid?, by the International Tobacco Growers' Association, examines the impact of a hypothetical fall in demand of 10 per cent by 1995 on the economies of six developing countries. The association promotes the interests of tobacco-growing organisations around the world, including those from the US and Canada as well as Latin America and Africa. It concludes that the six countries - Brazil, Bulgaria, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Zimbabwe - would suffer a collective loss of nearly Dollars 120m from a fall in export volumes of more than 59,000 tonnes. Malawi and Zimbabwe depend most heavily on tobacco for foreign exchange. Malawi's tobacco exports last year accounted for 59 per cent of total exports and contributed 16.7 per cent of gross domestic product. The loss of 10 per cent of projected tobacco export earnings in 1995 would be equivalent to 6 per cent of the aid it received in 1991, the report says. For Zimbabwe, the potential loss of Dollars 41m in foreign exchange would represent the equivalent of 25.7 per cent of its 1992 balance of payments deficit, and more than half the country's spending on social security and welfare. Pointing to the WHO's objective of a fall of more than 10 per cent in smoking in at least 20 per cent of its member states by 1995, compared with 1988, the report attacks what it calls 'a new imperialism'. 'Denied the dignity of contributing to their own development through foreign exchange earnings from tobacco, all the countries profiled in the present study and many other would. . . become more dependent on the largesse of the aid donor community,' it says. Last year the association published a report arguing that there were no sustainable alternative crops that would achieve the same level of earnings for most tobacco farmers. The Overseas Development Administration in London said yesterday it was looking at ways of helping developing countries find sustainable alternatives to tobacco. Since 1991, ODA policy has been to refuse to fund or support projects in the tobacco sector. Tobacco Trade or Aid? ITGA, PO Box 125, Forest Row, East Sussex RH18 5FA, England.

BAT said Brown  Williamson, the third largest cigarette company in the US, increased market share in the first half of 1994 from 10.3 per cent to 11.3 per cent, largely recovering the share it lost last year when Philip Morris cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes. BW increased domestic volumes by 20 per cent following a shake-up of its sales force, and export volumes by more than 10 per cent. Operating profits increased 76 per cent to Pounds 217m, benefiting from price increases in value-for-money brands which account for 60 per cent of its US business. BAT's performance outside the US was also strong. British-American Tobacco lifted trading profits 9 per cent, in spite of difficult conditions in some markets. Sales and profits in all operating divisions were up, with particularly strong performances in Chile, Argentina, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia. However, trading profits were down at BAT Cigarettenfabriken, the German business, because of a provision for relocation of a research facility. German sales improved, although total exports fell in spite of a big increase in exports to eastern Europe. A problem area was the Souza Cruz business in Brazil, where Pounds 80m profits last year were wiped out by weak economic conditions which led to downtrading and increased cross-border imports. BAT said action by the Brazilian government to stabilise the economy was likely to lead to improvement next year. Imperial Tobacco in Canada increased volumes and profits, benefiting from the elimination of border trade after domestic tax reductions.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.

TDK's sales of electronic materials and components were off by 3.4 per cent to Y91.4bn. However, the company said it increased sales of thin film and other magnetic heads, metal magnets and chip capacitors. The company also increased sales of audiotape and videotape in the face of stagnant market conditions. Floppy disks and satellite receiving antennae sales also rose, producing an 11.3 per cent rise in TDK's recording media division to Y42.12bn.

ACTION:     Notice of proposed rulemaking.              SUMMARY:     ATF is proposing to amend trade practice regulations   under the Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act on   tied-house, exclusive outlets, commercial bribery, and   consignment sales by adding standards for enforcing the   ``exclusion'' element where appropriate and by revising other   regulations as the result of an agency review and an industry   petition. Under the FAA Act, ``exclusion, in whole or in part,   of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages, sold or offered   for sale by other persons'' is a necessary element of a   violation of the tied-house, exclusive outlets or commercial   bribery provisions. Recent court rulings have raised questions   concerning ATF's traditional interpretation of the term   ``exclusion''. ATF intends to use rulemaking to   (1) promulgate a framework for establishing ``exclusion,'' (2) identify promotional practices which result in retailer   control, (3) identify promotional practices which result in   exclusion under the Act, and (4) identify those practices for   which there is no likelihood that exclusion will result and for   which the Bureau will not take action (safe harbors). Other   regulatory amendments are also made as a result of an ATF   review of the regulations and an industry petition submitted in   1992.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       The Federal Alcohol Administration Act       The Federal Alcohol Administration Act (hereinafter   referred to as FAA Act or Act) provides for Federal regulation of the alcoholic beverage industry. The FAA Act contains   particular restrictions that are unique to the alcoholic   beverage industry and reflects Congress' concern with a variety   of trade practices and abuses that took place before, during   and immediately after Prohibition. This notice of proposed   rulemaking focuses on four parts of the statute, Exclusive   Outlet (27 U.S.C. 205(a)), Tied-House (27 U.S.C.   205(b)), Commercial Bribery (27 U.S.C. 205(c)), and Consignment   Sales (27 U.S.C. 205(d)). The supplementary information is   divided into two sections. The first section deals with the   subject of exclusion, and the second section covers other   changes proposed as a result of an internal review of trade   practice regulations and an industry petition.      Exclusion       One element which is necessary for these practices to   result in violation of Federal law is ``exclusion, in whole or   in part, of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages, sold or   offered for sale by other persons.''   Although exclusion is not defined in the FAA Act or in the   current implementing regulations at 27 CFR parts 6, 8 and 10,   ATF has, in the past, held that ``exclusion in part'' includes   causing retailers to purchase less of a competing brand than   they otherwise would have bought.   In a recent decision, however,     Fedway Associates, Inc., et   al.     v.     United States Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (Fedway),     976 F.2d 1416 (DC Cir. 1992) the United   States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,   held that Congress had intended something more than just a   retailer purchasing less of a competing brand than it otherwise   would have and for a violation to occur there must also be a   tie or link between a supplier and retailer that at least   threatens the retailer's independence.   The court based this conclusion on several points. The   court said ``exclusion'' means to exclude a rival product from   the marketplace by some direct action of the violator. Merely   taking some action which influences a retailer not to purchase   a rival product is not exclusion under the Act if the   retailer's response is the result of a free economic choice.   This interpretation of exclusion as meaning the shutting out or   expelling of a rival's product, according to the court, is   consistent with conduct addressed by the Act such as   tied-house, commercial bribery and exclusive outlets. Any   broader interpretation would, in the view of the court, likely   result in restriction of pro-competitive activities.

Sales in the whole of Germany were up 3 per cent, 2 per cent higher than in December. The increase was led by a 14 per cent year-on-year rise in sales of cars and components. Pharmaceuticals sales were up 11 per cent, and home furnishings 9 per cent. There was a 1 per cent drop in sales of food, drink and tobacco, and a 4 per cent fall in textiles, clothing and shoes. Overall economic activity in Germany 'increased noticeably' around the turn of the year, the economics ministry said. The ministry cited growing foreign demand, 'lively' housebuilding and 'further clear progress' in eastern Germany's recovery as factors underlying this resurgence. Russia's industrial output rose 2.3 per cent in February from January, but was 24.1 per cent below the level of a year earlier, the sharpest drop since start of reforms in 1992. Some 4,280 enterprises shut down some or all production last month. Spanish industrial producer prices rose 1.1 per cent in January, compared with a 0.2 per cent rise in December and 0.8 per cent in January 1993.

A rise in the futures market prompted by the easing of the yen and Friday's rally on Wall Street triggered arbitrage buying in the morning. In the afternoon, the index faced profit-taking by institutional investors booking profits ahead of the September book closing. The Topix index of all first section stocks was finally 4.39 ahead at 1,640.08 and the Nikkei 300 up 0.76 at 298.37. Advances led declines by 592 to 327, with 222 issues unchanged. Traders said that while buying orders from public funds were putting a floor under the market, the Nikkei 225 lacked the support to rise above 21,000. 'There seem to be a lot of selling orders from corporations around the 20,700 level,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Overseas investors remained on the buying side, and supported the steel sector. Volume contracted from 233m shares to 206m, most investors staying inactive ahead of the Japan Tobacco auction results.

Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 183.7m to Pounds 194.8m in the six months to September 30, while sales increased by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 1.25bn (Pounds 1.71bn). The group said the home shopping side lifted sales by 5 per cent to Pounds 780.5m, helped by increased investment in warehouses, distribution and marketing, and operating profits rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 81.5m. Overseas retailing boosted operating profit by 24 per cent to Pounds 10.8m on turnover of Pounds 83.3m, a rise of 6.4 per cent. South Africa produced a good result, but the Canadian performance had been affected by economic problems. Sales of Burberrys products, including royalties, rose 10 per cent to Pounds 71.2m with operating profits were up 6 per cent at Pounds 12.5m. GUS said prudent lending policies enabled the consumer and corporate finance division to contain bad debt and this contributed to a modest 1.5 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 62.1m on sales of Pounds 311.2m, a rise of 8.8 per cent. Reviews of existing leases saw rental income from the property division increase by 11.9 per cent to Pounds 25.3m. GUS said: 'The recent turbulence in the currency markets and rapidly fluctuating interest rates represent a basic malaise in an unsettled economic climate, making forward business planning hazardous and complex.' Earnings increased from 49.2p to 51.4p. The interim dividend is 13.75p (12.75p). COMMENT GUS's A shares closed 35p down at Pounds 16.18, reflecting both that these profits were slightly below some expectations and the cautious tone of the terse accompanying statement. GUS said sales since the half-year had been satisfactory, but the volatile nature of trading made the outlook difficult to predict. Net cash is above the year-end total of Pounds 590m. Falling rates mean lower interest income, but the group contends that should be more than offset by the impact of cheaper money on consumer spending. Overseas earnings, accounting for nearly a fifth of group profits, benefited from the translation being made post-devaluation. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 470m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 12.6. The shares have had a good run from Pounds 12.80 in the past year, and were no doubt overdue for some profit-taking. However, they appear to have little downside at this level, given the group's consistent record of earnings growth.  The Financial Times   London Page 25  "

Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, said he would decide next month whether to proceed with the privatisation of West Japan Railway (JR West), one of the six rail groups that were created by the 1987 break-up of Japanese National Railways. He said the decisive factor would be the price performance of Japan Tobacco, the cigarette making monopoly, whose listing tomorrow has been marred by the fact that many private investors decided not to take up their rights to buy shares. The finance ministry managed to sell just under 60 per cent of the shares in Japan Tobacco, after private investors baulked at the offer price of Y1.438m a share, which was set through a pre-offer auction to institutions and rich individuals. It now plans to sell the unwanted shares in the new fiscal year, though Mr Kamei said yesterday that he still hopes to float JR West in the current fiscal year, ending in March. The Japan Tobacco flop has attracted widespread criticism of the method of pricing new issues via an auction to the richest minority of investors. This has prompted Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, to launch a review of the method of pricing flotations. New Oji Paper, Japan's largest paper and pulp manufacturer, yesterday said parent recurring profits for the six months to September 30 rose 32 per cent to Y6.58bn (Dollars 68m) from Y5bn in the corresponding period last year.

0,FT924-13219 ,"FT924-13219 _AN-CJPBWAEIFT 921016   FT  16 OCT 92 / Overseas holidays expected to fall      By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent   THE NUMBER of people taking an overseas holiday could fall next year in spite of an encouraging start to summer 1993 bookings, a survey published yesterday suggests. The survey, conducted for Lunn Poly, the biggest UK travel agency, revealed that 32 per cent of the 1,000 people questioned planned to take a summer holiday abroad next year. In last year's survey, 44 per cent said they planned to take a foreign holiday in summer 1992. In the event, only 22 per cent did so. In spite of indications that the recession has dented holidaymakers' confidence, summer 1993 bookings are up 5 per cent on last year according to Mr Peter Rothwell, Lunn Poly marketing director. A total of 950,000 holidays have already been sold for next summer. Lunn Poly's own sales are up by 45 per cent. Travel industry officials add that the early boost to bookings reflects the strength of the north of England economy compared with the south. As flights from regional airports are more limited than those from London, holidaymakers book earlier to ensure they can go away during school and factory holidays. Sales of this year's winter holidays are down by 12 per cent. Mr Rothwell attributed this to later booking of holidays this past summer. Travel industry sources point out that winter holidays tend to be more popular among those who, in better times, took second holidays. The survey showed, however, that 41 per cent of people would be prepared to cut other forms of expenditure to take overseas holidays.  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "
0,FT931-16513 ,"FT931-16513 _AN-DAFBVAD2FT 930106   FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tobacco family takes the wheel at Thwaites      By ANDREW BAXTER   UNCERTAINTY over the future of Thwaites, the dumper truck maker, has been resolved in a deal that switches control from executors of the founder, the late Mr Basil Thwaites, to the Wills tobacco family. The deal, for which terms were not disclosed, follows an announcement a year ago by Thwaites that it was exploring a possible sale of the company. Along with all UK construction equipment companies, the company has been hit by a sharp fall in demand and takeover by a Far Eastern-based group looking for a European manufacturing base initially seemed the most likely outcome. However, as conditions worsened throughout last year the sums offered failed to meet with shareholders' expectations. In June, a proposed purchase by BM Group was withdrawn after it was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The transaction announced this week will transfer full ownership of Thwaites to Lord Dulverton of the Wills family and his brother Mr Ian Wills. The family has been a substantial minority shareholder for more than 20 years. Mr John Webb continues as managing director. Lord Dulverton becomes deputy chairman, and Mr John Given has been appointed non-executive chairman. Although the deal is very different from what many observers had originally predicted, it is a significant boost for Thwaites. In the three years since Mr Thwaites died, the company has been in limbo, said Mr Webb, and the transaction would restore a 'clarity of direction.' However, the priority for Thwaites remains to clinch a joint manufacturing deal with a foreign company, enabling the company to broaden its product range and provide more work for its under-utilised plant. Thwaites incurred a deficit in the year to last August, on sales of about Pounds 10m. Sales in the current year should be slightly higher, said Mr Webb.

The results were achieved on sales down 0.6 per cent at Y294bn. Mr Katuji Kuwabara, managing director, said a substantial sales decline in chemicals had been more than offset by a robust performance from the pharmaceuticals, alcohol and food operations. The company reported post-tax profits up 4.1 per cent at Y6.28bn. The group predicted pre-tax profits this financial year would be almost flat at Y17bn on sales up 2.9 per cent at Y303bn. It reckoned operating profits would be unchanged at Y18.5bn and post-tax profits Y6.3bn. The company, which is Japan's ninth largest drugs group, said the cuts in domestic drugs prices due to be implemented in April would reduce its sales by about Y5bn. Chemical prices were likely to remain low, even if sales increased, it added. The company said it would raise its research and development spending by Y1.2bn to Y19.1bn this year. Meanwhile, Chugai, one of Japan's fastest growing drugs groups, yesterday warned its sales and profits would slow rapidly this year because of the government measures to reduce drugs spending. The company's healthcare sales fell 4.5 per cent last year to Y27.2bn, while pesticide sales were up 24.8 per cent to Y608m. Overseas sales rose 11.4 per cent to Y6.4bn. The group said pre-tax profits would grow only 2.8 per cent this year to Y17.5bn, compared with a 16.2 per cent increase last year.

Declining revenue from sales of karaoke equipment is calling the tune at Pioneer, the Japanese manufacturer of specialist audio-visual electronics. The company made a net loss in the six months to September, and indicated that some 1,300 jobs may have to go during the next five years. A strong yen and falling prices in the consumer electronics market, and lower demand for karaoke equipment, combined to help push Pioneer to a consolidated net loss of Y761m (Dollars 7.8m) in the first half, compared with a profit of Y7.7bn at the same stage a year ago. Revenues slipped to Y129.2bn from Y130.9bn previously. Recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - fell to Y3.7bn from Y7.9bn, although last year's figure included an exceptional gain. It plans to focus on car navigation and audio systems which are expected to be more promising than karaoke and laser disc systems. Japan Tobacco, the Japanese cigarette monopoly, posted a rise in interim earnings thanks to declines in raw material costs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The company, listed on the country's leading stock exchanges last month, said recurring profits for the first six months to September rose 7.7 per cent to Y66.9bn as a result of a fall in tobacco leaf costs due to the higher yen. The company increased the amount of imported tobacco leaves since the domestic product costs three times as much. Sales fell 0.5 per cent to Y1,372.4bn. The company lost 1.6 points of its share in the domestic market to foreign cigarette makers while the overall market only grew 0.6 per cent. After-tax profits rose 3.1 per cent to Y41.4bn. CORRECTION In a recent report of Pioneer's interim results it was incorrectly stated that the company's consolidated sales were down to Y129bn from Y130.9bn.

Exports to the rest of the European Community rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 717m, accounting for 39 per cent of worldwide sales. Mr Bill Bewsher, director-general of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the figures underlined the importance of the EC market to the industry and emphasised the need for a robust stand by the government to ensure fair tax treatment. Recent EC tax harmonisation proposals threatened to raise whisky prices, particularly in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, which accounted for half of export earnings from the EC last year. Sales to those four countries increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 364m. Mr Bewsher said: 'It is essential for the long-term well-being of the industry's exports that the government negotiate strongly to reduce and eventually eliminate the substantial discrimination which Scotch whisky faces in the EC. 'There is a real need to ensure that not only does Scotch whisky suffer no disadvantage in its major market, but that the wrong signal is not sent to the other 175 countries in which it is sold.' Export volumes to the EC increased by 1 per cent but declined worldwide by slightly more than 4 per cent to 227.75bn litres of pure alcohol. Brands bottled in Scotland were resilient to difficult trading conditions, exacerbated by the Gulf war in the early part of the year. Overseas volume sales of those brands declined only 2 per cent and earnings increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 1.49bn.  The Financial Times   London Page 7 Chart (Omitted). Chart (Omitted).  "

We warmly congratulate the success of the  conference.    Over the past five years since the last conference, our  country has experienced tremendous and profound changes in  various areas -- it has seen political stability, economic  development, national unity, and social progress. These  world-renowned achievements are the result of the thorough  implementation of the spirit of the 14th party congress and the  spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, as well as the result of hard struggle by people  throughout the country, including the broad masses of returned  Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese who have made  efforts on various fronts, and the broad masses of Overseas  Chinese who have given their support and concern. We sincerely  thank them for the valuable contributions they have made to the  prosperity and advancement of the Chinese nation.    The party and government have always attached importance to  returned Overseas Chinese work and have considered the broad  masses of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas  Chinese, and Overseas Chinese as an important force for China's  modernization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out many times  that the broad masses of Overseas Chinese hope to see a  prosperous and developed China, and he viewed giving play to the  active role of Overseas Chinese as an unique opportunity to  greatly develop our country. The All-China Federation of  Returned Overseas Chinese is a people's organization led by the  CPC for unity with returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of  Overseas Chinese of various circles; it is the bridge and link  through which the party and government foster ties with returned  Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Overseas  Chinese. The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese  has already officially become a component of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, and has a larger and  unique role to play in political consultation and democratic  supervision.    Our country is currently facing a very important historical  period. The development of the situation is raising new and  higher demands on the federation of returned Overseas Chinese at  various levels, and these federations should, under the  leadership of the party and government, continue to develop a  patriotic spirit, do a good job in education on collectivism and  socialism, unite with the broad masses of returned Overseas  Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese, and arouse their  enthusiasm and eagerness to work diligently for the country's  prosperity, struggle hard, build the home towns of Overseas  Chinese, and build the motherland.    The ""PRC Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of  Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese,""  implemented in 1991, has embodied the government's concern for  returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese and  has enabled returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas  Chinese to have a legal basis for the protection of their  legitimate rights and interests; the federations of returned  Overseas Chinese at various levels should help the government to  do a good job in implementing the ""PRC Law on Protecting the  Rights and Interests of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives  of Overseas Chinese,"" and should do a good job in liaison  between the government and returned Overseas Chinese and  relatives of Overseas Chinese.    The federations of returned Overseas Chinese should go to  the  grass-roots levels and go deep into the realities of life in  order to foster close ties with the broad masses of returned  Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese, listen to  their opinions and reflect their opinions, care for their  sufferings, and properly serve them, really becoming the ""close  friend"" of the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and  relatives of Overseas Chinese.    The conference this time has commended nearly 1,000 advanced  units and individuals and 10 outstanding persons from the  circles of returned Overseas Chinese. They are the outstanding  elements among the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and  relatives of Overseas Chinese; we sincerely congratulate them,  and we hope to see more outstanding elements emerging.    One important task that the federations of returned Overseas  Chinese at various levels must do well this time is liaison with  Overseas Chinese. ""Enable the returned Overseas Chinese to play  their role as a bridge."" They should help the relevant  departments to vigorously develop economic, trade, scientific,  technological, and cultural exchanges and cooperation with  Overseas Chinese for the sake of reform, opening up, and  modernization. On one hand, this can help Overseas Chinese to  develop businesses and is conducive to the economic prosperity  of the countries in which they are residing; on the other, this  can promote the development of reform, opening up, and  modernization in our country.    In order to accomplish their important duties and meet the  needs arising from the development of the situation, the  federations of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels must  vigorously strengthen their own reform and construction efforts.  Perfecting organization, training and assigning cadres,  improving work style, and straightening out the management  system have already become urgent tasks.    As far as the future is concerned, by the end of this  century, our country will have initially built the socialist  market economic system, will have realized the second-step  development goal of reaching a comfortable living standard, and  will have pushed the country's comprehensive national strength  to a new level. In 1997 and 1999, our country will resume  sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao respectively and will  realize a smooth transition. This represents major progress in  accomplishing the great undertaking of peaceful reunification of  the motherland according to the principle of ""one country, two  systems."" It is particularly important to do a good job in  ""Overseas Chinese"" work at this critical time when the country  confidently strides toward the 21st century and unity,  prosperity, and civilization. It is hoped that the federations  of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels will shoulder the  important duties entrusted to them by the times, unite with the  broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of  Overseas Chinese, and, under the leadership of the party and  government, work together wholeheartedly to make a larger  contribution in the struggle for the motherland's peaceful  reunification and prosperity.

He made a  congratulatory speech in which he said that the broad masses of  returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and  Overseas Chinese have the fine tradition of loving their country  and their native places, have extensive contacts overseas and  abundant information resources, and are an important force for  China's modernization. Thus, they can definitely make a big  contribution to the great undertaking of invigorating the  Chinese nation and the reunification of the motherland.    Qian Qichen said that returned Overseas Chinese, relatives  of  Overseas Chinese, and the broad masses of Overseas Chinese have  made great contributions to China's revolution and construction  during the various historical periods; they have added an epic  chapter to the annals of China's rise and prosperity and the  Chinese nation's advancement and invigoration. In the new  historical period, the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese  and relatives of Overseas Chinese are active in posts in various  trades. They have eagerly engaged in the undertakings of  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization with a great  sense of mission and a great sense of responsibility. They have  scored marked results in promoting China's economic development  and social advancement and have played an active role in the  great undertaking of reunification of the motherland. The broad  masses of Overseas Chinese are most enthusiastic about China's  opening up to the outside world, about the development of  economic and trade cooperation between China and foreign  countries, and about scientific, technological, and cultural  exchanges. They have joined hands with the peoples of the  countries in which they reside for progress and they have done a  great deal of work for the prosperity and advancement of those  countries and for the development of ties between those  countries and China. They have devoted themselves to China's  reform and construction with absolute sincerity.    He pointed out that the All-China Federation of Returned  Overseas Chinese is a people's organization under the leadership  of the CPC and belonging to the returned Overseas Chinese and  relatives of Overseas Chinese throughout the country. It is the  bridge and link through which the CPC and the Chinese Government  foster ties with the returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of  Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese. In the new situation,  the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese has  heavier duties and its status and functions have become more  important. The organizations of the All- China Federation of  Returned Overseas Chinese at various levels must use Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as guidance, uphold the CPC's basic line,  closely center on economic construction when launching work,  thoroughly perform their duties, and build the All-China  Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese into a vivid and  energetic ""home of the returned Overseas Chinese"" which is  trusted by the broad masses of people.    Qian Qichen said that the party and the government attach  great importance to the role of returned Overseas Chinese,  relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese in  revolution and construction and that they attach great  importance to Overseas Chinese work. In the new situation, the  CPC and the Chinese Government must strengthen and improve  leadership over Overseas Chinese work, give full play to the  role of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese,  and enthusiastically care for and support its work. Qian Qichen  believed that after the meeting of the representatives, a new  pattern of Overseas Chinese work, one which is characterized by  unity and bold advancement, will emerge in China.     "

After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed order.    This matter concerns claims made by American Tobacco in its advertising for cigarettes.    The Commission's complaint in this matter charges American Tobacco with engaging in unfair or deceptive practices in connection with the advertising of its Carlton brand cigarettes. According to the complaint, American Tobacco falsely represented, through the presentation of the tar of its Carlton product as a numerical multiple, fraction or ratio of the tar of other brands of cigarettes, and/or the visual depiction of ten packs or a carton of Carlton cigarettes versus one pack of the other brands: (1) That consumers will get less tar by smoking ten packs of Carlton brand cigarettes than by smoking a single pack of the other brands of cigarettes depicted in the ads, which are rated as having more than 10 mg. of tar; and (2) that it had a reasonable basis for claims that consumers will get less tar by smoking ten packs of Carlton brand cigarettes than by smoking a single pack of the other brands of cigarettes depicted in the ads.    The consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent American Tobacco from engaging in similar deceptive and unfair acts and practices in the future.    Part I of the order prohibits American Tobacco from representing, through certain means specified in the order, that consumers will get less tar by smoking ten packs of any cigarette rated as having 1 mg. of tar than by smoking a single pack of any other brand of cigarettes that is rated as having more than 10 mg. of tar.

Part III of the order provides a limited ``safe harbor'' for advertising that complies with certain specific requirements in its use of official tar and nicotine ratings. Specifically, presentation of the tar and/or nicotine ratings of any of American Tobacco's brands of cigarettes and the tar and/or nicotine ratings of any other brand shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to violate Part I or Part II of the order where no more than a single cigarette or pack or American Tobacco's brand is visually depicted versus a single cigarette or pack of any other brand.

The rise from Pounds 8.09m to Pounds 12.4m was struck on turnover ahead 22 per cent at Pounds 224m, compared with Pounds 184m. At the interim stage, the growth in turnover had only been 4.2 per cent. When those results were announced the shares rose 25p to 344p. The bulk of the profits growth came from the 12 overseas subsidiaries, where electrical appliances account for 60 per cent of sales. Overseas turnover expanded by Pounds 35.6m to Pounds 117.1m, 52.3 per cent of the group total. Of the Pounds 35.6m, organic growth accounted for Pounds 20.2m and favourable currency exchange rates the balance. Operating profits in the Far East were Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 5.9m), the Caribbean Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 6.3m) and the Pacific/Indian Ocean Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.1m). Transfers to deferred profits in the group, the payments so far on hire purchase sales, rose to Pounds 9m (Pounds 5.3m). This derived mostly from increased volume overseas where most of the business is on credit. In the UK credit accounts for only 15 per cent of sales. Sales of the Trinidadian joint venture, treated as an associate, were up from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 17.2m. Mr Bruce Cohen, chief executive, said that over the year there had been a certain amount of recovery, albeit 'slow and hesitant', but that Queensway and ELS had gone bust and that Chestermans, the Argos experiment, had been wound up. In the UK, operating profits were up at Pounds 4.41m (Pounds 3.53m) on sales ahead at Pounds 106.9m (Pounds 102.5m). Mr Cohen said that when the market strengthens, an increase in turnover would immediately impact on the bottom line. Earnings rose to 31.6p (19.7p) per share and the dividend is lifted to 5.5p via a proposed final of 3.67p (3.17p).   Companies:-  Courts (Furnishers).   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Prior to the opening, leading cadres, including Jiang Zemin,  Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, and Rong Yiren, met cordially  all deputies to the congress and posed for group photos.    On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State  Council, Jiang Zemin extended warm greeting to the congress;  wished the vast numbers of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives  of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese all the  best; and expressed his cordial regards to cadres of the  All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese [ACFOROC] at  various levels and to personnel who handle work concerning  Overseas Chinese. He said that work on Overseas Chinese has  been long-term, policy-oriented, important work for both the  party and the state. In the past, returned Overseas Chinese,  relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas  Chinese have made outstanding contributions in terms of nation  revitalization and national construction. In this new period  when China is accelerating its reform, opening up, and economic  construction, conscientiously doing a good job in Overseas  Chinese affairs will be important to the smooth realization of  China's economic development strategic objectives, to the  enhancement of friendly exchanges with other countries, and to  the promotion of the peaceful unification of the motherland.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who terms bringing out the positive role  of the broad Overseas Chinese as an unique opportunity for  greater development in China, has provided us with important  guidance with far-reaching significance to improve our work  under the new situation. Let's take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as  guidance, seize the opportunity, master the overall situation,  work hard in unity, and open up a new work horizon for ACFOROC  designed to contribute even more to revitalizing the Chinese  nation and unifying the motherland.    The congress, which is being attended by 812 deputies and  specially invited representatives, will examine ACFOROC's Fourth  Committee work report, scrutinize and adopt its draft  constitutional amendment, and elect its Fifth Committee.    In congratulating the congress on behalf of the party  Central  Committee and the State Council, Qian Qichen, a member of the  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council vice  premier, said: ACFOROC, a CPC-led nationwide people's  organization of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of  Chinese nationals living abroad, serves as a bridge and a tie  linking the party and the government with returned Overseas  Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and  Overseas Chinese. Under the new situation, ACFOROC at various  levels should unfold its work around the economy; give full play  to the role of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese  nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese in participation  in government and discussion as well as democratic supervision;  and protect their lawful interests and legitimate rights in  China according to the law. It is necessary to fully bring out  ACFOROC's superiority in conducting nongovernmental exchanges,  to step up foreign liaison work; to enthusiastically help  returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living  abroad, and Overseas Chinese in promoting cultural, educational,  public health, and other social undertakings in China; and to  thoroughly bring out ACFOROC's role in building the socialist  spiritual civilization, including promoting the spiritual  civilization in areas inhabited by returned Overseas Chinese.    Qian Qichen said: The party and the government have all  along  been attaching importance to work concerning Overseas Chinese.  From now on, party committees and governments at various levels  should further strengthen and improve leadership in this respect  by giving full play to the role of ACFOROC and by showing  concern for and lending their support enthusiastically.    In presenting a work report entitled ""Making New  Contributions Toward the Great Undertaking of Revitalizing the  Chinese Nation and Unifying the Motherland,"" ACFOROC President  Zhuang Yanlin, after reviewing the work of the past five years,  highlighted the federation's major future tasks as following:  to closely unite the vast number of returned Overseas Chinese,  relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas  Chinese to ensure greater contributions toward accelerating  China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive; to further  bring out its role in participation in government and discussion  as well as democratic supervision; to promote the full  implementation of ""The Law for the Protection of Returned  Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Chinese Nationals Living  Abroad"" and its ""Implementation Rules""; to further bring out  ACFOROC's superiority in conducting nongovernmental exchanges;  to open up a new situation in foreign liaison work; to play a  positive role in building a socialist spiritual civilization;  and to vigorously promote reform within the ACFOROC itself for  its improved performance.    ACFOROC Vice President Zhuang Shiping made an opening  speech,  while Gao Chao, vice president of the Chinese Scientists  Association, greeted the congress on behalf of various people's  organizations.

0,FT931-4354 ,"FT931-4354 _AN-DCKCYAD1FT 930311   FT  11 MAR 93 / Strong tobacco side lifts BAT to Pounds 1.65bn      By ANDREW BOLGER and RICHARD LAPPER   SHARES in BAT Industries rose 18p to 955p yesterday after the tobacco and financial services group reported annual pre-tax profits up 68 per cent to Pounds 1.65bn, which was at the top end of City expectations. Turnover grew 7 per cent to Pounds 22.1bn. The figures were attributed to an unexpectedly strong fourth quarter by the group's buoyant international tobacco business, and the continuing reduction in losses from Eagle Star, the UK insurance subsidiary which has been hit hard by mortgage indemnity losses. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the performance of Farmers, the group's US insurance subsidiary, was a highlight. It had become the third largest general insurer in the US, and its life business had contributed Pounds 93m to a trading profit above Pounds 400m. Farmers and Eagle Star helped financial services' trading profit from continuing operations to recover from Pounds 230m to Pounds 598m. Losses from mortgage indemnity insurance - which covers lenders against a portion of their losses on sales of repossessed properties - amounted to Pounds 244m. This was mainly because Eagle Star increased its provisions against claims on policies insuring commercial property lenders, a class of business it no longer underwrites. Losses on domestic mortgage indemnity policies fell to Pounds 97m, compared with Pounds 213m in 1991. Higher premiums and more selective underwriting led to a sharp fall in Eagle Star's underwriting losses in motor, home and commercial insurances. The group's tobacco trading profit increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 1.31bn. Total volumes rose to more than 570bn cigarettes, increasing the group's share of the world market to 10.9 per cent. Sales of international brands grew by 19 per cent, while export volumes were 23 per cent higher. As the most international cigarette maker, BAT continued to increase its share in key domestic markets around the world and to expand into newly emerging markets such as eastern Europe. Earnings per share more than doubled to 58.7p. The group's tax rate fell from 56.5 per cent to 41.5 per cent, mainly due to the improvement in UK profitability. A final dividend of 22.6p (against 11.2p) gives a total for the year of 37.2p, up 11 per cent. Details, Page 27; Lex, Page 24   Companies:-  BAT Industries.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The company earned Dollars 157.7m, or Dollars 1.82 a share, in the quarter, up from Dollars 90.8m, or Dollars 1.19, in last year's third quarter. Excluding special accounting charges, Deere earned Dollars 100.1m in the third quarter of 1993. Sales in the quarter rose 14 per cent, to Dollars 2.327bn, from Dollars 2.049 last year. Wall Street analysts had expected Deere to report another record quarter, but the magnitude of the earnings increase caught many by surprise. The company's share price closed up Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 69 1/2 in New York yesterday. Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said: 'The company's results for the quarter reflect continued improvement compared with a year ago, primarily due to higher North American production and sales volumes, as well as improved operating efficiencies and better than previously anticipated results from our overseas operations.' For the first nine months Deere recorded income of Dollars 434m, or Dollars 5.04, on sales of Dollars 6.5bn, up from Dollars 154.9m, or Dollars 2.01, before special charges, on sales of Dollars 5.57bn. Overseas sales increased 23 per cent in the third quarter, to Dollars 535m. Although the company still forecasts a long-term downward trend for agricultural equipment sales in Europe, Mr Becherer said: 'The current outlook for 1994 anticipates industry sales being slightly higher than 1993 levels.' The company revised its 1994 full-year worldwide production schedule to be up 17 per cent over last year, from a previous forecast of 16 per cent. The increase reflects the third-quarter production totals, which the company said would have been higher had it not been re-tooling production lines for a new large row-crop tractor line to be introduced in the fourth quarter. The company cautioned that fourth-quarter output of some vehicles could be hampered by the availability of tyres, which have been in short supply.   Companies:-  Deere and Co Inc.

Foreign investors applied for only 4,764 shares, and institutional investors for 85,835, the ministry said. A Japan Tobacco employees' shareholding group sought 7,000. In spite of the large number of subscriptions, however, many analysts are bearish over the demand for Japan Tobacco. Some imply that intensive sales by brokers could have pushed the number of subscriptions higher than genuine demand since a single investor was allowed to place orders for up to 9,999 shares, but is not obligated to buy them even if they win the lottery. 'Given what happened with Japan Telecom, there's a lot of anxiety with foreign investors towards new issues,' said Ms Patricia Horvath of UBS Securities.   Companies:-  Japan Tobacco Inc.

This is a significant meeting for the overseas  Chinese sector, and is also a great event which the returned  overseas Chinese, the relatives of overseas Chinese, and the  vast number of Chinese nationals residing abroad, numbering more  than 30 million, have universally followed with interest. The  convocation of this meeting is of vital significance to further  mobilizing the vast numbers of returned overseas Chinese and  their relatives to conscientiously implement the guidelines of  the 14th Party National Congress and the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee and accelerating the  development of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, I  should like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend our  warm congratulations to this meeting; our best wishes to the  vast number of returned overseas Chinese, the relatives of  Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese nationals residing abroad; our  cordial greetings to the assiduous workers of overseas Chinese  affairs; and our respects to the advanced collectives and  individuals in overseas Chinese work, who will be commended at  this meeting.    Returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of overseas  Chinese,  and the vast number of Chinese nationals residing abroad have  made tremendous contributions to China's revolution and  construction in various historical periods and have written an  epic and historic chapter on the prosperity of the motherland  and the progress and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. During  the new historical period, the vast number of returned overseas  Chinese and their relatives are active in the posts of various  trades and professions. With a lofty sense of mission and  responsibility, they have enthusiastically devoted themselves to  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization undertakings,  have made brilliant achievements in bringing about economic  development and social progress, and have played a positive role  in the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the  motherland. The vast number of Chinese nationals residing  abroad are the most enthusiastic supporters of China's open-door  policy, its effort to develop foreign trade and economic  cooperation, and its scientific, technological, and cultural  exchange activities. Advancing hand in hand with the local  people, they have performed substantial work for the prosperity  and progress of the countries where they are residing as well as  for the development of friendly ties between these countries and  China. They have demonstrated utterly sincere feelings for the  reform and construction of the motherland.    The period between now and the middle of next century will  be  a great historic period of national rejuvenation and the  realization of socialist modernization in China. In the 1990's,  we will strive to achieve the second-step objective of  quadrupling GNP ahead of schedule so that the people will be  able to lead a relatively comfortable life, and the socialist  market economic structure will be initially established. In  line with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the  Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, we will resume our  sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao as scheduled and will  maintain long-term stability and prosperity there. We will also  push forward the great cause of reunifying the motherland in  accordance with the principle of ""one country, two systems.""  For these purposes, we must fully mobilize the initiative of  the entire people, including the returned overseas Chinese, the  relatives of overseas Chinese, and Chinese nationals residing  abroad. They have the fine tradition of loving their motherland  and home towns, and boast the advantage of extensive  relationships with the people and rich information resources  abroad. Hence, they are a major force in the country's drive  for modernization and will certainly make greater contributions  to the magnificent cause of rejuvenating and reunifying the  motherland.    This is a crucial year for China's socialist modernization  process. ""Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening  wider to the outside world, promoting development, and  maintaining stability"" are the tasks on which the overall  interest of the entire party and country hinges. The Overseas  Chinese affairs work should be consciously subordinate to and  serve this overall interest. Closely centering around this  overall interest, we must seriously put into practice various  principles and policies on Overseas Chinese affairs work in the  new period, must extensively unite and mobilize the returned  overseas Chinese and their relatives to devote themselves to  reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, must  enthusiastically promote trade and economic cooperation as well  as scientific, technological, and cultural exchange between the  Overseas Chinese and the motherland, must maintain social  stability, and must give impetus to economic development and  comprehensive social progress. The vast number of overseas  Chinese affairs workers should do all they can to forge ahead  with one heart and one mind in a bid to initiate a new situation  for Overseas Chinese affairs work.    The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese is  a mass organization of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives  of Overseas Chinese throughout the country under the party  leadership, and is a bridge and link between them and the party  and government. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, the federations of returned Overseas Chinese  at various levels have exercised a significant role in reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive. The vast number of  cadres of these federations have worked diligently and have made  brilliant achievements. Under the new situation, they are faced  with even heavier tasks, and their position and role are even  more important. The federations at various levels should be  guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, should adhere to the party's basic  line, should perform their work with an emphasis on economic  construction, and should exercise their functions in a  comprehensive way. They should exploit their own advantages  and, through their effective work, further mobilize and unite  the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives across the  country to devote greater efforts to pushing forward the  undertakings of reform, opening up, and modernization in China.  It is necessary to fully exercise the role of the returned  Overseas Chinese and their relatives in participating in the  deliberation and administration of state affairs and in  democratic supervision. Their legitimate rights and interests  in the country should be protected in accordance with the law.  It is also necessary to fully exploit the advantages of the  federations of returned Overseas Chinese in conducting  nongovernmental exchange and increasing contact with foreign  countries. We should give enthusiastic assistance to the  returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of Overseas Chinese,  and Chinese nationals residing abroad in their efforts to run  cultural, educational, public health, and other social welfare  undertakings in the country. Besides, it is necessary to bring  into full play the role of the federations of returned Overseas  Chinese in the building of socialist spiritual civilization and  make further efforts to strengthen such building in their home  towns. Through intensified reform and building, we should train  a contingent of overseas affairs workers who have both ability  and political integrity and who will enthusiastically serve the  returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of Overseas Chinese,  and Chinese nationals residing abroad. The work of the  federations of returned Overseas Chinese should be geared to the  needs of the grass-roots units and should go deep into the  realities of life. They should earnestly propagate and explain  the party's principles and policies and the important measures  on reform and opening up to the returned Overseas Chinese and  their relatives, get acquainted with their aspirations, show  concern for their weal and woe, and convey their views and  demands to the party and government in good time. These  federations should be built into vigorous and energetic ""homes  of returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives"" which are  trusted by the broad masses.    Deputies and comrades, the party and government always pay  serious attention to the role of the returned Overseas Chinese,  the relatives of Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese nationals  residing abroad in revolution and construction, as well as to  the work of overseas affairs. Under the new situation, the  party and government at all levels should further intensify and  improve leadership over overseas affairs work, should give full  rein to the initiative of the federations, and should  enthusiastically show concern for and give support to their  work. I profoundly believe that, after the current meeting, a  brand new situation of unity and endeavor in overseas affairs  work will certainly emerge. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the leadership of the party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, let us firmly  seize the opportunity, do solid work, forge ahead, and make  great efforts to build China into a prosperous, democratic,  civilized, and modernized socialist country and to safeguard  world peace and development!    I wish the meeting complete success!     "

The Japanese company will market new products in Japan under a license  agreement and turn a portion of the profits over to Mycogen.    Japan Tobacco entered the contract because ""there is a need worldwide for new  environmentally acceptable herbicide products,"" according to a prepared  statement by Japan Tobacco Vice President Morio Tansho.

An Orange County health official immediately assailed the promotional tactic  Wednesday, accusing the government-run Korea Tobacco and Ginseng Corp. of  playing upon the national sentiments of Korean immigrants to increase cigarette  sales.    ""It's obscene to me,"" said Nampet Panichpant-Michelsen, program manager for the  International Immigrant and Refugee Health Assistance program, an arm of the  Orange County Health Care Agency.    A spokesman for the tobacco firm said Wednesday that it was unaware of the  no-smoking effort, but said the promotional campaign for Korean-made cigarettes  was intended to benefit Korean communities in the United States, not to build a  market for the company's products.    ""We didn't know about the"" Great American Smokeout being held today, Lee Hyung  Sub, managing director of Overseas Affairs for the privately owned cigarette  corporation, said in a telephone interview Wednesday from his office in Taejon,  South Korea.    Proceeds for the cigarettes will go to a Korean senior citizens group and to  sponsor a community anti-crime committee, Lee said. He added that his company  does not plan to sell cigarettes in the United States until late December.

""But it's another if you are doing it because you are not  sophisticated enough to know you are being manipulated by aggressive  advertising tactics.""    On Wednesday, several promotional posters advertising the cigarettes were  hanging in the Korean Community Center in Garden Grove. The posters, written in  Korean, said the company was proud to announce that the cigarettes from the  ""motherland"" had arrived, according to a Korean translator who works for the  county. The posters said the company had donated $30,000 worth of cigarettes  and the proceeds would be used to build elderly housing. Among the name brands  advertised were ""Eighty-Eights,"" and ""Lilac Slims.""    Officials at the Korean Community Center on Garden Grove Boulevard could not be  reached for comment on the cigarette promotion. However, county health  officials said center representatives had been handing out boxes of the  cigarettes at the senior center for at least a month.    Panichpant-Michelson said she learned of the promotion earlier this week when  she visited the center to ask an official there if he would stop smoking for a  day during national smokeout week.    ""I approached him to see if he would stop smoking for 24 hours and learned that  (the tobacco company) had dumped $30,000 worth of cigarettes claiming to be low  tar,"" she said.

This procurement-price adjustment merely incorporates the  state-set tobacco-production support charge into the procurement  price and, premised on overall price levels remaining  essentially unchanged and based on the principle of price based  on quality, appropriately adjusts the price differences among  grades (See attachments 1 and 2). Perfume tobacco is adjusted  in price from the average per 50 kg of 222.11 yuan (not  including the production-support charge) to 245.18 yuan  (incorporating the production-support charge into the  procurement price), for an increase of 10.39 percent; and  white-rib tobacco is adjusted in price from the average per 50  kg of 114.38 yuan (not including the production-support charge)  to 132.43 yuan (with the production-support charge being  incorporated into the procurement price), for an increase of  15.78 percent.    2. The State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau will issue a separate  circular on the benchmark prices for perfume and white-rib  tobacco allocation.    3. These perfume and white-rib tobacco procurement prices  will take effect the day on which this document is issued, with  Farm Price Document No 166 (1990) issued by the former State  Pricing Bureau and the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau being  annuled at the same time.

Japan Tobacco is about 135 times bigger than Manchester, with 1990 sales of Y2,701.8bn (Dollars 20.27bn) against about Pounds 89m (Dollars 153m) for the British company last year. It is putting Pounds 5m into the acquisition, including the purchase of equity and a commitment to buy new equipment to improve the quality of the operation. Mr Fursa Hogan, Manchester Tobacco chairman, will stay on as managing director. Although Japan Tobacco says its long-term strategy is to expand internationally, this initial acquisition appears more like a test of the waters rather than the opening gambit of a big expansion strategy. About 3.5 per cent of Japan Tobacco's production is exported. The company said yesterday it had no plans to expand the Manchester business, to increase exports, or to use the company to channel imports of Japan Tobacco's best-selling Mild Seven brand. The Japanese government plans a public offering of Japan Tobacco shares later this year, although nothing concrete has been announced. The structure of Japan Tobacco was changed from a government bureau to a joint stock company in 1985, after which its financial performance has improved considerably. The company reported profits of Y93.2bn, up 88 per cent since the change in structure. Inventories of tobacco leaves have also fallen sharply following a programme to reduce acreage. The Japanese cigarette market has expanded in recent years after earlier declines. In the six months to last September sales grew by 2.5 per cent, compared with a year earlier, to 167bn cigarettes. Imported cigarette sales have grown more quickly than domestic brands, and now account for about 16 per cent of the market. The company has diversified into a wide range of fields and has an extensive research programme. Its research scientists recently discovered a chemical substance that stimulates the portion of the brain that causes the sensation of hunger. The company has suggested that the substance may be used to treat anorexia nervosa, and is already being used to fatten up geese to obtain livers used to make pate de foie gras.

Qian Qichen said this in a speech to the Second Plenary  Meeting of the Executive Council of the Overseas Exchanges  Association of China.    Qian Qichen said: ""In the four years since the founding of  the Overseas Exchange Association of China, it has played a  positive role in giving publicity to China's achievements in its  reform, opening, and economic construction, in promoting unity  and friendship with Overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of  Chinese descent, and in developing cooperation and exchanges  with overseas Chinese communities and foreign citizens of  Chinese origin. I hope that the association will continue to  play a better role in these aspects in the future.""    Qian Qichen held: The new situation requires further  expansion of China's overseas exchanges so that China may better  understand the world and the world may also better understand  China. This will thus set higher requirements for the work of  the Overseas Exchange Association of China and will also create  a broader scope of activity for the association.    When talking about the concrete hopes pinned on the Overseas  Exchange Association, Qian Qichen said: Economic construction  is the central task of the CPC and the Chinese Government. Our  work in all trades should be closely tied to this central task.  The work of the Overseas Exchange Association and its local  branches at all levels should also be conducted closely around  the central task. Only thus will they play an effective role as  they should. After analyzing China's economic situation in the  last two years, he said: When the world economy remained in a  recession, there was sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development in China. The 1.2 billion Chinese people display  broad market prospects, which have aroused interest and  attention from more and more countries in the world and are  greatly attractive to overseas investors and entrepreneurs,  including overseas Chinese investors and entrepreneurs. This  provides a favorable environment for the Overseas Exchange  Association to conduct its work in order to serve our country's  economic construction.    Qian Qichen said: In the development of foreign relations,  mass organizations involved in foreign activities constitute an  indispensable force, and their role should be brought into full  play. Such organizations may have different characters and  perform different functions, but they share one common point.  That is, they are doing the work of making friends, building up  friendship, promoting communication, increasing exchanges, and  seeking common ground. The Overseas Exchange Association is  oriented to Overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese  origin. It has a large number of contacts among overseas  Chinese in various social strata and has built up a rather  profound friendship with some of them. Being mass organizations  in some specific communities, the local branches of the Overseas  Exchanges Association at all levels keep natural blood relations  and fellow countryman fraternity with overseas Chinese and  foreign citizens of Chinese origin. With these favorable  conditions, they may more naturally and more flexibly make  friends in a broad scope.    At the same time, Qian Qichen also hoped that overseas  Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese origin will settle down  and take root in the foreign countries where they are living,  and will get along in good terms with local people and make  contributions to local economic development.    When talking about the role of the Overseas Exchanges  Association of China in promoting the motherland's peaceful  reunification, Qian Qichen said: To resume the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao and to realize ""peaceful  reunification"" between the two sides of the straits, we not only  need cooperation between the Chinese and British Governments and  between the Chinese and Portuguese Governments and pin hopes on  the Taiwan authorities, but also need to rely on an increasing  patriotic and reunification-upholding force among the  compatriots in all social strata in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  and rely on the joint efforts of all Chinese people and people  of Chinese origin at home and abroad who support China's  reunification. Because the local branches of the Overseas  Exchange Association have broad and close connections with  overseas Chinese, foreign citizens of Chinese origin, and the  business communities and people in all social strata of Hong  Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, they should actively give publicity to  the policy of ""one country, two systems"" and other guidelines,  principles, and policies for realizing China's peaceful  reunification through their connections among Overseas Chinese  and foreign citizens of Chinese origin. This will certainly be  conducive to increasing exchanges, understanding, and common  ground between the mainland on the one side and Hong Kong,  Macao, and Taiwan on the other side, thus promoting the smooth  return of Hong Kong and Macao and speeding up the process of  peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait.    Today's plenary meeting of the Second Executive Council of  the Overseas Exchange Association of China was chaired by Qian  Weichang, chairman of the association. Liao Hui, vice chairman  of the association, delivered a work report in which he reviewed  the association's work in 1993 and outlined the 1994 work plan.    At today's meeting, 46 new members headed by Chen Ziying  were  added to the Executive Council, and 16 new members were added to  the Standing Committee of the Executive Council. Zhu Youjun,  director of ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE, was appointed to be new  secretary general for the association.     "
0,FT933-12572 ,"FT933-12572 _AN-DGWCHAD0FT 930723   FT  23 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Ratner's new jewel - The entrepreneur's latest venture      By VANESSA HOULDER   Gerald Ratner, the jeweller who once famously described one of his products as 'crap', does not appear to have lost his taste for controversy. Nine months after leaving Ratners (now called Signet), Mr Ratner is again raising eyebrows with his choice of passage back into the retail industry. He is attempting to convert Tobacco Dock, the failed shopping centre in London's Wapping, into a US-style 'factory outlet mall'. Factory outlet shopping - where manufacturers sell surplus stock directly to the public at discounts of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent - is fiercely resisted by many retailers. Unlike the US, where factory outlet malls are typically at least an hour's drive away from a city, in the UK towns are so close to each other that such outlets would inevitably compete with town centres, say retailers. Mr Ratner's task is to persuade manufacturers, which are inevitably reluctant to offend retailers, that Tobacco Dock will not threaten their markets. He is sending brochures to 1,000 manufacturers and admits that he has to 'break down some barriers' to win over prospective tenants. Mr Ratner is confident he will win the argument over Tobacco Dock's perceived threat to existing London shopping centres. 'Docklands is not a successful place for shopping. It will not cannibalise other markets,' he said. That much cannot be disputed. Tobacco Dock was in receivership from November 1990 until last October when it was bought for Pounds 12m by Bisley Properties, a private group which took on Mr Ratner as an adviser. Tobacco Dock's failure was blamed on its inaccessibility and poor transport links. Tobacco Dock's location could remain a problem: the solution depends on persuading well-known brand-name manufacturers to participate in Mr Ratner's factory mall in a bid to attract shoppers from as wide an area as possible. Mr Ratner is convinced that there will be no difficulty in attracting shoppers. 'People will be coming down from Scotland,' he says rather implausibly. Mr Ratner's move into factory outlet shopping follows a recent visit to the US. He became convinced that the success of factory outlets in the US could be replicated in the UK (where such outlets exist, but on a relatively small scale). He joined Bisley Properties on his return to the UK. The logic that persuaded Mr Ratner that the UK is ready for factory outlet centres has also impressed a handful of developers from the US and the UK which are working on such schemes in Britain. But Mr Ratner thinks that Tobacco Dock, which could have its first manufacturers in place in two months, will be Britain's first US-style mall.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-13103 ,"FT942-13103 _AN-ED0DLAAGFT 940427   FT  27 APR 94 / BAT buys American Tobacco for Dollars 1bn      By TONY JACKSON and RICHARD TOMKINS      LONDON, NEW YORK   BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and insurance giant, is to buy American Tobacco of the US for Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) cash. The deal turns the tables on almost a century of history, since BAT was formed in 1902 as a joint venture between American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco of the UK. The purchase gives BAT control in the US of the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall cigarette brands, which it already owns elsewhere in the world. It also obtains the rights to the Silk Cut brand outside Europe. American Tobacco, owned by the diversified US group American Brands, is the fifth largest tobacco company in the US, while BAT is third largest. The deal will increase BAT's US sales by some 50 per cent, while still leaving it in third position. BAT's move comes at a time when the US tobacco industry is under heavy pressure. The Clinton administration is threatening far-reaching legislation to curb cigarette smoking, while the market has been fiercely competitive since Philip Morris, the market leader, slashed the price of its Marlboro brand a year ago. BAT's move is also seen as unexpected, as in recent years it has concentrated on diversifying away from tobacco, using tobacco cash flow to expand in financial services in the UK and US. Mr Martin Broughton, BAT chief executive, said that policy remained in place. BAT is known to have been searching recently for an insurance acquisition in continental Europe, and has expressed interest in buying a UK building society. Mr Broughton said BAT was still looking for opportunities in both areas. While the American Tobacco purchase will bring BAT's balance-sheet gearing to 50 per cent, Mr Broughton said he would be happy to raise the figure to 70 per cent for the right purchase. 'We don't see this as inhibiting us,' he said. 'We could easily cope with another Pounds 1bn-plus of borrowings as of now.' Referring to a US broker's circular this week suggesting that a BAT-American Brands merger might result in cost savings of Dollars 200m, Mr Broughton described that figure as 'a bit aggressive'. BAT said the deal, which will be financed from its existing resources, would improve its earnings from the outset. The price represented between nine and 10 times American Brands' earnings. American Brands will retain Gallaher, its international operation, which is the largest tobacco company in the UK and Ireland. The group said transaction would 'remove potential uncertainty' from the group - a reference to anti-smoking pressures - and that the move would enable the group to focus on businesses with greater long-term profit potential.

The Federal Trade Commission is trying to halt the acquisition because it believes a reduction in the number of manufacturers will make it easier for those remaining to set prices to their advantage. 'I find BAT to be very price competitive,' said Ms Diana Temple of Salomon Brothers in New York, 'but it will be hard for BAT to get the FTC's opposition overturned in court.' 'It is genuinely a bizarre ruling by the FTC because the cigarette market would never accept price rises,' said a leading London analyst. But with the court outcome unpredictable because of political overtones, 'BAT has an even chance, perhaps no better, of winning.' The FTC goes to court in New York City on Monday to seek a temporary injunction to block BAT's Dollars 1bn purchase of American Tobacco from American Brands. A full trial will begin in the first week of December. If BAT loses it could appeal to the federal second circuit appeals court. There would be insufficient time to take the case to the Supreme Court because BAT's option on American Tobacco expires next April.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.     American Tobacco Co Inc.

0,FT944-13374 ,"FT944-13374 _AN-EJ3AVAFTFT 941028   FT  28 OCT 94 / BAT bid for American Tobacco facing US court block      By RODERICK ORAM   The US Federal Trade Commission said yesterday it would seek to block BAT Industry's Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover bid for American Tobacco because the deal could lead to reduced competition and 'co-ordinated' pricing among US cigarette makers. The FTC said it would ask a federal court in New York on Monday to halt the takeover until a full 'administrative trial and any appeals' had been heard. A trial could start within a few weeks with a verdict before the year-end. BAT, the UK tobacco and financial services group, and American Brands, the US consumer products group selling American Tobacco, said they would jointly fight the FTC. 'We think the creation of a stronger number three manufacturer will be beneficial to consumers,' BAT said. 'It's a setback but we have had them before with American takeovers.' It took BAT a year to win approval to buy Farmers, a California insurer, in 1988 in the face of hostility from state regulators. BAT's Brown and Williamson subsidiary, the maker of Kool and other brands, is the number three cigarette manufacturer in the US. However, buying fourth-placed American Tobacco, maker of Carlton and Lucky Strike, would lift its market share from 11 per cent to 18 per cent. Number one is Marlborough-selling Philip Morris with more than 40 per cent and second is the Reynolds subsidiary of RJR-Nabisco with about 30 per cent. The deal would also have the effect of reuniting the Lucky Strike brand, which is owned by American Tobacco in the US but by BAT outside the US. The trade commissioners, acting on their staff's recommendation, said the deal would remove one of the six manufacturers left in the US, a market 'highly concentrated and largely shielded from new entrants'. In the past, American Tobaccohas not followed other manufacturers' price increases so its takeover would 'remove an aggressive competitor', the FTC said, 'and increase the chances of co-ordinated actions among the remaining manufacturers'. 'This is not a picture of the market we'd recognise,' BAT said. It and American Tobacco had each delivered some one million pages of documents to the FTC and held meetings with its staff since the deal was announced in April. In recent weeks BAT began to realise the staff were hostile to the takeover but it hoped the commissioners would overrule them.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.     American Tobacco Co Inc.

[Rupees] 206 crore for 1993-1994.    ""...Strong Indian companies should go overseas with their  products and services as India's flag bearers,"" ITC Chairman  K.L. Chugh observed while reporting a gross income of Rs. 4,280  crore in the last fiscal.    Explaining his company's corporate strategy in a liberalised  regime Mr Chugh said: ""It has been my firm belief that in order  to integrate ourselves fast with the global economy, foreign  investment and technology should be inducted through  multinationals in areas that are needed.""    Mr Chugh's observations made after a meeting of the board  here yesterday are significant because the company recently  thwarted British American Tobacco (BAT)'s [as published] efforts  to get a controlling stake and hive off some of ITC's  non-traditional businesses.    It was, however, obvious that Mr Chugh's corporate  philosophy  of taking on multinational predators applied only to hostile  takeover bids.    Though the ITC Chairman did not specifically mention the  Centre for its support during his successful operation to  stonewall BAT, it was clear that the company perceives a period  of closer ties with the Union Finance Ministry.    ITC's profits before tax increased 34 percent over that of  1992-93 to Rs. 350 crore (Rs. 261.48 crore). With a market  capitalisation of Rs. 6,794 crore it continued to be among  India's blue chips. The company's foreign exchange earnings  totalled Rs. 822 crore.     "

The Nikkei 225 closed up 50.01 at 19,796.36 after a high of 19,919.88 and a low of 19,724.44. Dealers bought shares on the first trading day for November settlement, while overseas investors also supported prices. Volume was 210m shares against 215m. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 1.50 to 1,568.44 and the Nikkei 300 inched up 0.54 to 287.14. Advances led declines by 479 to 461 with 221 issues unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.30 to 1,292.90. Japan Tobacco plunged 23.5 per cent from its public offering price to Y1.1m. Early in the day, the stock failed to trade due to lack of buyers, but it changed hands in the afternoon at Y1.19m. Traders said investors who had bought stock at the lower end of the pre-offer auction were trying to take profits. Investors who had bought the stock on margin were also forced to liquidate their holdings when the offered price fell below Y1.3m. Traders said the focus for market participants was on corporate earnings and the currency market now JT was listed. 'We can now detach ourselves from JT,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Buying by overseas investors supported Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose Y6,000 to Y892,000. But East Japan Railway, the railway group privatised last year, lost Y3,000 to Y480,000, and Japan Telecom fell Y70,000 to Y3.68m. High-technology stocks were supported by prospects of strong profits. Sharp rose Y10 to Y1,790 and Toshiba Y6 to Y764. However, some issues fell on profit-taking, with Matsushita Electric Industrial down Y10 to Y1,580 and Mitsubishi Electric losing Y2 to Y723. Steel shares were firmer: Nippon Steel rose Y2 to Y394 and Sumitomo Metal Industries added Y10 to Y354. Mitsubishi Oil lost Y40 to Y1,020 on profit-taking. The stock had been supported by speculative buying on hopes of its oil digging project in Vietnam. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 13.27 to 21,965.36 in volume of 25.3m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y140 to Y5,290. Roundup Commodities-based gains in Australia and a continued buyers' strike in the embattled Taiwan equity market were the main features in the region yesterday. SYDNEY followed Australia's largest company, BHP, which reached an intra-day record high on the rosy outlook for mineral ores after the bull-run in base metals found new impetus on the London Metal Exchange on Wednesday. BHP rose 42 cents to ADollars 20.50 after peaking at ADollars 20.56. The All Resources index rose 18.4 to 1,422.9, towing the All Ordinaries to a gain of 14.6 at 2,032.2. Turnover was strong at ADollars 538.1m. The copper price, which jumped USDollars 41 to a four-year high of USDollars 2,627 a tonne, was said to be the source of BHP's strength, but other large miners were firmer on the back of much stronger base metals prices, and on support from domestic investors. CRA rose 32 cents to ADollars 18.90, Western Mining climbed 13 to ADollars 8.37, and MIM advanced 5 to ADollars 2.90. HONG KONG achieved a technical recovery but activity stayed thin, the Hang Seng index closing up 52.14 at 9,304.58, well off its 9,341.40 session high as turnover improved marginally from HKDollars 2.02bn to HKDollars 2.27bn. Wednesday's successful test of 9,200 on the Hang Seng and Wall Street's ability to avoid a heavy sell-off overnight, combined with news that Britain and China might be close to a financing agreement on Hong Kong's new airport, boosted flagging sentiment. Overseas buying lifted Hongkong Land, which rose 55 cents to HKDollars 19.10. Other property stocks also gained, with Henderson Land up 40 cents at HKDollars 48.80 and Cheung Kong by 30 cents to HKDollars 35.90. WELLINGTON thanked Telecom, once again, for a 12 cents gain on continuing demand to NZDollars 5.62 which accounted for around 13 points of a 21.10 rise to 2,090.42 in the NZSE-40 Index in turnover of NZDollars 47m. Fletcher Challenge also performed well, rising 5 cents to NZDollars 4.36, and Fletcher Forest closed up 1 cent at NZDollars 2.10 amid speculation about foreign demand. COLOMBO's all share index recovered for the first time after Monday's assassination of an opposition leader, widespread blue chip buying taking it up 9.41 to 1,087.56. Turnover rose from Rs47.21m to Rs187.36m. TAIPEI reversed small early gains to close sharply lower for the fourth consecutive session, and brokers expected the market to remain depressed. The weighted index lost 90.90 or 1.4 per cent to 6,594.97 in turnover of TDollars 44.4bn. Financials led the fall with China Bills losing TDollars 2.70 or 5.6 per cent to TDollars 45.90. Food and polyester shares performed relatively well, with Shinkong Synthetic Fibres gaining 30 cents to TDollars 26.90. President Enterprises rebounded after Wednesday's fall, gaining TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 58. Hualon fell TDollars 1 to TDollars 18.70 after the prosecutor's office started to investigate a TDollars 3.35bn share payment default related to the group. MANILA declined marginally ahead of a four-day holiday weekend, with Philippine National Bank leading the declines. The composite index finished 18.01 lower at 3,060.25 in volume of 2.95bn shares worth 1.34bn pesos. PNB, the country's largest commercial bank, fell 4.35 per cent to 385 pesos on news of a 28 per cent drop in its net profit to 1.2bn pesos in the first nine months against 1.67bn in the same period last year. Gainers were led by Jollibee Foods which advanced 8.6 per cent to 15.75 pesos followed by Bacnotan Cement which rose 4.6 per cent to 34 pesos. BANGKOK retreated but brokers expected the market to make headway today after the Bank of Thailand announced that inflation was under control and stringent monetary measures were now unnecessary. The SET index slipped 12.34 to 1,501.73 after fluctuating between 1,495.41 and 1,518.90 in turnover of Bt8.1bn. Bank of Thailand officials said the bank was sticking to its earlier estimate of a 4.8 per cent growth in the consumer price index for 1994. The finance sector was the biggest loser, falling 2.1 per cent on Bt1.2bn turnover.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.     AUZ  Australia.     HKZ  Hong Kong, Asia.     NZZ  New Zealand.

An agreement was signed in Beijing last week. Under the accord, the two sides will also develop and produce other brands in Ningbo, a city south of Shanghai. The new products will aim at both domestic and international markets. No capital investment is expected from Philip Morris. Its role will be to help train staff workers and upgrade leaf processing of the two existing Chinese plants. The CNTC monopolises China's cigarette production. Its 180 plants produce 1,500bn cigarettes a year. Philip Morris will be the fourth international tobacco manufacturer to enter China after RJR Nabisco, Rothmans and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Corp of Hong Kong. Marlboro is the most popular foreign cigarette in China. With living standards improving quickly, more Chinese are buying imported brands. China is the world's largest cigarette consumer, with 300m smokers consuming 1,600bn cigarettes a year.   Companies:-  Philip Morris Asia.     China National Tobacco Corp.

Therefore, the state has decided that beginning in  1994, all the imports of raw tobacco will be put under official  control. As early as 22 September 1993, the Customs General  Department issued Notice No. 793/TCHQ-GQ, which points out:  Those cigarette manufacturing units wishing to import raw  tobacco from Cambodia must seek quota allocations from the  Ministry of Commerce and must correctly comply with all  stipulations of the state governing the import of goods.""    At the request of the Vietnam Tobacco General Corporation,  the Ministry of Commerce on 3 February 1994 allowed the general  corporation to import $10 million worth of raw tobacco. After  that, the general corporation assigned the Nam Raw Tobacco  Company (in Thong Nhut district of Dong Nai province) the duty  to import $2 million worth of raw tobacco. ""Nevertheless, in  late March to early April 1994, this company continued to buy  large quantities of raw tobacco through their imports beyond the  quota allocated.""    In view of this violation, the 3d Market Control Team  inspected the company and seized over 152 tons of tobacco from  it. Later, however, the market control team somehow chose to  put this case into limbo, arguing that ""it found only a small  amount of tobacco -- 4,709 kilos -- kept by the company in  excess of the quantities of its duty-paid tobacco.""    After securing the release of its confiscated goods, the  company again bought 14 truckloads of raw tobacco. This time  the company's action could not go unoticed by members of the  C-15 Economic Police Unit who found the company had 98 tons of  duty-not-paid raw tobacco in its storage.    Because the company registered 6,000 dong as the import  price  per kilo of tobacco, compared to the real price of between  18,500-20,000 dong per kilo, it is believed that the company  ""delared the import price of its raw tobacco below the real  buying price to evade tax.""

0,FT942-12967 ,"FT942-12967 _AN-ED0DLAD8FT 940427   FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wheel of history goes full circle - A look at BAT's Dollars 1bn US acquisition      By TONY JACKSON and RICHARD TOMKINS   BAT's Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) purchase of American Tobacco, announced yesterday, brings the wheel of history full circle. At the turn of the century Buck Duke, the brilliant and aggressive founder of American Tobacco, attacked the UK tobacco market. British companies formed an alliance - Imperial Tobacco - to head him off. In 1902 the two companies struck a truce: each would leave the other's home market alone, while their overseas operations were merged in a new joint venture - British American Tobacco. By trapping both parents at home, the deal ensured their progeny would ultimately outgrow them. For American Tobacco, the game was up in 1911, when the US Supreme Court forced the sale of its BAT holding on monopoly grounds. Then, in 1927, BAT entered the US market by buying Brown  Williamson, now America's third biggest domestic tobacco company after Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco. American Tobacco, shrunk to a subsidiary of American Brands, is number five. Aside from the logic of history, the deal is in some respects a very odd one. The US tobacco industry is under unprecedented pressure. From a peak of 617bn cigarettes a year in 1977, the market last year was a mere 485bn. The Clinton administration is threatening new and sweeping curbs on smoking, and the market has been ferociously competitive ever since Philip Morris slashed the price of its Marlboro brand a year ago. According to US brokers Sanford C Bernstein, industry profits last year dropped from Dollars 9.6bn to Dollars 5.2bn. American Tobacco was worst hit again: from over Dollars 500m in 1991 and 1992, its pre-tax profits last year were just Dollars 169m. In addition BAT, like Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco and American Brands itself, has been using its cash flow to diversify. In BAT's case, the strategy since the mid-1980s has been to specialise in financial services. Granted, buying US tobacco assets at this point has an obvious contrarian appeal. In addition, the deal is a neat opportunity to gain US ownership of brands like Lucky Strike and Pall Mall, which BAT already owns elsewhere in the world. But does it not make nonsense of the group's overall direction? Not at all, says Mr Martin Broughton, BAT chief executive. The world tobacco industry has been restored to growth status by one decisive factor: the collapse of communism. Vast markets such as China and the former Soviet Union, previously closed to western companies, are now opening up. BAT is accordingly setting up joint ventures in such places as Uzbekistan and the Ukraine. America, Mr Broughton concedes, is in no sense a growth market. But it is cash-generative, and thus complements the new joint ventures, which are long-term and cash-hungry. In addition, he says, until a couple of years ago a US tobacco deal would have been ruled out on anti-trust grounds. Two things now convince him that this deal will be allowed. First, in a US court case in which BAT was involved two years ago, the judge ruled that the US tobacco market, while oligopolistic, was highly competitive. Second, the chaos caused by the Marlboro price war last year shows competition working in practice. Whatever BAT's arguments, it seems significant that American Brands' share price jumped by Dollars 2 to Dollars 33 3/4 yesterday, in spite of poor earnings figures reported for its first quarter. Clearly, one advantage American Brands expects from the deal - besides a handy Dollars 1bn of cash  -is relief from the downward pressure on its share price resulting from the political storm over smoking. Not that the deal takes it out of tobacco. Of its tobacco revenues of Dollars 7.4bn last year - more than half the group total - four fifths came not from American Tobacco but Gallaher, the international operation which is Britain's and Ireland's biggest cigarette company. But American Brands' drive away from tobacco has been single-minded. In the last five years it has spent nearly Dollars 5bn on acquisitions, building up a portfolio of consumer brands. Its large distilled spirits division takes in Jim Beam, the world's biggest-selling bourbon, and Whyte  Mackay, which became the world's third largest Scotch whisky producer with its acquisition of Invergordon Distillers last year. It also owns Franklin Life Insurance, MasterBrand locks and hardware, ACCO World office supplies and Dollond  Aitchison, Europe's biggest optician. For a long time now, American Tobacco has long looked a weak player in the US. With its Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Tareyton, Carlton, American, Monclair, Misty, Riviera, Private Stock, Prime and Summit brands, it has a small and declining share of the market, now less than 7 per cent, and looks vulnerable to further squeezing by the big companies in a shrinking market. For Mr Broughton, this is part of the appeal. BAT's market share is 11 per cent, making it a poor third after Philip Morris and RJR. American Tobacco is fifth. Putting the two together increases BAT's volume by half. 'We see a merger as being in the consumer's interest', Mr Broughton says - no doubt with one eye to the anti-trust authorities. 'It makes us a serious third force in the market.' Whether that is a desirable position remains to be seen. It is worth noting, though, that BAT's share price went up as did American Brands'. The undoing of history, it seems, has its own rewards.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Blending tobacco brands  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993                               BAT Industries      American brands                                                     (American Tobaccco                                                            subsidiary)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tobacco revenues                  Pounds 13.01bn         Dollars 1.5bn (as per cent of group revenues)    62.7 per cent         10.9 per cent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tobacco operating profits          Pounds 1.21bn        Dollars 169.2m (as per cent of group  operating profits)                57.8 per cent         11.2 per cent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tobacco brands owned jointly:         Lucky Strike and Pall Mall  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Other brands:               Kent, Kool, Player's          Tareyton and                    Barclay and State Express 555       Misty Montclair  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Other group businesses:           Allied Dunbar,      Gallaher Tobacco                           Eagle Star and Farmers       Whyte  Mackay,                       Group (financial services)   Jim Beam, Gilbey's,                                                   Ronrico and Vladivar                                                    (spirits), Titleist                                                      (golf equipment),                                                    Dolland  Aitchison                                                            (opticians)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  BAT Industries.

Japan Tobacco was due to be floated last year, along with East Japan Rail. The issues were postponed following a period of prolonged weakness for the Tokyo stock market. Japan Tobacco controls 83 per cent of the Y3,000bn (Dollars 28bn) domestic tobacco market. For the year to March, its pre-tax profits dipped 11.1 per cent to Y100.4bn on sales little changed at Y2,761.7bn. Mr Shigeru Mizuno, president of Japan Tobacco, said the company was looking to expand its exports and to diversify. In the initial listing, 33 per cent of the company's outstanding shares will be offered. Ahead of the listing, one-third of the tranche will be auctioned as a means of making an orderly secondary market. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, said the ministry would monitor developments on the stock market following JT's listing application.

The report, published yesterday, is the growers' answer to campaigners against tobacco, who claim that a reduction in the land and labour devoted to the tobacco industry would help to stop people smoking. Tobacco production in Zimbabwe, Malawi, the US and Canada is studied in the report, which identifies Canada as the only case where substitution might be possible, given the country's climatic disadvantages, falling domestic consumption and failure to find new export markets. In Zimbabwe and Malawi, however, many of the possible alternative crops 'are limited by instability, risk or difficulties in marketing and could take several years to yield their first returns'.

Speaking at a reception held by the All-China Federation of  Returned Overseas Chinese, Qian said that ""at present, with an  ever-growing economy, China enjoys political stability and good  unity among the people of various nationalities and is making  social progress.""    China has also made new progress in its friendly relations  with other countries, while the Chinese people have enhanced  their friendship with the people in the rest of the world, said  Qian, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the party  Central Committee.    He praised returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives for  plunging themselves into China's reform, opening up and  modernization drive, and making great contributions to the  country's social development and progress.    He described Chinese nationals residing abroad as the most  ""active and zealous force"" for promoting opening up and economic  and trade cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and  other countries.    ""They have made great contributions to the expansion of  friendly ties between China and the countries they reside in and  to the prosperity of their motherland,"" Qian told the gathering  of 1,200 people.    He quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying that bringing into full  play the role of Overseas Chinese and foreigners of Chinese  origin serves as a ""unique opportunity"" for China to achieve  tremendous development.    The present international and domestic situations have  provided a rare favorable opportunity for China to develop, he  said, noting ""it is possible that the world will usher in a  relatively long period of peace.    ""The economic vitality of the Asia-Pacific region has  continued to rise, providing favorable conditions for China's  economic expansion,"" he said.    ""Achieving the sacred cause of China's reunification is a  common aspiration of the entire Chinese people, including our  compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as Overseas  Chinese,"" he said.    The vice-premier said that the Chinese Government and people  are committed to and can certainly promote the country's  peaceful reunification in line with the principle of ""one  country, two systems.""    He described China as a major force for maintaining peace  and  stability throughout the world. ""We will, as always, pursue an  independent policy for peace and persist in expanding friendly  and cooperative relations with other countries on the five  principles of peaceful coexistence,"" he said.    ""We will also continue to make positive efforts to establish  a peaceful, stable, fair and rational new international order,""  Qian added.     "

0,FT944-1783 ,"FT944-1783 _AN-ELSDLAAQFT 941219   FT  19 DEC 94 / BAT nears American Tobacco takeover consent      By RICHARD TOMKINS      NEW YORK   BAT Industries, the British tobacco and financial services group, looks well placed to win a US court's consent this week for its planned Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover of American Tobacco, the fifth biggest US cigarette maker. Over the past two weeks the US Federal Trade Commission has been arguing in a New York court that the takeover should be blocked on competition grounds because BAT already owns Brown  Williamson Tobacco, the third biggest US cigarette maker. The case closed last Wednesday with the judge reserving his decision, so neither side yet knows the outcome. But lawyers for the Federal Trade Commission acknowledge that BAT seems to have come out ahead. Mr Merlin Orlans, who represented the FTC during the hearing, said that the judge had clearly not been disposed towards the FTC's arguments. During the hearing, the FTC argued that the US tobacco industry was already highly concentrated because it had only six participants. If two of the participants combined, the FTC said, competition would be further reduced and it would become easier for the remaining participants to raise prices. BAT countered that a merger of Brown  Williamson with its 11 per cent market share and American Tobacco with its 7 per cent share would increase the combined company's ability to compete with Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds Tobacco, the two industry giants, which together account for 70 per cent of US cigarette sales. The FTC appeared to start the proceedings with a strong case, but as the hearing progressed, it became evident from Judge Milton Pollack's grilling of key FTC witnesses that he was far from convinced by the FTC's arguments. Judge Pollack is thought likely to announce his decision tomorrow or Wednesday. But the FTC and BAT may yet reach a settlement before then under which the FTC would drop its opposition to the takeover. For the FTC, a compromise would be better than an outright defeat. For BAT, an agreement would eliminate the likelihood that the FTC, if defeated, would further delay the takeover by lodging an appeal. One compromise that the FTC and BAT are understood to have considered would involve an agreement by BAT that it would shed an American Tobacco factory and some its brands if the takeover went ahead.

The criticism came from the Advertising Association and the Tobacco Advisory Council, which represents the main tobacco manufacturers. In its response to the report the association said it had used invalid evidence and had ignored international research that contradicted the report's conclusions. It said the report: 'Reviewed only a small fraction of the evidence on the subject of the effect of tobacco advertising on tobacco consumption.' 'Ignores the extensive literature relating to the basic question of how advertising actually works.' 'Arrives at sweeping and unjustified conclusions based on a limited and incomplete review of the available evidence.' The association quoted a 1984 World Health Organisation study of smoking behaviour among schoolchildren in Norway and Finland, where tobacco advertising was banned, and Austria and the UK, where it was not. It concluded: 'A difference (in smoking habits) might have been expected. No such systematic differences are found'. The Tobacco Advisory Council suggested in its response that the generally accepted view of researchers was that children who smoked became aware of advertising, while children who did not smoke ignored it. In the UK about Pounds 60m annually is spent on tobacco advertising in the press and on posters.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P7319  Advertising, NEC.

0,FT924-317 ,"FT924-317 _AN-CL2BCAA3FT 921229   FT  29 DEC 92 / Bucking the Trend: Lack of frills keeps curtain maker on track - How a move upmarket and a new sales director helped transform Curtina      By DANIEL GREEN   OUTSIDE the plain grey office door of Mr Len Bichard, chairman of curtain-maker Curtina, staff work quickly, cutting, sewing and folding material. They need to work quickly. Sales have doubled since 1990 and turnover for the current year should pass Pounds 18m. Exports have taken off over the same period and account for 10 per cent of sales. Mr Bichard's salary last year was Pounds 106,688, up from Pounds 41,234 the year before. It has been a long haul. He started the company in 1967 after working for textiles group Courtaulds. For 20 years he made a steady living selling velvet curtains from Rainham, a decaying town in Essex. Then two decisions transformed the company: a move into printed fabrics and the recruitment of a new sales director. 'We looked at the price of grey (raw) cloth and the price of printing and found the others were charging four times cost. We thought we could charge double,' says Mr Bichard. That strategy has been maintained with the help of cost control. Only 15 per cent of sales are through freelance agents. The rest is sold by just three people, including Mr Bichard and his sales director. There are no secretaries. 'We make our own phone calls and write one letter a week.' There is no design studio. Patterns are bought from freelance designers. Specialist equipment for handling materials, such as cloth cutters, are built by a freelance engineer. Offices are plain to the point of shabbiness. The chairman's office is lit by three ceiling striplights. The chairs are a tatty lime green. Corporate entertaining is out. 'We are not interested in fancy lunches. Even the PR is on the cheap.' The choice of curtain prints has helped growth. 'The taste of the curtain-buyer has always been seen as lower middle class,' says Mr Bichard. 'We gave them better taste and they bought it.' With top management making up the sales team, financial policies are designed to save time. Equipment is bought outright, there is no rented property and no discounting of invoices. Not everything is going well, however. Managing growth is unfamiliar ground and the value of stocks has been allowed to rise to Pounds 3.25m. 'We are addressing the problem,' says Mr Bichard. The rise of exports means the tiny sales team is out of its depth. 'We have not geared up to the standards we need to maximise overseas sales. Since the pound fell we have had many more enquiries but our growth rate is stretching us and limiting our selling drive.' Those limits have brought their own benefits, Mr Bichard argues. The company has been able to choose its customers to minimise the risk of bad debts. 'If someone doesn't pay on time we simply don't deal. If they fall down on the first payment we go in and take the goods back.' Growth has also brought buying power. Curtina's factories in Rainham and Leyland, Lancashire, consume about 100,000 metres of grey cloth a week. Sales agents are knocking on the company's doors to offer cut-price deals. Mr Bichard blames the 'silly' boom of the 1980s for rivals losing ground or failing in the recession. 'Manufacturers recruited irresponsibly and buyers were able to buy badly. 'Then things turned and management put the pressure on buyers. Money got dear and retailers had to address stock levels. A 10-week lead time was normal but our lead time is one week. We don't send a confirmation letter of an order, the goods would arrive first.' The result is a growing list of customers, including John Lewis Partnership, Debenhams and Allied Carpets. Overseas customers include mail-order group Quelle Grossversandhaus, Germany's second-largest fashion retailer. At 61, Mr Bichard is an informal boss. He laughs easily and sometimes seems awed by the pace of change. 'We don't have a five-year plan,' he says sheepishly. 'We've not yet got used to the idea we are becoming a reasonably sized business.'  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

0,FT944-18457 ,"FT944-18457 _AN-EJDDVABQFT 941004   FT  04 OCT 94 / Tobacco crop profits fall in third world      By ALISON MAITLAND   Tobacco farmers in developing countries could be better off growing crops such as maize, according to a report by Panos, the independent London-based research institute. The report challenges claims by the tobacco industry that the crop is profitable for the third world. It says tobacco prices have fallen by 50 per cent in real terms over the last decade, assuming annual inflation of 4 per cent. Last year, prices fell by about a third because of over-supply. They have recovered this year, but the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation says global stocks are high, at about 85 per cent of annual output, and expects prices to remain depressed. At the same time, farmers face sharply increased prices for fertilisers and pesticides. 'Falling prices plus rising costs suggest tobacco growing is a poor prospect for the South's farmers,' says the report, published to coincide with an international conference in Paris next week on tobacco and health. Over 40 developing countries export tobacco, but in only two - Malawi and Zimbabwe - does tobacco account for more than 2.2 per cent of foreign earnings, the report says. 'The role of tobacco exports in the economies of developing countries needs to be kept in proportion.' According to the International Tobacco Growers' Association, no sustainable alternative crops would achieve the same level of earnings for most tobacco farmers. The Panos report says such claims are increasingly being disputed and the search for alternatives has been given a boost by the dramatic fall in the auction price of tobacco in Zimbabwe and Malawi last year. In Zimbabwe, maize had become more profitable in terms of money invested and cost less to insure than tobacco. In Bangladesh, potatoes and cotton gave farmers bigger net profits than tobacco. The report argues that the health and environmental costs of tobacco production should also be taken into account. The World Health Organisation says that 7m people will die in developing countries from smoking-related diseases every year by 2025 if current growth in smoking continues. Tobacco crops cause a serious loss of trees, which are cut down for fuel to cure the tobacco, and occupy land for longer periods than alternatives such as maize. 'In semi-arid areas, where tobacco thrives, the loss of trees can make land more vulnerable to desertification and unfit for agriculture.'

""A big part of it is the Canadian bill that shows such legislation can work and  is not just pie in the sky,"" said Phil Wilbur, director of Advocacy Institute,  a health research center in Washington.    About 100 anti-smoking bills are pending before Congress, including one drafted  by Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) to restrict print advertising and another by Sen.  Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) to eliminate the tax deductibility of tobacco  advertising.    Rep. Tom Lukin (D-Ohio) has asked the Justice Department to look into whether  product placement in movies that might appear on television violates the  current advertising ban.    ""The mood in the United States has changed. The swing is against the special  interests represented by the tobacco companies,"" Wilbur said in a telephone  interview.    He said many of the bills were drafted after Canada led the way. Canada's  smoking ban on airline flights of less than 2 hours' duration in 1987 preceded  similar legislation in the United States.    In 1987, the Conservative government also considered a complete ban on smoking  but opted instead for the restrictive Tobacco Products Control Act that banned  newspaper and magazine advertising and required cigarette companies to disclose  to the Health Department the ingredients in their cigarettes.    A ban on billboard advertising takes effect next January and tobacco companies  have also been ordered to halt sponsorships of sports and cultural events.    Garfield Mahood, executive director of the Non-Smokers Rights Assn. in Toronto  credited with leading the anti-smoking campaign, said the United States will be  under pressure to pass its own Tobacco Products Control Act.    ""Americans have a great appreciation of the value of disclosure and this bill  is an example,"" Mahood said.    ""American legislators will be hard pressed to tell Americans why, when the  industry (in Canada) is disclosing the toxic constituents of second-hand smoke,  that information should be privileged in the United States.""    The Canadian law has infuriated tobacco companies, which are going to ingenious  lengths to avoid the disclosure clause.    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. of Winston-Salem, N.C. said in January that it was  changing the recipe of its four brands sold in Canada -- Winston, Camel, Salem  and More -- to get around the disclosure regulation.    ""The company doesn't have to give the recipe to any other government. To  protect the confidentiality (of ingredients) it made a switch on the Canadian  product,"" said Jeffrey Labow of RJR Macdonald Inc., the Canadian subsidiary of  R.J. Reynolds.    Labow said the new brands went on sale 3 weeks ago and it is still too early to  estimate the impact on sales. However, the company said its research indicated  that people who tried them ""don't see any difference whatsoever.""    U.S. cigarette makers want to protect their tiny niche in Canada, where imports  have a 1% market share. The market is expected to improve under the U.S.-Canada  free trade agreement, which will reduce or eliminate tariffs on imported  American cigarettes.    Statistics Canada, the government's reporting agency, estimated that there were  5.6 million smokers in the country in 1986. While the number of male smokers  has declined, a growing number of women seem to be taking up the habit, it  said.    Canada's three tobacco companies, RJR Macdonald, Imperial Tobacco Ltd. and  Rothmans Benson & Hedges Inc., have launched separate court challenges of  the Tobacco Products Control Act.    RJR Macdonald, in documents filed in the Quebec Superior Court, charges that  the legislation violates freedom of speech guarantees in the Charter of Rights  and Freedoms.    The company also says the law puts Canadian cigarette companies at a  disadvantage because the advertising ban does not apply to foreign magazines.  About 60% of cigarette advertising read by Canadians appears in U.S.  publications.    In the United States, the American Bar Assn., along with the newspaper and  magazine publishing industries, vigorously opposed similar legislation  suggested 2 years ago.

About 100 anti-smoking bills are pending before Congress, including one drafted  by Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) to restrict print advertising and another by Sen.  Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) to eliminate the tax deductibility of tobacco  advertising.    Rep. Tom Lukin (D-Ohio) has asked the Justice Department to look into whether  product placement in movies that might appear on television violates the  current advertising ban.    ""The mood in the United States has changed. The swing is against the special  interests represented by the tobacco companies,"" Wilbur said in a telephone  interview.    He said many of the bills were drafted after Canada led the way. Canada's  smoking ban on airline flights of less than 2 hours' duration in 1987 preceded  similar legislation in the United States.    In 1987, the Conservative government also considered a complete ban on smoking  but opted instead for the restrictive Tobacco Products Control Act that banned  newspaper and magazine advertising and required cigarette companies to disclose  to the Health Department the ingredients in their cigarettes.    A ban on billboard advertising takes effect next January and tobacco companies  have also been ordered to halt sponsorships of sports and cultural events.    Garfield Mahood, executive director of the Non-Smokers Rights Assn. in Toronto  credited with leading the anti-smoking campaign, said the United States will be  under pressure to pass its own Tobacco Products Control Act.    ""Americans have a great appreciation of the value of disclosure and this bill  is an example,"" Mahood said.    ""American legislators will be hard pressed to tell Americans why, when the  industry (in Canada) is disclosing the toxic constituents of second-hand smoke,  that information should be privileged in the United States.""    The Canadian law has infuriated tobacco companies, which are going to ingenious  lengths to avoid the disclosure clause.    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. of Winston-Salem, N.C. said in January that it was  changing the recipe of its four brands sold in Canada -- Winston, Camel, Salem  and More -- to get around the disclosure regulation.    ""The company doesn't have to give the recipe to any other government. To  protect the confidentiality (of ingredients) it made a switch on the Canadian  product,"" said Jeffrey Labow of RJR Macdonald Inc., the Canadian subsidiary of  R.J. Reynolds.    Labow said the new brands went on sale 3 weeks ago and it is still too early to  estimate the impact on sales. However, the company said its research indicated  that people who tried them ""don't see any difference whatsoever.""    U.S. cigarette makers want to protect their tiny niche in Canada, where imports  have a 1% market share. The market is expected to improve under the U.S.-Canada  free trade agreement, which will reduce or eliminate tariffs on imported  American cigarettes.    Statistics Canada, the government's reporting agency, estimated that there were  5.6 million smokers in the country in 1986. While the number of male smokers  has declined, a growing number of women seem to be taking up the habit, it  said.    Canada's three tobacco companies, RJR Macdonald, Imperial Tobacco Ltd. and  Rothmans Benson & Hedges Inc., have launched separate court challenges of  the Tobacco Products Control Act.    RJR Macdonald, in documents filed in the Quebec Superior Court, charges that  the legislation violates freedom of speech guarantees in the Charter of Rights  and Freedoms.    The company also says the law puts Canadian cigarette companies at a  disadvantage because the advertising ban does not apply to foreign magazines.  About 60% of cigarette advertising read by Canadians appears in U.S.  publications.    In the United States, the American Bar Assn., along with the newspaper and  magazine publishing industries, vigorously opposed similar legislation  suggested 2 years ago.

A lower court had found the ban unconstitutional and the federal government had appealed. The tobacco industry, which has complied with the federal ban since 1989, said it would almost certainly take the case to the Supreme Court of Canada. The three big tobacco producers seeking a final ruling on the ban are led by Imasco, the Canadian arm of BAT Industries.   Countries:-  CAZ  Canada.   Industries:-  P21  Tobacco Products.

The domestic tobacco business's operating profits slumped from Dollars 102.5m to Dollars 55.4m in the first quarter, on revenues down from Dollars 407.5m to Dollars 376.5m - mainly because of the price war that broke out in the US cigarette market in April last year. The downturn was a big factor in cutting American Brands' total net profits for the first quarter to Dollars 149.2m from Dollars 247.1m before last year's accounting changes. Turnover fell from Dollars 1.89bn to Dollars 1.33bn and fully-diluted earnings per share fell from Dollars 1.22 before accounting changes to 74 cents. However, the domestic tobacco business was not the only poor performer. Gallaher, the international tobacco business that is not included in the sale to BAT, suffered because of a shift in the timing of the UK budget from April to November. This caused the pre-budget sales bulge to disappear, taking operating profits down to Dollars 126.2m from Dollars 165.1m. The spirits business also showed a dip in operating profits, to Dollars 38.4m from Dollars 44.9m, in spite of last year's acquisition of Invergordon Distillers. American Brands said this was because of a planned, one-time reduction in inventory levels at Jim Beam. American Brands said the disposal of American Tobacco would leave it with profitable, strongly-positioned businesses that had performed well. It warned that unusual factors 'may well result in unfavourable profit comparisons' for 1994. But it lifted the quarterly dividend from 49.25 cents a share to 50 cents.

This was stated at the work meeting of Shanghai overseas  enterprises, which ended here yesterday.    As the representative of Shanghai municipal government for  overseas investment and headquarters of all Shanghai's  enterprises and companies in foreign countries, the Shanghai  Overseas Company has decide to center its efforts on  establishment of more overseas group companies this year.    By now, more than 420 enterprises belonging to Shanghai's  Foreign Trade, Industry, Agriculture and Science Departments  have been set up in 60-plus countries and regions of the world,  managing to increase exports and primarily form an overseas  marketing network.    To better organize these diverse enterprises and increase  their competitiveness in international markets, Shanghai  Overseas Company is now determined to shift them toward  multi-functional transnational group companies.    Apart from the existing five overseas group companies in  Oceania, America, CIS, Japan and Hong Kong, a new one will be  set up in Europe. Branches will also be added in Singapore, the  Republic of Korea, Africa and South-East Asia.    These group companies will carry out varied transnational  business through share-purchasing, share-holding, annexing and  joint management and marketing.    International standards will be adopted in the management of  these group companies and decision-making powers in many aspects  will be granted to the overseas companies themselves.    It is also expected that by taking advantage of existing  overseas marketing networks, specialized talents, management  experience and information on demand, the new group companies to  be established will stimulate exports and foreign trade of  domestic enterprises.    Shanghai Overseas Company also aims to establish a domestic  trade network based on the 9,000-plus foreign trade enterprises  in Shanghai to match its overseas network.     "

These regulations allow the establishment of   definite American viticultural areas. The regulations also   allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be used   as an appellation of origin in the labeling and advertising   of wine.     On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision   ATF60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR,   providing for the listing of approved American viticultural   areas. Section 4.25a(e)(1), title 27, CFR, defines an   American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing   region distinguishable by geographical features, the   boundaries of which have been delineated in Subpart C of   part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for   proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested   person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region   as a viticultural area. The petition should include:     (a) Evidence that the name of the proposed   viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as   referring to the area specified in the petition;     (b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries   of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition;     (c) Evidence relating to the geographical features   (climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which   distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area   from surrounding areas;     (d) A description of the specific boundaries of the   viticultural area, based on features which can be found on   United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the   largest applicable scale; and     (e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the   boundaries prominently marked.

It contains approximately 2160 acres,   of which approximately 2.5 acres are planted to vineyards.

The regulations also   allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be used   as an appellation of origin in the labeling and advertising   of wine.     On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision   ATF60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR,   providing for the listing of approved American viticultural   areas. Section 4.25a(e)(1), title 27, CFR, defines an   American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing   region distinguishable by geographical features, the   boundaries of which have been delineated in Subpart C of   part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for   proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested   person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region   as a viticultural area. The petition should include:     (a) Evidence that the name of the proposed   viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as   referring to the area specified in the petition;     (b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries   of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition;     (c) Evidence relating to the geographical features   (climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which   distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area   from surrounding areas;     (d) A description of the specific boundaries of the   viticultural area, based on features which can be found on   United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the   largest applicable scale; and     (e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the   boundaries prominently marked.         Petition         ATF has received a petition from Brian J. Helsaple of   Seiad Valley Vineyards proposing to establish a   viticultural area in Siskiyou County, California, to be   known as ``Seiad Valley.'' The proposed viticultural area is   located in northwestern California, about 15 miles south of   the Oregon border. It contains approximately 2160 acres,   of which approximately 2.5 acres are planted to vineyards.   Seiad Valley Vineyards is the only commercial grower and   the only wine producer currently active within the proposed   viticultural area.         Evidence of Name         Evidence that the name of the proposed area is locally   and/or nationally known as referring to the area specified   in the petition includes:            "

Yun Sok-ku said 18 Korean companies, including Korea  Petroleum Development Corp., are exploring for oil in 18  projects in 14 countries.    Korean firms have spent 1.2 billion U.S. dollars on oil  development projects abroad and registered an income of 910  million dollars from them, scoring a 75-percent recovery rate.  But since the regions being explored for oil are becoming more  remote and deeper in the sea, the success rate has declined and  the investment cost risen, he said.    Yun called on the government to help boost overseas oil  development by increasing financial assistance, educating  personnel and building up a comprehensive information network.     "

Petition         ATF has received a petition, dated June 4, 1993, filed on behalf of the Wine Institute, a trade association of California wineries which represents approximately 80 percent of the total U.S. wine production. According to the petitioner, a regulatory definition of ``reserve'' is necessary to permit U.S. ``reserve''_designated wines to be sold for export in European Communities (EC) countries.     Specifically, Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2392/89 of July 24, 1989, Article 26(2)(c) allows for supplemental information on imported wine labels, subject to certain restrictions. Details ``regarding superior quality'' are allowed on the label ``in so far as they are prescribed by the national provisions of the third country in which the wine originates for the domestic market of that country and are recognized by the Community.''    ATF has been informed that the EC considers that the term ``reserve'' is a term which refers to ``superior quality.'' In the absence of a regulatory definition of the term ``reserve'' in the U.S., which would apply to wines produced for domestic consumption, products bearing this term can be prohibited from being sold in EC member countries. The petitioner states that Germany, for example, prohibits the importation of U.S. wines that bear the term ``reserve'' on the label. The petition does not state whether other EC member nations have taken this position.    The petitioner also believes that defining the term in the regulations would provide for uniform meaning and, consequently, be of benefit to consumers. They contend that the use of the term ``reserve'' is so prolific in the marketplace that its meaning has been lost, resulting in consumer confusion.            "

International tobacco companies Rothmans and Reynolds have indicated their readiness to invest heavily in Bulgaria. However, Bulgarian tobacco growers face short-term difficulties if agrarian reform does not stimulate production from fields that have newly been returned to private owners. Last year, production was only half what it was in the early 1980s when Bulgaria was thebiggest tobacco producer in Europe with a 19 per cent market share and was the world's seventh largest producer. Now the country produces only 10 per cent of Europe's tobacco, and ranks 14th in the world. Bulgartabac, the state-owned tobacco monopoly, was once the world's biggest exporter of cigarettes and the second largest tobacco exporter. Tobacco and cigarettes accounted for half of Bulgaria's exported processed agricultural products. But the US overtook Bulgaria in the 1980s and now exports more than twice as much tobacco. The loss of former Soviet and Comecon markets in recent years has crippled export sales. Bulgar- tabac's exports to the CIS last year were only 76 per cent of those to the Soviet Union in 1991. Exports to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia also fell after customs duties went up to protect their industries. Bulgartabac officials complain that the Bulgarian government did just the opposite last year when it cut customs duties from 80 to 40 per cent. As a result cigarette imports rose to 6.5m kg in 1992, equal to the annual production of 10,000 Bulgarian farmers, according to the Union of Tobacco Producers. Meanwhile, farmers complain that the prices paid for their tobacco by the state monopoly cover under 70 per cent of production costs. The UTP claims that, given the incentive of higher prices, tobacco production could leap to 100m kg. As it is, Bulgaria's 12 tobacco-processing plants and nine cigarette-producing factories operated at only 60 per cent of capacity last year.   Companies:-  Bulgartabac.

Taxable profits at the group, the world's third-largest tobacco company, rose by 10.9 per cent to Y110.45bn (Dollars 1.06bn) in the year to the end of March, mainly due to cost reductions, on sales up by 1.6 per cent to Y3,462bn. The small increase in turnover reflects the fact that Japan's tobacco market, where Japan Tobacco holds an 83 per cent share, is mature. But the group has lowered its break-even point by cutting staff and reducing the number of outlets in a restructuring programme which began in 1985. However, pre-tax profits for the current year are expected to stagnate at around Y110bn, said the group, on sales up slightly to Y3,500bn.   Companies:-  Japan Tobacco.

The Principles of the Adjusted Economic Policy on Tobacco    The adjusted economic policy on tobacco will be suited to  our  socialist market economy development, by giving consideration to  the interests of the three parties of tobacco farmers, local  governments, and tobacco enterprises, in order to ensure that  the real income of peasants for a normal harvest year does not  drop, and to essentially maintain the existing tobacco-product  tax level, while basically not raising cigarette-enterprise  production costs.    II. Strict Control of Tobacco Production    To control unchecked tobacco production, all provinces and  autonomous regions, when purchasing tobacco, will  conscientiously implement the provisions in the State Council  National Document No 7 (1993) on ""all taxes on tobacco exceeding  state planned procurement being paid into Central revenues, and  the purchasing prices of tobacco sold to the state that exceeds  plans or is unplanned floating downward 20 percent,"" with taxes  on all tobacco that exceeds state-assigned annual procurement  plans being calculated according to the average tax per dan (50  kg) of flue-cured tobacco for the year in the province  (autonomous region), and paid into Central revenues. When  arranging particular procurement plans, we will implement the  principle of supporting excellence, in order to gradually cut  back on the area planted to tobacco that is not suited to  tobacco cultivation.    III. Adjusted Tobacco Procurement Prices    As flue-cured tobacco standards are now in a stage of  transition from 15 to 40 grades and, in line with the principles  of market demand and price based on quality, tobacco procurement  prices are correspondingly adjusted to the two separate  flue-cured tobacco standards of 15 and 40 grades (See  attachments 1 and 2). The former state-set tobacco production  support charge will be incorporated into the tobacco procurement  price.    IV. The Adjusted Tobacco Product Tax Rate    The tobacco-product tax rate is based on the adjusted  tobacco-procurement price, being lowered from 38 percent to 31  percent in line with the principle of essentially maintaining  the current tobacco-tax level. The Ministry of Finance and the  State Administration of Taxation will draw up the particular  regulations on the adjustment of taxpayment links.    V. Deregulated Tobacco Allocation Prices    In line with the needs of establishing a socialist market  economy and based on our current realities, we are deregulating  tobacco-allocation prices. The specific means of application  will be drawn up by the pertinent commercial department of the  State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau.    These regulations will take effect for 1993's new tobacco  listings, with white-rib tobacco, perfume tobacco, and sun-cured  tobacco implementing the adjusted plan for flue-cured tobacco.  As Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi province (autonomous  region) tobacco is in the latter stage of procurement, the  respective provincial (autonomous regional) People's Governments  will decide whether these provinces (autonomous region) will  implement in 1993 the new flue-cured tobacco procurement prices  and tobacco product tax rate.

0,FT944-5280 ,"FT944-5280 _AN-ELECYAAPFT 941205   FT  05 DEC 94 / BAT's American tobacco hopes raise a question of competition: Richard Tomkins reports on the US cigarette market and why the anti-trust regulator opposes a bid by the British group      By RICHARD TOMKINS   In 1927, the British took over a big chunk of the US cigarette industry when the UK company now known as BAT Industries bought Brown  Williamson Tobacco, one of the largest US cigarette manufacturers. Now BAT Industries is trying to take another slice through a Dollars 1bn takeover of American Tobacco. Will the US let it happen? The answer will largely hang on a hearing that begins today in New York, at the end of which a US federal court will decide whether or not to support the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to block the acquisition. BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and financial services group, made its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m) cash offer for American Tobacco, the fifth biggest US cigarette maker, in April. The would-be vendor is American Brands, the diversified US consumer products group that is American Tobacco's parent. Both BAT and American Brands are keen to complete the deal. But at the end of October the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would try to halt it, saying the takeover would substantially reduce competition in the US cigarette market and result in anti-competitive pricing. Over the next two weeks, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York will consider the FTC's request for an injunction barring the acquisition. In theory, an injunction would be a temporary measure pending a full hearing of the FTC's complaint; in practice, the court's decision, or any appeal against it, is likely to settle the matter. In many ways, it seems odd that BAT should want to buy American Tobacco at all. In the US, the proportion of adults who smoke has dwindled to 25 per cent, and in the last 10 years cigarette sales have been shrinking the rate of 2-3 per cent a year. Meanwhile, smokers and cigarette makers are under siege: big increases in cigarette taxes may be on the way, the Clinton administration is threatening to introduce sweeping curbs on smoking in public places, and the manufacturers are facing a new wave of product liability lawsuits from well-heeled plaintiff attorneys. These factors, however, have driven down the market value of US cigarette companies, making them more attractive to buyers. And since BAT Industries already owns Brown  Williamson in the US, it stands to reap big benefits from the acquisition of American Tobacco because of the cost savings that would result from merging the two companies' manufacturing and distribution. The FTC's objection to the takeover rests on the argument that it would remove a player from a market that is already highly concentrated. American Tobacco has not followed other companies' price increases, the FTC says, so the acquisition would eliminate an aggressive competitor. If American Tobacco went, the chances of collusion between remaining players would increase, and prices would probably go up. The FTC's argument is compelling. There are only six cigarette manufacturers in the US, one of which is already owned by BAT. According to US merger guidelines, a market is regarded as highly concentrated if it scores more than 1,800 points on a formula called the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. The US cigarette market scores more than 2,900. Yet BAT has some strong arguments, too. It points out that the two largest companies in the US cigarette market, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds Tobacco, together account for more than 70 per cent of cigarette sales. BAT's Brown  Williamson, the third biggest, has only 11 per cent. Even after a merger with American Tobacco, Brown  Williamson would remain a distant third with a market share of less than 18 per cent: but a stronger Brown  Williamson would be better able to compete with the two market giants. On price, BAT says there is no likelihood of collusion, with or without the takeover. Competition is becoming more intense as manufacturers fight to increase sales in a shrinking market. In addition, restrictions on cigarette advertising have eroded loyalty to all but the most powerful brands, leading to extremely competitive pricing. Recently, BAT points out, the downward pressure on prices has grown still stronger because of the proliferation of cut-price, own-label cigarettes. If evidence were needed of the increasing competitive pressures, it came last year on 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip Morris slashed the price of its leading brand to claw back market share. The arguments are finely balanced and it would take a brave pundit to predict the outcome. But BAT does at least start with the advantage that it has been here before: in 1988 it spend eight months fighting the regulatory authorities in nine states before succeeding in its Dollars 5.2bn takeover bid for Farmers, the US insurance group.

0,FT944-812 ,"FT944-812 _AN-ELWCWAD0FT 941223   FT  23 DEC 94 / BAT wins go-ahead for US tobacco deal      By RICHARD TOMKINS      NEW YORK   BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and financial services group, has won US government approval for its planned Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover of American Tobacco, the fifth-biggest US cigarette maker. The US Federal Trade Commission withdrew its opposition to the deal in exchange for undertakings that BAT would divest some of American Tobacco's minor brands in the next 12 months. The acquisition will take place immediately. The US brands that BAT will acquire are Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Carlton in the premium sector and Misty, Private Stock and some private-label brands in the lower-priced segment. BAT will also get the rights to sell Silk Cut outside Europe. BAT said the acquisition would result in a restructuring charge of about Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m after-tax for the year just ending, but expected to derive efficiency savings of Dollars 200m a year by combining American Tobacco's headquarters and sales organisations with those of Brown  Williamson, the US tobacco company it already owns. BAT agreed to buy American Tobacco from American Brands, its US parent, in April, but the FTC sought to block the bid on competition grounds. During a federal court hearing, the FTC argued that the US tobacco industry was already highly concentrated with only six participants. BAT countered that a merger of Brown  Williamson with its 11 per cent market share and American Tobacco with its 7 per cent share would increase the combined company's ability to compete with Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds Tobacco, the two industry giants, which together account for 70 per cent of US cigarette sales. The eight-day court hearing ended last week, with the judge reserving his decision. FTC lawyers later acknowledged that the case had gone badly for them: but BAT was under pressure to do a deal with the FTC because of the risk that the commission would appeal against an unfavourable decision, further delaying the deal. Yesterday's out-of-court settlement requires BAT to divest Montclair, a low-priced brand, and certain minor discount brands within 12 months. The acquiring company will also be given the option of buying Tareyton, a premium brand. As a result of the divestitures, BAT's share of the US cigarette market will rise to 17 per cent instead of the 18 per cent originally envisaged.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.

0,FT941-1212 ,"FT941-1212 _AN-EC0AVAAGFT 940326   FT  26 MAR 94 / Clinton steps up attack on cigarette industry      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   The Clinton administration yesterday launched a ferocious two-pronged assault on the cigarette industry, already reeling from a wave of anti-smoking measures. As the Labour Department announced plans to ban smoking from the workplace, federal health officials began an attempt to regulate nicotine as an addictive drug. Regulations proposed yesterday by Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, would in effect ban smoking from all workplaces, including rest areas, except in enclosed areas with direct ventilation to the outside. The proposed rules, which could come into force next year, would stop smoking in bars and restaurants because no one could be required to work in an area where smoking was permitted. Complying with the proposed rules could cost businesses Dollars 8.1bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in the first year and Dollars 6.6bn a year thereafter. But Mr Reich said this would be outweighed by a Dollars 15bn a year improvement in worker productivity. The move follows new evidence of the damage caused by passive smoking. However, Mr Charles Whitley, spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, defended the cigarette industry, saying: 'I deny that cigarettes cause cancer.' Dr David Kessler, head of the US Food and Drug Administration, yesterday presented a strong case to the House of Representatives health committee for regulating nicotine as an addictive drug - a move that could lead to the withdrawal of cigarettes that contain nicotine. Nicotine 'meets all the criteria of an addictive substance', Dr Kessler told a House of Representatives health committee yesterday, citing studies showing that laboratory rats would administer doses of nicotine to themselves. He suggested cigarette manufacturers were manipulating nicotine levels in their products. He added that he was aware of no evidence that manufacturers left nicotine in their cigarettes for any reason other than addiction. Dr Kessler's comments implicitly contradicted Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, which on Thursday filed a Dollars 10bn libel suit against ABC, the US television network, over allegations of 'spiking' its cigarettes with nicotine. Philip Morris acknowledges that it removes nicotine during the manufacturing process and adds it back later, but says it puts back less than it takes out. Tobacco companies also face a stiff increase in taxes on their products as part of the healthcare reform legislation now being considered by Congress.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT942-895 ,"FT942-895 _AN-EF0DGAEBFT 940627   FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: BAT looks again at Dollars 1bn deal - American Tobacco acquisition in jeopardy after FDA accusations      By PAUL ABRAHAMS   BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and insurance group, yesterday warned that its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) acquisition of American Tobacco could be jeopardised by the increasingly aggressive attitude of the US Food and Drug Administration. The warning follows accusations last week by Mr David Kessler, FDA commissioner, that a US subsidiary of BAT had secretly developed a form of tobacco with high nicotine content through genetic engineering. Mr Kessler's allegations were part of a campaign by the FDA to gain regulatory control of the tobacco industry. Mr Michael Prideaux, director of public affairs at BAT, said: 'If the FDA takes control of tobacco regulation and introduces closet prohibition - by stopping the sale of cigarettes containing nicotine or banning cigarettes that generate smoke - that could have a material impact on the results of American Tobacco.' The contract between BAT and American Brands, the diversified US owner of American Tobacco, contains a material adverse change clause, according to BAT. This allows BAT to cancel the deal - though not change the price - if the results of American Tobacco, the US's fifth largest tobacco group, deteriorate significantly. 'We will be looking carefully at American Tobacco's next few quarters,' said Mr Prideaux. The deal is scheduled to be concluded by April 1995. The acquisition, currently being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, would increase BAT's sales by about 50 per cent, raising its share of the US cigarette market from 11 per cent to 18 per cent. BAT is already the US's third biggest cigarette manufacturer. Mr Thomas Sandefur, chairman of BAT's subsidiary, Brown  Williamson Tobacco, last week accused Mr Kessler of leading 'a dangerous crusade' to advance his 'personal and political agenda' of banning tobacco products. 'We don't expect Mr Kessler to succeed in his agenda - the tobacco industry is already tightly regulated. But it's a worrying development,' said Mr Prideaux. Any attempt to pull out of the acquisition would probably lead to litigation with American Brands, he admitted. When the deal was announced BAT already knew the US tobacco market was in trouble. Competition has become increasingly fierce since Philip Morris, the market leader, cut the price of its Marlboro brand last year.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.     American Tobacco Co Inc.

BAT Industries has underperformed the market by 13 per cent since a new excise duty on tobacco was proposed. Yesterday's full-year figures suggest the market should not be too alarmed. Although BAT earns a large chunk of profits from US tobacco, cigarette exports to eastern Europe and Asia grew by more than 20 per cent last year. Only the most onerous of new taxes would knock BAT's tobacco business off its stride. Besides, tobacco companies have off-set previous falls in volume sales by widening margins under the cover of higher taxation. The fly in the ointment is Eagle Star's exposure to the UK housing market. With tobacco strong and Farmers insurance expanding in the US, though, the drag on profits is hardly noticeable. On a 30 per cent yield premium to the market average, the shares will look cheap if Mr Clinton's bark turns out to be worse than his bite.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.

0,FT944-4231 ,"FT944-4231 _AN-ELIDCACTFT 941209   FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Manufacturers 'paying for ineptitude' - Drink and tobacco      By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor   The chancellor's increases in drink and tobacco duties drew a chorus of criticism from producers who thought they had detected in November's Budget the first signs of government sympathy for their loss of trade to cross-channel shopping. 'We're shocked. We're picking up the tab for the Tories political ineptitude,' said the Wine and Spirits Association. 'We're outraged and quite shocked. We really feel he's panicked and made an irrational decision,' the Scotch Whisky Association said. Distillers, brewers and tobacco companies had lobbied with unprecedented force before the main Budget, arguing that the flow of low-duty paid imports and smuggled goods had reached damaging proportions. Brewers claim that such imports account for about 4 per cent of total beer consumption and 15 per cent of the take-home trade. The UK's third largest brand of tobacco for hand-rolled cigarettes, Drum, is not officially for sale in this country. 'No chancellor can remain unmoved in the face of this,' Mr Kenneth Clarke said in his November Budget speech. However, he said the government could not cut alcohol excise duties without raising other taxes to compensate for the lost revenue. Recognising the inroads made by imports, the November Budget left duty on beer, wine and cider unchanged but cut it on sparkling wine by 27p per 75 cl bottle and by 13p a bottle on fortified wine to remove anomalous tax rates between different types of alcoholic drinks. Yesterday, Mr Clarke added 1p on a pint of beer and litre of cider, 5p on a bottle of wine, 7p on sparkling and fortified wine and 26p on a bottle of spirits, effective from January 1. 'This is a kick in the teeth of British beer drinkers,' the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association said. The increases will make cross-border shopping even more of a problem, it added. The government's strategy for reducing the attractiveness of cross-Channel imports is to negotiate with Continental governments to raise their duties. 'The solution is for the government to work with our European partners to bring duties more in line,' the chancellor said in his November Budget speech. 'The forthcoming review of Europe-wide minimum excise duties gives us the opportunity to make a start at that.' But the Scotch Whisky Association said: 'The chancellor now goes into those European talks with a weakened position.' 'This is a bad decision and bad timing,' said Mr Anthony Greener, chairman of Guinness, the largest distiller. In November, the chancellor 'made it clear that for the sake of British exports to Europe the discrimination should not be increased. Today he has done just that.' The chancellor raised tobacco taxes in November in line with government policy of increasing prices faster than inflation to curb consumption for health reasons. Duty on a packet of cigarettes was raised 10p in November and 6p yesterday, cigars were raised by 5p and 3p, and pipe tobacco by 6p and 4p. Hand-rolling tobacco was raised by 12p in November but left unchanged yesterday. A packet of cigarettes will typically cost Pounds 2.70 in the UK against Pounds 1.70 in France, the Tobacco Manufacturers Association said. 'The chancellor has handed tobacco smugglers two wage increases in a fortnight,' the association said. The government has expressed some scepticism about the claimed level of drinks smuggling, while acknowledging that criminal gangs operate in tobacco. Tobacco retailers are losing Pounds 980m a year and the government is losing Pounds 750m a year in taxes, the Tobacco Alliance, a lobby group for retailers, said yesterday.

The increase was achieved on a 2 per cent advance in sales to Pounds 352m. Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman, was bullish about the current year, saying like-for-like sales were running 7 per cent ahead of last year. Further improvement would come from the Pounds 5.95m cash acquisition announced yesterday of 27 convenience stores trading under the Macs name. This is TS's second acquisition this year, after the Pounds 6.7m cash purchase of 74 Gibbs newsagents shops. The two purchases are expected to contribute sales of more than Pounds 40m in the current year. Supercigs, the discount tobacco and confectionery chain, suffered an 11 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds 2.54m, on sales 3 per cent lower at Pounds 170.6m. Mr Threlfall said a shift in focus towards discounting a wider range of products at the Supercigs chain, including magazines and cards, had helped to offset the effects of an overall decline in the cigarette market. Dillons newsagents reported a 4 per cent advance at the operating level to Pounds 5.8m, on sales 1 per cent ahead at Pounds 102.8m. Mr Threlfall said the increase was due to tight cost controls, with the average branch profit up by 9 per cent to Pounds 21,740. Dillons convenience stores increased operating profits by 8 per cent to Pounds 4.39m on sales 16 per cent ahead at Pounds 78.7m. Like-for-like sales were 5 per cent ahead, in spite of increased Sunday opening from supermarkets. Mr Threlfall said TS intended to open 30 new stores across the businesses this year. The final dividend was increased by 3 per cent to 3.6p, for a total pay-out of 6.1p (5.9p). Earnings per share fell from 15.17p to 13.44p. COMMENT These were disappointing results, but the market was half expecting to be disappointed. The best news was the latest acquisition which, added to that in January, gives hope that TS may end two years of stagnation in 1994. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.8m this year. After the 9p rise to 194p in the shares, the forward multiple of 13 times may not look too demanding.   Companies:-  T and S Stores.     Macs Stores Suppliers.

True, he is jolly young - 45 - and, like the bosses of most of his competitors, he is no longer a chain-smoker. But he is still at heart a tobacco man, having joined the British-American Tobacco Company over 20 years ago. BAT's performance over the past decade has certainly improved. If it hadn't, it would almost certainly have been taken over by now. However, its preference for recruiting its head honcho from within underlines its conservatism. Lou Gerstner, the 50-year-old boss of RJR Nabisco since 1989, is an ex-management consultant who made his name at American Express; Michael Miles, 53, head of Philip Morris, is a marketing man who joined PM after it took over his employer Kraft in 1989.

From 6pm last night, tax on each packet of 20 cigarettes rose by 10p and the chancellor promised that duty on other tobacco products would rise by a similar proportion. However, the tax on alcohol was left unchanged as the chancellor responded to complaints from the drinks industry about duties and the increase in cross-Channel shopping and smuggling. The chancellor's action on beer was largely expected as a Treasury select committee last week rejected a call by brewers for beer duty to be halved to curb cross-Channel imports and stimulate UK sales. In his speech Mr Kenneth Clarke said cross-border shopping and smuggling had 'meant a loss of duty to the exchequer'. He said that 'no chancellor can remain unmoved in the face of this but neither can any chancellor simply adopt popular measures to cut taxes on alcohol that would threaten the revenue and require taxes on other goods to be raised'. Last night the drinks industry was sceptical about Mr Clarke's claim that he would campaign for higher duties throughout Europe. Mr Robin Simpson, director of the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association, said: 'Frankly, other European countries are not going to raise their beer duties to solve a UK problem.' Carlsberg Tetley said that 15 per cent of all beer drunk at home in Britain was bought on the Continent. 'The differential is too huge and needs something more drastic than just leaving the tax alone,' said a spokesman. Mr Peter Lewis, director of the Wine and Spirits Association said: ' . . . cross-border shopping remains a threat to the pub, off-licence and supermarket trade.' However, Mr Tony Greener, chairman of Guinness, the largest spirits company, said: 'We are satisfied with the chancellor's decision not to increase the duty on alcoholic drinks. We welcome the chancellor's promise to support the industry when he enters negotiations on European excise duties.' The tobacco industry was disappointed in Mr Clarke's decision to raise tax on cigarettes. The Tobacco Manufacturers Association said: 'Tonight the bootleggers will be celebrating with a bottle of bootlegged champagne and lighting up a smuggled cigar.' Mr Paul Mason, an independent retailer in Southampton and spokesman for the Tobacco Alliance, said: 'The chancellor has put another nail in the corner-shop's coffin.'

The price of 20 cigarettes, raised by 10p in the March Budget, rose a further 11p to around Pounds 2.52p. The price of five small cigars rose 5p and of 50 grams of pipe tobacco by 14p on a 7.3 per cent increase in duty. The price of hand-rolled tobacco went up 32p for a 50-gram packet. Tobacco duty will be raised each year from now on by an average of at least 3 per cent a year in real terms.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Ulf Dinkelspiel, Sweden's minister for European affairs and foreign trade, gave a warning yesterday that if Swedes were not able to continue buying the substance, in defiance of an EU directive, it would be almost impossible for the country to win a referendum next year supporting EU membership. The directive, which came into force in July, bans on health grounds the marketing and sale of wet snuff, a tobacco derivative known in Sweden as 'snus' that is inserted between the gum and upper lip. Oral snuff-taking is a centuries-old tradition in Sweden - something the country is only too keen to prove to Brussels with examples of 17th-century price lists or 18th-century snuff boxes. One in 10 Swedes is a regular user. Last year they consumed more than 5,000 tonnes of the stuff. The issue is very sensitive for pro-EU Swedes.

Net profits rose to USDollars 136.5m in 1993, compared with Dollars 1.5m the previous year, and the directors recommended a dividend of 1.3 cents. Results were buoyed by the the sale of the group's remaining interest in the Hongkong International Terminals group for Dollars 120.1m, which was taken above the line. While the core shipping activities still suffered from competition and over-supply, investments performed well. Mr C. H. Tung, chairman, warned: 'The group's investment portfolio benefited from increased bond values and buoyant equity markets, particularly in Hong Kong and south-east Asia. Substantial returns on the portfolio were achieved. However, the group believes it is unlikely that these returns will be repeated in 1994.' OOIL held cash balances and portfolio investments of Dollars 477.7m at December 31 1993, compared with Dollars 260.1m a year earlier. The group has ordered six new container vessels costing Dollars 484m, and expects further improvement in container transport business as a result of higher load factors. Strategic investment in China began last year with a property development project. Operating profit after financing last year rose to Dollars 17.4m, which compares with a loss of Dollars 28.2m in 1992. Earnings per share rose to 27.7 cents against a 1.6 cent loss.

Mr Hans Storr, the chief financial officer, said the earnings figure would stand at about Dollars 5.45 a share. He added that recent retail sales trends for Marlboro had been encouraging, and noted the recent narrowing of price differences between discount and premium brands. When Philip Morris reported third-quarter figures, it disclosed the domestic cigarette shipments had fallen slightly in the three-month period, and predicted a larger dip in the final quarter. This reinforced worries on Wall Street that the growing discount cigarette sector was proving a threat to premium brands, which include Morris's profitable Marlboro. This week's furore over a report from the US Environmental Protection Agency on the dangers of passive smoking, has hit Philip Morris shares, but yesterday's profit forecast seemed to reassure the stock market.

Four institutions in Los Angeles and one each in San Diego and San Francisco  were among the names on a list sent out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,  which regulates banks and insures bank deposits.    The FDIC notice said these ""banks"" apparently were operating illegally and  added: ""Any proposed transactions involving any of the listed entities should  be viewed with extreme caution.""    A federal banking regulator said a bank in the Southwest discovered Thursday  morning that it had lost $36,000 in a scheme involving a fraudulent cashier's  check drawn on one of the institutions, located on Montserrat in the West  Indies. The regulator declined to identify the victimized bank and asked that  his name be withheld.      Few Legitimate Uses    The regulator said the number of entities operating as banks in the United  States without proper authorization or license has increased substantially in  recent months.    Many banks on the FDIC warning list are located in Montserrat, where  authorities have sold more than 200 bank charters in recent months, according  to U.S. regulators. The names on the charters sound official and are often  similar to those of established institutions.    The charters are re-sold at high mark-ups by organized businesses to U.S.  citizens, who then operate them in this country, according to testimony at  congressional hearings conducted in 1985.    Although neither selling nor buying such a charter is illegal, experts told  Congress there are few legitimate uses for these banks and they said many are  used in illegal schemes, including issuing worthless cashier's checks and other  types of financial instruments.    In the case that came to light Thursday, a customer at the Southwestern bank  cashed a $36,000 cashier's check drawn on Lux International Bancorp in  Montserrat. The U.S. bank held the check for several days, assumed that it had  cleared and gave the customer the cash.    By the time the bank discovered that no funds had been received to honor the  check, the customer had disappeared.    For several months, federal law enforcement officials in California and other  states have been investigating similar schemes involving worthless certified  drafts drawn on nonexistent Mexican banks, including two of the 43 entities  cited by the FDIC.    The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington also is  investigating off-shore banks and provided the names that the FDIC issued  Thursday.    James R. Dudine, an enforcement official with the FDIC in Washington, said the  number of successful frauds pulled off using the questionable banks is  relatively small.    ""Most banks are astute enough not to get caught with this sort of stuff. But  there are some real dangers,"" he said.    Most of the U.S. names on the list were not listed with telephone operators.    One institution on the list is Banco Commercial Arabe in Los Angeles. Robert M.

The accord marks the first foreign manufacturing investment by the partly-privatised Spanish company. It is the latest in a series of agreements between Polish cigarette manufacturers and international groups. Tabacalera said it would spend about Pta750m (Pounds 3.64m) on the Polish project. Apart from licensed production of Tabacalera's Fortuna and Winns brands, the two companies plan to introduce a new brand through a joint venture 51 per cent controlled by the Spanish partner. Tabacalera will supply packaging equipment and raw materials and will take charge of promotion, with the Polish company responsible for production and distribution. The Spanish said Poland ranked eighth among world markets for tobacco products, and had one of the highest per capita consumption rates, of 7.28 cigarettes per day, compared with 5.6 in Spain. Further deals are under discussion in Europe and other foreign markets in an effort by Tabacalera to offset a gradual decline in domestic sales of tobacco products.   Companies:-  Tabacalera.

Statistics on the release of alcoholic drinks and tobacco by Customs from bonded warehouses showed no significant change in the first three months of the European single market. Customs admitted that the figures were less reliable than usual because of lack of information about imports from the European Community since the formation of the single market. 'We are continuing to monitor the situation,' officials said. Drinks retailers have protested that increased allowances for personal imports of cheaper, duty-paid cigarettes, spirits and beer from continental Europe since January were threatening their business. But Customs said that figures - incorporating its own estimates of imports from the EC - published yesterday by the Central Statistical Office suggested 'a continuation of existing trends'. They showed a small decline in consumption of beer and spirits, but a more buoyant market for wine compared with the same period last year. Tobacco figures varied considerably with a surge in cigarette clearances in March reflecting pre-Budget stocking.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P5921 Liquor Stores.

The committee urged the government to support proposals to restrict tobacco advertising to points of sale when they are considered by EC health ministers later this year. It said that if Britain dropped its opposition, it would require the support of only one more country for a directive banning advertising to be adopted. 'The government cannot continue to procrastinate on the issue of an advertising ban on the grounds that it is awaiting a level of proof about its effectiveness which is in the nature of things unobtainable,' said the committee. Yesterday's report was widely welcomed by organisations campaigning for a ban. The British Medical Association said the committee's acceptance of evidence that tobacco advertising increased tobacco consumption - a disputed issue - was a 'victory for common sense'. But the Tobacco Advisory Council, the industry's trade association, said the report leant 'too heavily on data which are seriously flawed, muddled and unsubstantiated'.

""Simply put, we need a cigarette which, when dropped accidentally in a chair or  bed, goes out before a life-threatening fire can start,"" Walgren said.    Two years ago, a federal task force concluded that it would be ""technically  feasible"" to produce safer cigarettes. The study found that thinner cigarettes,  using looser-packed tobacco and less-porous paper, would cause fewer fires.    Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) introduced a bill that would give the Consumer  Product Safety Commission a year to establish an ignition resistance standard  for cigarettes. The industry then would have another year to bring its products  into line with the standard.    A rival bill by Reps. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) and Thomas J.

It would not require  any action upon completion.    ""The issue of commercial feasibility is a real question,"" said Charles Whitley,  a former congressman who testified on behalf of the Tobacco Institute. ""More  research needs to be done.""    Asked by Walgren about the industry's financial support of fire groups, Whitley  said there were ""no strings"" attached to the grants.

Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) on  behalf of the industry would launch a three-year study of unresolved issues,  including the commercial potential of safer cigarettes. It would not require  any action upon completion.    ""The issue of commercial feasibility is a real question,"" said Charles Whitley,  a former congressman who testified on behalf of the Tobacco Institute. ""More  research needs to be done.""    Asked by Walgren about the industry's financial support of fire groups, Whitley  said there were ""no strings"" attached to the grants.    Before Wednesday's hearing, the Tobacco Institute and the National Volunteer  Fire Council orchestrated a letter-writing campaign in which some fire groups  endorsed the industry-backed bill.    Johnson reported from Washington and Levin reported from Los Angeles.    "

Wang gave his guests a detailed account of China's economic  development over the last few years, especially the reforms with  respect to the fiscal and taxation system, foreign exchange,  foreign trade, and prices. He said China has put into effect  more reform measures than ever this year, adding that facts show  the situation regarding economic operations has been good. If  these reform measures prove finally successful, this will mean  that China has taken a decisive step forward toward the  socialist market economy, he added.    Wang said: China will continue to develop steadily and open  wider to the outside world. With the economic development,  China has great market potential. Many big companies in the  world, including quite a few U.S. companies, are interested in  exploring the China market, while China is also in great need of  U.S. funds and technology. The two sides can intensify  cooperation to their mutual benefit.    Wang emphasized: China and the United States have a common  duty to safeguard world peace, including peace in the  Asia-Pacific region, and this is in their common interest.  Improved Sino-U.S. relations will be beneficial to both  countries and to peace and development in the world, including  the Asia-Pacific region.    Wang said the large numbers of Overseas Chinese constitute a  valuable opportunity for China's development. He hopes Overseas  Chinese and Chinese-Americans in the United States will  contribute to promoting Sino-U.S. relations, help China to  develop into a prosperous and powerful country, and help develop  the U.S. economy.    The visiting delegation comprised seven members: Chen  Hsien-chang, senior adviser to the Illinois Springfield [chun  tian 2504 3944] City CTI Scientific and Technological Advisory  Company; Chen Sulian, chairwoman of the board of the In Flight  [fei xiang 7378 5046] Airline Food Company Limited and her  assistant; Liao Tzu-kuang, chairman of the board of the Liao  Tzu-kuang Investment Group; Yao Chien-min, chairman of the board  of the Asian Integrated Industrial Company Limited; Yao-Chin  Yi-li, president of the Hawaii Pioneer Deposit Bank; and Li  Ching-tao, president of the Billion Asian International Company  Limited.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    The Federal Alcohol Administration Act         Section 105(e)   of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act),   27 U.S.C. 205(e), vests broad authority in the Director, ATF,   as a delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury, to prescribe   regulations intended to prevent deception of the consumer,   and to provide the consumer with adequate information as to   the identity and quality of the product.     Regulations which implement the provisions of section   105(e) as they relate to wine are set forth in title 27, Code   of Federal Regulations, part 4 (27 CFR part 4). Section   4.23a provides that the name of a single grape variety may be used as the type designation of a grape wine   if the wine is labeled with an appellation of origin, and if   not less than 75 percent of the wine is derived from grapes   of that variety, the entire 75 percent of which was grown in   the labeled appellation of origin area. Section 4.34(b)(1)   provides that an appellation of origin disclosing the true   origin of the wine shall appear in direct conjunction with   and in lettering substantially as conspicuous as the class   and type designation if a grape type (varietal) designation   is used under the provisions of section 4.23a.         History of Gamay Beaujolais Name         For many years ATF has   permitted the use of ``Gamay Beaujolais'' on wine labels as a   varietal designation. This resulted from the identification   in the 1940's, of a grape grown in Napa County, California as   the Gamay grape native to the Beaujolais region of France.   In the late 1960's, the University of California at Davis   (UCD) determined that the grape known as Napa Gamay was the   true French Gamay and that the Gamay Beaujolais vine was   actually a clone of Pinot noir. Since then, ATF has   permitted wine produced from both the Napa Gamay and Pinot   noir grape varieties to be labeled as ``Gamay Beaujolais.''   The Foundation Plant Material Service (FPMS) at UCD (a   service operated in cooperation with UCD which makes virus   free, true type plant material available to the industry)   also identified the Gamay Beaujolais vine as a clonal   selection of the Pinot noir variety. More recently, UCD determined that the grape known   as Napa Gamay is not the Gamay grape of France. Napa Gamay   has been positively identified by the FPMS as Valdiguie,   although it is not widely known by this name.         Winegrape Varietal Names Advisory Committee         In 1982,   ATF established the Winegrape Varietal Names Advisory   Committee (referred to as the ``Committee'') to conduct an   examination of the hundreds of grape variety names and   synonyms in use [47 FR 13623, March 31, 1982]. According to   its charter, the Committee was to advise the Director of the   grape varieties and subvarieties which are used in the   production of wine, to recommend appropriate label   designations for these varieties, and to recommend guidelines   for approval of names suggested for new grape varieties.   Their recommendations were restricted to grape names used in   producing American wines. The Committee's final report,   presented to the Director in September 1984, contained the   Committee's findings regarding use of the most appropriate   names for domestic winegrape varieties.     One finding which appeared in the l984 final report of   the Winegrape Varietal Names Advisory Committee was that the   name ``Gamay Beaujolais'' is not the name of any grape   variety. However, the report did recommend that the term be   permitted for use during a five year phase out period, for   wine made either from the grape called Napa Gamay, or from   the Gamay Beaujolais clone of Pinot noir.

0,FT943-5944 ,"FT943-5944 _AN-EIAD1ADTFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / Japan Tobacco at Pounds 9,410 a share leaves 'em gasping: Monopoly's privatisation price seems steep as core growth is being extinguished      By GORDON CRAMB   The Japanese finance ministry yesterday put a market value of Y2,876bn (Pounds 18.6bn) on the country's monopoly cigarette manufacturer, setting the privatisation price for Japan Tobacco at what many found a gasp-inducing Y1.438m (Pounds 9,410) per share. While maximising revenues for the government at a time when its tax receipts are down, the pricing drew concerns from analysts that the Tokyo Stock Exchange might be in for another bumpy autumn journey. Initial trading last October in JR East, the previous big state sell-off, all but derailed the exchange's systems as the price ran up furiously. But liquidity was drained from the rest of the market, and stock in the regional train operator eventually fell back to join other issues in a hibernation which they have yet to shake off. Japan Tobacco shares, which go on sale from tomorrow, start trading on October 27. Like JR East, the company has strong cash flow and a healthy land portfolio. It is also virtually debt-free. But like tobacco groups elsewhere, it has no prospect of growth in its main business. Its diversification attempts are not expected to contribute significantly to earnings for as much as a decade. JT's asset base helped prompt bids of up to Y2.11m a share in a pre-offer auction among institutions. Although the lowest accepted bid in the auction of 230,000 shares, or 11.5 per cent of equity, was more than Y1.36m, some securities houses said the shares were worth only Y500,000 if measured against western industry leaders such as Philip Morris of the US, maker of Marlboro. After the public tranche, the government will retain two-thirds control of JT, and has left intact its status as the only licensed producer of cigarettes in Japan. The market has, however, been open to imports since 1987, and these have grown steadily to account for 17.9 per cent of all cigarettes sold in Japan last year. JT acknowledges that the rise in foreign penetration will continue. The company's main advantage is its distribution system, which extends to pavement vending machines which fall under its control. The main foreign brand there is Marlboro, which JT makes under licence. The group has struck a similar deal with France's Seita state monopoly to produce Gitanes Blondes, and international links are seen as a way forward. JT licenses its own best-selling Mild Seven brand to be manufactured in Malaysia, and in 1992 bought Manchester Tobacco in the UK to supply Europe and parts of Asia. In May JT said it was quintupling capacity in Manchester to 10bn cigarettes a year, a figure that pales compared with the 272.9bn JT products which Japanese lit up last year. Japan is among the few developed countries where most men still smoke - 59.8 per cent - but the proportion is slowly falling, while the 13.8 per cent of women who are smokers has barely changed in a decade. JT admits: 'We will see a decline in the number of young people who are the primary consumers, so the tobacco industry will be faced with difficulties.' Japan, where foreign consumer products have usually sold on a premium image, has not yet encountered the wave of supermarket brands which have brought price competition to some western cigarette markets. In the current climate of austerity JT recognises this as a threat and at least one US maker has begun selling a discounted line in Japan. To shape up for the private sector, JT's workforce has been cut by nearly a quarter to 23,700 and the number of domestic plants reduced by a similar margin to 26. It has sought other businesses, most notably pharmaceuticals where it now produces 40 over-the-counter drugs and an agent used in chemotherapy, its first prescription treatment developed in-house. But it is likely to be 10 years before the sector generates an income stream, and outlays are still high. The company spent Y40bn on a research centre for the division and says that such spending, along with increased promotional for its tobacco business, account for a steady increase in marketing and administrative expenses - these outlays rose 44 per cent over the past five years while pre-tax profits were up a little more than a third. JT is forecasting a 4.5 per cent dip in profits before tax to Y109bn in its current year to March, on a 2.6 per cent decline in sales to Y2,711bn. Net earnings are, however, projected to emerge higher at Y36,000 a share against Y33,246, from which a dividend of at least Y5,000 will be paid. Net assets per share in March were put at Y564,947. Most foreign funds which track Japanese stock market indices will shell out for some Mild Seven. But Mr Keith Donaldson, investment strategist at Salomon Bros in Tokyo, says: 'I don't think I'd recommend it at this price.' Individual Japanese investors may decide differently. But in a country where decisions are commonly made in smoke-filled rooms, there was one possible portent yesterday. As Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, chaired the meeting of dozens of officials and advisers which set the JT price, the air was curiously clear.   Companies:-  Japan Tobacco Inc.

It was the 22nd straight month for sales at major retailers  to decline from year-earlier levels, the ministry said in a  preliminary report.    MITI said the poor performance in the reporting month  reflected continued price-consciousness among consumers.    A spell of bad weather in the latter half of March also  adversely affected retail sales, MITI said.    Sales at 420 department stores fell 4.2 percent to 940  billion yen, marking the 25th straight month of year-to-year  declines, it said.    Sales at 2,056 supermarket chains dipped 1.5 percent from a  year earlier to 819.6 billion yen, for the 20th straight month  of falls.    March sales of clothing at department stores decreased 5.3  percent from a year before while clothing sales at supermarket  chains fell 6.4 percent.    Total clothing sales for the reporting month dropped 5.6  percent for the 20th month running of year-to-year declines.    Sales of spring clothing were sluggish due to unusually cool  weather in the month, while sales of business suits continued to  fare poorly, MITI said.    Sales of food and beverages edged up 0.4 percent overall,  with a 0.2 percent pickup at department stores and a 0.5 percent  gain at supermarket chains.    Food and beverage sales grew for the third month in a row on  brisk demand for products for daily use.    Sales of small items of furniture picked up but high-priced  furniture performed poorly.    General household equipment sales were slack.    Sales of household electrical appliances grew 8.1 percent at  supermarket chains but fell 6.5 percent at department stores.     "

Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, launched a fresh round of talks with cigarette companies in December after concern grew that parliament might impose an advertising ban. The voluntary controls are believed to include a ban on poster advertising, tight controls on advertising in women's magazines, an end to shop-front advertising and bigger health warnings on cigarette packets. The talks followed an announcement that Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, intended to introduce a private members' bill banning all cigarette, cigar and pipe tobacco advertising except at the point of sale. Mr Barron, who won third place in a backbench Commons ballot for the right to introduce legislation, claimed the support of more than 200 MPs of all parties, giving his bill a chance of becoming law. The government could probably have found procedural ways of killing the bill, but would prefer to be able to demonstrate to MPs that tougher voluntary restraints are on the way. The government is firmly opposed to legislative controls on tobacco advertising, which ministers believe are less effective than voluntary curbs.

It is incorrect to say that 'the (flower) industry took off when white tobacco farmers decided to diversify, fearing the strength of the anti-smoking lobby in the west'. Traditionally, tobacco production has been the mainstay of farming in those areas of Zimbabwe suitable for this purpose. However, generations of tobacco farmers have recognised the danger of having all your eggs in one basket and have attempted different forms of diversification. I well remember the governor of the Reserve Bank, when opening the annual tobacco congress in 1961, exhorting tobacco growers to diversify and suggesting ground nuts as a possible crop. This diversification has ebbed and flowed over the years, depending on the prevailing economic return of tobacco vis a vis that of alternative crops. Horticulture is presently the most popular alternative source of income for tobacco farmers. Not because of a fear of declining tobacco fortunes due to the anti-smoking campaign but because horticulture currently enjoys a satisfactory return on each dollar invested. To achieve such a return does, however, require a massive initial capital investment. Tobacco is the only crop which can significantly carry that investment until the first return is realised.

Speaking at the function, Mr Nguyen  Ngoc Tran, chairman of the Central Board for Overseas Vietnamese  said that about 180,000 Vietnamese overseas had returned to the  homeland for Tet and for investment opportunities in 1993,  compared to little more than 100,000 for the Tet of last year.    He said that their activities to contribute to national  renovation have become more and more practical and fruitful. By  the end of 1993, overseas Vietnamese had 30 projects licensed by  the Vietnamese Government capitalized at tens of millions of US  dollars. They mostly deal with electronics, chemicals, tourism,  services, agriculture, forestry, fishery and soft drinks.    They also have contributed to the transfer of modern  technology to the country in several fields. Many consultative  ideas from overseas Vietnamese have been considered valuable by  government offices in the fields of education and training,  science and technology, finance, banking tourism and  administration.    After Tet, a number of overseas Vietnamese experts will  return to the homeland to attend a conference on Vietnam's  university education renovation with their colleagues here.    According to Mr Tran, more than 2 million Vietnamese have  settled in 70 countries. There are about 1 million in the  United States, 200,000 in France, 150,000 in Canada, 130,000 in  Australia and 85,000 in Germany. Around 400,000 of them have got  university or post graduate degrees and some are holding key  positions in many branches of sciences, technology and  management.    Overseas Vietnamese remittance to their families constitutes  an important source of foreign exchange.    Total import-export turnover of companies owned by overseas  Vietnamese is estimated at around USD 4-6 million a year.    In order to broaden the overseas Vietnamaese participation  in  economic and technical development programmes in the country,  the government is preparing to establish an overseas Vietnamese  bank, a centre of training and technology transfer staffed by  overseas Vietnamese and also so form of non-governmental  consultancy mechanism of overseas Vietnamese.

0,FT943-4078 ,"FT943-4078 _AN-EIKACAC7FT 940910   FT  10 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Telecom leaves Tokyo wary of over-supply - The Japan Tobacco listing is likely to be another casualty      By EMIKO TERAZONO   Not only has last week's listing of Japan Telecom, the country's third largest telecommunications operator, left investors sitting on losses, but it has also triggered worries among investors towards future initial public offerings. As a result, the biggest casualty is likely to be Japan Tobacco, which floats more than Y900bn worth of stock next month. What worries investors is that together with Japan Telecom, the listing will inject more equity into the market than investors can handle. The concern is that the Telecom listing has come at a time when underlying confidence has been weakened and the supply and demand situation has deteriorated. Such worries stem from continuing sales of shares by companies and banks, which want to spruce up their profits ahead of half year book closing at the end of the month. Another concern is that overseas investors, the biggest buyers in the stock market rally earlier this year, have started to question valuations of Japanese shares. Banks have been especially active in the half-year end selling spree this year, partly due to recent weakness in the bond market. As fund procurement rates have risen in tandem with the increase in long term interest rates, profit margins have been squeezed. The stagnant demand for loans has also prompted lower profit margins as some banks have been forced to 'dump' loans to companies. The decline in profits from loans, as a result, has forced financial institutions to turn to the stock market for profits. On the demand side, domestic institutions, which were expected to come back to the market earlier this year, have remained cautious, although public pension and insurance funds have been pumped into the market by the government to support prices. Some blame the high valuations of stock prices, while others argue that the chances of a triple dip in the economy are still high. The reversal in sentiment among overseas investors has been the fundamental factor in the weakness in demand. Foreigners were the main buyers of Japanese stocks due to expectations of a recovery in earnings and the economy. However, many fund managers have lost their patience over the lack of movement in prices, especially with a price/earnings ratio of more than 90 times for the Nikkei. 'Foreigners who started buying shares around 16,000 are questioning the extent of the recovery discounted into current share prices,' says Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel. He adds that European and US investors are once again looking to shift to the US and markets in south east Asia. While earlier this year many overseas investors were expecting a sharp earnings recovery due to restructuring and the fall in depreciation costs, opposition to this theory is asserting itself. Mr Alexander Kinmont, strategist at Morgan Stanley who is forecasting a mere 8.3 per cent rise in profits for the current year to next March, argues that the effects of cost cutting will be muted since Japanese style restructuring still frowns on aggressively cutting overhead. He maintains that since depreciation only accounted for 3.27 per cent of non-financial companies' sales in 1987 and 3.60 per cent last year, it can hardly be the main reason for the profits plunge, while a decline in depreciation over the next few years does not necessarily point to a sharp recovery in corporate earnings, as some foreigners had hoped. However, analysts are divided on the outlook for corporate earnings. Mr James sees a 15 per cent rise in consolidated pre-tax profits for the current business year and expects companies to revise their profit projections upward in the coming earnings announcement season in November. Some investors seem to agree with such views and stocks that are usually active at the start of the earnings cycle have started to move. Basic materials such as steels, cement and paper have gained ground and could receive a further boost later in the cycle as commodity prices rise. Mr Alan Livsey, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, believes that foreigners, many of whom made the mistake of selling their holdings last autumn, do not want to take the risk of making the same mistake again. He says there is a historical case for not selling now. Looking back a few decades, investors in the Tokyo market who have bought in November and sold in May have seen far higher profits than those who have bought in May and sold in October. Meanwhile, fears over Tobacco persist among many investors. The bear argument over the negative impact of the two JTs triggering another downward spiral is supported by Nikko Research Institute, which claims that share prices are placed under extreme pressure when equity financing by listed companies is greater than 15 times the average daily turnover. The extra injection of funds from the two issues will raise a total Y5,700bn, substantially more than 15 times the current daily activity. Mr James says, however, that investors, who have learned their lesson from the East Japan Railway fiasco last year, have been selling futures to hedge their portfolios ahead of the Tobacco listings, prompting arbitrage unwinding. The Tobacco flotation on October 27 will not cause the market to plunge like last year's JR East listing, and could eventually trigger a rally. Although the Nikkei index is likely to move in the 19,000-20,000 range over the next month, share prices are likely to recover in November, as hedging in the futures is unwound by institutions and with the expected spate of upward earnings revisions following the listing.

BAT is buying about 75 per cent of the shares in the Saratov Tobacco Factory, which is situated on the Volga, about 700km south-east of Moscow. The announcement came only days after the group agreed to invest Dollars 200m in return for a majority stake in the tobacco industry of the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. In both cases BAT said its priority was to increase the quantity and quality of the cigarettes produced. The Saratov factory currently makes approximately 5bn cigarettes a year, a total which BAT plans to increase to 10bn over three years. The company is committed to investing a total of Dollars 40m, including the purchase price, over the period. Mr Ulrich Herter, managing director of BAT's tobacco businesses, said: 'This is an important first step in our investment plans for Russia. We have been very impressed with the management team at Saratov, who have negotiated with a real sense of purpose and commitment, enabling us to make rapid progress. 'This augurs well for our future co-operation.' BAT is also in advanced negotiations with the Java Factory in Moscow, which currently makes about 14bn cigarettes a year.

0,FT931-2989 ,"FT931-2989 _AN-DCRCHAHNFT 930317   FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Distillers avoid added burden - Drinks and Tobacco      By PHILIP RAWSTORNE   THE BUDGET brought relief to the Scotch whisky industry but disappointment to brewers and drinks retailers. After long and intensive lobbying by the Scotch whisky industry, the chancellor was finally persuaded not to add to the tax burden on spirits. 'This is very good news for one of Britain's most successful exports and we appreciate the consideration,' Mr Tony Greener, chairman and chief executive of Guinness, said yesterday. 'Clearly the chancellor has listened to the industry and we hope he will do the same next year.' The Scotch Whisky Association also made it clear that the narrowing of the tax differential with beer and wine was only 'a move in the right direction'. The industry, faced with a 10 per cent decline in scotch sales and the closure of distilleries, had argued strongly that any tax increases would lead to further job losses. It also warned that excessive taxation of spirits in the UK encouraged similar taxation policies in other European Community states, endangering exports. The chancellor acknowledged these arguments - but the clinching argument may have been the fall in tax revenue from spirits. In 1991-92, the government's tax receipts of Pounds 2.6bn from spirits were 2.3 per cent lower in real terms than in the previous year. Falling sales since then are estimated to have cost the chancellor a further Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m. The chancellor also recognised the drinks industry's concern about the impact of cross-Channel shopping - encouraged by lower Continental taxes - on the brewers and drinks retailers. Even though estimates suggest the chancellor may lose up to Pounds 200m in revenue this year from duty-paid drinks imports, he did nothing to avert the danger. The increase of 5 per cent in duties on beer and wine adds 1.5p to a pint of beer and 5.5p to a bottle of wine. The Brewers' Society condemned the duty increase as a further incentive to duty-paid imports of beer, which already accounted for nearly one pint in 10 drunk at home. 'It will have serious consequences for UK business and jobs,' said the society's director, Mr Robin Simpson. 'French retailers will be laughing all the way to the bank. It is also a wide-boys' charter which will mean an increasing black market in beer.' Mr Alistair Eadie, of the Wine and Spirits Association, said the chancellor's move would cause 'further damage to the retail sector and jobs'. He added: 'We hope the autumn Budget will do more to align UK rates of excise duties with those of out European partners.' The tobacco industry also protested about the effects of the 'damaging and unfair' tax increase on tobacco - adding 10p to a packet of 20 cigarettes and 4.5p to a packet of five small cigars. Mr Christopher Bullock, director of the Tobacco Advisory Council, said that the tax hike would not stop people smoking; it would only encourage more duty-paid imports and smuggling of cigarettes across the Channel.

There are 300m of them, the great majority men, though more women are taking up the habit. They smoke 1,600bn cigarettes a year, 30 per cent of total world consumption. It is an enviable domestic market for international tobacco companies hit by declining sales in countries with more active anti-smoking campaigns than China, but not an easy one to crack. It has taken the Rothmans company eight years to establish a small joint venture cigarette factory in Jinan, Shandong province, officially opened on Tuesday by former British prime minister, Sir Edward Heath. Shandong is one of China's biggest tobacco growing provinces. The Rothmans venture, in partnership with the Shandong Tobacco Corporation, provincial arm of the national monopoly, is only the second tobacco joint venture in China and the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration has decreed it will be the last. The first was set up by Winston manufacturers RJ Reynolds in Xiamen, a special economic zone in Fujian province across the strait from Taiwan. Rothmans was given the go-ahead only because it spent years helping Shandong tobacco growers improve the quality of their leaf, said Lord Swaythling, the chairman of Rothmans International. He dismissed criticism that it was bad for the company to be seen selling cigarettes to new markets as sales declined in the health-conscious west. 'We're not encouraging Chinese to smoke. They have been the world's biggest consumers of cigarettes for 40 years. They all smoke like chimneys here anyway, we just want them to smoke our brands.' The two brands to be produced in Jinan, are Rothmans international brand and a local brand, Horseman, retailing at half the price, 3 yuan (43p). Both brands' packs will carry a health warning, 'Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health'. The Chinese are conscious of a health risk in smoking, but with 20 per cent of state revenues deriving from taxes on tobacco - the single largest source of revenue in the country - the authorities tread warily in mounting anti-smoking campaigns. The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration has set a target of reaching 30bn yuan in profits and taxes. Smoking restrictions are not the rarity they once were. Hotel restaurants have no-smoking areas and smoking is banned on domestic flights and in airports. The joint venture Jinan factory is under-capitalised and very small, with a capacity of only 40m cigarettes a year. To be viable it should be six times as large, but Rothmans hopes 'phase two' will begin in two or three years - if China allows - bringing production levels to 2.5bn.

Mr Stephen Woodward, deputy director of ASH, the anti-smoking lobby said: 'Our experience of tobacco companies is that any new product that is judged to give a competitive advantage, very quickly spreads throughout the industry'. However, ASH said that it had no evidence to contradict the assertion by BAT Industries, parent of Brown  Williamson Tobacco of the US which developed cigarettes containing the Y-1 strain, that these had been largely withdrawn after proving unpopular with consumers. Mr Woodward said he did not believe that Y-1 has been widely used on unsuspecting guinea pigs in the Third World. Tobacco companies, he pointed out, have no problems in the Third World marketing high-nicotine high-tar cigarettes without having to resort to new technologies. His views were echoed by Mr Nicholas Wall, a professor in environmental protective medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. 'I can't see who would want to go through all the trouble and expense (in the Third World where) there is less reason to use high-nicotine strains of tobacco because there has been less public pressure to reduce tar yields,' he said.

Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said yesterday he was opening the tendering for French and foreign banks to advise the government on the sale of Seita, which has already chosen Credit Commercial de France and Societe Generale to advise it. Seita has thrown cold water on the enthusiasm of the world's tobacco giants by saying it wanted 'no foreign tobacco maker' to take a stake. It confirmed that it would like the state to keep nearly 10 per cent of its 100 per cent stake, leave about the same for its employees, and award 25-30 per cent to a core group of stable shareholders who might include foreign institutions. Foreign tobacco groups would otherwise be keen to take a stake in a Seita, which distributes other companies' cigarettes and has the added cashflow bonus of being a collector of taxes. In particular, BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco conglomerate, appeared to see its 1993 'financial' investment in the Banque Nationale de Paris privatisation as smoothing its path politically to an 'industrial' investment in Seita. The decision to keep foreign manufacturers out is not just because Seita considers itself, with its Gauloises, Gitanes, its Alain Delon brand of cigarette and its Johnny Hallyday lighter, as much part of the French heritage as camembert cheese. With privatisation, Seita will lose its legal monopoly on tobacco manufacture in France, a right that has become meaningless with the free entry into France of cigarettes made in other European countries. But it intends to keep its de facto monopoly on distribution of cigarettes in France to the country's 36,500 tabacs, or tobacconists. Allowing foreign cigarette makers into its capital would jeopardise the neutrality of its distribution system, says Seita, while adding nothing in terms of external expansion. Seita already has production and marketing agreements with BAT in Germany, with Reemstma of Germany in several markets in western Europe and now in eastern Europe, and with Japan Tobacco in Japan. But Philip Morris, the US tobacco giant, recently threatened to break its distribution agreement with Seita if the latter took in another foreign tobacco company as a shareholder. Seita denies ceding under such pressure, but some industry analysts believe that Philip Morris, which has 29 per cent of the French market (behind Seita's 45 per cent), could have carried out its threat. Distribution is certainly a money-spinner for Seita, whose profits rose from FFr447m in 1992 to FFr585m (Pounds 70m) last year on turnover that increased from FFr13.9bn to FFr14.1bn. Seita also collects the 75 per cent rate of state tax levied on total tobacco sales - FFr63bn last year - passing it on to the state with a two to three-week delay. The privilege of playing with the taxpayer's money for that period accounted for FFr200m of Seita's profit last year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Background            Several members of the wine industry have recently   petitioned ATF for approval of the use of 3 wine treating   processes and 1 wine treating material in the production,   cellar treatment, and/or finishing of wine. Only one of the   processes, the spinning cone column, is new and would be   used to reduce the ethyl alcohol content of wine or to   remove off flavors in wine. The other two processes are not   new but either would be used in combination or would be used   for a different purpose or at a different limitation than   previously authorized. The processes to be used in   combination are reverse osmosis and ion exchange and would   be used to remove excess volatile acidity from wine. The process which would be used at a different limitation is   ultrafiltration. And finally, the new wine treating   material, urease enzyme, would be used to reduce urea in   wine, thereby reducing the possibility of ethyl carbamate   formation during wine storage.            Wine Treating Processes            Spinning Cone Column            The spinning cone column (SCC) is a gas-liquid   contacting device which can process a wide range of products   including slurries with very high solids contents. It is a   multi-stage mass transfer device consisting of a series of   alternating stationary and rotary truncated cones. During   its operation the product is fed at the top of the column   and then flows down the upper surface of the stationary   cones under the influence of gravity and moves across the   upper surface of the rotating cones in a thin film due to   the applied centrifugal force. The stripping gas enters the   bottom of the column and flows counter current to the liquid   phase in the spaces between the fixed and rotating cones.     The petitioners who have requested ATF to approve the   use of the SCC wish to use it in the production of low   alcohol wine, as well as to remove off flavors in wine (e.g.   volatile acidity, ethyl acetate, hydrogen sulfide, etc.).     In the production of low alcohol wine, the feed wine is   initially run through the SCC to recover the volatile wine   flavor essence. In the second stage of processing, the flavor essence reduced wine is run through the SCC to reduce   the alcohol in the wine to the desired level. The essence,   which has previously been removed, is then added back to the   alcohol reduced wine to make a low alcohol wine which,   according to the petitioners, retains much of its original   flavor. The alcohol which has been removed from the wine   can then either be used in accordance with law and   regulations or be destroyed.     Treatment of wine utilizing the SCC to remove off   flavors, or to reduce the alcohol content of the wine, may   not alter the vinous character of the wine. Otherwise, the   wine would no longer be considered standard wine.     Since the separation of alcohol from a fermented   substance is considered to be a distilling process, SCC   operations cannot be conducted at winery premises but must   instead take place at distilled spirits plant premises.

0,FT933-8792 ,"FT933-8792 _AN-DHMBNADSFT 930813   FT  13 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Rothmans/Dunhill   The fine print of Richemont's asset reshuffle highlights the move's industrial logic but the financial advantages from the viewpoint of Rothmans' and Dunhill's shareholders are less clear. By untangling the web of interconnecting shareholdings, Richemont will produce two businesses separately focused on tobacco and luxury goods. Given the conspicuous clash of corporate cultures between the two groupings, this is doubtless a good thing. As a pure tobacco company, Rothmans clearly has its attractions. The opening of markets in eastern Europe and China has given tobacco companies revived opportunities: Rothmans expects world cigarette consumption to grow by 2 per cent a year to 5,700bn sticks by the end of the century. With Pounds 500m of cash, Rothmans is strongly placed for expansion. However, its yield, which is likely to languish well below that of BAT Industries, may hold the share price in check. Dunhill's minority shareholders, though, may reasonably gripe that their interests are not best served by transferring their assets, valued at the bottom of the cycle, into a bigger business over which they have diminished control. The Japanese downturn has certainly resulted in a nasty scratch across Dunhill's veneer. The company's currency hedging policies have also left it looking rather reckless - even if the immediate result is more red faces than red ink. But the unanswered questions remain: if Dunhill is as relatively weak as the terms of this deal suggest, why were its shareholders not aware of the fact; and why did its parent, Rothmans, not tackle the problems earlier?

In UK financial services, it faces a new disclosure regime and the costs of untangling the personal pensions fiasco. In US financial services, the Californian insurance reform movement has come back to haunt it. In tobacco, where the US anti-smoking lobby is getting ever more vociferous, BAT is now fighting to save its Dollars 1bn bid for American Tobacco from an anti-trust challenge. A normal company might start to feel persecuted. But suppliers of cigarettes and life assurance do not expect to be loved. Not that the regulatory pressure is all bad. While the personal pensions disaster has done little to dent BAT's new life and investment business, it can only hasten consolidation in the industry and BAT has the money to spend on fire sales. On the cigarette side, the blocking of the attractive American Tobacco deal would be a blow. But at least the threat of an excise duty hike has receded for the moment. Nevertheless, the thickness of the regulatory jungle is tending to obscure BAT's healthy trading picture. The shares slipped yesterday despite the resilient financial services profits and strong recovery from the US cigarette business. At this rate, BAT will be more than justified in matching the 8 per cent interim dividend increase at the final stage, so pushing the yield to 6.3 per cent. That looks cheap even by the standards of other tobacco stocks. Whether it takes full account of the regulatory and legal risks is another question.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.

In San Francisco, smoking is now banned in almost all workplaces. Restaurants will become 'smoke free' at the beginning of next year and at least 35 per cent of hotel rooms must now be 'non-smoking'. Smoking is also prohibited in outdoor sports arenas, including Candlestick Park, home of the 49ers football team. San Francisco's anti-smoking rules are being matched in towns and cities throughout the state. 'California is approaching smoking with a prohibitionistic fervour unlike any other state in the nation,' said Mr Tom Lauria of the Tobacco Institute. Close to 100 communities now ban smoking entirely in restaurants, workplaces or both. San Francisco bar and hotel owners who fear that restrictions may damage their businesses have joined Philip Morris in challenging the city's anti-smoking rules. Their lawsuit charges the city has overstepped its powers by enacting regulations that pre-empt state workplace safety laws. 'If every local government took it upon itself to issue varying workplace regulations,' said Mr Jeffrey Tanenbaum, a San Francisco attorney representing the plaintiffs, 'it would be impossible to do business in this nation.' Mr Steve Parrish, senior vice-president and general counsel for Philip Morris, said it 'believes the common sense solution to this issue is to provide separate sections for smokers and non-smokers'.

The restrictions, which form part of a five-year voluntary agreement between the government and tobacco manufacturers, will mean larger health warnings, fewer posters and the removal of all permanent shopfront advertising for tobacco products by the end of 1996. The bill, which had been proposed by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, was opposed by the government and yesterday ran out of time at the report stage after Conservative MPs tabled amendments. Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said the new voluntary rules would mean an end to the use of humour likely to appeal to the young, and the removal of poster advertising from within a 200m radius of school entrances. The Tobacco Manufacturers Association said yesterday it had agreed 'with the utmost reluctance' to the new restrictions. It said it was 'dismayed and disappointed' by the 'attack on the industry's marketing freedoms'. The Advertising Association, the umbrella group which has been co-ordinating opposition to the bill, said it was relieved that a complete ban did not get through. It was 'extremely disappointed', however, that further restrictions had been placed on advertising in spite of there being 'no evidence of a link between advertising and total market consumption' of tobacco products. Action on Smoking and Health, the anti-smoking campaign group, claimed a 'moral victory' and said it would back amendments to other bills, 'in the same way that the seat-belts legislation was introduced', to bring in a ban on tobacco advertising.

0,FT942-12984 ,"FT942-12984 _AN-ED0DLADRFT 940427   FT  27 APR 94 / The Lex Column: BAT's tobacco habit   At first sight it might seem surprising that BAT Industries is investing Dollars 1bn in US tobacco rather than putting its money, literally, in a building society. Yet the acquisition of American Tobacco does not preclude a move in financial services. Gearing of around 50 per cent by the year-end looks perfectly comfortable, given BAT's ability to generate cash. Having made the decision to stay in US tobacco, BAT badly needed to strengthen its hand. Even after the acquisition, BAT will be fighting from third place behind Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco. But raising its market share to around 18 per cent should bring greater clout. If promised efficiencies in manufacturing and sales are delivered, BAT will also have scope to widen its margins. That would leave it better placed to weather a price war if the market leaders decide to absorb some of the US government's proposed tobacco tax. Despite such commercial logic, though, one might still question the decision to make a strategic investment in a declining market. Faced with similar arguments, American Brands decided to get out. There are certainly risks. The steady decline in US cigarette sales could easily accelerate, while the one-off impact of the tobacco tax can only be guessed at. BAT's gamble is that an exit multiple of around nine times last year's earnings is cheap enough to compensate. Since the big US tobacco companies are bundled within larger groups, that valuation is difficult to test. But if the additional investment delivers a return in all but the most trying market conditions, the group as a whole must be less risky as a result.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.

Section 1106 of the 1993 Act amended the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (the 1938 Act) by adding new section 320C that imposes a domestic tobacco content requirement for cigarettes made in the United States by any ``domestic manufacturer of cigarettes'' as defined in the 1938 Act. Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, each such manufacturer of cigarettes must certify the percentage of tobacco produced in the United States which was used by the manufacturer to produce cigarettes during the preceding calendar year. If the percentage of United States produced tobacco used by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes in the manufacture of cigarettes is less than 75 percent, the manufacturer will be subject to a domestic marketing assessment and must purchase a quantity of tobacco from inventories of the producer owned burley and flue-cured cooperative marketing associations in an amount equal to the quantity of imported tobacco used by the manufacturer to produce cigarettes during the preceding calendar year that exceeds 25 percent of the total quantity of tobacco used in such cigarette production. When a manufacturer is subject to a domestic content marketing assessment, the assessment rate will be based on the amount by which 1/2 the sum of the average prices per pound received during the most recent marketing year, by producers of domestically produced burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco, respectively, exceeds the average price per pound paid for unmanufactured imported tobacco during the preceding calendar year. This proposed rule would amend the regulations to implement the provisions of section 320C.

O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 200132415, telephone (202) 7208839.     The 75 percent domestic tobacco content requirement is expected to increase the usage of domestic tobacco by 188 million pounds for 1994 which will cost domestic manufacturers about $200 million. Since the cost of domestic tobacco is about double that of imported tobacco, domestic cigarette manufacturers are expected to shift cigarette production to foreign based operations. As this shift in production occurs, domestic cigarette production is expected to decline about 9 percent a year for the next four years. This will result in the loss of about 11,000 jobs in domestic cigarette manufacturing plants. The use of domestically produced tobacco will eventually decline to a level less than if there were no domestic content requirement. Domestic cigarette output is expected to decline about 40 percent by 1998. The impact statement indicates little effect on the consumer prices for cigarettes because the tobacco accounts for only about 3 percent of the cost of cigarettes. The regulatory impact analysis does not consider any effects that an increase in cigarette excise tax may have on domestic cigarette production.     The initial increase in the use of domestic tobacco is expected to draw down current loan stocks of burley and flue-cured tobacco. This will benefit tobacco producers in the short term since the Commodity Credit Corporation's net loan outlays for the 1994 marketing year are estimated to be about $380 million less as a result of the domestic tobacco content requirement. This will reduce the amount of the no-net-cost assessments paid by producers and purchasers of tobacco.     Except for the cigarette manufacturing sector, this proposed regulatory action is not expected to have an adverse effect on the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. This regulatory action is not expected to be inconsistent nor interfere with an action taken or planned by another federal agency. Other than as indicated in the summary of the regulatory impact statement, this action would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs, or the rights and obligations of the recipients thereof. This proposed rule would be consistent with the President's priorities and principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

But the issue's high-profile flop has certainly put the Japanese system for pricing equity offerings under the spotlight. Japan Telecom was designed to appeal to foreigners. There is a danger that it will instead reinforce investor suspicions that buying new Japanese equity is a quick way to lose money. Japan's system for pricing issues was introduced following the Recruit share scandal of the late 1980s. Then the problem was that new issues typically shot to handsome premiums and so companies could reward their friends by allocating them shares. But in combating corruption, the current system has brought its own problems. The main difference between the Japanese system and the 'bookbuilding' process used in most international equity issues is that the price is set through an auction near the start of the offering period rather than near the end. The delay between pricing an issue and trading means the share price is a hostage to wider market movements. Investors also have less time to analyse a stock before placing their bids. Japan Telecom is due to be followed by several other large issues. Japan Tobacco is next in line and two railway companies, JR West and JR Central, are expected next year. It is too late to alter the system for the Tobacco sale. But if future flotations are to attract foreign investors, Tokyo will need to bring its issuing practices closer to international standards.

Since the US company is prepared to sacrifice 40 per cent of its operating profit from US tobacco, there is little doubt that it means business. It will have few resources left for large acquisitions in the European food industry. But Cadbury Schweppes' relief is BAT Industries' distress. Unlike Rothmans, the other tobacco company in the FT-SE, BAT has a large US cigarette business. BAT generated some Pounds 360m in operating profit from the domestic US tobacco market last year. A drop in the same proportion as that anticipated by Philip Morris would knock Pounds 145m or 8 per cent off group operating income. The shock is unlikely to be as bad as that. By cutting the price of Marlboro, Philip Morris is sacrificing a high margin brand. BAT's premium brands like Kool, which account for about 40 per cent of its sales but a considerably higher proportion of its profits, should escape relatively lightly. Still, the heat will burn a significant hole in BAT's earnings: enough to change the arithmetic on its enhanced scrip dividend even if there is no short-term threat to dividend growth. After yesterday's 7 per cent fall in its price, BAT will have to issue more shares - on which it will be making a smaller return - to cover the scrip payment. Happily, BAT only needs a 9.5 per cent return to prevent the exercise being dilutive over the medium term, and it has been making over 20 per cent recently. The exercise still offers value which marginal cases such as Ladbroke cannot hope to match.   Companies:-  Philip Morris Companies Inc.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The Dollars 310m investment in the operation, in which the US group already owns a 49 per cent interest, underlines the importance of international markets to the troubled US food and tobacco group. Philip Morris would acquire 97 per cent of ATK, while the Kazakh government would retain 'a golden share', the news agency said. The investment includes Dollars 48.9m to acquire the equity, a Dollars 50m bonus to be paid to the Kazakh government, and about Dollars 210m in spending to improve production, tobacco growing and processing. In September, Philip Morris agreed to buy a minority interest in the enterprise and said it would lift its stake to more than 90 per cent within a year. The deal represented the first in which a foreign company had taken a significant stake in a privatised enterprise in the former Soviet republic. The Kazakh acquisition is the latest in a series of moves in which Philip Morris has sought to bolster its presence in foreign markets, which account for a greater percentage of its tobacco revenues than the US. The company has equity interests in tobacco operations in Russia and Lithuania. Along with other US tobacco groups, Philip Morris's domestic revenues have been hit by declining cigarette consumption. Profits from foreign sales, meanwhile, have grown at a faster pace than domestic earnings, partly because of the increasing popularity of cut-price no-frills brands. The investment in Kazakhstan is intended to flood the region with American-quality cigarettes. As part of the agreement, ATK will manufacture Marlboro and other leading Philip Morris brands, as well as local cigarettes.   Companies:-  Philip Morris Companies Inc.

The Advertising Standards Authority said yesterday that the advertisements had passed its vetting process and had not contravened a code of practice on tobacco advertising, but it 'considered that further use of the campaign would be unwise and therefore requested that it be discontinued'. The authority's recommendation is likely to fuel debate about whether controls on tobacco advertising should remain voluntary, or whether all tobacco advertising should be banned, as the European Commission has argued. The government is expected to announce a tightening of voluntary controls, one aim of which would be to head off a private member's bill to ban tobacco advertising - except at point of sale - being tabled by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley. The Embassy Regal posters, which have appeared mainly in Scotland, Wales and northern England and have won advertising industry awards, feature Reg's views on life. An example is: 'Reg on party politics - If you drop ash on the carpet you won't get invited again.' Research by the Health Education Authority was said to have shown that the Reg character had become an 'icon' among children. The authority said surveys showed that 'children in Manchester no longer called each other a Wally to denote stupidity, they called each other a Reg'. Imperial Tobacco said yesterday it did not accept the Reg campaign had encouraged any children to start smoking, but it accepted the Advertising Standards Authority's role 'as the final arbiter on such matters'. It added that its own study had concluded that the Health Education Authority's research was 'highly selective' and 'highly misleading'.   Companies:-  Imperial Tobacco.

THEY FACE OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL  GROWERS, HEALTH ADVOCATES.      By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      BEIJING      Across East Asia and through much of the developing world, a battle is raging  that some are calling a new Opium War.    Britain's victory in that 19th-Century conflict enabled its traders to continue  exchanging Indian opium for Chinese tea and silk, making huge profits while  devastating China.    Today's fight is over tobacco. Western firms, faced with declining demand at  home, are seeking to expand overseas. But they face fierce resistance from  local tobacco industries, nationalist advocates of protective farm policies and  outraged anti-smoking activists.    Lines are drawn for growing political conflict within and between nations. In  the United States and Europe, those opposing the trade on health and ethical  grounds are sharpening their attacks on tobacco defenders. Internationally,  some tobacco disputes are escalating and more are waiting to erupt.    The new Tobacco Wars sometimes reveal sparks of humor, as when leaflets passed  out at a rally outside the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, declared: ""If  smokers have to die, they should die with Thai tobacco.""    But the battles are mostly serious.    Approximately 500 million people alive today will die of tobacco-caused  diseases, according to an estimate presented by Richard Peto, an Oxford  University cancer expert, at an April conference on tobacco and health held in  Australia.    The U.S. government, viewing tobacco sales as a trade issue, has weighed in on  the side of the tobacco firms, using the threat of trade sanctions to force  markets open in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.    The Bush Administration is due to decide in November whether to impose punitive  tariffs on Thailand for refusing to open its cigarette market to foreign  brands. Before then, officials of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade will examine the issue.    The tobacco industry argues that it is only seeking fair access to existing  markets, not creating new smokers overseas. Some also note that American and  European cigarettes often have less tar than local brands common in developing  countries.    But with each new inroad, opponents become more vocal. Opium War imagery adds  power to their cause.    Taiwan's anti-smoking activist David Yen, who lost a lung to cancer in 1972,  has been compared to Lin Zexu, the Qing Dynasty official who led the anti-opium  campaign that touched off that long-ago conflict with England.    In South Korea, where resistance to foreign cigarettes has strong nationalistic  overtones, anti-imports leader Kang Moon Kyu told the Hong Kong-based Far  Eastern Economic Review that the key issue is protection of tobacco farmers,  and ""health is secondary.""    But Kang, too, reached back to the powerful old image. ""This is Korea's version  of the Opium War,"" he said.    People like Yen and Kang are finding increasingly vocal allies in the richer  developed countries.    Tobacco companies are ""marketing death in the Third World,"" American Cancer  Society chief executive William Tipping declared at the April health conference  held in Perth, Australia.    ""American corporations are the carriers of an epidemic, and our government has  become a willing instrument for the enforced export of that epidemic,"" Tipping  said. ""Those of us from America can only feel ashamed at our Administration's  role in undermining world health.""    U.S. tobacco exports are booming. American firms shipped nearly $5 billion  worth of tobacco products overseas in 1989, according to a study released in  April by the Tobacco Merchants Assn. of the United States.    At a health conference in Boston late last month, former U.S. Surgeon General  C. Everett Koop called the rise in tobacco exports ""a moral outrage.""    Koop noted that while smoking in the United States dropped 5% last year, U.S.  tobacco exports rose 20%.    ""I do not believe the United States will ever again be a good market for  tobacco products,"" Koop said. ""The curve is going down and accelerating. But if  we feel good because we have beaten the cigarette industry on its own turf, we  must realize that we've driven them to scour the rest of the earth for new  victims.""    The tobacco issue is also heating up in Europe.    London's Sunday Times reported last month that thousands of tons of high-tar  tobacco is being exported from European Community countries to developing  nations at low, taxpayer-subsidized prices.    Such exports are expected to grow once a new ruling comes into effect at the  end of 1992 banning the sale within the European Community of any cigarettes  containing more than 15 milligrams of tar, the newspaper reported.    ""It is totally unacceptable, and against all ethics, for the European Community  to dump high-tar tobacco on the Third World,"" Roberto Masironi, head of a World  Health Organization program on tobacco and health, commented in the Sunday  Times report. Keith Ball, a chest surgeon and adviser to the World Health  Organization, told the Sunday Times that today's European tobacco exports, much  of which go to Africa, will eventually bring sharply increased cancer rates  there. ""We have lit the fuse,"" he said. ""We're just waiting for the explosion.""    Those who focus not on health issues but on tobacco's contribution to exporting  countries' balance of payments often take a very different view.    A U.S. tobacco industry lobbying group called COMET (Coalition for Open Markets  and Expanded Trade) recently noted that ""in the face of the chronic American  foreign trade deficit, the U.S. tobacco export industry has steadily increased  its foreign trade surplus, ending 1989 with a net surplus of $4.3 billion.""    Despite this growing trade surplus, U.S. cigarette exports account for less  than 3% of worldwide consumption, according to COMET.    In an April statement on tobacco exports, Dean Kleckner, president of the  American Farm Bureau Federation, praised the growth in overseas sales as  benefiting American farmers and the U.S. economy. ""The success of tobacco has  meant thousands of jobs in this country and has provided many farm families a  good income.""    The Bush Administration says it respects health restrictions that foreign  governments place on smoking and cigarette sales, but that when a country  allows domestic firms to sell cigarettes, foreign producers should have the  same opportunity.    The United States, however, sometimes has attacked other countries'  restrictions on cigarette advertising, further angering anti-smoking forces.  Tobacco industry officials and Administration policy-makers argue that, because  imports have long been shut out, American cigarette makers must advertise in  these countries to let people know their products are available.    Anti-smoking activists in developing nations usually view such advertising as  anathema.    In Latin America, tobacco advertising ""is everywhere, at all times -- theaters,  opera houses, many sporting events, popular concerts,"" Carlos Alvarez Herrera,  president of the Argentina-based Latin America Coordinating Council on Smoking  Control, complained at the recent Boston conference.    Some, however, believe that by introducing a nationalistic element to the  tobacco issue, Western firms are provoking developing countries to look more  seriously at the question of tobacco and health.    ""The Western blitzkrieg . . . seems to have backfired,"" reported Asiaweek, a  Hong Kong-based magazine. ""Asian opinion seems to have tipped toward seeing a  commercial dispute as an issue of public health.""    U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills, sticking to the view that this  is still a commercial dispute, recently defended the American stance this way:  ""In a situation in which a foreign government judges it acceptable to sell  cigarettes to its citizens, we see no basis for refraining from ensuring equal  access for U.S. cigarette manufacturers. The sale of cigarettes is legal in the  United States and legal in those markets in which we have challenged their  practices.""    Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), speaking at the recent health conference in  Boston, ridiculed Hills' stance. ""Carla Hills is supposed to be the U.S. trade  representative,"" he declared, ""not the U.S. cancer representative.""    The General Accounting Office, Congress' own watchdog agency, issued a mid-May  report noting that American health and trade policies appear to be in conflict.  The report noted that ""if Congress believes that health considerations should  have primacy,"" it has the option of enacting laws to bring that about. So far,  one such bill has been introduced.    Meanwhile, tobacco companies continue to develop markets even in countries  where U.S. pressure is not yet a major issue.    Philip Morris Asia Inc., for example, recently sponsored a Beijing exhibit of  its Formula One racing cars. A few days later, sports officials and a Philip  Morris representative appeared at a news conference in the Great Hall of the  People to announce the Marlboro Dynasty Cup soccer tournament, which will bring  together teams from North Korea, South Korea, China and Japan in Beijing this  summer.    A reporter at the news conference asked for a response to criticism in the  United States and elsewhere that, since cigarettes are not good for health,  companies should not try to develop new markets in Asia.    Cathy Leiber, Hong Kong-based marketing coordinator for Philip Morris, replied  that Marlboro helps ""put sports on the map in countries that otherwise wouldn't  have the opportunity to compete at this level.""    ""In terms of our visibility as a company,"" she added, ""we take great pride in  the knowledge that we market a legal product around the world.""    Organizations such as the London-based International Tobacco Growers Assn. are  also fighting back.    ""Evidence from a number of major authoritative studies has emphasized the  economic and social importance of tobacco growing for many developing  countries,"" Alan F. Ravenscroft, chairman of the growers association, wrote in  an association report on tobacco in the Third World.    ""Yet anti-tobacco policies are being designed to reduce and even eliminate the  use of tobacco by the year 2000,"" Ravenscroft continued. ""Little allowance  appears to have been made for the very significant losses in jobs,  foreign-exchange earnings and revenue that would result if these policies were  ever implemented. As a consequence of these losses, many developing countries  would face serious problems of social instability and economic ruin.""    The report estimates that 33 million people engage in tobacco growing  worldwide, 90% of them in the developing countries. Including their families,  about 100 million people derive their livelihoods from tobacco cultivation, the  study says.    The world's leading tobacco grower is China, which produced 2.9 million tons in  1989, about 40% of the world total. This is slightly more than four times the  production of the United States, which ranks No. 2.    Market penetration by foreign brands remains at just 1% in China, which still  severely restricts cigarette imports.    The tobacco issue in China may ultimately be of greater significance than in  any other country. Most Chinese men are heavy smokers. Offering cigarettes is  an important social ritual, and few people take the risk of cancer very  seriously.    The Chinese government has recently given some support to anti-smoking efforts,  and the Chinese media are beginning to be aware of the issue.    A recent report by the official New China News Agency quoted World Health  Organization figures showing that tobacco-related diseases now take about 2.7  million lives per year worldwide.    ""Predictions for the future are grim,"" it added. ""Of all the children alive  today in China under 20 years of age, it is estimated that 50 million will die  from the effects of tobacco use.""    The news agency reported last month that survey results show 37% of high school  boys and just 2% of high school girls in China are smokers. The report added,  without giving details, that China is drafting laws ""to control the dangers of  tobacco.""    No-smoking signs are beginning to appear in airport departure lounges and on  some trains. But they are often disregarded. Virtually no one in China has any  concept of personal rights to clean air.    ""In America, you cannot smoke anywhere -- not at work, not in airplanes, not in  restaurants,"" marveled an elderly Chinese man who recently visited relatives in  the United States. ""In China, you can smoke everywhere, even if there's a law  against it. That's why all the American tobacco companies have started to sell  in China. They can make more money here. You can't smoke American cigarettes in  America, but you can in China!""    The 10 Leading Tobacco Producers    Estimated 1989 green weight production in tons    1. China: 2,886,150    2.

0,FT941-5023 ,"FT941-5023 _AN-ECJDQAH2FT 940309   FT  09 MAR 94 / Pentagon bans smoking      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   After Britain's Royal Navy abandoned the rum ration, it was perhaps only a matter of time before the US armed services stopped smoking. That time came yesterday when the Pentagon announced a workplace smoking ban. The new policy will still allow soldiers and sailors to light up a cigarette in designated areas of military barracks, clubs and restaurants, but will rule out Pentagon offices and hallways, as well as the inside of a tank or aircraft. Smoking below the decks of US Navy ships has already been virtually outlawed. The armed forces have traditionally smoked much more than the population at large, and despite aggressive steps to curb smoking, the rate of addiction remains high. Navy officials said around 37 per cent of Navy personnel were now smokers, compared with around 27 per cent in the general US population. The move was therefore welcomed by anti-smoking campaigners, who have been pressing for tougher curbs on smoking in the wake of the Environmental Protection Agency's recent decision to classify passive smoking as an environmental hazard. Some shopping malls and restaurant chains, including McDonald's, have banned smoking on their premises, and legislation is being debated in Congress that would bar cigarettes from all public buildings. Tobacco companies also face scrutiny over reports that they add nicotine to their products in order to maintain addiction - a charge that has led the Food and Drug Administration to consider regulating cigarettes as a drug. Justice Department officials are also conducting a monopoly investigation into allegations that tobacco companies agreed to keep a cigarette which presents less of a fire hazard off the market. The tobacco industry, facing a steep increase in cigarette taxes as part of US healthcare reforms, is not taking this lying down. Philip Morris, the tobacco conglomerate, shut down one of its largest plants yesterday to bus its workers to Washington to demonstrate against the tax rise.

The company, which already has a strong presence in eastern Europe and Russia, said it had agreed to a deal in which it would gain control of Almaty Tobacco Kombinat, a Kazakhstan cigarette manufacturing operation which employs 1,700. Initially, Philip Morris will take a 49 per cent interest in ATK, with its stake building to more than 90 per cent within a year. ATK's management and staff would hold the rest. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but the group said it was committed to spending at least Dollars 200m over the next five years to modernise ATK's manufacturing facilities. Mr Andreas Gembler, president of Philip Morris Europe's eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa operating region, said: 'Kazakhstan is certain to play a key strategic role in the economic development of central Asia.' The group said it envisioned the country becoming a net exporter of tobacco products within a few years. The immediate goal is to boost annual capacity from 12bn to 20bn cigarettes, the approximate number smoked in Kazakhstan a year. Local brands as well as Philip Morris's main international brands - including Marlboro, LM and Bond Street - are to be produced at the plant. In conjunction with efforts to boost output, the group has earmarked at least Dollars 25m for a programme aimed at improving the quality and quantity of Kazakhstan's tobacco crop. It is hoped that the country will become self-sufficient in tobacco growing by 1998. The acquisition highlights Philip Morris's strategy of broadening the base of its international tobacco operations, which have experienced healthy earnings gains recently, in contrast to its US tobacco business, where operating income has fallen sharply.

These new U.S.-made planes include eight Boeing-737, one  Boeing-747, one Boeing-757 and one Boeing-767.    An official from the China Aviation Suppliers Corporation  said that in the past few years, while the world's civil  aviation industry has experienced a sluggish market, the Chinese  aviation industry has maintained a sustained high-speed increase  of over 30 percent.    With the expansion of the country's air fleet, Boeing planes  have become the first choice for the Chinese market. In 1993  alone 47 Boeings were delivered to the Chinese mainland,  constituting 14 percent of the Boeing company's output for the  year. At present China is the biggest overseas buyer of Boeings.    The official said that the 12 major Chinese airlines use 164  Boeing planes, ranging from Boeing 737-500s, with more than 100  seats to Boeing 747-400s, with 420 seats.    Sources said that by the end of this year the number of  Boeing planes used by Chinese airlines will exceed 200. In 1995  China Southern Airlines will be the first to receive a  Boeing-777, the latest product of the Boeing company. Last year  China Southern Airlines ordered six Boeing-777 passenger planes.

This type of tobacco has twice as much nicotine  as regular tobacco (6 percent as compared to the average 3  percent). Production of the Y-1 tobacco has been banned in the  United States. Y-1 was developed in a laboratory by the U.S.  company DNA Plant Technology. The U.S. Department of  Agriculture has banned both the production and export of seeds  of this type of tobacco.    David Kessler, director of the FDA (Food and Drug  Administration), reported that the Y-1 plant was grown in Brazil  because ""U.S. manufacturers agreed that the nicotine content of  new varieties of tobacco should be close to average levels,""  which vary from 2.5 to 3.5 percent. According to Souza Cruz,  Y-1 was produced at the request of the Brown and Williamson  Tobacco Co. The company's press office in Rio de Janeiro  reported that 850 tonnes were exported in 1991, and 253 tonnes  in 1992.    Souza Cruz adviser Victor Sznejder said the company filled  orders placed by Brown and Williamson as well as by 50 other  customers from different locations around the world. Yet of the  average 60,000 tonnes of tobacco of various species exported by  Souza Cruz, the only order for the Y-1 type came from Brown and  Williamson. Although denying that the plant had undergone  genetic changes, Souza Cruz could not explain how the seeds of  the Y-1 plant -- the patent rights for which Brown and  Williamson has claimed both in Brazil and the United States --  ended up in the hands of Brazilian farmers.    Souza Cruz does not produce tobacco in Brazil, but purchases  the production of 65,000 farmers in southern Brazil. These  farmers, however, could not have gained access on their own to  the genetic code of the Y-1 plant. Brown and Williamson may  have sent the seeds to Souza Cruz, which in turn may have turned  them over to the farmers. The two companies are close partners.  They are both controlled by BAT (British American Tobacco)  Industries, a British group that owns 100 percent of the assets  of Brown and Williamson and 75 percent of those of Souza Cruz.    In Brasilia, the Brazilian Government has announced that it  has no control over the nicotine content of cigarettes  manufactured in Brazil. Yesterday, the Agriculture Ministry,  which is charged with monitoring tobacco production, reported it  has never heard of the Y-1 high nicotine tobacco. The FDA  claimed that this type of tobacco, which has a high content of  nicotine and which increases addiction in smokers, is being  produced in Brazil.    Jose Meireles, chief of the Division of Production  Standardization and Supervision, said their control of Brazilian  tobacco is limited to ""checking the health conditions of the  product."" Government experts would verify, for instance,  excessive humidity or use of toxic pesticides. They do their  inspection with the naked eye, without laboratory analyses that  could measure the nicotine content.    Thus, Brazilian consumers do not have the slightest idea of  the tar or nicotine content of the tobacco used to manufacture  cigarettes in the country. In most cases, the experts rely on  the information supplied by the respective manufacturers.    Advisers of Agriculture Minister Sinval Guazelli have noted  that the ministry has no authority to check the quality of  export products. In the case of the Y-1 tobacco exported to the  United States, Law 5025 -- issued in 1966 -- provides that an  exporter will be held accountable for the quality of the product  he is selling. Agricultural experts are awaiting, however, to  receive the FDA report to discuss with Industry and Commerce  Ministry the mechanisms for controlling the tobacco being  exported.    The Health Ministry has announced that it has no authority  to  monitor the content of cigarettes. The ministry has issued only  one decree on the subject; it orders manufacturers to post the  warning that cigarette smoking is hazardous to human health on  each cigarette.     "

0,FT944-9229 ,"FT944-9229 _AN-EKPEKAF4FT 941116   FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japan postpones privatisation of JR West      By WILLIAM DAWKINS      TOKYO   The Japanese government yesterday shelved until next year the flotation of West Japan Railway (JR West), the latest in a series of embarrassing setbacks to its privatisation programme. Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, said the flotation would have 'adverse effects on the stock market' if it took place as scheduled, in the current tax year to March. He feared the value of the company, one of seven established from the 1987 break-up of Japan National Railways, 'may not be recognised adequately'. The stock exchange believes the listing will take place after the company's annual results next June. The postponement was seen by Tokyo stockbrokers as a government recognition of the market's dislike of its unique pricing system for new issues, in which the price is decided at a pre-offer auction among a restricted number of large investors. This contrasts with the book-building system, used for most international equity issues, where professional advisers set the price after consulting the main institutional buyers. Critics of the Japanese equity pricing system say it tends to set prices too high, a factor in the flop of the latest privatisation, of Japan Tobacco, the cigarette making monopoly, last month. The finance ministry was left with 280,000 Japan Tobacco shares after small investors spurned the issue. It traded yesterday at Y991,000 a share, well below its Y1.438m issue price. As a result of the Japan Tobacco experience, the finance ministry has launched a review of the method of pricing flotations. The delay to JR West's privatisation will leave another shortfall in the finance ministry's revenues this year. They have already been depleted by lower than expected income tax revenues. However, the ministry is accustomed to the unexpected where privatisations are concerned. The 1990 stock market collapse forced it to delay reducing its stake in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, still at 65.6 per cent, to the targeted 50 per cent. For the same reason, the government delayed the flotation of East Japan Railway, the only rail operator to have been privatised so far, for a year until 1993.   Companies:-  West Japan Railway.

0,FT941-13151 ,"FT941-13151 _AN-EA0DIABKFT 940127   FT  27 JAN 94 / Smugglers force Canada to cut cigarette taxes      By BERNARD SIMON      TORONTO   Canada's federal and Quebec governments have bowed to the commercial and political costs of rampant cigarette smuggling across the US-Canada border and look set to reverse a tradition of ever-higher taxation on tobacco products. Both Quebec and Ottawa have promised to cut and perhaps even abolish the high federal and provincial taxes which are widely blamed for the surge in cigarette smuggling. The problem is most acute in Quebec, where the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council estimates that about two-thirds of all cigarette sales are contraband. A group of Quebec convenience store owners, whose business has been ravaged by smuggling, earlier this week flouted the law by setting up an illegal market north of Montreal, where they sold cigarettes at the smuggled price of CDollars 20 (Pounds 10.20) a carton, compared with the fully-taxed retail price of CDollars 40-CDollars 46. Governments have become increasingly concerned at the social and political ramifications of smuggling. Much of the trade, which is centred on the St Lawrence River and Indian reserves which straddle the US-Canada border, has fallen into the hands of organised crime. Some Indian communities have begun to manufacture their own cigarettes, and contraband products are starting to find their way on to retailers' shelves in counterfeit packaging. The ready availability of cheap, smuggled cigarettes is also believed to have boosted consumption. Contraband packs carry less prominent health warnings. Ottawa and the provinces have so far failed to agree on a co-ordinated tax cut. Ontario, which collects CDollars 800m a year from tobacco taxes and is struggling to contain a yawning budget deficit, is reluctant to forfeit a sizeable source of revenue. But the smuggling issue has gained a political dimension in Quebec, where separatists argue that the francophone province could easily put a stop to the trade if it had greater autonomy from Ottawa. Tobacco manufacturers estimate that taxes on cigarettes will have to be chopped by about two-thirds to compete with contraband goods. They are also banking on a rise in US cigarette taxes within the next year to narrow the price gap between the two countries.   Countries:-  CAZ  Canada.   Industries:-  P2111 Cigarettes.

In a stunning verdict Monday night, a jury here found American Tobacco Co.  liable for the lung cancer death of a longtime smoker but awarded zero damages  to his family.    The decision, seen as a victory for the tobacco industry in its fight to  discourage smoker death lawsuits, shocked the lawyers, Wall Street consultants  and reporters who packed the courtroom in the 150-year-old courthouse.    The jury deliberated 5 1/2 hours before rendering its verdict on the wrongful  death claim brought by the family of Nathan H. Horton, a carpenter and  contractor who died in 1987 at age 50 after smoking American's Pall Mall brand  for more than 30 years.    ""It's sort of a baffling decision,"" said a litigation consultant for a Wall  Street investment firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""It sounds like  it's continuing to protect the industry.""    Immediately after the verdict was read by Circuit Judge Eugene Bogen, lawyers  for American Tobacco asked him to ""reform"" the verdict, contending that since  no damages were due to plaintiffs, judgment should be entered for the tobacco  company.    Lawyers for the Hortons, who had been seeking punitive damages of $15 million,  moved for Bogen to award at least nominal damages or to set a new trial on the  issue of damages alone.    Bogen said he would take both motions under advisement and left the courtroom  without further comment.    The verdict came just before 7 p.m. on a 9-3 vote. It was uncertain whether the  three dissenters had favored a clear judgment for American or a damage award  for the Hortons.    Reached at home Monday night, jury foreman David G. Roach said the verdict was  a compromise between jurors who were about evenly split between plaintiffs and  defendants. ""It was a very high likelihood of a hung jury,"" said Roach, 41,  deputy director of computing and information systems at the University of  Mississippi. ""This was a verdict that nine out of 12 could accept.""    The outcome could prove discouraging to plaintiffs' lawyers since it shows they  must contend not only with the tobacco industry's high-powered legal defense  but with the hostility of jurors toward smokers who ignore health warnings yet  seek damages for smoking-related disease.    Kurt Feuerman, a tobacco analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co., Monday night  called the verdict ""very positive"" for the industry ""because it basically  confirms the industry's long-term record"" of defeating smoker death claims.    Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston and  chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project, which encourages lawsuits  against tobacco companies, said: ""The upside of this is that the tobacco  companies, even in the Deep South, even with six smokers on the jury, can't  come up with a verdict anymore. The downside is, we're still waiting for our  verdict.""    The number of smoker death claims against the industry has dwindled from about  120 two years ago to about 55 today.    The jury of eight women and four men included six smokers, of whom five  reportedly stated on jury questionnaires that they could kick the habit if they  tried. That was seen as a negative for plaintiffs, who said Horton had tried  but was unable to quit smoking.    Monday's verdict actually makes it three trials out of the last five that the  industry failed to win. Still, the tobacco companies' 35-year record of never  paying a nickel to a customer who contracted smoking-related disease remains  intact.    In June, 1988, a federal jury in Newark, N.J., awarded $400,000 damages in a  smoker death case, but the verdict was overturned on appeal last January and a  new trial is pending.    In January, 1988, the first Horton trial ended in a hung jury when bitterly  divided jurors, split 7-5 in American's favor, refused to continue deliberating  with each other.

The awardees were announced here today by the WHO regional  office for the western Pacific.    The award, which highlights the observance of the World No-  Tobacco Day on May 31 each year, is presented annually to a very  selected number of individuals and institutions for their  continuing commitment to promoting a tobacco-free society  through research or health promotion activities.    It is intended to make governments, communities, groups and  individuals aware of the health hazards of smoking and encourage  them to take appropriate action, the who said.    The five awardees for this year in the western Pacific  region  are Philippine Health Secretary Juan Flavier; Buchun [spelling  of name as received], YMCA, South Korea; Cathay Pacific  Airlines, Hong Kong; and the Chinese Association on Smoking and  Health as well as the Health Bureau of Jishan County, Shanxi  Province of China.    At present, three million people die of tobacco-related  diseases worldwide every year, WHO said, warning that if the  current trend continues the death toll from smoking would reach  10 million by 2025 and 70 percent of them would be in the  developing world.    In view of the agressive promotion on the part of the  tobacco  companies, which have predicted a 33 percent increase in tobacco  sales in the western Pacific region before the end of the  century, the who has launched a program aimed to ban tobacco  advertisements completely in the western Pacific region by the  year 2000.    This year's World No-Tobacco Day links the media to fighting  smoking with the theme of ""The Media and Tobacco: Getting the  Health Message Across.""    In bestowing the award to Flavier today, WHO's regional  director for western Pacific Dr. S.T. Han challenged the media  to help bring about a significant change in tobacco consumption  ""by instigating a truly dynamic health information campaign on  the danger of smoking.""    He also urged the media to support anti-tobacco legislation.     "
0,FT942-12006 ,"FT942-12006 _AN-EECCXAC7FT 940503   FT  03 MAY 94 / Leading Article: The business of smoking   The acquisition of American Tobacco by BAT Industries is at first glance a perverse step. For one thing, it appears contrary to BAT's strategy of diversifying away from cigarette sales into financial services. For another, BAT is investing in the US tobacco market at a time when sales are declining and the anti-smoking climate is shifting from determined to downright zealous. Yet BAT has benefited from the adverse circumstances - as its share price rise shows. Fears over the future of the US market mean that the price paid for American Tobacco is cheap at under 10 times earnings. The acquisition should allow BAT to strengthen its market position through efficiencies in marketing and sales. In spite of falling sales and the price war launched last year by Philip Morris, tobacco continues to produce strong cash flow. This cash can be used to diversify out of tobacco. BAT continues to look for opportunities in financial services. American Brands, former owner of American Tobacco, has built up a strong portfolio of other consumer brands. But the collapse of communism creates enormous opportunities for companies that remain in the tobacco business. Markets such as China and the former Soviet Union are now opening up with fast-growing sales. The tobacco giants would be unwise to assume that they can indefinitely expand the market for their products, however, even in less developed countries. The health consequences of smoking on those who indulge in it are now undisputed and clear. As life expectancy in such countries lengthens, the cost in premature deaths and medical treatment will become evident. Restrictions on sales and marketing will follow. Anti-smoking activists The rapid change in thinking in the US should be a warning of how fast the climate for smoking can change, even in a country with a substantial tobacco industry. The election of President Bill Clinton has ended a period in which anti-smoking activists had minimal impact and US diplomats did their best to open foreign markets for their tobacco companies. Far-reaching measures now proposed could restrict smoking to the privacy of the home, the car or special smoking rooms sealed off from the rest of the world. Given the growing evidence on the health impact of smoking on non-smokers, it is certainly sensible to ensure that the latter can avoid 'passive smoking'. The threat of litigation will compel employers to protect their non-smoking employees from tobacco smoke. The prevailing mood may also lead businesses such as restaurants to segregate their smoking customers. Smokers in public places will face increasing restrictions at the behest of the non-smoking majority. Draconian measures Yet some of the more draconian measures now proposed are unlikely to be effective. Punitive taxation, for example, is tempting because it bears heavily on 'sinners'. It can also be shown to reduce consumption and deter young people from the habit. Excessively high taxes, however, also increase the sort of cross-border smuggling that recently forced Canada to cut its tobacco tax. Even more drastic attempts to treat tobacco like other dangerous drugs is likely to make control more difficult. Banning other widely-consumed drugs such as marijuana has not significantly reduced their consumption. It has, however, removed them from controls over distribution, to the advantage of those who sell more dangerous substances. As with alcohol prohibition in the US, the main beneficiaries are criminals. Nor is it clear that complete bans on advertising are efficacious (other than in defending state tobacco monopolies against foreign competitors). There is some evidence that smoking may increase in countries with bans because of the disappearance of the anti-smoking messages that advertisements are normally required to carry. Reducing the number of smokers and the amount of smoking is a legitimate and worthwhile aim of public policy. But pragmatism is needed in chosing the means. And success is likely to be gradual, a fact that allows the tobacco companies very many more profitable years before their market disappears completely.   Companies:-  American Tobacco Co Inc.

The turnaround in technology transfers, which had declined  since 1989, reflects the business recovery in Korea, according  to the ""Annual Report on Technology Introduction"" issued  recently by the Korea Industrial Technology Association.    The annual report analyzed last year's technology  introduction, finding that the electric and electronic sector  led the way with 238 cases (33.6 percent), followed by 206 cases  for the machinery area (29.1) and 91 cases for the chemical  field (12.8).    In terms of royalties paid for technology transfers, the  electric and electronic sector came first with 54.2 percent,  trailed by the mechanical and chemical fields with 22.8 percent  and 12.55 percent, respectively. The most conspicuous rise  occurred in the construction sector with 28 cases worth 14.46  million dollars compared with three cases totaling 7.35 million  dollars in the previous year.    By country, Japan ranked first with 285 cases (40.3  percent),  followed by the United States (31.6 percent), Britain (5.15  percent) and Germany (4.3 percent).    The report said Korea's reliance on American and Japanese  technology declined as Japan, in particular, is avoiding  transfer of its advanced technology.    However, technology imports from former communist countries  such as Russia rose to 17 cases from five in the previous year,  indicating that technical cooperation with these states is  becoming more active.

When the 626,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District becomes ""tobacco  free"" on Nov. 15 -- banning the use of such products anywhere on district  property or at school-sponsored events -- it will find plenty of company,  especially among suburban or small-town districts.    LITTLE OPPOSITION: In the last two or three years, rules aimed at achieving  smoke-free elementary and secondary campuses have been enacted from Orlando,  Fla., to Simi Valley, Calif. -- with only modest pockets of opposition from  district employees and practically none from parents who liked to smoke at  football games and other school-sponsored events. Even the tobacco industry,  which usually mobilizes at the first whiff of anti-smoking proposals, has  stayed out of the way of campaigns to ban its products at schools.    The campaigns are aided by mounting medical evidence of tobacco's serious  health effects, including from so-called second-hand smoke, and by indications  that tobacco is a ""gateway"" substance that can start the youngest smokers down  the road to illegal drug use. They are also helped by social pressure against  smoking and by a desire to provide better role models for youngsters.    According to a survey last year by the National School Boards Assn., 17% of  school districts nationwide banned tobacco use entirely, contrasted with just  2% in 1986. New Jersey, Kansas, Utah and New Hampshire have required that all  their schools be tobacco-free, to be joined next year by Washington state, an  official of the Tobacco Free America Project said. The project is run by the  American Cancer Society, the American Heart Assn. and the American Lung Assn.,  the agencies that are spearheading the drive to boot tobacco off campus.    School tobacco bans ""are definitely increasing . . . this is the easiest, most  obvious move to make,"" said Diane Maple of the Lung Assn., which, like its two  sister agencies, offers advice and stop-smoking programs to school boards  considering such bans.    ""After all, schools are about children, and who can argue about that?"" Maple  said.    INDUSTRY QUIET: The Tobacco Institute, which has battled regulations from  restaurants to airliners on grounds that they trample the rights of smokers, is  conspicuously absent from school board debates.    ""We don't (lobby school boards) because children are involved,"" said Tobacco  Institute spokesman Thomas Lauria, who denounced the comprehensive bans on  campus tobacco use for ""treating teachers like children."" Nonetheless, the  industry, fighting accusations that it is trying to recruit new smokers, is  ""not going to go on record to defend policies that affect children,"" he said.    Most of the school bans have been enacted after communitywide campaigns, are  accompanied by stop-smoking help and have either several months' lead time  before enforcement or have been phased in slowly.    Orlando's 103,000-student Orange County Public Schools led the state of Florida  when it enacted its ban in February, 1989, but the policy will not take full  effect until next fall, when new teachers union contracts are in place,  district spokeswoman Diane Taylor said. So far, the bans do not appear to have  led any of the districts that pioneered them into stormy legal waters.    RULE OF REASON: Most districts said they try to be reasonable about  enforcement.

0,FT932-16700 ,"FT932-16700 _AN-DDDAIAEPFT 930403   FT  03 APR 93 / Finance  The Family: A quiet one to watch - Investment Trusts      By PHILIP COGGAN   FOR A TRUST with half a billion pounds in assets, Anglo  Overseas gets surprisingly little attention. Indeed, one symptom of this low profile is the near-20 per cent discount at which the shares trade. These remain largely in the hands of institutional investors, perhaps because of the trust's lowish yield and the fact that its international portfolio makes it ineligible for full Pep status. But it could be argued that its aims - to invest in world-wide companies with greater emphasis on capital appreciation than income - are designed better for private investors than for institutions, which these days can manage international exposure for themselves. The trust was founded in 1890 as Anglo-American Debenture Corporation in order to buy bonds and other securities in the US, Canada and elsewhere. The 'debenture' tag was dropped as the portfolio became concentrated in equities, but the trust was known as Anglo-American Securities until 1987 when its name was changed to avoid confusion with the South African conglomerate. Morgan Grenfell took over management of the trust from Robert Fleming in 1981. The lead manager, James Fox, has been a fund manager since 1968. He joined Morgan Grenfell in 1985 after spells at Hill Samuel and Warburg Investment Management. As well as making the overall asset allocation decisions, he also looks after the continental European element of the portfolio. The rest of the team is Adrian Frost (UK), Kazuichi Mihara (Far East) and Alan Nesbit (the Americas). The trust is more international than most of its competitors - the UK weighting (39.9 per cent at the end of 1992) is designed to generate income. The rest of the portfolio at end 1992 was split: the Americas (19.8 per cent); Japan (19 per cent); other Far East (6 per cent); and Europe (15.3 per cent). Since then, the American portion has been reduced and the Japanese and European elements increased. Over the past few years, Anglo  Overseas has had quite a high weighting in Japan relative to its competitors. This damaged its performance in 1990 when the Tokyo market fell out of bed, but has been of benefit in the opening quarter of 1993. Fox says the trust tries to take a contrarian approach, as shown by its increased exposure to Japan in the teeth of conventional wisdom. He cites, as another example, the trust's Pounds 15m direct investment into UK property over the past two years. 'We have bought five buildings outside London, on an average yield of around 10 per cent and with good tenants,' he says. Anglo-Overseas also believes it is the first trust to issue commercial paper (a form of short-term debt). It is using the paper to play the yield curve, borrowing short in dollars at 3.2 per cent and investing in dollar Eurobonds at 6.4 per cent. The 10 biggest investments in the portfolio reflect the international flavour. They are: Foxhurst (the property subsidiary); Generale des Eaux; BTR; BAT; GUS; Sandoz; Robert Fleming; Export-Import Bank of Japan (Eurobond); UBS; and Export Development Corporation (Eurobond). The trust's performance has been respectable, rather than inspiring. In terms of net asset value total return, it was 6th out of 14 trusts in the international capital growth sector over the year to March 1 with a rise of 25.1 per cent (according to the Association of Investment Trust Companies). Anglo  Overseas was eighth (out of 12) in the sector over a five year period and fifth (out of 10) over a 10-year period. Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says: 'It is one of those trusts which has chugged away without doing anything special. 'Because of its size, it tends to be a core holding of institutional investment trust portfolios, but it has not really succeeded in attracting the private investor.' Hamish Buchan, of NatWest Securities, adds: 'It is a classic flexible international trust. It will never be a high yielder, but it has good revenue reserves and there is the prospect of steady dividend growth. It does not have the track record of Foreign  Colonial, which explains why the discount is so wide.' But the discount does increase the attractions of the trust for those who want overseas exposure and who believe, like Morgan Grenfell, that the Japanese market is due for further recovery. Key facts Gross assets are around Pounds 525m and net assets were Pounds 469m. On April 1, this translated into net assets per share of 408.8p, according to NatWest Securities. This put the shares, then at 332p, on a discount of 18.8 per cent. The yield was 2.8 per cent. Morgan Grenfell's management expenses were 0.3 per cent of assets. Board The chairman is Lord Wakehurst, who has been on the board since 1968. Other directors are John Boyer, a former deputy chairman of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Michael Dobson, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell; Peter Ogden, chairman of Computacenter; and James Fox. Lord Catto is about to retire. Savings scheme and Pep details The minimum monthly investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 30, or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. The only charges are commission of 0.2 per cent and government stamp duty of 0.5 per cent. Because of its high overseas weighting, Anglo  Overseas does not qualify for full Pep status. But as a non-qualifying trust, self-select Pep investors could put Pounds 1,500 a year into it.   Companies:-  Anglo and Overseas Trust.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-10443 ,"FT942-10443 _AN-EELCZAGLFT 940511   FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Four shipping groups plan global pact      By PAUL ABRAHAMS, SIMON HOLBERTON and RONALD VAN DE KROL      TOKYO, HONG KONG, AMSTERDAM   Four of the world's top 10 container groups yesterday announced plans for an alliance linking Japan, China, Europe and North America, the globe's largest trading blocs. Mitsui OSK of Japan, Nedlloyd Lijnen of the Netherlands, American President Lines of the US, and Hong Kong's Orient Overseas Container Line, said they had started negotiations aimed at sharing capacity around the world. The lines will not take equity stakes in each other. The planned partnership is the latest in a series of worldwide agreements between shipping companies as they seek to achieve economies of scale in an increasingly competitive environment. The four aim to dominate the high value-added segment of the container shipping market which involves greater attention to customer service. 'This configuration will allow the four companies to use their ships more effectively, improving use of capacity, offering more frequent, more direct and faster sailings,' said Mr Hideyuki Sadamatsu, Mitsui OSK's deputy general manager for Europe and Oceania. The groups were still negotiating how many ships would be allocated to the alliance which should be agreed within four months and implemented within two years, he said. Mr Simon Brough, finance director of Orient Overseas, said the alliance would allow the partners to offer a frequent service to their customers. Each company would, however, be responsible for its own marketing, sales and service, he said. The new alliance could eventually include joint trucking, logistics, warehousing and inland operations as well as ship-sharing. In Rotterdam, Nedlloyd said the proposed alliance would enable it to improve services to cargo customers. 'It means we can offer a greater frequency of services, and more direct services to more harbours, than before,' Mr Hans Teeuw, senior vice-president of Nedlloyd Lines, said. He said the partnership was not aimed at bolstering freight rates but added that Nedlloyd hoped that rates would recover. The recent stabilisation of rates after sharp declines in past years, plus growth in cargo volumes, is expected to allow Nedlloyd to return to profit in 1994 after several years of losses. The shipping industry, which is highly capital intensive, is suffering from overcapacity and poor rates. This has forced operators into capacity sharing agreements to make the most efficient use of assets and improve returns. Last year, Hapag-Lloyd, Germany's biggest container company, Neptune Orient Lines of Singapore, and Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Japan's largest containership company, concluded an agreement to provide services between Asia, North America and Europe. Mitsui, which previously had a partnership for Asian-European trade with Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Hapag-Lloyd, severed its links with these companies after the creation of the alliance. American President Lines and Orient Overseas are the largest container shipper on the trans-pacific route since forming an alliance in which they share capacity, co-ordinate sailings and share container terminals. Mitsui has teamed up with the Malaysian International Shipping Corporation, Nedlloyd Lines and Compagnie Gene Maritime to provide scheduled services between Europe and the Far East. The Japanese company said the latest deal would not affect this arrangement, called the Tonnage Sharing Agreement.   Companies:-  Mitsui OSK.     Nedlloyd Lijnen.     American President Lines.

Mr Bernard Huber, KJS vice-president for central and eastern Europe, called the deal 'an important part of our east European confectionery strategy'. The purchase price includes a commitment to invest Dollars 12.5m in the business, which employs 800 people. KJS, which expects total revenues of Dollars 9bn this year and is the third-largest food manufacturer in Europe, has made similar acquisitions in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. The deal marks the second foray into Lithuania by Philip Morris, which in April beat British American Tobacco to acquire the Klaipeda Tobacco Company for Dollars 40m - the biggest western investment in the Baltic states so far. The Kaunas deal repeats a pattern which has marked Philip Morris' entry into other east European markets. Shortly after it bought a majority stake in the Czech Tabak cigarette factory last year, Jacobs Suchard bought Figaro, a confectionery company in the Slovak Republic. Last summer Jacobs Suchard, a confectionery and coffee business which is in the process of merging with Kraft, acquired Dadak, a Czech spice producer. Inexpensive western consumer products, such as cigarettes and chocolates, are in strong demand in the former Soviet bloc. It is estimated that 700bn cigarettes are sold in the region every year. In Lithuania, Philip Morris and KJS have inherited a virtual monopoly propped up by high import duties. Kaunas, the country's largest sweets company with Dollars 10m in total sales, sells 90 per cent of its output on the domestic market. But KJS may want to tap the export potential. Though Lithuania is a small country of 3.7m people, it is often seen as a stepping stone to larger neighbouring markets. By buying local companies, Philip Morris and its subsidiary inherit informal trade contacts cultivated under Soviet rule that may help to smooth any future moves east. Estonia, Latvia and Belarus are the markets closest to Lithuania. But Russia remains the most lucrative - in particular the St Petersburg region, which includes northern Europe's largest city and a population approaching 9m.   Companies:-  Kraft Jacobs Suchard.

Reporting yesterday on the disbursement of programme aid to four African countries between 1987 and 1993, the NAO urged the development administration to consider 'more timely' completion of reports, the setting of more specific targets and swifter payment of aid to countries meeting their reform programmes. Since 1987 the administration has spent Pounds 914m on programme aid, which is intended to smooth the introduction of economic restructuring programmes agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Most of the aid has gone to Africa. The NAO examined prog-ramme aid devoted to Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia, which between them account-ed for more than half the aid given to Africa over the six years. It concluded that new safeguards to ensure better value for money in procurement spending had achieved only 'mixed' success where governments were reimbursed with foreign exchange, and needed to be tightened. According to the office, two-thirds of the aid was not tied to UK or other suppliers. The Overseas Development Administration believes that the untying of aid was generally beneficial to the UK 'because British exporters win a significant share of African business'. Overall, the NAO concluded that 'no fully satisfactory' method existed for judging the value of programme aid.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

France introduced guidelines at the start of the year to reduce the country's notorious over-prescribing habits; doctors were asked to prescribe only drugs appropriate to a given medical condition. Sales in France in the first quarter of 1994 were worth Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.9bn), compared with Dollars 3.2bn in the first quarter of 1993. The decline was 4 per cent, taking into account currency fluctuations, IMS International, the London-based market research company, reported. Italian reforms significantly affected sales, which fell 11 per cent in constant currency terms to Dollars 1.8bn. Italy has introduced limited lists of drugs for which the state medical system would pay in the treatment of patients. By contrast, sales in Germany, Europe's biggest individual market, recovered 6 per cent against a year earlier to Dollars 3.1bn. However, the comparative improvement was partly due to the low level of last year's figures for the first quarter, when new healthcare reforms penalised doctors for over-prescribing. Sales in the UK, where reforms have been relatively modest, grew by 8 per cent, faster than any other large country. Nevertheless, UK doctors remained relatively low prescribers, and sales of Dollars 1.3bn were less per head of population than Spain. The US, where sweeping healthcare legislation is still being discussed, saw drugs sales rise 6 per cent to Dollars 12.2bn. Sales in Canada, which has a thriving generics (cheaper unbranded drugs) industry, rose 1 per cent to Dollars 822m. Sales in Japan, where the government has pushed through drug price cuts, fell 6 per cent to Dollars 4.6bn. By therapeutic area, cardiovascular drugs, including many treatments for heart conditions, remain the biggest single area, with sales 5 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1993. But the next biggest category, digestive tract drugs including the world's biggest seller, Glaxo's Zantac, was one of the fastest growing sectors. Sales increased 7 per cent.

The nature reserve has been admitted to the international  network of biosphere reserves of the United Nations Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) along with nine  other such reserves in China.    Since 1988, it has co-operated with the worldwide fund for  nature to protect wild elephants and study the breeding of  insects, and the development of forestry and farming outside the  reserve as well as the relationships between tourism and  wildlife protection.    Meanwhile, it has started a training class in the management  of wild animals in co-operation with experts from the  association of wild animal protection of the United States.    Established in 1958 in a remote part of southwest China's  Yunnan Province, and known as ""the kingdom of plants"", the  nature reserve is made up of five linked reserves with a total  area of 240,000 ha.    Specially designed to protect the local ecosystem of  primeval  forests, and rare animals and plants, the reserve boasts 4,000  kinds of tropical forest and rain forest. So far, a total of  341 wild plants are cultivated in the reserve, 52 of which are  under special protection from the central government.    In addition, 99 wild animals in the reserve are under top  protection from the Chinese Government.    Some 150,000 Chinese and foreign tourists, many of them  experts and scholars, visited the reserve last year.     "

Foreign investors or those from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao  once were forbidden to invest in the Chinese commercial retail  business. Trial utilization of foreign funds in this field in  some large cities including Beijing and Shanghai was approved by  the State Council only in recent years to meet the growing  demand of consumers.    Since then, Shanghai commercial departments have approved  300- plus foreign invested retail projects with a total capital  exceeding one billion U.S. dollars. Investors are from Japan,  Hong Kong, Taiwan and some transnational corporations.    Following the Eastern Shopping Mansion, another large-scale  complex named the Hongqiao Friendship Shopping Center and partly  funded by Hong Kong investors opened to service recently in  Shanghai.    Equipped with high-standard facilities and stocked with  world- renowned brands, these shopping centers manage to provide  elegant and comfortable shopping environments and greater  selection for those consumers with high income.    In order to attract more local wage-earners, the  newly-opened  Hongqiao Friendship Shopping Center offers affordable daily  necessities in conjunction with expensive luxuries in its  beautifully-decorated shopping halls. Its commodities amount to  more than 30,000 varieties in total.    ""If you want to make your brands known in China, Shanghai  can  help you do it,"" general manager of the Hongqiao Friendship  Shopping Center said, which is also what most overseas investors  in Shanghai's retail business firmly believe.

0,FT932-422 ,"FT932-422 _AN-DF2CGAC4FT 930629   FT  29 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Tobacco warning rules clarified - European Court   The European Court of Justice last week clarified in two cases the scope of discretionary powers available to European Community states when fixing health warnings on cigarette packets and other tobacco products. The first case related to British rules on the size of health warnings and their compatibility with EC law. Under the terms of the tobacco products directive, all cigarette packets for sale in the Community must carry health warnings which cover at least 4 per cent of the surface of the packet. Under the UK's rules, brought into force to give effect to the directive, health warnings must cover 6 per cent of the surface of a packet. Cigarettes imported from other EC states are deemed to comply with UK law if the health warnings comply with the requirements adopted by the exporting country in implementing the directive. The court was asked for a preliminary ruling on whether UK regulations were compatible with the directive. It said the directive laid down common rules for the labelling of tobacco products in the Community. Some rules gave states no discretion to impose stricter requirements; others allowed a degree of discretion. Such discretion was allowed in relation to health warnings. The directive set down a minimum surface area. EC member states were entitled to increase the area to be covered. The court accepted that its decision, which was contrary to the earlier opinion of the advocate general, might lead to less favourable treatment for national products compared with imports, but it ruled that this was an unfortunate consequence of setting out only minimum requirements on the size of health warnings in the directive. The second case involved Italian rules on health warnings. The Italian rules require manufacturers to put two health warnings on cigarette packets and require warnings covering at least 4 per cent of the surface for other tobacco products. The court said there was no discretion under the directive to require more than one health warning. The court said that as far as other tobacco products were concerned the directive set out different conditions than those for cigarettes. Health warnings simply had to be printed so that they were clearly legible and easily seen. There was no discretion for EC member states to impose more stringent requirements for warnings on other tobacco products.

Danish public procurement contract breached EC law Nearly four years after the case was first lodged with the European Court, judgment was given last week on the public procurement contract for the construction of the bridge across the Grand Belt, which divides Denmark in two. The court found the contract was flawed in two respects. First, by insisting that construction companies were to use as high a percentage of Danish materials as possible, the state-owned company in charge of the project was found to be in breach of EC law. The court said despite the removal of the clause in question, the tendering process had been tainted and that its removal at the last stage of the operation prior to signature was not sufficient to validate the breach. Second, the court found the successful tender had not been made in conformity with the tender offer conditions. The fact that the company in charge of operations had even considered that tender breached the fundamental principle of equal treatment. The court said it was irrelevant that the EC directive on public procurement did not specifically mention the right to equal treatment for tenderers, as the obligation to respect the principle corresponded with the directive's very essence.

BAT also reported a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.81bn, with its insurance businesses offsetting a fall in tobacco profits. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said BAT had 'no present intention' of buying Victoire or having a rights issue. 'We're not going to preclude what might happen next year or the year after, but the statement means what it says,' he said. Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, said: 'It is well known that we are interested in expanding our financial services business, and we make no secret of the fact that we are looking at continental Europe. We have no wish to comment on any specific transactions.' Speculation about a bid for Victoire, worth approximately Pounds 1bn, has arisen since the group's parent, Compagnie de Suez put it up for sale. BAT's insurance business, consisting of Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar in the UK and Farmers in the US, raised full-year profits by 53 per cent from Pounds 598m to Pounds 913m. Tobacco profits, however, were hit by a price war in the US, and excluding profits from the disposal of brands the underlying fall there was 18 per cent. Mr Broughton said there were early signs of recovery in US tobacco. 'But given what happened to US margins last year, it would be a very brave or foolish man who would forecast margins in 1994.' Cigarette sales and profits were lower in continental Europe. Tobacco profits in Australia, Hong Kong and south and central America also fell. Sir Patrick said the group performance 'demonstrated the resilience of our strategy, with a year of exceptional difficulty for tobacco offset by firm recovery in financial services'. The improvement in insurance was achieved despite heavier than expected provisions for mortgage indemnity business. Provisions for discontinued operations amounted to Pounds 143m, against Pounds 145m in 1992. Losses from Eagle Star's domestic mortgage indemnity business of Pounds 99m rose from Pounds 69m, but overall general insurance underwriting losses - on so-called continuing operations - fell to Pounds 142m from Pounds 280m. BAT's shares rose 16p to 485p. Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 25   Companies:-  BAT Industries.     Groupe Victoire.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     FRZ  France, EC.

A new law, published in local newspapers yesterday, appeared to contain provisions outlawing tobacco advertising that are more restrictive than those in many western countries. The law, due to come into effect in February, will ban tobacco advertising in films, television, newspapers and magazines. Advertising is also 'forbidden' in waiting rooms, theatres and cinemas, conference halls and sports venues. The Chinese smoke one-third of the world's cigarettes and the prospects of continued growth in the market have attracted foreign makers, facing flagging markets in the west. In Beijing, the representative of a leading tobacco company said the law appeared highly restrictive, but the company would seek clarification. Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco of the US, and Rothmans International of the UK have established manufacturing joint ventures in China, and other companies are exporting. All are operating in an industry dominated by China's state tobacco monopoly, which has 96 per cent of the market and is reputedly the world's biggest cigarette producer. One British manufacturer said that restrictions could make it harder for foreign companies to woo smokers away from Chinese brands. Companies have been spending heavily on advertising in China. Philip Morris, through its Marlboro brand, sponsors the national soccer league, and others are also active in the sporting arena. Cigarette advertising on hoardings is also widespread, although whether it will survive the new law is not clear. Tobacco industry representatives attribute the new law to China's desire to bring itself into line with international standards. Interest among foreign companies in China market is understandable, given the numbers involved. A survey last year by the State Statistical Bureau showed 298m people over the age of 15, nearly 35 per cent of the population, smoke. However, China has been reluctant to expose the lucrative state monopoly to foreign competition. and has made entry difficult for foreign companies. Heavy restrictions are placed on imports of cigarettes, through high tariffs and other barriers, but this has not stopped a flood of foreign imports. In 1990, a Chinese newspaper estimated that less than 1 per cent of foreign cigarettes on sale in China had passed through customs - the rest were smuggled.

0,FT944-11496 ,"FT944-11496 _AN-EKFAUADYFT 941105   FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets: BAT awaits their judgment - The Bottom Line      By RODERICK ORAM   A ruthless octogenarian, Judge Milton Pollack, stands between BAT Industries and a higher rating of its shares. On December 5 in New York City he will open the trial sought by the US Federal Trade Commission to block BAT's Dollars 1bn purchase of American Tobacco. After a near-trebling of BAT's third quarter US tobacco profits, reported this week, investors are in no doubt about the importance of cigarettes to BAT. The story was repeated around the world with a strong resurgence in Brazil and booming UK exports, particularly to eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and the far east. Tobacco trading profits were up 13 per cent to Pounds 920m in the nine months ended September. In contrast, financial services contributed Pounds 674m, up 3 per cent, to group trading profits. This division has its own problems ranging from investigations by UK regulators of the personal pension industry, rising claims from last year's San Francisco earthquake and falling investment income at Eagle Star in the UK. 'We've scored a unique regulatory double,' Martin Broughton, group chief executive, said unveiling the results. Any expense from compensating individuals poorly advised to buy a pension from BAT's Allied Dunbar or Eagle Star subsidiaries is likely to be minor, analysts estimate. Greater investor concern is focused on Allied Dunbar's style. Although well run and growing its profits, it is still cold calling and paying only commissions to sales staff while many of its competitors are moving to salaried, less aggressive techniques. The tobacco hurdle is higher. Buying American Tobacco from American Brands would push BAT's US market share from 11 per cent to 18 per cent, third behind Philip Morris with some 46 per cent and RJR Nabisco with 28 per cent. The FTC argues that American Tobacco's loss of independence would remove a price 'maverick' from the market and make it easier for the remaining companies to collude on prices. BAT argues that the deal will make it a stronger number three and, anyway, the Supreme Court ruled several years ago that collusion was impossible and BAT competed keenly on price. Judge Pollack, the bane of lawyers in the Drexel Burnham Lambert bankruptcy and other high profile cases, will decide the issue. Observers say he is quick of mind and court action, crusty, independent and unlikely to take bureaucrats' arguments at face value. Moreover, the FTC has lost roughly half the anti-trust cases it has taken to court in the past 17 years. Losing American Tobacco would be a blow to BAT. It would forego the cost savings, added marketing clout and brand synergies the deal would bring. But its existing US business is performing well and abroad BAT is benefitting from a brands swap it agreed previously with American Tobacco. BAT is the most international of cigarette companies. Global consumption fell by 0.5 per cent a year between 1988 and 1993, according to Diana Temple of Salomon Brothers. But for every market declining, another beckons as it opens up to foreign cigarettes. The most enticing is China, accounting for one-third of the world's cigarettes. On one hand the government is trying to curb consumption but on the other it is opening the market. BAT has about half the imports which account for roughly 5 per cent of consumption. Its weakness, though, is it lacks a local venture unlike Philip Morris, RJR and Rothmans International. Encouraged by the third quarter results, analysts raised their full-year pre-tax forecasts a notch to around Pounds 2bn against last year's Pounds 1.8bn. But thanks to rising tax and minorities, they left earnings per share unchanged at around 40p versus 38.5p. The best part is the yield of around 6 per cent with a bigger payout to come at the year end. An all clear from the judge would remove a cloud over BAT's shares and let investors focus on the wider tobacco potential around the world. But for real value, the bulls say, the tobacco and financial services arms should be floated separately. That, however, is a judgment BAT seems reluctant to make.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.

The brewers - which last night delightedly welcomed their first Budget relief for five years - had mounted a powerful campaign to persuade the chancellor that any increase in beer duty, after the 1.5p a pint rise in March, would increase the damage already being done to the industry by cross-Channel shopping. The increase in personal imports of duty-paid beer from France is already estimated to account for about 12 per cent of the UK's take-home market; equivalent to about 700,000 barrels a year or the output of a large brewery. Loss of revenue to the Treasury this year is expected to amount to Pounds 130m on legitimate imports alone - but smuggling is also believed to be growing. The brewers warned that any increase in beer prices above those prevailing in Continental Europe would further stimulate cross-Channel trade. They claimed, too, that continual increases in duty, up by 31 per cent in real terms since 1979, had contributed to the 25 per cent decline in beer sales through pubs during the same period. Beer duties had already been increased twice this year - by 5 per cent in the March Budget and by a further 2.7 per cent from a change in the duty collection system in June which the government had promised would be fiscally neutral. The chancellor acknowledged the strength of these arguments yesterday. The chancellor's St Andrew's Day decision to continue the standstill on spirits duty introduced in March was welcomed by the Scotch Whisky Association. The 2p increase on a bottle of wine, however, was dubbed as 'irresponsible' by the Wine and Spirits Association. It would lead to increased cross-Channel shopping to the detriment of UK retailers, it said. Cross-channel imports also weighed less heavily than health factors in the chancellor's treatment of cigarettes. The Tobacco Advisory Council described the 11p per packet increase, on top of a 10p increase in March, as 'outrageous.' It added: 'The country's 17m smokers, who already pay Pounds 23m a day in tobacco taxes, are being used to make up the Treasury's shortfall.' ASH, the anti-smoking organisation, welcomed the decision as 'very helpful to health'. It could reduce demand for cigarettes by 2bn a year and eventually save 2,500 lives a year.

A judge ruled that up to 60,000 present and former flight attendants could together sue US tobacco companies for health difficulties they said had been caused by inhaling passengers' cigarette smoke. It is the first time illness caused by secondhand smoke has been accepted as grounds for a class action lawsuit. Mr Stanley Rosenblatt, the flight attendants' lawyer, said compensation and punitive damages for all 60,000 plaintiffs might total in excess of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3bn). Today, in a court in New Orleans, lawyers representing tens of millions of present and former smokers seek to bring a class action against the tobacco industry claiming compensation for nicotine addiction. In yet another type of case to be heard next Monday, tobacco manufacturers will try to fend off a lawsuit from the State of Mississippi in which the state attorney-general is demanding compensation for the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses under public assistance programmes such as Medicaid. Other states are bringing similar suits. The flight attendants suing in Miami are employed by various US airlines. They do not smoke, but say they were exposed to passengers' cigarette fumes before the US banned smoking on most domestic flights in 1989. US cigarette manufacturers say passive smoking has not been proved to cause any illness, but last year the Environmental Protection Agency, a US government body, declared that secondhand smoke was carcinogenic. Judge Robert Kaye of the Circuit Court for Dade County originally turned down the attendants' request to proceed as a group, but in March a state appeal court overruled his decision. Some tobacco companies were considering an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court. They were also taking comfort from a footnote to Judge Kaye's decision in which the judge said he was 'deeply concerned with the issue of causation'. RJ Reynolds Tobacco, part of the RJR Nabisco tobacco and food group, said that indicated that the judge felt individual trials would still be needed for each flight attendant to establish the precise cause of their illness and the appropriate level of damages. 'As we have argued, thousands of separate trials to decide those facts defeats the purpose of handling these claims as a class action,' RJ Reynolds said.

0,FT942-1986 ,"FT942-1986 _AN-EFVDUAAFFT 940622   FT  22 JUN 94 / BAT unit accused of boosting nicotine in tobacco      By JEREMY KAHN and TONY JACKSON      WASHINGTON, LONDON   The US subsidiary of Britain's BAT Industries is using a genetically engineered form of tobacco with high nicotine content in some of its cigarettes. Brown  Williamson Tobacco publicly admitted the use of the high-nicotine tobacco yesterday after Mr David Kessler, head of the US Food and Drug Administration, accused it in Washington of secretly developing the strain. Mr Kessler told a House of Representatives sub-committee that officials at BW had instructed contract researchers who helped create the genetically altered tobacco plant, code-named Y-1, to mislead his agency about its existence. He said Y-1, which is grown in Brazil, contained more than twice the nicotine found in normal tobacco plants. Nicotine, a toxic substance, is a stimulant in small doses and is also addictive. Mr Kessler's accusation is the latest in a series of potentially damaging charges against the tobacco industry. The House sub-committee is seeking to determine whether the FDA can legally regulate tobacco as a drug. The FDA chief also said some chemicals on a list of tobacco additives released by six cigarette manufacturers in April were used to increase nicotine levels. Tobacco companies, for example, routinely added ammonia to cigarettes as an 'impact booster', doubling the amount of nicotine a smoker inhales. Mr Kessler said: 'The findings lay to rest any notion that there is no manipulation and control of nicotine undertaken in the tobacco industry.' BW officials admitted privately to the FDA last week that this high-nicotine tobacco had been used in its Raleigh, Richland and Viceroy brands, according to Mr Kessler. Those were 'distributed nationally in 1993'. BW said last night that Y-1 had been originally developed by the US Department of Agriculture in the late 1970s, in an attempt to find a tobacco that would yield less tar for a given amount of nicotine. The company had taken up the work and applied unsuccessfully for a patent for Y-1 in 1991. It said the brands in which Y-1 was used represented less than 0.5 per cent of the total US market last year. Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive, said last night that cigarettes containing Y-1 had proved unpopular and had been largely withdrawn. Mr Kessler said yesterday that 'several million pounds' of Y-1 tobacco was currently stored in warehouses in the US and could be used at any time.

Domestic Marketing Assessment and Required Purchases of Tobacco (723.503 and 723.504)         Section 320C(c) of the Act provides that if the quantity of imported tobacco used by a domestic manufacturer for making cigarettes for the year exceeds 25 percent, such manufacturer must pay a domestic marketing assessment on each pound of imported tobacco used in excess of 25 percent. In addition, as provided in section 320C(d) and (e), such manufacturer must purchase tobacco from the existing burley and flue-cured tobacco inventories of producer owned cooperative marketing associations in an amount equal to the weight of imported tobacco used in excess of 25 percent.     The per pound domestic marketing assessment rate set by section 320C(c) is the difference between one-half the sum of the average market prices received by domestic producers of burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco, respectively, and the average price of unmanufactured imported tobacco. Domestically produced burley and flue-cured tobaccos are marketed on a marketing year basis. The average price per pound paid to domestic producers for a kind of tobacco is determined for the marketing year. The marketing years are: for burley tobacco, October 1 through September 30; and for flue-cured tobacco, July 1 through June 30. Under the proposed rule, the average prices for domestically produced burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco would be calculated using data published by the Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). For the other side of the comparison, a weighted average price of all unmanufactured tobacco imported for consumption in the United States, with no allowance for tobacco reexported, would be calculated from Bureau of Census data. For example, if the calculated average market prices were $1.83 per pound for burley tobacco and $1.73 per pound for flue-cured tobacco, the average price would be $1.78 per pound. If the weighted average price of unmanufactured imported tobacco for the relevant period was $1.28 per pound, a domestic marketing assessment rate of $0.50 per pound would apply. That rate would be multiplied by the pounds of imported tobacco used in excess of the 25 percent limit (unless a higher limit had been set under the Secretary's discretionary authority to adjust the limit as provided for in section 320C(f)). If noncompliance is indicated, the cigarette manufacturer will have an opportunity for an administrative hearing before any domestic marketing assessments or other sanctions are imposed. Under the proposed rule payment of the assessment would be required to be made within 30 days after the manufacturer is notified of the amount due.     Where a domestic content violation has occurred, the compensatory purchases of tobacco by a manufacturer, as required by section 320C(d) and (e), must be in equal quantities of burley and flue-cured tobacco and must be from the inventories of producer owned cooperative marketing associations that handle price support loans for tobacco. However, the statute provides that if the total required compensatory purchases by all noncomplying manufacturers would reduce the associations inventories of loan stocks of burley or flue-cured tobacco below the reserve stock level for the respective kind of tobacco, the required purchase of such kind of tobacco, for each manufacturer, may be reduced proportionately. These provisions of section 320C would be implemented by   723.504 of the proposed rule. The required purchases of burley tobacco could be made from either of the two producer owned marketing associations for burley tobacco: the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association and the Burley Stabilization Corporation. There is only one applicable producer association for flue-cured tobacco, the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation. Under the proposed rule, required purchases of tobacco must be at the applicable list price published by the association without discounts of any kind. The manufacturer would be allowed to make such purchases from any grade or grades of uncommitted tobacco in the association's inventories. Compensatory purchases of tobacco would be required to be made within 30 days after the manufacturer is notified of the quantities of burley and flue-cured tobacco that must be purchased. However, the time could be extended if the manufacturer requests reconsideration of the compensatory purchase determination. As provided in sections 320C (d) and (e) of the statute, if a manufacturer fails to make the required compensatory purchases in a timely manner, the manufacturer, under the proposed rule, would be subject to a penalty of 75 percent of the average market price for the applicable kind of tobacco for the most recent marketing year multiplied by the quantity of tobacco involved. Further, as provided in sections 320C(d)(5) and (e)(5), these compensatory purchases could not be counted by the manufacturer for purchases in the application of section 320B of the 1938 Act.

0," FR940426-1-00041   FR940426-1-00006        Proposed Regulations        The proposed amendments and additions to the regulations on the subject of exclusion follow a framework which ATF believes is consistent with the statutory interpretation of exclusion adopted by the     Fedway     court as well as similar concerns previously raised in     Foremost Sales Promotions, Inc.     v.     Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,     860 F.2d 229 (7th Cir. 1988) (    Foremost    ). The courts in both     Fedway     and     Foremost     found that ``exclusion'' as used in the FAA Act cannot occur without a relationship or arrangement between the industry member and the retailer which directly or indirectly threatens the retailer's independence.    ATF proposes to amend regulatory parts of title 27 CFR relating to exclusive outlet (part 8), tied-house (part 6), and commercial bribery (part 10), by adding new subparts on exclusion. Even though the exclusive outlet provision was not involved in the     Fedway     or     Foremost     decisions, the provision is impacted by the decisions since the provision requires the showing of exclusion in order for a violation to arise.    ATF proposes to describe exclusion, in whole or in part, of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages sold or offered for sale by others as occurring (1) when a practice places retailer independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the industry member and retailer or by any other means of industry control over the retailer, and (2) such a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, or through an affiliate, results in the retailer purchasing less that it otherwise would have of a competitor's product. The proposed regulations will contain a set of criteria by which ATF will determine the existence of the first element. These criteria include the duration of the practice or promotion, the degree to which a practice involves an industry member in the day-to-day operations of a retailer, and, in some cases, the non-discrimination feature of the practice where it is available to all retailers. Exclusion will exist when ATF can establish the presence of both of these elements.    In addition, ATF proposes to identify certain practices which it believes, by their very existence, place retailer independence at risk. When such practices are undertaken, ATF would determine through the course of an investigation whether the other exclusionary element set forth above is present.    In addition, ATF proposes to revise and consolidate several of the provisions contained in Subpart D of Part 6 of the current regulations which find that certain practices will not result in exclusion under the FAA Act (that is, safe harbors). The classification of these practices is intended to provide guidance to the regulated industry so that legitimate product marketing programs can be developed without the uncertainty of a potential Federal enforcement action. Legitimate product marketing encourages competition, by large and small businesses alike, on the basis of price, product quality and service.    ATF emphasizes that the revision of the trade practices regulations is an ongoing process. Any interested person may petition for a rule change, under 27 CFR 71.41(c).        Exclusive Outlet        Section 105(a) of the FAA Act makes it unlawful for an industry member to require, by agreement or otherwise, any retailer engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages to purchase any such product from such person to the exclusion in whole or in part of alcoholic beverages sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce, provided one of the three interstate or foreign commerce jurisdictional clauses is met.    Retailer independence is threatened in an exclusive outlet arrangement when the ability of the retailer to decide which brands of alcoholic beverages to purchase is restricted or impeded. In the     Fedway     context, the question is whether any restriction negates the retailer's free economic choice or has been imposed by the industry member.    In that regard, the proposed regulations identify two practices that clearly result in exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act. The first practice involves purchases of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages by a retailer as a result, directly or indirectly, of a threat or act of physical or economic harm by the selling industry member. The second practice involves contracts between an industry member and a retailer which require the retailer to purchase distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages from that industry member and expressly restrict the retailer from purchasing, in whole or in part, such products from another industry member. In both situations, exclusion of a competitor's products results directly from the arrangement or the contract without any action by the retailer. Further, ATF views an exclusive outlet arrangement as including a situation where the retailer offers exclusivity privileges and the industry member accepts that offer. In other words, it does not matter whether the requirement originates with the industry member or the retailer; rather, the requirement is within the exclusive outlet prohibition so long as it is part of the bargain.        Tied-House        Section 105(b) of the FAA Act makes it unlawful for an industry member to induce through any of the following means, any retailer engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages to purchase any such products from such person to the exclusion in whole or in part of alcoholic beverages sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce, provided one of the three jurisdictional clauses is met:    (1) By acquiring or holding any interest in any license with respect to the premises of the retailer; or               "," FR940426-1-00041   FR940426-1-00006        Proposed Regulations        The proposed amendments and additions to the regulations on the subject of exclusion follow a framework which ATF believes is consistent with the statutory interpretation of exclusion adopted by the     Fedway     court as well as similar concerns previously raised in     Foremost Sales Promotions, Inc.     v.

0,FT932-16913 ,"FT932-16913 _AN-DDDAIAAAFT 930403   FT  03 APR 93 / Marlboro cut points to price war in US      By MARTIN DICKSON      NEW YORK   PHILIP MORRIS declared an all-out price war in the US tobacco industry yesterday by slashing the price of its Marlboro brand to protect its market share from the rise of discount brands. The cut in the price of America's most popular cigarette and one of the world's most valuable trademarks reductions is restricted to the US market. It is expected to have little immediate effect on Philip Morris's international operations, which include an estimated quarter-share of the European Community cigarette market. A packet of Marlboro costs on average around Dollars 2.15, nearly twice that of discount cigarettes selling at around Dollars 1.20 a pack, according to Philip Morris. Analysts think Marlboro will be cut by about 40 cents, or nearly 20 per cent, although Philip Morris declined to spell out details. The move sent the shares of tobacco companies plummeting in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At lunchtime, Philip Morris was down 20 per cent, or Dollars 13 1/4 , at Dollars 51 3/8 , while RJR Nabisco dripped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 and American Brands stood Dollars 3 3/8 lower at Dollars 30 3/8 . In London, BAT's share price tumbled 71p to 928p on exceptionally heavy turnover as traders feared that the move could dent the UK group's profits. Philip Morris, which is the American cigarette market leader with an estimated 43 per cent share, said it expected operating earnings from its US tobacco business to be down as much as 40 per cent in 1993 because of its new strategy. Mr James Johnston, chairman of RJR Reynolds Tobacco, the second largest US tobacco company, with a 28 per cent market share, said it intended to remain fully competitive and would take 'appropriate action' to protect its market share. The move follows a gradual erosion of Marlboro's brand share, which dropped to around 24.5 per cent of the US market in 1992 from 25.8 per cent in 1991 as smokers have switched to cheaper branded cigarettes and generic varieties with no brand image. Philip Morris, which belatedly entered the discount market two years ago, has become a big player in the sector, rivalling RJR Reynolds for market leadership. Philip Morris said its shift in Marlboro strategy was designed to 'grow market share rather than pursue rapid income growth rates which might erode our leading market place position.'

The government-funded Health Education Authority suggested that BBC viewers of sporting events last year could have watched 'tobacco company or brand images for up to 25 minutes of every hour of transmission' - equivalent to as many as 50 30-second tobacco advertisements an hour. The report suggests that tobacco companies have discovered an attractive commercial deal: whereas paid-for television advertising could cost some Pounds 1 1/2 m an hour, tobacco-sponsored televised sport amounts to some 300 hours annually on the BBC, with just Pounds 5m spent by the companies on sponsoring events. Cigarette advertising on television was banned in the UK in 1965. That ban was extended to include all tobacco advertising last October when the government acted on the 1989 EC broadcasting directive. The EC council of health ministers is due to meet soon to consider a draft directive to ban all forms of tobacco advertising. The authority's report highlights the means by which tobacco sponsors spread their message on BBC broadcasts. Placing tobacco company and brand names of boards in key positions. Putting company logos on sport participants. Visual and verbal references to sponsors in commentaries and studio event-title shots. Echoing the company colours and brand names in other features of the event, such as umbrellas or refreshment stands. The BBC said that its policy on sponsorship was subject to 'very strict guidelines', particularly in the case of events sponsored by tobacco companies. The guidelines went beyond the voluntary code agreed by the government and the Tobacco Advisory Council, which lays down the number of shots of posters, logos and other promotional items. The BBC said the authority's recommendation that it should cease covering tobacco-sponsored events would 'conflict with our obligations to our licence-payers'.

But Dollars 1.2bn of restructuring and other charges dragged the group into loss. The higher sales were supported by products such as Axid, Humatrope, Prozac and Vancocin, the company said. Sales of Ceclor, an antibiotic which is Lilly's second-biggest product after Prozac, the anti-depressant, declined slightly during the year, it added. Due to previously announced charges, the company reported a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 523.6m, or Dollars 1.77 a share. Excluding one-off items, net income would have risen to Dollars 332.4m, or Dollars 1.14, from Dollars 311.1m, or Dollars 1.06, a year ago, when Lilly took restructuring charges of Dollars 46.1m pre-tax. Like other companies, Lilly has experienced a slow-down in the US market. Sales there last year grew by 4 per cent, held back by 'downward pressure on prices resulting from Medicaid rebates, which increased to Dollars 156m, and greater participation in managed care programmes'. Sales outside the US grew by 6 per cent, taking overall sales up 5 per cent to Dollars 6.5bn. Pharmaceuticals accounted for Dollars 4.75bn, up 7 per cent, and medical devices and diagnostics - earmarked for disposal - for Dollars 1.25bn, up 4 per cent.

A statement from the administration said aid would be concentrated on the poorest 50 countries, which received three-quarters of bilateral aid in 1993-94. 'Aid for the poorest countries in Africa and Asia and the provision of know-how to countries in transition remain particular priorities for the ODA's work,' it said. The statement was disputed, however, by the World Development Movement which recently won a High Court challenge over the funding of the controversial Pergau Dam in Malaysia. It said the channeling of more aid through Europe and to commercially tied projects would leave fewer funds for poverty-focused country-to-country aid. Ms Harriet Lamb, development movement campaign officer, said Africa in particular would suffer as, on the ODA's own calculations, the percentage of total British aid to Africa was set to fall from 14.4 per cent in 1994-95 to 12.1 per cent in 1997. Mr Ben Jackson, the movement's campaigns co-ordinator, complained that the chancellor had had to stump up Britain's share of the Edinburgh summit's commitment to increase European aid by 60 per cent by the end of the decade. He said: 'Unlike some of his European counterparts, he has failed to match this promise with extra funding for the overall aid budget. 'Britain is punching well below its weight as an aid giver. This will mean biting cuts in Britain's aid for long-term development programmes essential for the world's poor.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT944-3264 ,"FT944-3264 _AN-ELNEAADSFT 941214   FT  14 DEC 94 / The strong whiff of trouble: The US tobacco industry is facing a wave of potentially ruinous lawsuits, says Richard Tomkins      By RICHARD TOMKINS   Should cigarette manufacturers be made to pay for the harm smoking does to people? Many believe justice would be better served if they were  - perhaps nowhere more than in the US, where the anti-tobacco lobby is strong and litigation is a national industry. Even so, US courts have proved stubbornly unsympathetic to the idea. Over the past 40 years, some 700 lawsuits have been lodged against US tobacco companies by people claiming damage to their health from smoking. None has ultimately succeeded, and no cigarette maker has paid a cent in damages. Now, however, the tobacco industry is facing a new wave of litigation. On Monday, a court in Miami ruled that non-smoking flight attendants could sue US cigarette makers for health problems caused by passive smoking. Worse, in two much bigger cases to be heard in the US over the next few days, lawyers will be trying out new types of claims against cigarette manufacturers which, if successful, could prove financially ruinous. The main reason earlier attempts to sue the tobacco industry have failed is straightforward. In nearly every case, juries have concluded that the health hazards associated with smoking are so well known that anyone taking up the habit automatically accepts the risks. One notable exception came in 1988 when a jury awarded damages of Dollars 400,000 to the family of Rose Cipollone, a smoker who died after getting lung cancer. However, the award was overturned in a federal appeal court in 1990, and the family, faced with the formidable legal costs of a case that had lasted seven years, gave up the struggle. That case illustrated another big difficulty of taking on the US tobacco industry: cigarette makers, with their vast financial resources, can easily outgun lone plaintiffs represented by small law firms. Anti-smoking activists accuse the tobacco industry of waging a war of attrition on its opponents, citing an internal memorandum written by a lawyer working for RJ Reynolds Tobacco in 1988. 'To paraphrase General Patton, the way we won these cases was not by spending all of Reynolds' money, but by making that other son-of-a-bitch spend all his,' the note said. Yet both difficulties  - the assumption of risk and the costs of legal action  - could be overcome in a case due to be heard in a federal court in New Orleans today. The Castano case  - named after Dianne Castano, one of the five plaintiffs  -does not seek compensation for health damage caused by smoking. Instead, it seeks compensation for addiction to nicotine. The plaintiffs want each US cigarette company to refund all the money they have spent on cigarettes, meet the cost of health monitoring for addiction-related problems, compensate them for emotional distress and pay punitive damages. The plaintiffs are also backed by big money. Some 60 law firms have formed a consortium to pursue the case in an attempt to turn it into a class action that will pursue similar claims for millions of present, former and deceased US smokers reaching back 50 years. Each firm has undertaken to invest up to Dollars 100,000 a year in the case, providing total backing of Dollars 6m a year  - easily enough to fight the cigarette manufacturers. Paradoxically, this fresh approach comes at a time when the political pressure on cigarette companies has died down. The Republicans' crushing victory in last month's mid-term elections has produced a Congress much less inclined to attack the tobacco industry with tighter regulations and increased taxes. Further, the cigarette manufacturers' arch-foe  - Representative Henry Waxman, the Californian Democrat who chairs the House subcommittee on health and the environment  - is to lose his position in January. This will end a series of hearings in which chief executives of US tobacco companies have repeatedly been hauled before the subcommittee to answer hard-hitting questions about their industry's activities. The change in the political climate, however, has not erased the memories of events earlier in the year when internal tobacco industry documents were leaked to the media and Mr Waxman's committee. Together, these documents built up a picture of an industry that not only knew of the addictive and carcinogenic properties of cigarettes, but had concealed the evidence for decades. The anti-smoking lobby believes these disclosures have transformed the outlook for litigation. 'The notion that tobacco companies were innocent purveyors of an agricultural product has been changed to a more accurate notion that they are very knowledgeable and sophisticated manufacturers of an addictive drug,' says Mr Richard Daynard, chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Boston's Northeastern University. The disclosures have not only prompted the Castano case, but encouraged a second type of litigation now being brought against cigarette manufacturers. Two US states  - Florida and Mississippi  - are suing the tobacco industry for the costs of treating smoking-related diseases under public assistance programmes (notably Medicaid). The Mississippi case reaches a crucial stage next Monday when a state judge hears arguments about what defences the tobacco industry should be allowed to deploy. The state cases are clever because they seek to avoid complex arguments about whether individuals knew the risks when they started smoking or which brands harmed their health. Their sentiment is: Smoking has cost us (in Florida's case) Dollars 1.2bn in Medicaid payments over the last five years. We want our money back. Liability for damages would be split between the cigarette manufacturers according to their market share. The tobacco industry says the states have some nerve: after all, they collect far more in cigarette taxes than they pay out for the treatment of smoking-related diseases. But its main argument is that it would be unfair for states to roll up all their smoking-related medical costs into one undifferentiated sum. Before paying up, the cigarette companies say, they would have to study each person's case individually to determine whether smoking was really the cause of his or her illness and to see whether their medical costs could be fully justified. In all likelihood, they say, they would dispute the facts of every patient's case in court, so overwhelming the US judicial system. But what of today's case in New Orleans? The Castano case is a little more complex than those in Florida and Mississippi because it raises the question of nicotine addiction. Tobacco lawyers say cigarette smoking cannot be addictive because large numbers of people have given it up. By that definition, say anti-smokers, neither is heroin. The tobacco industry argues that, if smoking is addictive, then so are (for example) tea and television, yet no one until now had suggested that addiction in itself was a personal injury. Anti-smokers observe that addiction to tea and television rarely results in damage to people's health. The immediate issue in the Castano case, however, is whether the case can be turned into a class action. As in the state lawsuits, the tobacco industry says it is vigorously opposed to lumping individuals together as every smoker's case differs. The industry's lawyers threaten that, if a class action were allowed to proceed, they would insist on a court hearing for every smoker who sought to join the class and dispute his or her entitlement to membership. The result  - as in the state cases  - would be to overwhelm the US judicial system. For the tobacco industry, the stakes are high. If it were defeated in this new wave of litigation and had to meet all the claims that followed, the bill would make the Dollars 10bn so far paid out to victims of asbestos-related diseases look like petty cash. Would the courts dare do it? Tobacco companies say it would make no sense for society to condone the manufacture and sale of cigarettes but penalise the tobacco industry when people smoked them. A decision against the tobacco industry would also set a disturbing precedent for manufacturers of other products carrying health risks, such as high-fat foods and alcoholic drinks. But times change, and the fact that cigarette makers have triumphed in the courts for the last 40 years does not make the outcome of the latest litigation any more predictable.

The gains for many developing countries may be proportionally even greater. Developing countries will gain from the rise in world income for all the reasons outlined by Mr Blackhurst. But they have an additional interest because this round has for the first time included two sectors, agriculture and textiles and clothing, that did not benefit from the reductions in barriers achieved by other goods in previous rounds. These sectors are those of greatest interest to developing countries, which are seeking to sustain export expansion without succumbing to 'jobless growth'. On the basis of the Dunkel Draft settlement, the Overseas Development Institute (in The Gatt Uruguay Round: Effects on Developing Countries) has estimated that the effects from these net export gains alone would be at least 3 per cent of the value of their exports (equivalent to Dollars 25bn), and could well be twice that. These figures in turn could be doubled by effects from the income gains to their industrial country trading partners, and the wage advantage for export production over local markets is probably even greater for them. This explains why so many developing countries are participating fully in the Uruguay round negotiations for the first time. They have viewed the recent US-EC stand-off on agricultural protection with irritation at being treated as bystanders at what they hope will be a feast for all.

In a sport-mad country the ban - which comes into effect in 1995 - is a serious matter. The state of Tasmania has said it may defy it, arguing that it is unfair to deprive sports bodies of so much cash. Indeed, tobacco groups - which since 1976 have been prevented from conventional advertising - contribute an estimated ADollars 20m (Pounds 8.5m) a year towards the total ADollars 120m sport sponsorship market. The Confederation of Australian Sport is hoping to persuade the federal government to set up a health fund paid from a levy on tobacco sales. Some states already have such a scheme: Victoria has paid about ADollars 25m over three years in 'Quit' sponsorship. Sports associations are finding other ways of fighting back: lobby group the NSW Sports Federation has called for blacklisting of companies that use sport in their advertising without contributing to it. Alcohol companies fear they may be next in line, but Ros Kelly, the sports minister, says she has no plans for further bans. She argues that there is no safe level of nicotine intake, whereas moderate drinking may even be good for you. Tobacco sponsorship is already restricted in many EC countries: it is banned in Portugal and Italy, while in France tobacco advertising and sponsorship are due to be phased out by 1993. This is expected to cost the motor racing alone some FFr350m (Pounds 35m) a year. Tobacco companies in the UK spend Pounds 7m a year on sponsorship, particularly of sport. Since the UK banned tobacco advertising on television, sponsorship has become more important. However, the practice is increasingly controversial: the BBC was recently criticised by the Health Education Authority for allowing back-door tobacco advertising worth the equivalent of some Pounds 200m annually. It claimed that by strategically placing tobacco logos in sponsored sporting events, the industry got television coverage without paid-for advertising.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "

Sales of passenger cars fell by 6.1 percent to 259,249,  while  those of trucks declined 7.4 percent to 111,801, the Japan  Automobile Dealers Association said.    Bus sales fell 21.5 percent from a year earlier to 1,705.    Of the passenger cars, sales of cars with engine capacity of  more than 2 liters grew for the first time in six months, rising  1.2 percent to 51,782.    Sales of passenger cars with engine sizes ranging from 660  cc  to 2000 cc fell 7.8 percent to 207,467, continuing the decline  that started in April last year.    All the major automakers except Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.  saw sales dropping.    Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest automaker, saw its sales  in April fall 7.0 percent from a year earlier, while No. 2  Nissan Motor Co. registered a 16.3 percent decline, and Honda  Motor Co. an 18.4 percent drop.    In contrast, imported car sales jumped 45.0 percent from  April last year to 24,253 vehicles, the association said.    Fuji enjoyed a 55.3 percent rise in sales due to its  ""Legacy""  model which was popular following the renewal of its type last  year.    In March, the decline in overall sales shrank to 3.8  percent,  and hopes have spread in the auto industry that sales figures  would recover, particularly with the reduction of the car  consumption tax from 4.5 percent to 3 percent in April.    However, the companies went too far in March in discounting  auto prices ahead of the consumption tax cut and the fall in  April was a natural response to the boost in sales during March,  said an official at the association.    ""I'm afraid a recovery might be delayed until the latter  part  of this year,"" the official said.     "

Nevertheless, he said he neither  rules out nor disregards Mexico's serious problems.    He denied this movement is a ""flight of capital."" The  phrase, he said, is currently being used to describe an  uncontrolled departure of people afraid of losing their assets,  which they try to protect at all costs.

""We have additional problems, and this brings about  adjustments. I cannot predict the extent and duration of those  adjustments. I can only say that, fortunately, those stock  market fluctuations never last long.""    Asked whether there is any connection between a recurring  drop in the stock exchange indexes and the country's  pre-electoral situation, Sales replied that many factors are  involved in this situation. ""To deny the influence of any one  of them would be like trying to shield the sun with one finger.  To regard the effect of one of them, however, would be an  oversimplification.""    He summed up the situation by saying: ""There is indeed  instability, which I hope will be temporary. In the world's  history, however, there has not been one single permanent  downward trend.

0,FT944-15697 ,"FT944-15697 _AN-EJQD5AFAFT 941017   FT  17 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Japanese flop sparks pricing rethink - International      By WILLIAM DAWKINS   Japan's finance ministry is rethinking how to price equity offerings, as the result of what could become a costly hitch to its latest privatisation, that of Japan Tobacco, the state monopoly cigarette maker. The ministry is under fire from both Japanese and foreign securities houses over the second privatisation issue to go wrong since the introduction of tough new rules on the conduct of equity offerings at the end of the 1980s. An embarrassed ministry announced on Friday that there were no buyers for more than 65 per cent of the 436,666 shares allotted to small investors in Japan Tobacco. As a result, the ministry runs the risk of falling Y408bn short of the Y958bn (Dollars 9.75bn) it had hoped to raise from the share issue. The ministry is offering a total of 666,666 shares to individuals and institutions, comprising a one-third stake in the company. At the issue price of Y1.438m (Dollars 14,631) a share, Japan Tobacco is valued at Y2,876bn (Dollars 29.3bn). It is unlikely, in these circumstances, that other small investors will voluntarily take up many of the left-over shares, say brokers. Ministry officials will decide what to do on the results of a second attempt to allocate unwanted shares by lottery. The final reckoning will be on Thursday, when payments on those shares fall due. The flop increases the likelihood that Japan Tobacco's share price will fall when trading starts a week later, on October 27, unless the finance ministry keeps the unwanted shares. If the ministry fails to step in, a heavy loss could be on the way for big investors. That could destabilise an already weak equity market and guarantee a poor reception for future privatisation issues, like West Japan Railway early next year and another tranche of the already-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. Japan's equity pricing system, to be fair, does serve the purpose for which it was designed. It stops companies on the way to the market from covertly handing out cheap shares to friends in high places, as was the case in the late 1980s Recruit shares for favours scandal, which provoked the rule change. In drawing up the new rules for pricing shares, the finance ministry took its inspiration for the auction system it has used for many years to sell government bonds. The result produces a system very different from that normally used for international share sales. One third of the shares to be issued are auctioned in advance to rich individuals and institutional investors. The rest are sold by lottery to the public, at the mid-price of bids made in the auction. This drains off all the surplus institutional demand for the shares, before the issue even gets to the public, argue the system's critics, and ensures that the first few days' trading will be more likely to show a loss than in other international issues, which give advisers more scope to set the price at a level likely to stimulate the market. Big investors must pay the price they bid in the pre-offer auction, even if they are unlucky enough to have bid above the mid-price. In Japan Tobacco's case, bids accepted by the finance ministry ranged from Y1.36m a share, up to Y2.11m, probably at the top end of total bids received. 'This way, you get no after-market,' complains one foreign broker. A second problem is that the pre-offer auction risks setting a misleading price, in Japan Tobacco's case clearly higher than thousands of small investors will bear. It only reflects the valuation accorded to the shares by the biggest and richest one-third of investors, rather than the demand from all potential buyers. Japan Tobacco is not the only example of a flotation to have hit trouble under this system. Japan Telecom, a private sector long distance telephone operator, was a high profile flop only last month, despite the fact Nomura Securities priced it at a discount to the auction mid-price. Mass selling orders for JR East, a privatisation issue, made the stock exchange's computers break down and hit the whole market last October. Foreign lobbyists, like the European Business Council, have for years been urging the finance ministry to adopt something like the book-building system of pricing shares, used in most international equity issues. This would reduce the mathematical distortions of the Japanese system, it is argued. The finance ministry does not usually cave in easily to outside pressure. But it has a clear self-interest in ensuring a smooth reception for future attempts to raise government revenue from privatisations, at a time when its tax revenues are short of target.

0,FT931-1202 ,"FT931-1202 _AN-DCZBZABGFT 930326   FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (6): Investors' two-way traffic - While some foreign companies move in, others call it a day      By KHOZEM MERCHANT   THE general investment climate has improved over the past 18 months. Foreign companies are permitted to be 100 per cent owners of local subsidiaries, and import tariffs and corporation tax have been cut. However, the record is mixed. While some foreign companies have been expanding their operations in Bangladesh, others, especially drug companies, have been leaving. Among the exodus are Philips, the Anglo-Dutch consumer electronics group, and NCR, the US computer company. Drug companies, including Imperial Chemical Industries and Fisons of the UK and Pfizer and Squibb of the US, have pulled out partly because of a government policy banning the manufacture of some 1,700 generic drugs by multinationals leaving the market free for local companies. Squibb, having decided to sell out to local interests, finally shut its operations after 25 years in Bangladesh, apparently frustrated at the bureaucracy surrounding the sale. Pfizer, which has been trading in Bangladesh since 1955, employs 550 people with sales of Dollars 7m in 1990. 'The government does not seem to be concerned,' says Mr Syed Kabir, Pfizer's managing director. However, other companies are more encouraged. One move which has produced immediate benefits for foreign companies has been the relaxation on rules governing technical agreements. Previously foreign companies were not allowed to pay for technology transfer with foreign currency. This shift has produced tangible improvements at Bangladesh Tobacco company, part of UK tobacco group BAT. 'Product development is simply not possible here. That's why these relaxed conditions on technical exchanges are so vital. It has enabled us to benefit from the results of leaf research at head office in the UK, invite marketing expertise over and improve the factory,' says Mr Malcolm Fry, BTC's managing director. Lever Brothers, a Unilever subsidiary with a Pounds 25m turnover in toiletries, is also optimistic. It is looking to snap up the interests of one departing drugs company. 'We see no reason for panic because the government is introducing a degree of reality,' says Mr Ian Sangster, chairman. Nestle, the Swiss chocolate group, is also upgrading its operations, from agency to manufacturing in a joint collaboration with a local company. The biggest concentration of foreign companies is at the 400-acre Chittagong Export Processing Zone, where some 57 foreign and local companies with a collective investment of about Dollars 98m have been attracted by a 10-year tax holiday, purpose-built factories and non-union staff. A second 38-acre export zone in Dhaka is due to come on stream next month. A third is planned. Companies in the export zones escape the stifling red tape that remains the bane of industry and business.   Countries:-  BDZ  Bangladesh, Asia.

Speaking at the function, Autonomous Regional Chairman  Gyaincain Norbu said: After meticulous and thorough  preparations, the Tibet Art Troupe will soon be leaving for  performances in Austria. The troupe is thus far Tibet's largest  cultural troupe to be dispatched for overseas performances,  serving not only as a key foreign propaganda project for Tibet,  but also a major cultural exchange program with foreign  countries. Gyaincain Norbu stated: We should, through visiting  performances, widely publicize Tibet's realities, including  political stability, economic development, social progress,  nationality solidarity, ever-enhancing living standards,  protected Zang culture, and freedom of religion achieved under  the correct central leadership and with the vigorous support of  people of all nationalities across the country in the past  40-odd years since its peaceful liberation, particularly since  launching of reform and opening up, so that more Zang  compatriots overseas and people all over the world will have a  correct and full understanding on Tibet -- a bid to project a  correct image of a new socialist Tibet to the world and to  enhance friendship between the people of the Chinese Tibet and  that of other nations through friendly exchanges.    Gyaincain Norbu said: The Tibet Art Troupe will not only  function as Chinese ambassadors responsible for conducting  cultural exchanges with foreign countries with the missions of  spreading friendship and broadening overseas publicity, but will  also be given the important responsibilities of studying,  drawing experience from, and absorbing the fine cultures of the  people of other nations. The autonomous regional party  committee and government hope that all members of the art troupe  will be united as one in completely fulfilling their glorious  and arduous missions entrusted by the party and the people of  the motherland.

Paid ""product placement"" deals, calling for brand-name merchandise to be shown  in films, are a legal and potentially large source of revenue for movie  producers.    But paying to have cigarettes placed in movies is ""a subtle technique by the  merchants of addiction to get young people to smoke,"" Rep. Tom Luken (D-Ohio)  said in introducing the bill last week. The proposed legislation is being  co-sponsored by Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Bob Whittaker (R-Kan.).    Luken also said paid    placement of cigarettes in films ""has the effect of circumventing the federal  ban on cigarette advertising on television"" when movies appear on TV.    Tobacco companies say they shy away from product placement deals precisely to  avoid charges like the one Luken made.    But in filing the bill last week, Luken, who chairs the House transportation  and hazardous materials subcommittee, said a preliminary inquiry has turned up  three instances in which cigarette makers did pay to feature their brands in  recent films.    In response to questions from Luken, Liggett Group Inc. said in a letter that  it paid $30,000 in 1983 to have its Eve cigarette brand appear in the movie  ""Supergirl"" -- although the company's policy since has been to ""not pay for  product to be used in films.""    Philip Morris Cos., the No. 1 U.S. tobacco company and maker of the Marlboro  brand that is the world's largest seller, disclosed two cases in which payments  were made to feature cigarettes in foreign-made films destined for United  States and foreign audiences. In a Feb. 24 letter, the company said these were  the only cases it had discovered ""based upon our review thus far.""    In the first case, more than $40,000 was paid in 1979 for Marlboro to appear in  ""Superman II."" And the company's Tokyo-based advertising agency agreed last  fall to pay $350,000 to showcase Lark cigarettes in ""License Revoked,"" a new  James Bond film shot primarily in Mexico. Lark is actually a Liggett brand, but  Philip Morris owns the rights to the brand overseas, including in Japan, where  the James Bond character is especially popular.    In the United States, Philip Morris said, it has been providing free cigarettes  or advertising signs for an average of 17 films per year, but without paying  cash.    Earlier this year, a Philip Morris spokesman told The Times that the company  had not paid to place its cigarettes in movies ""for at least 10 years,"" but  said he was not sure this applied to all foreign subsidiaries.    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the No. 2 cigarette maker, told Luken it does not  pay film makers to feature its brands, a policy ""we believe . . . has been  adhered to"" at least since 1982.    Frank Devaney, director of product placement at Rogers & Cowan Inc., a  public relations firm, said Reynolds ""is the one account that I don't pursue  any placements for."" He said that when film makers request cigarettes for  movies rated ""R"" or ""PG-13,"" ""I give them product and that's it. . . . If they  come to me and they want my brand, I'm certainly going to say OK.""    The issue is a sensitive one for the cigarette makers, who were helped in  decades past by a flood of endorsements from glamorous stars. The companies say  they do not target adolescents through movies or other media, and that they  advertise only to lure smokers of other brands -- not to induce non-smokers to  start.    Critics have long accused the companies of using popular entertainment to  market their brands to youth. With nearly all new smokers taking up the habit  while still in their teens, critics say the cigarette makers must target youth  to replace the 2 million smokers who annually quit or die.    An aide said Luken will press the cigarette companies for more specifics on  their product placement policies. For example, some firms that said they  currently do not pay to get their brands in movies did not provide information  back to 1979, as Luken requested.    Legislation to ban all forms of cigarette advertising and promotion went  nowhere in the last session of Congress. The Luken bill, dubbed ""The Protect  Our Children From Cigarettes Act of 1989,"" takes a less sweeping approach. It  would permit text-only advertising on billboards and in print media, with no  pictures other than the cigarette pack. However, cigarette billboards would be  banned from sports arenas, vending machine sales would be barred in places  accessible to adolescents and payments to feature cigarettes in movies would be  banned.

0,FT931-10696 ,"FT931-10696 _AN-DBGABADXFT 930206   FT  06 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: Dunhill goes back to its roots - A company that is cashing in on nostalgia      By LUCIA VAN DER POST   AT THE turn of the century London was a city of small shop keepers. Mass-production had not yet got under way and business was largely made up of small cottage industries. For historians what is fascinating is trying to identify just why some of the small cottage industries died and why others grew into hugely successful modern companies. Take Alfred Dunhill. In the late 19th century Dunhill was just a little tobacco shop, one among many. Almost all later fell by the wayside but Dunhill prospered and is now busy turning itself into a big player in the luxury goods industry. Like most successful businesses it was kick-started by a man who was intuitive enough to anticipate the way the world was going, to offer customers what they had not yet realised they wanted. Motoring, he foresaw, was going to be the coming thing and so he developed what he called the Dunhill Motorities - fine leather coats to keep out the wind, foot-muffs to warm the feet, motoring-masks, fur-lined goggles, brass lamps, picnic baskets; the ideas came thick and fast. From Motorities (which he foresaw would be less in demand once motor-cars became enclosed and warmer) he moved into an ingenious range of lighters, watches and accessories. Now that it has become fashionable for companies to look to their roots Dunhill, in its centenary year, is doing just that - affirming its spirit, celebrating its history, digging deep into the archives. It has launched an Pounds 8m advertising campaign to persuade owners of Dunhill collectables to sell them back to the company.  Already, several rare pieces have been bought but there are still some special pieces (such as the 'Dorothy' rose lighter - a marvellously kitsch design with a platinum and gold basket topped by 60 cabochon rubies for the roses) which the company longs to have. Dunhill has also been inspired to try and recreate the best of the pieces. It has started with a few key designs - the golf ball lighter, a classic of the 1930s; a marvellous short leather motoring jacket based on the Motorities coat; a range of watches inspired by a 1930s Dunhill range; and the Sylphide Lighter. Sadly, not all the designs have been recreated as finely as the originals - technology and time move on and what was expensive way back in the 1930s is almost unaffordable in the 1990s - but all have something of the original spirit. Pictured here are some of the first pieces from the new Heritage Collection, to be available in mid-March from Dunhill, 30 Duke Street, St. James's, London, SW1Y 6DL and branches.

Roche, which is in the process of completing a Dollars 5.3bn acquisition of the US pharmaceuticals group Syntex, also said yesterday that it would make a SFr230m provision against this year's pre-tax profit for a restructuring of its pharmaceuticals division. Some 5,000 jobs would be eliminated, mainly in the US. However, Roche said it still expected 1994 net income 'to show a further rise' over last year's SFr2.48bn. The rise of the Swiss franc continued to dampen revenues. Expressed in local currencies, total sales in the nine months to September 30 were up 6 per cent. In Swiss franc terms, they were flat at SFr10.7bn. The group said it 'felt the impact' of health cost containment measures taken by governments in several countries. Sales in the pharmaceuticals division, which turned downward in the second quarter, fell 4.3 per cent in the third quarter to SFr1.85bn. However, it said pharmaceuticals sales in local currencies grew significantly faster than the average for its sector in most leading countries, due to its strong position in the hospital market. The vitamins and fine chemicals division achieved a volume increase in spite of competition from low-cost suppliers from the Asia-Pacific region. Sales were down 7 per cent in the quarter at SFr780m. Sales of the diagnostics division fell 10.8 per cent in the third quarter to SFr380m, reflecting closure of some unprofitable laboratories and changes in customer payment policies. Two new applications of Roche's polymerase chain reaction technology, for detecting the hepatitis-C virus and mycobacterium tuberculosis, have been well received. The flavours and fragrances division bucked the group trend, achieving a 4.7 per cent rise in third-quarter sales to SFr375m. The group cited strong sales of flavours in the US and a general recovery of fragrance sales.   Companies:-  Roche Holdings.   Countries:-  CHZ  Switzerland, West Europe.

The company, in which Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical group has a majority stake, reported earnings of Dollars 38.9m, or 33 cents a share, up from Dollars 14.3m, or 12 cents a share, in the same period of last year. Sales rose from Dollars 153m to Dollars 198.9m. The figures, released on Friday, were below analysts' highest forecasts and the share fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 44 1/2 on profit-taking. The two new products launched in the quarter were Nutrpin, a human growth hormone, and Pulmozyme DNase for treating cystic fibrosis. Pulmozyme produced sales of Dollars 22.4m. Sales of the group's two growth hormone products rose 3 per cent to Dollars 53.6m. Sales of Activase, the clot-dissolving drug for heart treatment, rose 43 per cent to Dollars 70.2m. Upjohn, the pharmaceutical group, reported first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 135m, or 74 cents a share, compared with Dollars 133.4m, or 73 cents, in the same quarter last year. Operating revenues totalled Dollars 915.9m, compared with Dollars 918.2m, while operating income fell from Dollars 183m to Dollars 168.6m. Mr John Zabriskie, chairman, said the sales and earning performance had been achieved despite intense generic competition against several key products. There was a Dollars 68m drop in sales of the anti-anxiety agent, Xanax/alprazolam, due to increased generic competition. Warner-Lambert, the pharmaceuticals and healthcare products group, told an analysts' meeting on Friday that it expected to achieve a 5 per cent increase in earnings per share to Dollars 1.42, against Dollars 1.35 last year, when first-quarter results are released tomorrow. Sales should be up 11 per cent. Analysts' earnings expectations were pitched around Dollars 1.38 a share. Mr Melvin Goodes, chairman, said that for the full year the company expected a double digit sales increase and an earnings gain of at least 8 per cent, excluding restructuring charges and accounting changes.

Its outlay as host in readying the city of Rio to receive 30,000 visitors has brought a large dividend. Over the 12 days of the conference Brazil has gained more in bilateral and multilateral aid commitments than at any time in the past decade and more than the rest of money pledged for new world aid. The Japanese government has agreed Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 600m) in concessionary loans through its Overseas Export Credit Fund - its first lending to Brazil for seven years and around half the new Overseas Development Aid it has pledged in Rio for environmental projects worldwide. Germany has pledged Dollars 300m to Brazil in concessional aid. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has agreed to release Dollars 1bn and the World Bank is to increase its lending from Dollars 700m last year to Dollars 1.08bn. The heads of the World Bank, IDB, and International Monetary Fund each promised between Dollars 350m and Dollars 400m as initial collateral in Brazil's current negotiations on its commercial debt. The total in new aid for this year could reach Dollars 4bn - compared with what appears to be only Dollars 2.5bn (the numbers are vague) pledged for environmental projects worldwide by leaders of industrialised nations at the summit. The direct cost of the summit to Brazil was about Dollars 37m. 'The returns have been very good,' said Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, Brazil's economy minister. Although much of the money was for projects already under negotiation, he said the Earth Summit had provided the impetus. 'First of all everyone was here and it gave us chance to speak to heads of state and of multilateral institutions directly; secondly everyone wanted to sign things here.'

The drop in earnings re-flected higher costs as manufacturers offered low-interest consumer loans to revive sluggish domestic demand. They also had increased costs associated with the production and marketing of several new car models. Hyundai Motor, the biggest Korean motor company, said net profits fell by 23 per cent to Won41.6bn (Dollars 52m), although sales rose by 8.5 per cent to Won6,079bn. Sales and profits were harmed in the last two months of 1992 as employees became involved in the presidential campaign of Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, causing sales activity to slacken. Hyundai was able to balance sluggish sales in South Korea and the US, traditionally its largest foreign market, by increasing exports to Europe, which became its biggest overseas customer last year. Kia Motors reported a 5.7 per cent decline in net profits to Won14.95bn as sales rose by 20 per cent to Won3,282bn. Earnings were depressed by costs involved with the introduction of the Potentia luxury car and the medium-range Sephia. It also had heavy investment spending in expanding production at its Asan Bay facility. Daewoo Motors, which is unlisted, continued to post losses. Its deficit shrank to Won90bn from Won146.7bn in 1991. Sales increased by 6.5 per cent to Won1,700bn. Asia Motors, which is a specialised manufacturer of commercial vehicles and affiliated with Kia Motors, suffered a 29 per cent fall in profits to Won7.4bn as demand weakened because of a downturn in the construction industry. Sales remained almost unchanged at Won970bn. Ssangyong Motor slipped into a deficit of Won8.75bn after registering a profit of Won9.38bn in 1991. Sales also fell by 15 per cent to Won340.8bn. The reverse was largely caused by increased competition in the market for the four-wheel drive vehicles, which Ssangyong monopolised until last year with its Korando model. The introduction of the Galloper by Hyundai Precision, a manufacturer of rolling stock and containers, sharply reduced Ssangyong's market share.   Companies:-  Hyundai Motor.     Kia Motors.

The decision sent the company's share price sharply lower on Wall Street and contributed to a 2 per cent fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock market was also upset by an unexpected fall in US employment and a drop in bond prices. The cut - possibly by as much as 20 per cent - in the price of America's most popular cigarette and one of the world's most valuable trademarks is restricted to the US. It is expected to have little immediate effect on Philip Morris's international operations, which include an estimated quarter-share of the European Community market. A packet of Marlboro costs on average Dollars 2.15, nearly twice that of discount cigarettes at around Dollars 1.20 a pack, according to Philip Morris. Analysts think Marlboro will be cut by about 40 cents, narrowing the gap between the brand and the cheapest pack of discount cigarettes from around Dollars 1.06 to 66 cents. On the New York Stock Exchange, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 68.63 lower at 3,370.81, Philip Morris stock fell more than 20 per cent, or Dollars 15 1/4 , to Dollars 49 3/8 . This erased about Dollars 13.5bn from the group's stock market valuation. RJR Nabisco dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 6 3/4 and American Brands fell Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 30. In London, BAT's price tumbled 71p to 928p on exceptionally heavy turnover as traders feared the move could dent the UK group's profits. Philip Morris, which is the American cigarette market leader with an estimated 43 per cent share, said it expected operating earnings from its US tobacco business to be down as much as 40 per cent in 1993 because of its new strategy. Some analysts cut their 1993 earnings forecasts for the group from around Dollars 6.45 a share to around Dollars 5 a share. Mr James Johnston, chairman of RJR Reynolds Tobacco, the second largest US tobacco company, with a 28 per cent market share, said it intended to remain fully competitive and would take 'appropriate action' to protect its market share. The move follows a gradual erosion of Marlboro's brand share, which dipped to around 24.5 per cent of the US market in 1992 from 25.8 per cent in 1991 as smokers switched to cheaper branded cigarettes and generic varieties with no brand image. These discount cigarettes, substantially less profitable for the manufacturers, have seen their share of the US market grow from about 19 per cent in 1990, to about 36 per cent last year.

Sales by wholesalers totaled 537.08 trillion yen, down 4.1  percent, while those by retail stores came to 136,376 billion  yen, down 3.8 percent.    Wholesalers and retailers both incurred a drop for the  second  year running for the first time since statistics were taken in  1953, MITI said.    A MITI official attributed the poor performance by  wholesalers to falling fuel and materials prices due to the  strong yen, as well as sluggish personal spending and slack  corporate capital spending, particularly by manufacturers.    Retailers were affected by an increasing consumer tendency  for buying bargain-priced products and a drop in import prices  amid the strong yen, the official said.    On a quarterly basis, sales by wholesalers dropped 3.1  percent in the October-December quarter from a year before,  which was also attributable to the strong yen.    The fourth-quarter sales by retailers fell 3.5 percent,  affected by an unusually warm winter, MITI said.    Business performance among both wholesalers and retailers is  expected to remain stagnant in the near future, the official  said.     "

By JANE HULSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES      Ventura County officials plan to spend almost $1 million in state funds during  the next two years on an anti-smoking blitz that goes beyond simply spreading  the word.    The plan, which comes before the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, includes a  number of possible tactics -- everything from urging the Ventura County Fair's  rodeo officials to drop their tobacco sponsor to asking doctors to write ""quit  smoking"" prescriptions for their patients.    The plan also calls for asking newspapers to stop accepting tobacco  advertising, using billboards to counteract tobacco advertising and coaching  health and education professionals on the dangers of smoking and how to help  smokers quit.    ""We're going to make the message inescapable,"" said Carlene Maggio, a senior  health educator with the Ventura County Tobacco Education and Control Program.  Consumers ""are already being saturated by information from the tobacco  industry.""    Funding for the program comes from a 25-cent tax on cigarettes that voters  statewide approved in 1988 as part of Proposition 99. The tax took effect Jan.  1, 1989, and is expected to generate $1.46 billion by mid-1991.    On Tuesday, local program officials will ask the supervisors to approve  submitting the plan to the state Department of Health Services for any final  changes.    The goal of the tax measure is to reduce the consumption of tobacco by 75% in  California by the year 2000. Current estimates show that about 30% of the adult  population smokes, said Bill Miley, the county's program coordinator.    Miley is the first to admit that the program's anti-smoking message isn't new.  The health hazards of tobacco were first publicized broadly in 1964.    ""People who smoke underestimate the risk or they intellectualize the risk to  themselves and those around them,"" he said. ""They say, 'Oh yeah, tobacco and  smoking cause cancer. You got a cigarette?'

By JANE HULSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES      Ventura County officials plan to spend almost $1 million in state funds during  the next two years on an anti-smoking blitz that goes beyond simply spreading  the word.    The plan, which comes before the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, includes a  number of possible tactics -- everything from urging the Ventura County Fair's  rodeo officials to drop their tobacco sponsor to asking doctors to write ""quit  smoking"" prescriptions for their patients.    The plan also calls for asking newspapers to stop accepting tobacco  advertising, using billboards to counteract tobacco advertising and coaching  health and education professionals on the dangers of smoking and how to help  smokers quit.    ""We're going to make the message inescapable,"" said Carlene Maggio, a senior  health educator with the Ventura County Tobacco Education and Control Program.  Consumers ""are already being saturated by information from the tobacco  industry.""    Funding for the program comes from a 25-cent tax on cigarettes that voters  statewide approved in 1988 as part of Proposition 99. The tax took effect Jan.  1, 1989, and is expected to generate $1.46 billion by mid-1991.    On Tuesday, local program officials will ask the supervisors to approve  submitting the plan to the state Department of Health Services for any final  changes.    The goal of the tax measure is to reduce the consumption of tobacco by 75% in  California by the year 2000. Current estimates show that about 30% of the adult  population smokes, said Bill Miley, the county's program coordinator.    Miley is the first to admit that the program's anti-smoking message isn't new.  The health hazards of tobacco were first publicized broadly in 1964.    ""People who smoke underestimate the risk or they intellectualize the risk to  themselves and those around them,"" he said. ""They say, 'Oh yeah, tobacco and  smoking cause cancer. You got a cigarette?'

0,FT934-15027 ,"FT934-15027 _AN-DJMCRAGRFT 931013   FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (11): Gains made despite recession - The long-term role of the sector is assured, with Asian and eastern European markets offering huge potential / The drinks industry      By PHILIP RAWSTORNE   THE DRINKS industry achieved a further increase in exports last year in spite of recession in many of its most important markets. Although Guinness dropped two places to 12th in the Top 100, the group recorded close to a 15 per cent rise in export sales to Pounds 975m. Allied-Lyons moved down three places from 27th to 30th but recorded a 12 per cent increase to Pounds 402m; Grand Metropolitan also fell from 36th spot to 40th but raised overseas sales by 6.6 per cent to Pounds 308m. Seagram slipped one place to 44th. Bass, the brewing and hotels group, remains outside the Top 100 but managed to increase its sales by 12 per cent to Pounds 73m. Its success is based on an increasing thirst for Bass ale in the US and Spain, and Tennent's lager in Italy. Scotch whisky was the mainstay of the international spirits groups' performance. While sales of Scotch fell by almost 10 per cent in the UK, the value of exports rose for the ninth successive year to Pounds 1.96bn. Overseas markets now account for nearly 86 per cent of the industry's sales. Overall world demand for spirits, however, fell slightly during the year. In general, the marketing and distribution strengths of the leading UK-based groups have enabled them in recent years to offset a slow decline in domestic demand and in mature markets such as the US and Canada, with growth in continental Europe, Asia/Pacific, and Latin America. This proved more difficult to achieve as 1992 wore on. While conditions in the US - and particularly California - remained depressed, recession began to bite in other important markets. The most serious blow to the spirits exporters came from the deteriorating economic conditions in Japan, one of the biggest high-value growth markets of the late 1980s. Growing unemployment and waning consumer confidence were quickly reflected in the demand for imported spirits. The squeeze was felt most severely in the high-priced bar trade and gift-giving sectors, which accounted for 30 per cent of volumes and a higher proportion of value sales. Elsewhere in East Asia, Taiwan remained healthy but Thailand, another de-luxe market, and Korea weakened. In Europe, the German market began to decline as the euphoria of unification gave way to recessionary forces. Demand also slackened in Italy and France, but improved in Scandinavia with a reduction in excise duties and more liberal regulation. More affluent young consumers sustained relatively buoyant markets in Spain, Greece and Portugal. Latin America, which accounts for 11 per cent of Scotch whisky export volumes, showed greater volatility. There were huge increases in consumption in some countries. Sales to Argentina were 70 per cent higher; consumption of mainly de-luxe whisky brands in Venezuela, the region's largest market, were 43 per cent ahead. But economic difficulties in Brazil caused a 32 per cent fall in shipments. Under the impact of worsening economic conditions, consumers in several markets began to trade down to lower-priced spirits brands. Exporters of Scotch, in particular, found this pressure on prices compounded by over-production and surplus stocks. The worldwide trend towards lower inflation rates also restrained the 'confident pricing' policies that had ruled throughout the late 1980s. Patchy trading conditions have persisted this year and will hold back export growth. Anthony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, reported: 'We are still seeing signs of further deterioration in some major markets and any overall recovery remains elusive.' While economic conditions in some countries, such as the US and Australia, appear to be improving, other markets, such as Spain and Germany, are being increasingly affected by declining consumer confidence. In the first six months of the year, Guinness increased volume sales but found the gains concentrated in the lower-priced segments of the market. The group has been able to achieve only modest price increases for its brands, reflecting lower inflation and a highly competitive environment. However, the longer term role of the drinks groups among the UK's leading exporters seems assured. International quality spirits' share of the overall world market is just 7 per cent - and everywhere they continue to gain at the expense of local products. Trade barriers which have protected some of the biggest markets are crumbling. China, India, and eastern Europe offer huge potential. Whatever the doubts in the US and UK about the value of brands, vast numbers of consumers in the emergent markets aspire to drink Johnnie Walker, J  B, and Ballantine's Scotch. Guinness says:'The world market for whisky of all kinds is around 200m cases. Scotch, the most authentic whisky, only accounts for 72m cases, or 36 per cent. In Asia alone, from India to Japan, 80m cases of whisky are consumed every year of which only 5 per cent is Scotch. Even if we only convert 1 per cent of whisky drinkers every year, think what that can do for the sales of the major premium brands.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The parent already has a 59 per cent stake in Hitachi Sales and the offer values the rest at some Y39.85bn (Dollars 398m). Shares in the subsidiary have fallen by Y95 since Hitachi announced its intentions last week, including a Y5 dip to Y625 yesterday. With Hitachi's own shares up Y51 since last Thursday's announcement and unchanged on the day at Y1,010, the all-scrip offer implies a bid premium of some 13 per cent. Hitachi Sales, with revenues of Y433bn in its latest year, operates a chain of retail outlets. These have been hit by the downturn in Japanese consumer spending, and profitability for the past two years has been marginal. The deal, says Hitachi, will streamline product development and marketing and rationalise management resources. Officials deny suggestions that the move may be a precursor to a withdrawal from consumer electronics, which represents about 10 per cent of its business. New lines are being sought for its stores.

0,FT923-8736 ,"FT923-8736 _AN-CHMAPAAJFT 920810   FT  10 AUG 92 / Swiss go border-hopping in search of food bargains: Subsidies for Alpine farming are producing high prices and more 'consumer tourists'      By IAN RODGER   EUROPEAN consumers appear to be much more savvy and less inhibited than they used to be about crossing borders in search of lower prices. A recent study in Switzerland estimates that Swiss food retailers could lose about SFr1bn (Pounds 400m) in custom this year - or about Pounds 60 per Swiss resident - to supermarkets in neighbouring EC countries. To those unfamiliar with Swiss agricultural policy, it may seem odd that anyone would want to buy food in the European Community, where the notorious Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) keeps market prices for most farm products far above international market levels. But Switzerland's farm supports are much more generous than even those provided by the CAP, reflecting the higher costs of production in small mountainside farms and a national consensus that preservation of the Alpine way of life is a good thing. Food prices are on average 50 per cent lower in Germany and France than in Switzerland. As most Swiss live close to a border with an EC country, the practice of shopping in the neighbouring country has long existed. However, it used to be on a modest scale, partly because people were less mobile and partly because the Swiss border guards were thorough in inspecting incoming motorists to see if, for example, they were breaching the severe limit of 0.5kg of meat per person. According to a University of Basle study sponsored by Coop Schweiz*, the amount of such shopping has soared in the past couple of years, with the value of foreign purchases up roughly 40 per cent. Coop, the second largest Swiss food retailer, says that most of it is concentrated in only a few products. It estimates that Swiss consumers this year will spend in neighbouring countries SFr100m on butter and oils, SFr200m on milk and cheese products, SFr250m on wines and spirits and SFr300m on meat. While the study attributes this spending mainly to the excessive prices of agricultural products in Switzerland, it mentions several new factors. For example, German and French supermarket companies have become much more aggressive in appealing to Swiss consumers. Their advertisements in Swiss media stress that there is not even any need to change currency. Swiss francs are welcome. Also, trans-border consumers have found that as their numbers have increased, weary Swiss customs officers have become increasingly nonchalant over inspections. That in turn has encouraged many more to play the game. Until recently, it was mainly the 1.8m Swiss who live close to the German and French borders who participated, but now even those living in the middle of the country are joining in. According to the study, one in 10 residents of Lucerne goes across the borders at least once a year to buy food. Obviously, this is having a significant effect on the trade of Swiss retailers. Coop points out that SFr1bn is equivalent to one third of its annual sales. It also means lost sales for Swiss farmers. Sales of Swiss meat and dairy products are flat in spite of a growing population. The growth of consumer tourism is also working in the other direction. A surging flow of Italian motorists from adjacent Lombardy seeking cheap petrol has forced the cantonal government in Ticino to close access roads at night. A year ago, following a petrol tax increase in Germany, business in the forecourts of north Switzerland surged. According to Erdol-Vereinigung, the Swiss petroleum industry association, about 13 per cent of all petrol sold in Switzerland is bought by visitors from neighbouring countries. That represents a retail value of about SFr700m a year. The tax take from this is sufficiently large to make the Swiss tax collector worry about how much much he can raise petrol taxes in Switzerland without jeopardising his windfall gain. German, French and Italian consumers also like to buy cigarettes in Switzerland, as tax there represents only 50 per cent of the retail price. The Swiss Tobacco Merchants Association says its members in border areas do brisker business than those elsewhere, but it has no clear idea of how significant the cross-border trade is or how fast it is growing. In the capital markets these days, differences in prices for identical securities on different bourses tend to be eliminated in seconds by arbitrageurs. But governments have hitherto been able to block effective arbitrage in the retail trade of consumer products even when differentials have been very large. The Swiss experience suggests that this is becoming more difficult. If so, the creation of the single EC market is well timed. Switzerland, of course, is not an EC member and even if it approves the creation of an expanded free trade area, the European Economic Area, next year, nothing much will change because trade in food products is excluded from the pact. Presumably the Swiss government could reduce the haemorrhage on its food account by stiffening border controls. But as Coop points out, at a time when Bern is promoting liberalisation of markets and increased harmony with the EC, this would be a strange response. * Consumer Tourism and Switzerland's Retail Food Market, Department of Economics, University of Basle.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SWITZERLAND AND EC PRICE DIFFERENTIALS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Product prices in SFr          % Price difference Product   Switzerland   Germany    France     Germany      France  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pork         27.15/kg  15.60/kg  13.35/kg       -42.5       -50.8 Beef         39.35/kg  20.55/kg  21.40/kg       -47.8       -45.6 Milk         1.90/ltr  1.10/ltr  1.40/ltr       -42.1       -26.3 Cheese       25.00/kg  11.20/kg  14.35/kg       -55.2       -42.6 Butter       16.75/kg   6.80/kg   8.00/kg       -59.4       -52.2 Oil          4.50/ltr  1.50/ltr  1.70/ltr       -66.7       -62.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Economics, University of Basle, for Coop Schweiz  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Merck, the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, continues to benefit from its new product line, which helped lift third-quarter net income by 17 per cent to Dollars 644.5m, or 55 cents a share, from Dollars 552.4m, or 47 cents, last year. Sales advanced 16 per cent to Dollars 2.46bn from Dollars 2.12bn, and were led by Vasotec for cardiovascular disease, Mevacor and Zocor, which lower cholesterol. Nine-month net income rose 17 per cent to Dollars 1.87bn, or Dollars 1.61, from Dollars 1.59bn, or Dollars 1.37. Sales were 12 per cent higher at Dollars 7.06bn, against Dollars 6.29bn. American Home Products, another large pharmaceuticals group, turned in third-quarter net income of Dollars 427.7m, up 11 per cent from Dollars 384.9m. Earnings per share were 12 per cent up at Dollars 1.37, against Dollars 1.22. Sales grew 12 per cent to Dollars 2.11bn from Dollars 1.86bn, led by a 16 per cent improvement in drug sales to Dollars 1.21bn. Like Merck, American Home Products' performance has been helped by several relatively new products. In contrast, growth at Upjohn has been held back by a lack of major new products. The company posted third-quarter net income of Dollars 138m, or 77 cents a share, against Dollars 140m, or 77 cents, a year ago. Sales of Halcion, the sleeping pill banned recently in the UK, fell 47 per cent in the quarter. Earnings in the latest quarter included after-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 15m, or 8 cents a share. Third-quarter sales rose 8 per cent to Dollars 894.4m from Dollars Dollars 831.7m.

Net income for the quarter was Dollars 203.8m, or 61 cents on sales of Dollars 1.69bn, against earnings of Dollars 179.1m, or 53 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.63bn a year earlier. Pfizer, which has divested or closed several businesses in the past two years, said sales from on-going operations rose 13 per cent in the latest quarter while net income from those operations increased 10 per cent. The sale of Pfizer's Coty fragrance and cosmetics business contributed a Dollars 3m after-tax gain in net income and Dollars 56.5m in restructuring credits to operating income. Sales of new pharmaceutical products contributed to a 17 per cent improvement in pharmaceutical sales growth in the quarter. The company said the improvement was almost entirely due to higher volume, since no pharmaceutical prices were increased in the quarter. Second-quarter earnings from Johnson  Johnson, the US healthcare products and pharmaceuticals group, were also strong. Net income rose 14 per cent to Dollars 464m, or 70 cents a share from Dollars 406m, or 61 cents a year ago. Sales increased about 13 per cent to Dollars 3.41bn from Dollars 3.03bn. For the first six months, net income rose about 13 per cent to Dollars 928m, or Dollars 1.40, from Dollars 824m, or Dollars 1.24 last year. Sales were 10 per cent higher at Dollars 3.34bn from Dollars 3.08bn. Sales growth was led by Johnson  Johnson's profession segment, which includes products used in less invasive surgery, where domestic sales rose 17 per cent and overseas sales advanced 15 per cent. Warner Lambert, another large US pharmaceuticals company, posted net earnings of Dollars 178m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, up 15 per cent, on the back of an 11 per cent improvement in sales to Dollars 1.37bn. A year earlier, the company had net income of Dollars 155m, or Dollars 1.15, on sales of Dollars 1.24bn. For the first half of 1992, net income was Dollars 341.5m, or Dollars 2.54, compared with Dollars 188.1m, or Dollars 1.40, a year earlier. The previous year's results were distorted by an after-tax charge of Dollars 106m, or 79 cents a share, related to an accounting change. Sales in the six months were Dollars 2.68bn against Dollars 2.46bn.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

The aim of private training programs using ODA funding  has so far been to promote exchanges of technology. But  additional ODA funds will now be used to support a training  program on Japanese industrial property rights, which will be  carried out from this fall by the Japan Institute of Invention  and Innovation [JIII] (an auxiliary organization to the Patent  Office). This is in response to the agreement on Trade Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIP) reached in the  Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which urges  developing countries to establish an industrial property system.  Tokyo plans to assist developing countries mainly in Asia in  establishing the system, thereby exporting Japan's system of  protecting property rights to those countries.    The training program will be carried out mainly by the  Industrial Property Patents and International Cooperation  Training Center, which was established by the JIII on 1 April.    The center will dispatch Japanese private sector patent  specialists to foreign countries and also invite specialists  from foreign companies so that Japan's patent application system  for such products as computer circuits and semiconductors will  take root overseas.    ASEAN will be a main participant in the project. The project  will be funded by a portion of an ODA subsidy (which totals 9  billion yen in fiscal 1993) provided to the Japan Overseas  Development Council (JODC) and the Association for Overseas  Technical Scholarship (AOTS). The subsidy will cover one-third  to one-half of trainees' living expenses during their stay in  Japan.    Developing countries have been trying to establish an  industrial property system following the Uruguay Round  agreement, which obligates them to establish one. The United  States and the European Union have been working to export their  own industrial property systems to developing countries in a bid  to help private companies make inroads into those countries in  the future. Similarly, Japan's training program is aimed at  conforming an industrial property system in Asia to Japan's to  back Japanese companies in making inroads into developing  countries in Asia.     "

In these assemblies, everyone has the  opportunity to give his opinion on different aspects of our  economy and finances. Juan Bautista, a worker at this factory,  answered questions asked by our reporter, Roberto Cavada.    [Cavada] One of the topics that came up in this assembly,  which has been called the Workers Parliament, today here in the  Miguel Fernandez Tobacco Factory was the issue of whether money  of dubious origin, accumulated in great quantities by small  sectors of the population, should be confiscated. I was very  interested in the opinion that Juan Bautista expressed to the  rest of his comrades and I have asked him to express that  opinion for the rest of the Cuban people. What is your opinion,  Juan?    [Bautista] We believe that this money of dubious origin  should be confiscated, especially since the money was obtained  illegally and by exploiting the needs of the workers due to the  situation that the country is currently facing.    [Cavada] How would you determine who obtained it through  dubious means and who obtained it through legal means and hard  work?    [Bautista] This is simple. No worker can have 200,000 pesos  stashed in the bank or in his home.    [Cavada] Another of the questions that was asked today in  your factory and which was debated by the workers concerned the  price policy [politica de precio] that the country should  follow. What is your opinion?    [Bautista] Marx established that the principle of  socialistic  distribution was not entirely fair but that it was the only  principle realistically applicable to socialism. In other words,  everyone should contribute according to his capacity and receive  according to his work. The price policy would fulfill this  principle of distribution that applies and should apply in  socialism. Each person should contribute to society according to  his capacity and should receive according to his work. This  principle should allow him to have access to determined products  that could be offered.    [Cavada] Juan, in a nutshell, as an old tobacco worker, how  do you think the state can confront the excess of currency and  restructure the economy?    [Bautista] I believe the way to confront the excess of  currency is by increasing production. At the moment, we must  take steps to overcome the situation; in other words, find an  equilibrium between the amount of currency and the amount of  goods available. The definite solution to this problem is to  increase production and the efficiency of our enterprises. I  believe one of the topics that was analyzed at the assembly was  subsidies to the enterprises. I believe inefficient enterprises  should not be subsidized. I believe every enterprise director,  together with the labor union and the rest of the organizations,  should find the way for those enterprises to become efficient.    [Cavada] That is the opinion of Cuban workers. This is the  case of Juan Bautista, an longtime tobacco worker, who continues  to produce and give his opinion at the Miguel Fernandez Factory  where today began what the Cuban Workers Federation has called  the Workers Parliament.

As a response to the recent agreement emanating from friction  concerning cellular phones, IDO will invest about 60 billion yen  to expand the service area and accelerate signing of new  subscribers to provide for early recovery of its investment in  the Motorola system. IDO expects to enlist about 120,000  subscribers within the fiscal year. By expanding the service  area and emphasizing the Motorola system, it hopes to compete  more effectively with NTT's mobile communication network called  NTT Dokomo [Anywhere] and to prevent recurrence of Japan-U.S.  friction.    The dedicated team will be established as the Fourth Sales  Section within the Sales Department. It will be initially  staffed with eight individuals. Since it does not have any  company-owned direct sales outlets, IDO will set up dealers that  specialize in Motorola cellular phones and provide sales support  to distributors.    In the past, IDO had established the First, Second and Third  Sales Sections under the Sales Department and had provided sales  support to dealers which handled both NTT and Motorola cellular  phones. However, now IDO sources say, ""If we approach the sales  effort for both rival NTT's Dokomo and Motorola systems in the  same way, there is little prospect of improving sales of  Motorola units."" But, now that capital investments in the  Motorola system have been expanded as a result of the agreement,  IDO has decided to place emphasis on the promotion of Motorola  units.    In conjunction with the outright sale of cellular phones  which began in April, IDO as an operator of communications  systems will stock a maximum of 11 models of cellular phones and  provide that eight of them will be applicable to the Motorola  system. It will thus position the Motorola system strategically  in the competition to increase its subscriber share in the  market place.    As a follow-on to the Japan-U.S. agreement on cellular  phones, IDO will invest about 60 billion yen to expand its base  stations for the Motorola system and reassign some of the  frequencies currently used on the NTT system to the Motorola  system by the end of September 1995. Further, the operating plan  submitted by IDO to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  contains a passage which states, ""We will install a dedicated  sales organization to promote the Motorola system.""    IDO subscribers to the Motorola system as of 31 March 1994  totaled about 22,000. This figure is far behind the 310,000 IDO  subscribers for the NTT system, but is close to three times the  number existing at the same time last year.     "

The 1938 Act covers many commodities, including tobacco. Until recently the tobacco provisions of the 1938 Act dealt mainly with regulating the production of tobacco by domestic producers and the definition of ``tobacco'' in section 301 of the 1938 Act, which is made generally applicable to the entire 1938 Act, appears to have been drafted accordingly when it was enacted in 1938. The term ``tobacco'' is used in section 320C without a modifier and in combination with the word ``imported.'' Tobacco is classified by kind and by type number. For example, domestic burley tobacco is commonly referred to as type 31. Section 301 refers to the ``Service and Regulatory Announcement 118 of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Bureau of Agricultural Economics'' published in 1929 and defines tobacco to mean certain specified tobacco types by type number as identified in Announcement 118. All of the identified types, however, are identified in Announcement 118 as domestic tobaccos. Foreign tobaccos are assigned other type numbers and, thus, under the section 301 definition, they technically would not appear to be, ``tobacco'' at all under that definition. However, section 320C clearly was intended to measure the amount of use of ``imported tobacco,'' as those words would be defined in their common meaning as compared with domestic tobacco use. Use of the section 301 definition of ``tobacco'' would make that comparison impossible and make the statute essentially meaningless. Thus, the proposed rule presumes that the Congress did not intend for the section 301 definition of ``tobacco'' to be used for the section 320C purpose. The proposed rule has been drafted accordingly. ``Tobacco'' is defined in the proposed rule to mean that which is commonly considered to be ``tobacco'' in the trade. As there is no provision in the statute to do otherwise, that would include all foreign tobacco, including those like Turkish and Oriental tobaccos, which may not have as close a domestic counterpart as other tobaccos. This inclusion is consistent with the Conference report issued with the 1993 Act (H. Conf. Report No. 103213) where the Conference managers stated their belief that the 75/25 ratio, by allowing the maintenance of current blends, would be sufficient to ``permit the continued importation of Turkish and Oriental tobaccos.'' If Turkish and Oriental tobaccos were not subject to section 320C, the ratio would be irrelevant. These conclusions, as with all aspects of the proposed rule, are subject to further consideration on receipt of comments.         Discussion of Proposed Rule         1. Domestic Tobacco Content Requirement (723.502)         A ``domestic manufacturer of cigarettes'' is defined in section 301(b)(17) of the 1938 Act as ``a person that produces and sells more than 1 percent of the cigarettes produced and sold in the United States.'' To avoid the domestic marketing assessment and other sanctions imposed by section 320C of the amended 1938 Act, beginning in 1994 and each succeeding calendar year, each domestic manufacturer of cigarettes must use at least 75 percent domestically grown tobacco in the cigarettes manufactured by such manufacturer. In determining compliance with the domestic content requirement, the proposed rule specifies that imported tobacco will include all tobacco imported into the United States including Oriental and Turkish tobaccos. The domestic tobacco content requirement will apply to all cigarettes manufactured in the United States by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes without regard to whether the manufactured cigarettes are sold domestically or exported. The domestic content requirement would not apply to cigarettes manufactured outside the United States by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes. Likewise, the domestic tobacco content requirement would not apply to tobacco processed in the United States for use in making cigarettes outside the United States. Domestic manufacturers of cigarettes with operations located outside the United States would not be required to file reports for cigarettes manufactured in such foreign based operations for foreign-made cigarettes and the domestic content rules would not apply to such cigarettes.         2. Reports and Certifications by Domestic Manufacturers of Cigarettes (723.502)         Under the proposed rule, beginning with the 1994 and each succeeding calendar year, each domestic manufacturer of cigarettes would be required to maintain records, file reports and certify to the quantities of domestic and imported tobacco used by such manufacturer to manufacture cigarettes in the United States. Determinations as to content percentages would be based on the weight of the tobacco when it is ready for the cigarette manufacturing process. Adjustments, to avoid double-counting, will be made for any tobacco which loses its identity during the manufacturing process and is recaptured and reused to manufacture cigarettes by the same manufacturer and for tobacco in any cigarettes returned to the manufacturer and reused by such manufacturer to manufacture other cigarettes. Such adjustments will be made only to the extent that records are maintained which prove the reuse of such tobacco. For the purpose of determining the domestic content percentage, any tobacco reconstituted, or otherwise processed, so as to lose its respective identity as either imported tobacco or domestic tobacco, before being acquired by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes shall be considered to be imported tobacco when it is used to produce cigarettes by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes. The proposed rule provides that reports and certifications must be mailed or otherwise delivered to Director, Tobacco and Peanuts Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, P. O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 200132415 by February 15 of the year after the calendar year for which reports and certifications apply. Failure to file timely reports or make required certifications will result in all tobacco used by the manufacturer in the manufacturing of cigarettes in the United States being considered as imported tobacco and sanctions would be applied accordingly. Such a presumption is provided for in section 320C(b) of the 1938 Act.

According to the public expenditure watchdog, a spot check last year into the eligibility of 7,700 pensioners and widows led to the suspension of payments to a fifth of those contacted. The agency pays benefits and pensions to 680,000 people overseas, almost half in Australia, Canada and the US. More than 95 per cent of the payments are retirement pensions or benefits to widows. The NAO says most other countries regularly check the eligibility of pensioners living abroad, usually annually. They send out 'life certificates' requiring recipients to attest to the fact that they are still alive and entitled to the benefits. The US had suspended payments to 1.5 per cent of its 353,000 beneficiaries abroad in 1989 after such an exercise, and found that the circumstances of a further 15 per cent had changed. Canada suspended payments to 2.5 per cent of its 78,000 recipients in 1990. Similar checks were carried out on a selective basis by the Department of Social Security until 1985. However, these were discontinued after industrial action left a backlog of work to be cleared. The Benefits Agency, which took over the payment of social security benefits in 1991, has begun a programme of selective checks. The first, last year, involved contacting all retired pensioners in the Indian sub-continent and all widows receiving benefits in Bangladesh. By January, payments to 20 per cent had been suspended, though some payments may be resumed if the recipients react to their suspension by returning the life certificates. The NAO says the agency has only one employee abroad to keep in contact with pensioners in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Other UK organisations in the public and private sector make regular checks on the eligibility of pensioners abroad, according to the NAO.

Sales rose by 1.1m from 13.1m in 1992 and 12.5m in 1991, the low point of the last recession. The US market peaked at 16.3m in 1986. The strengthening recovery in the US new vehicle market is in stark contrast to the steep fall in demand in Europe last year and the further drop in new vehicle sales in Japan, where demand has fallen for three years in succession. The increase in sales in the US has been driven by the surge in demand for light trucks, such as pick-ups, mini-vans (multi-purpose vehicles), vans and four-wheel-drive sports/utility vehicles, now accounting for about 40 per cent of the US passenger vehicle market. Light truck sales, still dominated by the big three US vehicle makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, rose 16 per cent last year to a record 5.7m; car sales rose 4 per cent to 8.5m. US carmakers outperformed the market with a 10.4 per cent increase in new vehicle sales. Japanese carmakers have been forced to increase prices faster than their US rivals. Under pressure from the strong appreciation in the value of the yen, the Japanese have lost market share. The rapid improvement in the fortunes of the domestic US vehicle makers was led by Chrysler, smallest of the big three, which increased its total vehicle sales 19.9 per cent to 2.047m from 1.71m a year earlier. Sales of light trucks by Chrysler accounted for 59 per cent of its total sales volume last year. The company is strengthening its position with the launch of a series of new cars this year, including the Neon small car and the Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus large family cars, unveiled this week at the Detroit motor show. Chrysler, which is undertaking a rapid renewal of its product range, increased its car sales last year by 23.1 per cent to 834,132; its light truck sales rose 17.8 per cent to 1.2m. Ford also performed strongly and accounted for five of the top 10 best-selling vehicles in the US. Its full-sized F-series pick-up was the best-selling vehicle at 565,000, while the Ford Taurus was the best-selling car at 360,000, ahead of the Honda Accord at 330,000. Ford's total vehicle sales rose 12 per cent to 3.6m; its car sales increased by 6 per cent to 1.878m, while light truck sales rose 19.4 per cent to 1.68m. General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle maker, suffered another small erosion of its US market share to about 33 per cent. Its total vehicle sales rose 5.9 per cent to 4.7m. GM increased its new car sales 2 per cent to 2.93m; its truck sales rose 13 per cent to 1.79m. Honda's sales in the US fell 7.3 per cent last year to 717,000. Total vehicle sales by Toyota, including its Lexus luxury car division, increased 1.3 per cent to 1.033m. Sales of cars under the Toyota brand fell 2.1 per cent. Nissan, the second biggest Japanese car maker, recovered after falling behind its Japanese rivals in the US.

Sales rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn. Sales growth would have been 2 percentage points higher but for the rise in the dollar exchange rate since last year, which caused lower dollar translation on Merck's 46 per cent overseas sales. The strong performance was led by Merck's newer drugs. The company's Vasotec, Vaseretic and Prinivil blood-pressure drugs and its Mevacor and Zocor cholesterol-reducing drugs, brought full-year earnings to Dollars 2.12bn, or Dollars 5.49 a share, up about 19 per cent. Sales for the year advanced 12 per cent to Dollars 8.6bn from Dollars 7.67bn. Merck also benefited from favourable tax rates in 1991. Pre-tax earnings for the fourth quarter rose 19 per cent to Dollars 790.7m and for the year grew 17 per cent to Dollars 3.17bn. The company said yesterday its new drug application for Proscar, to treat and control benign prostate disease, would be reviewed by the Food  Drug Administration's advisory panel on February 4. Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, New Jersey, turned in underlying fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 121m, or 90 cents a share, up 15 per cent from Dollars 105m, or 78 cents, a year earlier. The company took an after-tax restructuring charge in the quarter of Dollars 3.11 a share which resulted in a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 297m, or Dollars 2.21 a share. Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.34bn from Dollars 1.25bn. For the year, Warner-Lambert posted net income of Dollars 34.8m, or 26 cents, on sales of Dollars 5.06bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 484.9m, or Dollars 3.61, on sales of Dollars 4.69bn. Stripping out one-time items, the company's earnings rose 15 per cent to Dollars 559m, or Dollars 4.16 a share.

Net profit for the fourth quarter was Dollars 133.8m, or 91 cents per share. However this included a one-time, pre-tax arbitration award of Dollars 77.1m  -producing an after-tax gain of about 34 cents per share - over Amgen's marketing rights dispute with Johnson  Johnson, the US healthcare products group. In the same period last year the company reported net profits of Dollars 60m, or 41 cents a share. Fourth quarter sales rose to Dollars 308.2m from Dollars 210m. Sales in the quarter of Epogen, Amgen's anti-anaemia drug, were Dollars 135.7m, down slightly from Dollars 136.9m in the third quarter. For the year, sales increased to Dollars 506.3m, from Dollars 409.4m in 1991. Sales of Neupogen, which received US marketing approval in February 1991, rose to Dollars 544.4m in 1992 from Dollars 232.8m in 1991, Although fourth quarter earnings were in line with expectations, analysts expressed concern that the sales momentum is slowing, and the company's share price closed at Dollars 53 7/8 on Friday, down from Thursday's Dollars 59 3/4. For the year ended December 31, total turnover was Dollars 1.1bn, compared with Dollars 682m a year earlier. Net profits came to Dollars 357.6m, or Dollars 2.43 a share, compared with Dollars 97.9m, or 67 cents, which included a one-time, pre-tax legal assessment of Dollars 129.1m.

0,FT941-5245 ,"FT941-5245 _AN-ECHD1ABRFT 940308   FT  08 MAR 94 / Malaysia aid probe will focus on earlier decisions      By JAMES BLITZ and JIMMY BURNS   MPs probing the UK's offer of aid for Malaysia's Pergau dam project will increasingly focus their investigations on decisions taken before the signing of a protocol in March 1988 which linked arms and aid. In recent weeks ministers have admitted that the protocol, which was signed by Lord Younger, then defence secretary, contained an 'entanglement' between the sale of Pounds 1.3bn of defence equipment to Malaysia and an offer of about Pounds 200m in aid. Both the prime minister and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, have repeatedly said that this link was 'disentangled' in correspondence between the Malaysian and British authorities in June and August 1988. But members of the foreign affairs committee investigating Britain's decision to agree to the project will ask Lord Younger today why he felt he was able to give any assurance on aid to the Malaysians in the first place. They will want to know whether the Overseas Development Administration had been involved in the original offer of aid in the March 1988 protocol or whether the entire deal had been approved under the auspices of Baroness Thatcher, the then prime minister. One prominent member of the committee said yesterday: 'It looks to me like an independent foreign policy was being run from Number 10 Downing Street.' Mr John Major yesterday reiterated that ministers had acted properly in offering the aid package to Malaysia in parallel with the defence deal. He said that efforts to 'disentangle' the two packages after they had been linked showed that the government of the day was one 'with high standards not low standards'. However Mr Geoffrey Bindman, a senior partner of Bindman  Partners and a well-known constitutional lawyer, said evidence already put before MPs established an 'overwhelming probability' that, in deciding to authorise the grant of aid for the dam, Mr Douglas Hurd had 'acted ultra vires (beyond his authority) and therefore unlawfully'. His legal advice is contained in a five-page document prepared for the World Development Movement, the pressure group that has been lobbying Parliament over the affair. Mr Bindman says Mr Hurd has personal responsibility for the 1980 Overseas Act which covers the provision of aid. He says that evidence before the Commons points 'very strongly' to the conclusion that the government may have breached the act.   Countries:-  MYZ  Malaysia, Asia.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

By RICHARD TOMKINS      NEW YORK   US cigarette manufacturer RJ Reynolds Tobacco yesterday appeared to be playing down prospects for the launch of a new type of low-smoke cigarette called Eclipse, saying it did not know if or when the cigarette would be introduced because it was still being developed. Reynolds, part of RJR Nabisco, the US food and cigarette group, has been testing the cigarette which works by igniting a charcoal element at the end and passing the hot air over tobacco without burning it. A similar non-burning cigarette called Premier, launched by the company in 1988, flopped. Yesterday Reynolds said testing indicated that Eclipse had less tar and nicotine than 95 per cent of cigarettes currently on the market and eliminated 90 per cent of second-hand smoke.

0,FT944-10549 ,"FT944-10549 _AN-EKJEJABUFT 941110   FT  10 NOV 94 / Challenge to Hurd over Pergau funds      By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent   Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, was yesterday accused in the High Court of acting unlawfully in earmarking Pounds 234m from the overseas aid budget for the Pergau dam in Malaysia. The World Development Movement, a lobby group for developing countries, is seeking to have his decision quashed, to recover the Pounds 29.6m already spent and to block further payments from the aid budget for the dam's construction. The next instalment is due to be paid next month. The group says that Mr Hurd overstepped his powers under the 1980 Overseas Development and Co-operation Act by allocating aid money for the improper purpose of promoting trade with Malaysia. The act says the primary purpose of aid must be the economic benefit of a foreign country or the welfare of its people. Mr Nigel Pleming QC, the group's counsel, said the purpose of the act was 'aid - not trade'. He said the use of aid could not be said to be for the economic benefit of Malaysia because when Mr Hurd took the decision 'Pergau was unequivocally an economically unsound project'. Mr Pleming told the court that the dam could not be 'unbuilt' and added: 'We are not concerned with what happens in Malaysia from now on. What we are concerned about is that British monies which should not have been spent on Pergau should be spent on proper, deserving cases.' He said that Sir Tim Lankester, former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, had advised that the dam was uneconomic and funding it was an 'abuse of the aid programme'. But he was overruled by Mr Hurd on the basis of 'wider considerations'. A plea by the development movement for the court to order the government to release documents containing Sir Tim's reports to Mr Hurd was rejected by the judge. The government has accepted that if it loses the court case the bill for the dam will have to be met by another government department.

For 19 consecutive months, both its production  and domestic sales have fallen below the results for the  previous year, and it continues to break its worst record of the  past. In production, however, although passenger cars fell mroe  than 20 percent compared to the same month of the previous year,  commercial vehicles had only a slight decrease. Some brightness  could be seen in domestic sales also, for example, light autos  were on par with the previous year for the first time in eight  months.    The number of cars produced was 59,189, a 20.1-percent  decrease compared to the same month of the previous year. The  drop in passenger cars was especially great at 47,320, a  23.8-percent decrease. On the other hand, there was no more than  a slight decrease for commercial vehicles at 11,869, a  1.1-percent decrease for the period.    By vehicle class, the major vehicle classes decreased across  the board, but in commercial vehicles, the ""B series"" pickup  truck, which had a large order from the Middle East, increased  by 21.7 percent compared to the same month of the previous year,  and the Bongo series registered a 2.6-percent increase for the  same period.    The number of cars in domestic sales was 32,523, a decrease  of 9.5 percent compared to the same month of the previous year.  Within this, light cars combining commercial vehicles and  passenger cars were 5,137, a 1-car increase from the same month  of the previous year. Moreover, exports were 43,177, a  20.4-percent decrease for same, falling below the mark for the  previous year for 13 consecutive months.     "

The average annual quantity produced in the United States and exported during the same period was approximately 120,000 pounds (farm sales weight basis). Domestic use has shown a sharp downward trend, and exports have shown a moderate downward trend. Accordingly, a quantity of 92,000 pounds has been determined to be a normal year's domestic consumption and a quantity of 20,000 pounds has been determined to be a normal year's exports. Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 300,000 pounds.    Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 200,000 pounds. The 1993 Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco crop is estimated to be 100,000 pounds. Therefore, the total supply of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco for the 1993 MY is 300,000 pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total approximately 120,000 pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 180,000 pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained.    The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 120,000 pounds. This represents the quantity of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. Around 90 percent of the announced national marketing quota is expected to be produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a national marketing quota of 131,000 pounds is necessary to make available production of 120,000 pounds. Accordingly, the national marketing quota for the 1994 MY is 131,000 pounds.    In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 131,000 pounds by the 198993, 5-year national yield of 1,286 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment of 101.87 acres.    Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, a national acreage factor of 1.05 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 0.08 acre, by the total of the 1994 preliminary farm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g) of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms.        (5) Cigar-Filler and Binder (Types 4244 and 5355) Tobacco        The yearly average quantity of cigar-filler and binder (types 4244 and 5355) tobacco produced in the United States which is estimated to have been consumed in the United States during the 10 years preceding the 1993 MY was approximately 16.0 million pounds. The average annual quantity of cigar-filler and binder (types 4244 and 5355) tobacco produced in the United States and exported from the United States during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993 MY was less than 100,000 pounds. Domestic use has trended downward and exports are almost nonexistent. Accordingly, a normal year's domestic consumption has been established at 12.0 million pounds while a normal year's export has been established at 60,000 pounds. Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 34.8 million pounds.    Manufacturers and dealers report stocks of cigar-filler and binder (types 4244 and 5355) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 30.8 million pounds. The 1993 cigar-filler and binder crop is estimated to be 7.7 million pounds. Therefore, the total supply of cigar-filler and binder (types 4244 and 5355) tobacco for the 1993 MY is 38.5 million pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total about 9.0 million pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 29.5 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained.    The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 5.3 million pounds. This represents the quantity of cigar-filler and binder tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. Slightly less than 70 percent of the announced national marketing quota may be produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a 1994 national marketing quota of 7.75 million pounds is necessary to make available production of 5.3 million pounds. In accordance with section 312(b) of the 1938 Act, it has been further determined that the 1994 national marketing quota must be increased by 20 percent in order to avoid undue restriction of marketings. This results in a national marketing quota for the 1994 MY of 9.3 million pounds.    In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 9.3 million pounds by the 198993, 5-year national average yield of 1,879 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment of 4,949.44 acres.    Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g), of the 1938 Act, a national factor of 0.70 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 4 acres, by the total of the 1994 preliminary farm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g) of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms.        (6) Cigar-Filler (Type 46) Tobacco        There is no demand for cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco. Accordingly, the reserve supply level is zero. The estimated carryover at the start of MY 1994 is 0.6 million pounds.    Because the estimated carryover exceeds the reserve supply level, the quantity of tobacco which may be marketed during MY 1994 and the 1994 acreage allotment are both zero.

Lin Chien-hsiung, director of the Department of National  Treasury, made the announcement on the opening day of US-Taiwan  tariff reduction negotiations.    US negotiators had earlier requested Taiwan revoke its  monopoly alcohol and tobacco tax in accord with General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regulations.    Taiwan currently imposes monopoly taxes on the imported  products averaging NT$16.6 (US$0.61) per pack of cigarettes and  NT$660 (us$24.4) per liter of alcohol.    After the monopoly tax is lifted, imported alcohol and  tobacco will be subject to normal taxes, Lin said.     "
0,FT941-17179 ,"FT941-17179 _AN-EAFCSAAWFT 940106   FT  06 JAN 94 / Sales of new cars and trucks in US rise 8%: Recovery contrasts with further fall in Japan      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent      DETROIT   Sales of new cars and light trucks in the US rose by more than 8 per cent last year to around 14.2m, the highest level since 1989, according to provisional industry figures. Sales rose by 1.1m from 13.1m in 1992 and 12.5m in 1991, the low point of the last recession. The US market peaked at 16.3m in 1986. The strengthening recovery in the US new vehicle market is in stark contrast to the steep fall in demand in Europe last year and the further drop in new vehicle sales in Japan, where demand has fallen for three years in succession. The increase in sales in the US has been driven by the surge in demand for light trucks, such as pick-ups, mini-vans (multi-purpose vehicles), vans and four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles, now accounting for about 40 per cent of the US passenger vehicle market. Light truck sales, still dominated by the big three US vehicle makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, rose 16 per cent last year to a record 5.7m; car sales rose 4 per cent to 8.5m. US carmakers outperformed the market with a 10.4 per cent increase in new vehicle sales. Japanese carmakers have been forced to increase prices faster than their US rivals. Under pressure from the strong appreciation in the value of the yen, the Japanese have lost market share. The rapid improvement in the fortunes of the domestic US vehicle makers was led by Chrysler, the smallest of the big three, which increased its total vehicle sales 19.9 per cent to 2.047m from 1.71m a year earlier. Sales of light trucks by Chrysler accounted for 59 per cent of its total sales volume last year but the company is strengthening its position in the car market with the launch of a series of new cars this year, including the Neon small car and the Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus large family cars, which were unveiled this week at the Detroit motor show. Chrysler, which is undertaking a rapid renewal of its product range, increased its car sales last year by 23.1 per cent to 834,132, while its light truck sales rose 17.8 per cent to 1.2m. Ford also performed strongly and accounted for five of the top 10 best-selling vehicles in the US. Its full-sized F-series pick-up was the best-selling vehicle in the US at 565,000, while the Ford Taurus was the best-selling car at 360,000, ahead of the Honda Accord at 330,000. Ford's total vehicle sales increased 12 per cent to 3.6m. Its car sales increased by 6 per cent to 1.878m, while light truck sales rose by 19.4 per cent to 1.68m. General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle maker, suffered a further small erosion of its US market share to about 33 per cent. Its total vehicle sales rose 5.9 per cent to 4.7m. GM, whose North American automotive operations are being drastically restructured after several years of heavy losses, increased its new car sales by 2 per cent to 2.93m, while its truck sales increased 13 per cent to 1.79m. Among the Japanese car makers, Honda's sales in the US fell 7.3 per cent last year to 717,000. Total vehicle sales by Toyota, including its Lexus luxury car division, increased 1.3 per cent to 1.033m. Sales of cars under the Toyota brand fell 2.1 per cent. Nissan, the second biggest Japanese car maker, staged a strong recovery after falling behind its Japanese rivals in the US, and its total sales, including the Infiniti luxury car division, rose 17.9 per cent to 680,000.

The move seeks to push railway development to catch up with  rapid economic growth.    The policies will allow railway joint ventures to be set up  and independently managed. Such commercial railways will have  much more say in setting prices than State-run ones, a ministry  official said.    The joint ventures will enjoy a wide spectrum of  ""attractive""  treatment, such as pricing power and a wider business scope,  such as railside real estate developments, to help balance  foreign exchange.    ""This will be a stimulus to foreign firms which are still  hesitant to invest in railways with huge input and lengthy  construction periods,"" said An Shunyi, deputy head of the  ministry's Foreign Capital and Technical Import Office.    The coastal regions have been targeted with a list of  lucrative rail projects for foreign investment, he said. The  projects will not be revealed for several months.    Many experts suggest that the envisioned Beijing-Shanghai  high-speed railway should be on the list. But the more than $10  billion project still awaits final State approval.    Negotiations are taking place with an American firm to  co-build the Zhangzhou-Chaozhou-Shantou line, which will stretch  more than 300 kilometres in Fujian and Guangdong provinces.    And talks are continuing with a Canadian company on the  100-kilometre Yantai-Lancun line in Shandong Province.    The government is also trying to soak up more overseas  preferential loans to finance its modern railway network,  according to An.    A total $3.7 billion from the Japanese Government and World  Bank since 1980 has helped China complete 5,700 kilometres in  new lines, rebuild 6,500 kilometres of old ones, and revamped  six rolling stock plants.    The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will grant a $200 million  loan for technical enhancement of the Beijing-Kowloon line,  which is under intense construction.    The agreement for the project is scheduled to be signed next  month in Manila, signaling ADB's growing interest in China's  national railways, rather than local lines.    The Japanese Government is preparing $2 billion as its  fourth  railway loan parcel to China. Agreements will be struck next  Summer.    China will use the blessing to update the existing  Zhuzhou-Guiyang line in the southwest, and build a new  240-kilomtre line linking Xian and Ankang in the northwest.    It will also cover a railway and highway bridge spanning the  Yangtze at Wuhu of Anhui Province, and probably the  Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail project.     "
0,FT942-1196 ,"FT942-1196 _AN-EFZARABGFT 940625   FT  25 JUN 94 / Judge's ruling reopens dam row      By JAMES BLITZ   A leading UK pressure group yesterday won the first round in a legal battle to halt Britain's funding of Malaysia's Pergau dam project. The World Development Movement, a pressure group on Third World issues, was granted its application for a judicial review of the decision by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to fund the project. The group is calling for the review on the grounds that the offer of Pounds 234m for the dam broke British law, which states that aid money can only be spent on beneficial economic projects. Lawyers for the group are also pressing the High Court to block the Pounds 200m that is yet to be paid to the Malaysian government under the agreement signed by Mr Hurd. Mr Ben Jackson, the campaign co-ordinator, said the decision by Mr Justice Auld to grant the application was 'a major victory' for his movement. Mr Hurd's lawyers did not oppose the granting of leave for the application. But his counsel, Mr Stephen Richards, said the full hearing later this year would be contested 'with vigour'. The High Court decision re-opens the row over the funding of the Pergau dam at a time when the UK is anxious to restore trade relations with Malaysia. Much of the controversy over the project earlier this year was focused on whether the government had broken its own guidelines in 1988 by linking the offer of aid to a defence deal worth about Pounds 1bn. Mr Hurd has admitted there was a 'temporary entanglement' between the two deals but that they were both pursued separately later. The World Development Movement is challenging Mr Hurd on the broader point that his decision in 1991 to fund the project broke the Overseas Development and Co-operation Act. Mr Nigel Pleming QC, for the group, said that, under the act, aid could be given only 'for the purpose of promoting the development or maintaining the economy of a country or the welfare of its people'. Mr Hurd had been informed by his officials that the project was uneconomic. Sir Timothy Lankester, the former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, told the foreign secretary that the dam was an 'abuse of the aid programme', but was overruled by Mr Hurd on the basis of 'wider considerations'. The group acknowledged that because it is not a charity, it would need substantial donations from the public to proceed with the case.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT943-15724 ,"FT943-15724 _AN-EGGDZAHBFT 940707   FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (7): Overseas markets remain crucial - In spite of a recovery on home ground, Andrew Baxter finds that the proportion of sales going abroad must remain high if manufacturers are to maintain their pole position in the industry / UK construction equipment      By ANDREW BAXTER   The UK is one of Europe's most important centres for the manufacture of construction equipment, and exports have been a vital element in achieving and maintaining that position. Whether British or foreign-owned, equipment manufacturers usually export 50-80 per cent of their products, although the percentage varies depending on the companies, the product lines and the state of the UK market. The traditional boom-and-bust cycle in the UK construction industry means that in a recession as deep and long as the most recent one, the percentage of sales going to the home market will inevitably fall. The importance of strong positions in as many export markets as possible cannot, therefore, be overstated. With domestic market conditions recovering strongly from the trough of recession, and some continental markets still flat, the proportion of sales going to export markets could fall back for some companies - but not by much. This is because of the strength of markets such as the US - which recovered from recession a year earlier than the UK - and continuing growth in markets, such as those in south-east Asia, which have been immune to recession. Statistics from the London-based Corporate Intelligence Group's off-highway research division emphasise the importance of exports - whatever the conditions in the home market. Last year, it says, 16,070 backhoe loaders were produced in the UK. Of these just 2,667 were sold in the domestic market. As for mini-excavators, UK factories produced 2,954, of which 643 were sold in the UK. In the smaller, more specialist category of asphalt finishers for roadmaking, just 25 of the 220 units produced in the UK were also sold there. The effects of the UK construction industry recession are illustrated by statistics for rough-terrain lift trucks. In 1991, just 850 of the 3,250 UK-produced units were sold in the UK. Two years later, 2,103 of the 3,795 units manufactured in the UK went to the domestic market. At J. C. Bamford, the largest UK-owned construction equipment producer, overseas sales have hovered between Pounds 233.5m and Pounds 271.9m in the past five years. UK sales, meanwhile, have been much more volatile, ranging between Pounds 149.4m and Pounds 78.8m over the same period. JCB's direct exports were up nearly 40 per cent in the first five months of this year, compared with the same period of 1993. Exports to North America have more than doubled, while those to continental Europe  - viewed by JCB as its 'home market' - rose by 25 per cent as markets emerged from recession. A long-term growth prospect for JCB, meanwhile, is the Asia Pacific region, which accounts for 6 per cent of exports. Sales in the first five months soared by 64 per cent. At Fermec, the Manchester-based producer better known by its MF Industrial brand, exports represent more than 80 per cent of its business. In the first five months of this year, exports to North America have risen more than 400 per cent while sales to the rest of the world beyond Europe - mainly Australia, Thailand and Israel - have more than doubled. Fermec attributes the success to its new range of backhoe loaders and, in North America, to a new supply agreement with Kobelco America, the Japanese-owned distribution company. Foreign-owned producers are also heavy exporters from their UK plants. Caterpillar UK, the British part of the world's biggest construction equipment producer, had sales of Pounds 235.4m in the period from December 1992 to November 1993. Of this, Pounds 28.8m derived from the UK, Pounds 66.2m from continental Europe, Pounds 89.2m from the US and Pounds 51.2m from elsewhere. Komatsu, the world's second biggest producer, has its European factory for hydraulic excavators at Birtley near Newcastle. Of nearly 1,200 units produced last year, 272 went to the UK market, but that was dwarfed by the 615 units which went to Germany. Further north, the Scottish contribution to the exports picture should not be ignored. Lanarkshire-based Atlas Hydraulic Loaders says that more than 52 per cent of its 1993 sales were exports, the bulk going to the continent and Germany in particular. Excluding exceptional sales to eastern Germany in the first six months of last year, this year's exports by Atlas, part of Germany's Atlas Weyhausen, are ahead of 1993's. Exports to France are up 220 per cent, to the Netherlands up 50 per cent, to Australia up 50 per cent and to Chile up 67 per cent. Exports to the Gulf states have fallen considerably, but this is not an important market for Atlas. At Terex in Motherwell, at least 70 per cent of the dumptrucks, loaders, scrapers and other plant made by the US-owned company is exported. The plant, which was once at the periphery of Terex, is now its global centre for construction equipment. A supply agreement with OK in Germany accounts for a significant part of exports, but China is probably the plant's biggest market - because of equipment that is shipped complete and broken down kits which are supplied to a joint venture in China that assembles one of the Terex rigid dumptruck models.

Sales for the period fell 14 per cent to Y321.2bn, with sales of basic chemicals down 18 per cent, of aluminium 26 per cent, and of speciality chemicals 2 per cent lower. Demand for basic chemicals such as plastics and monomers has weakened in the Japanese car and domestic appliance industries, which have reduced output this year because of a rapid increase in inventories. Sales of aluminium products were weakened by the sharp fall in building starts during the first half. Domestic sales of specialty chemicals remained strong, but exports were bruised by the appreciation of the yen and the international recession. Sales of agricultural chemicals fell 4 per cent, with an increase in domestic sales of feed ingredients and public hygiene chemicals outweighed by a decrease in exports. Sumitomo had aimed for a pre-tax profit of Y15bn, but the weakening of the Japanese economy in recent months has forced most companies to revise their estimates. For the full year to end December, Sumitomo is forecasting sales of Y640bn, down 8.7 per cent, and a pre-tax profit of Y14bn, down 43 per cent, though even those forecasts may prove optimistic.

The company, which controls Hugo Boss, Germany's biggest menswear designer, yesterday reported a 74 per cent decline in net earnings to L10.2bn (Dollars 6m), against L39.8bn in 1992. Net earnings in 1991 were L40.1bn. Sales were little changed at L1,953bn, against L1,955bn, of which three-quarters came from the European Union. The parent company announced a net profit of L4.4bn, compared with the 1992 loss of L44.7bn, which was struck only after some L70bn of extraordinary provisions. Sales of the parent company fell 8.3 per cent to L956bn, and operating profits were cut to L25.9bn from L55.2bn. Marzotto's caution was reflected in its decision to recommend a cut in dividends, to L150 per ordinary share from L280. However, the group said orders were up in the first quarter of 1994, both in Italy and in overseas markets. The end-March order book was worth L774bn, nearly 20 per cent higher than at the same time last year. Sales at the same date had reached L591bn, down 2 per cent on the first quarter of 1992. The company explained that it was in Italy - particularly in the market for classic men's clothing - that Marzotto felt the pinch last year. The group said the downturn had offset growth in net profits from its textile manufacturing subsidiaries, and its holdings in Hugo Boss, and Linificio, a thread manufacturer. Marzotto owns nearly 64 per cent of the voting stock of Hugo Boss, which last month announced 1993 profits 73 per cent higher at DM76.5m (Dollars 44.5m).   Companies:-  Marzotto.

In 1993 the Chinese mainland produced 1.31 million  automobiles, including 300,000 sedans. One-third of that number  was manufactured by plants in Shanghai and Jiangsu, Hubei,  Jiangxi and Sichuan Provinces.    Shanghai Volkswagen, a Sino-German joint-venture, the  Nanjing  General Automobile Plant, a Sino-Italian joint-venture, and the  state-owned Yangzhou General Bus Plant have become the main  producers of sedans, trucks and buses.    Shanghai Volkswagen turned out 100,000 ""Santana"" sedans last  year.    Auto production is now the mainstay industry in Shanghai,  Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi and Sichuan.    Many of these factories have enjoyed good economic returns  in  recent years, with profits exceeding 100 million yuan each.    The development of the technology-intensive auto industry  has  boosted the growth of related support businesses. Shanghai  Volkswagen has 200 factories making parts for it which are  involved in a dozen industrial sectors and are scattered along  the Chang Jiang or in nearby areas.    Now 80 percent of the parts on a Santana sedan are made in  these support factories.    Shanghai Volkswagen is expected to roll 200,000 Santanas off  the line this year, double last year's figure.    The central government has placed priority on the auto  industry and is determined to support its development for a long  time to come.    Last year the output value of the 116 auto manufacturers on  the mainland accounted for about three percent of the gross  industrial output value in the country.    However, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said recently that ""China's  light-duty auto industry, due to its low technology and  productivity, still has a long way to go before becoming a  full- fledged producer.""    Overseas auto corporations have realized the needs and  potential of the Chinese market and are pouring hefty investment  into the domestic manufacturers along the Chang Jiang.    The French Renault auto company has invested 100 million  U.S.  dollars jointly with a local partner in Hubei to produce  mini-vans. The project is expected to start production this  September and make 40,000 mini-vans annually.    Most of the Sino-foreign joint ventures have decided to  increase production or develop new models.    Overseas auto parts makers are also trying to gain a  foothold  in China. A company from the United States has invested 160  million U.S. dollars to set up 15 auto parts manufacturers.    Experts here said that since the auto industry involves many  other industries, the rapid expansion of Sino-foreign joint  ventures and state-owned auto plants is bound to edge out those  smaller, less competitive local counterparts.

For the three months to September 30, Bristol-Myers had net income of Dollars 608m or Dollars 1.18 a share on sales of Dollars 2.86bn. A year earlier, it earned Dollars 589.2m, or Dollars 1.14 on sales of Dollars 2.95bn, including earnings from discontinued operations of Dollars 17.4m. Like its competitors, Bristol Myers has been hit by pressure to reduce drugs prices. The company blamed unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations and government costs containment measures in some European countries for its sales shortfall in the quarter. Mr Richard Gelb, chairman and chief executive, also blamed the decline on a comparison with a very strong third quarter for pharmaceutical sales last year. In the latest quarter, Bristol Myers' pharmaceutical sales fell 4 per cent in spite of higher sales for several new products including its cholesterol-lowering Pravachol, its Videx AIDS medication and the Taxol cancer-fighting drug. Sales of Capoten, a cardiovascular drug, continued to erode. Sales of medical devices were flat, while consumer product sales dropped 3 per cent, reflecting strong competition in the US analgesics and hair care markets. For the nine months, net earnings were Dollars 1.7bn, or Dollars 3.30, on sales of Dollars 8.42bn. In the same period of 1992, the company earned Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 2.67 including earnings from its Drackett household products business which was sold in December and from a charge of Dollars 246m for accounting changes. Earnings from continuing operations rose 8 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 1.58bn. Sales edged up to Dollars 8.42bn from Dollars 8.33bn.   Companies:-  Bristol-Myers Squibb.

By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      At the urging of the Tobacco Institute and a Virginia congressman, a nationally  acclaimed scientist from UC San Diego has been removed from an Environmental  Protection Agency panel reviewing the effects of secondhand cigarette smoke.    The scientist, Dr. David M. Burns, an associate clinical professor of medicine  and a pulmonary specialist at UC San Diego Medical Center, has a been outspoken  about the perils of smoking.    ""I've never seen anything like this,"" said Steven Bayard, manager of the EPA  project to assess the health risks of passive smoking.    ""I'm disturbed about this,"" Bayard said Thursday.

The EPA reports, which analyze the effects of passive cigarette smoke  on adults, children and people in the workplace, are scientifically solid,  Burns said.    Since the late 1970s, Burns, 43, has served as a senior editor and reviewer of  the surgeon general's smoking reports. Former U.S. Surgeon General C.

Barnes, a former EPA staff scientist, told both Burns and The Times that while  Burns has not technically been removed from the panel -- because the group does  not yet officially exist -- the scientist will not serve on the committee.    Barnes acknowledged that tobacco industry representatives came to see him two  or three times to object to Burns.

The company said the rising yen and strong sales of growth hormone to the Japanese market made a significant contribution to the performance. Earnings per share increased to DKr38.01 from DKr34.12, and return on equity was 12.7 per cent. An unchanged DKr4-a-share dividend was to be paid. The improved turnover stemmed party from a better product mix, Novo said. However, 40 per cent of the sales rise was attributed to Japan, to which sales improved 43 per cent. The figure takes into account a 23 per cent appreciation of the yen against the krone. The share of group sales going to Japan increased to 17 per cent from 14 per cent. Sales of human growth hormone to Japan were especially strong, the company said. The performance was in line with company forecasts. A year ago, Novo said pre-tax profits would fall below the 15 per cent annual growth which the group seeks to achieve. For 1994, Novo expects a larger increase in pre-tax profits than last year, assuming currencies remain stable and prices on securities markets remain unchanged. Health care division sales last year increased by 16 per cent to DKr8.22bn, with insulin and diabetes care sales ahead by 11 per cent. Sales of biopharmaceuticals products, including growth hormone, rose by 34 per cent, and other pharmaceuticals by 30 per cent, boosted by the introduction of a new anti-depressant in the Nordic markets. Sales of bio-industrial products, including enzymes, were up by 8 per cent to DKr3.34bn. Capital expenditure reached a record DKr2.39bn, where it is expected to remain in 1994.

The Nikkei 225 average closed 29.91 up at 19,336.57 after moving between 19,372.67 and 19,284.76. Overseas investors were net sellers for the eighth consecutive trading day. Analysts said foreign fund managers were securing profits ahead of the close of the business year in December. Buying orders placed in the afternoon by domestic institutions provided underlying support. Volume came to 210m shares, against 256m. Activity remained light due to the lack of fresh news. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 2.11 at 1,527.61 and the Nikkei 300 firmed 0.54 to 280.75. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 7.83 to 1,252.69. Overseas investors sold steels, while arbitrage buying and purchases by individuals of machinery stocks supported share prices. The brief breakdown of the stock exchange's computer in the morning session had minimal impact other than triggering buying by dealers due to the lack of prior activity. Mitsubishi Estate, a property developer which owns 80 per cent of the Rockefeller Group, of the US, fell Y50 to Y1,070. Reports in the US that Rockefeller Center, a member of the Rockefeller Group, could default on its mortgage payment discouraged investors. Mitsubishi refused to comment on the reports. Seiyu, the supermarket chain, weakened Y100 to Y1,200 on reports that it would bail out its affiliated consumer credit company. The retailer said it had not yet decided on providing financial aid. Higher raw metal prices supported mining and non-ferrous metal stocks. Sumitomo Metal Mining advanced Y7 to Y941 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting added Y6 at Y439. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, resisted selling by overseas investors and finished Y1 firmer at Y386. Speculative buying supported Hoya, an optical and electronic equipment maker, which climbed Y50 to Y2,490. Kayaba Industry, an auto parts maker, rose Y21 to Y663. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 34.75 to 21,444.03 in volume of 70.9m shares. Roundup Tuesday's US interest rates rise was still having some effect on the region. HONG KONG was led down by interest rate-sensitive property stocks. The Hang Seng index declined 73.96 or 0.8 per cent to 9,518.28. Turnover decreased to HKDollars 2.8bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 3.6bn. Among property issues, Cheung Kong dropped 70 cents to HKDollars 37.20, Sun Hung Kai Properties 50 cents to HKDollars 57.75 and New World Development 40 cents to HKDollars 25.20. Local retail interest rates were expected to rise after today's meeting of the Association of Banks. SINGAPORE saw institutional interest in leading blue chips, and the Straits Times Industrial index put on 11.47 at 2,357.97. Brokers said a 50 basis-point increase in interest rates by the United Overseas Bank was largely discounted. SEOUL was supported by a late spurt of institutional buying. The composite index added a net 1.88 at 1,120.63, having rallied from a day's low of 1,115.39. Citizens National Bank went limit up, gaining Won1,000 at Won24,000, while Shinhan Bank set a record volume with 853,880 shares traded, and moved forward Won500 to Won24,100. TAIPEI was easier as turnover dwindled amid continued nervousness regarding the outcome of next month's elections. The weighted index slipped 48.90 to 6,297.88 as turnover dropped to TDollars 19.5bn, the lowest level since TDollars 19.0bn on October 21, 1993. Stocks linked to the Hualon group, which had risen in recent sessions, retreated on profit-taking: Hualon Preferred receded TDollars 2.40 or 4.9 per cent to TDollars 46.60. MANILA made a modest gain of 2.65 in the composite index to 2,904.100, largely on a rebound in PLDT shares of 2.7 per cent, spurred by its Dollars 1 rise in New York overnight. The mining sector shed 43.6 to 5,250.9 on profit-taking. KUALA LUMPUR extended its losses as profit-taking wiped out most of the gains made earlier in the week. The composite index dipped 10.67 or 1 per cent to 1,052.48. Volume was a thin 102m shares. Granite Industries dominated activity, tumbling MDollars 1.30 to MDollars 6.40 in volume of 15m shares. Granite said it planned to acquire timber and hotel assets which would result in a reverse takeover of the company by Malaysian businessman Ting Pek Khiing. SYDNEY ended sharply lower on continued bearishness over rising bond yields. The All Ordinaries index fell 17.9 to 1,922.4 in turnover of ADollars 550m. BHP finished 8 cents down at ADollars 18.96. NAB dropped 32 cents to ADollars 10.36 in spite of a bigger than expected rise in the final dividend. WELLINGTON closed higher, but was off its best level for the day. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 10.18 at 2,048.21, after touching 2,054.99. Telecom put on 5 cents at NZDollars 5.44 ahead of going ex-dividend on Monday.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

Operating income grew a faster 7 per cent to SFr1.36bn on sales up 2 per cent to SFr8.2bn, 8 per cent higher in local currencies. But the net financial result tumbled from a SFr79m profit to a SFr90m loss because of price declines of securities held. Sandoz expected sales trends in leading markets to remain favourable in the second half and operating income to 'continue its upward path'. Gerber would be consolidated from August 25. Mr Raymund Breu, Sandoz finance director, said the baby food group would add Dollars 410m to group sales and Dollars 70m to operating income this year. At net income level, it would have no effect this year or in 1995. Group volume growth was 4.6 per cent in the first half, with a 10 per cent rise from agricultural chemicals, 5 per cent from construction and 4 per cent from both pharmaceuticals and nutrition divisions. Prices were squeezed, so the improvement in the operating margin from 15.9 per cent to 16.5 per cent came from volume and cost improvements. Sales of the pharmaceuticals division were down 1 per cent to SFr3.59bn, reflecting government enforced price cuts in some countries and the strong Swiss franc. Sales of the nutrition division soared 29 per cent to SFr1.15bn, largely as a result of acquisitions last year. Sales in the chemicals and environment sector were flat at SFr2.76bn, with gains in agriculture and construction offsetting an 8 per cent slide in chemical sales, especially those to textile and paper makers.

0,FT922-13722 ,"FT922-13722 _AN-CDJA7AA1FT 920410   FT  10 APR 92 / Manila comes to terms with its workersabroad      By JOSE GALANG      MANILA   SOME 220 Filipino domestic servants are detained at the Philippine embassy in Kuwait, awaiting repatriation after fleeing employers whom they had accused of maltreatment. The Philippines government has expressed surprise, however, not at complaints of abuse, but that the women are in Kuwait - the government outlawed the sending of servants there in 1989 and plans to investigate how they got jobs in Kuwait illegally. Illegal employment is just one of many problems that have accompanied the increase in Filipinos working abroad. Despite the problems they have to contend with, including rape, physical abuse, non-payment of wages, infidelity of spouses left behind and even racial discrimination, Philippine workers still go abroad in droves, in search of jobs which their economy cannot provide. Overseas workers send home more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) a year, according to official estimates, although other informal remittances could amount to another Dollars 500m. These revenues exceed earnings of the country's leading merchandise exports, such as garments at Dollars 2.2bn and semiconductors' Dollars 1.5bn. Throughout the Middle East, Europe, US and Asia, an estimated 1.2m Filipinos work as construction workers, seamen, hospital staff, domestic servants or entertainers. A teacher can earn six times as much as a servant in Hong Kong as in a public school in Manila. A report by the Central Bank said that increased remittances helped offset a Dollars 3.2bn trade deficit last year and contributed to a Dollars 1.4bn surplus in the balance-of-payments position. The overseas workers' contribution to the economy is expected to expand further in the coming years, according to Mr Jose Sarmiento, head of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). Overseas employment will remain an attractive option as long as Philippine economic growth remains slow. Last year, about 2.4m people, or 9.5 per cent of the work force of 25.58m, had no job and an estimated 750,000 young people join the labour force each year. Employment of workers abroad increased last year, with POEA-approved departures reaching 615,019, an increase of 38 per cent from 1990, with a further increase expected this year. While the Middle East will remain 'a healthy market', he said, POEA is looking at Japan and South Korea, where serious labour shortages are already curtailing industrial expansion. Representatives from Japanese companies have already called on the POEA chief and expressed interest in hiring Filipino workers even though they are awaiting Japanese government policy allowing the entry of foreign workers. When that happens, Mr Sarmiento said, the Philippines should enjoy a head-start. Whether the government can cope with the corresponding increase in social problems related to overseas employment is another matter, however. Embassies' response to cases involving Filipino expatriates have been tentative - bordering on indifference, according to some employers. Meanwhile, a company belonging to Philippines businessman Mr Joseph Noel Ducat has set up a foundation, with financial help from foreign partners, that aims to give help to Filipino migrant workers in case of emergencies and to establish ties with employers to prevent abuse. Mr Ducat was captured, with two American companions, by Iraqi troops along the Iraq-Kuwait border during the Gulf war. He says attempts to assist him were snubbed by embassy staff and Foreign Ministry officials in Manila. Mr Sarmiento believes that Philippine diplomats, particularly in countries that hire big numbers of Filipino workers, 'should now look at labour as a principal function'. For instance, in the Middle East, the POEA chief notes, 'practically all the oilfields are manned by Filipino workers. Most of the households of the royal families are staffed by Filipino domestics. So are hospitals, airports, and even the bureaucracy.' On the basis of these 'strategic positions', he says, 'we should develop a new diplomacy consistent with this reality.' Domestic-help diplomacy could be unfolding in the Philippines.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

In announcing the plea, federal prosecutors said a seven-count indictment was  brought against an attorney whose firm once worked for Ashland, for his alleged  role in the scheme in which Atkins pleaded guilty.    Atkins, 65, of North Palm Beach, Fla., pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to  conspiracy and wire fraud. Could face a maximum of 10 years in prison and a  $500,000 fine when he is sentenced Nov. 16.    Atkins was Ashland's chairman and chief executive from 1974 until 1981. He was  a consultant to Ashland, earning $425,000 a year, from 1981 to 1984.    U.S. Atty. Benito Romano said Atkins and the lawyer, Charles D. Barnett, were  involved in a secret scheme to defraud Ashland by attempting to sell  confidential papers to National Iranian Oil Co.    The documents dealt with the 1979 sale of $283 million in crude oil from the  Iranian company to Ashland Overseas Trading Ltd., a Ashland subsidiary in  Bermuda. Court papers said Ashland never paid for the oil.    In 1982, while he was a paid consultant, Atkins received about 260 privileged  documents about the oil sale through an unidentified Ashland employee, Romano  said.    According to the indictment against Barnett, Atkins and Barnett made repeated  attempts, from 1982 until 1988, to sell the documents and Atkins' consulting  services to the Iranian company. They had planned to use a Swiss bank account  to receive their payment, it said.    As compensation, Atkins and Barnett asked for 25% of what the Iranian company  recovered from Ashland, the indictment alleged.    In court Thursday, Atkins said the deal was never final, although  representatives of the Iranian company were allowed to see the documents in  1985.    After seeing the papers, National Iranian Oil Co. sued Ashland and Ashland  Overseas for payment on the oil. Those suits, filed in Mississippi and Bermuda,  were settled last week when Ashland agreed to pay $325 million, said Assistant  U.S. Atty. Herve Gouraige.    Neither Ashland nor National Iranian Oil Co. was charged with any wrongdoing.  Romano praised Ashland for cooperating in the investigation.

0,FT934-13863 ,"FT934-13863 _AN-DJTC2ABIFT 931020   FT  20 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Fine-tuning in the overseas risk business  -A new chief at the Overseas Private Investment Corp      By LISA BRANSTEN   IN a corner behind the door to Ms Ruth Harkin's office sits a pile of framed maps of the world, which the new head of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation has not yet had time to hang. 'My personal imprint on the office so far is the paperwork on my desk,' she says, several months after her June 2 swearing in. In April President Bill Clinton launched Opic on its most challenging venture to date: providing loans, loan guarantees and risk insurance to US companies going in to the former Soviet Union, as part of the administration's Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) Russian aid package. Opic hopes to convert Dollars 40m of government funds into more than Dollars 1bn in loan guarantees, new loans and equity projects in Russia over the next two years. Like his Republican predecessor, the new president sees Opic as a foreign policy tool. Especially in the current cash-strapped era it is easier to encourage business to go abroad and contribute to development efforts than to make direct appropriations of foreign aid. In 1992 the 22-year-old agency received its first congressional appropriation. Since then it has done something almost unheard of in the halls of government: return the money. This year, Ms Harkin says, she will give back about Dollars 17m to Congress. The agency's main mission is to provide insurance against currency problems, political violence and expropriations to companies seeking to invest abroad. It functions much like a private insurer collecting fees from the organisations it insures. Opic also offers financial services such as direct loans to businesses and fee-earning advisory services. The agency has attracted a degree of controversy, with labour unions arguing it is encouraging 'runaway plants' that cost US jobs. During the 1992 election campaign the Clinton camp lambasted Opic, along with the Agency for International Development, for encouraging manufacturers to relocate their plants in Central America. But business believes it has found a champion in Ms Harkin, according to Mr Willard Workman, vice-president of the US Chamber of Commerce. The business community feels the Department of Labour is resistant to foreign investment because of the consequent job losses at home. 'We think that's a specious argument because there are going to be some jobs created in Guatemala, but there are also going to be jobs created here to oversee that investment,' says Mr Workman. However, labour, which is not such a natural ally for Opic, has expressed hope that Ms Harkin will be more sensitive to job-loss issues, in that her husband, democratic Senator Tom Harkin, has always been a strong union supporter. Ms Harkin said she would not encourage companies to take plants abroad, but she takes a business-oriented approach to whether moving a factory costs American jobs. Factories moving abroad can still create jobs at home, she says, because 'you are utilising the local workforce, but at the same time you are bringing over American equipment, which means American jobs.' The battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement has served to heighten sensitivities about Opic policies, with labour and environmental groups scrutinising US trade policy more closely than before. 'Given the heated debate about Nafta there is a change in the nature of the debate that was not there in the past,' says Dr Robert Lawrence, a professor of economics at Harvard University. Thus far, however, Ms Harkin has earned cautious support from factions which are fighting tooth and nail over the agreement. One of the agency's newest initiatives is an environmental growth fund that Opic will use to encourage US 'envirotech' companies to help clean pollution abroad - a project which Ms Harkin sees as the agency's biggest departure from the Bush era. Overall, Ms Harkin believes her role is to fine-tune rather than overhaul the agency, which she describes as 'a jewel in terms of its efficiency and the calibre of its employees'. It is a job quite different from that confronting the head of the troubled Agency for International Development, a job Ms Harkin went after but did not get. 'The intrigue at AID was on a totally different level,' she said. 'Many people have told me that I am very fortunate (not to be at AID) and I believe them.'

Sales of new commercial vehicles rose 7.7 per cent last month, but that was too little to prevent sales for the year as a whole falling below 1991 levels. Sales totalled 201,186 in 1992, a drop of 3.75 per cent on the previous year's 209,021. Most manufacturers are now expecting a market increase approaching 10 per cent this year. The UK industry was unable to prevent a further small imports rise last year. Their market share rose to 36.32 per cent from 35.51 per cent in 1991.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The mining complex uses Brazilian technology  and employs over 100 workers.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 10 May reports that 1,630  caballerias of tobacco in Pinar del Rio will be financed by the  Spanish Tobacco Company. The southern part of Pinar del Rio  Province, including San Luis and Consolacion del Sur  Municipalities, was chosen by the Spanish Tobacco Company for  financing in a project that will bring in hard currency. The  financing is excellent because Cuba can use the money however it  deems necessary -- e.g., for fertilizers, herbicides, shoes, or  clothing -- so as to ensure that the land produces maximally. A  local official said the financing will be repaid in tobacco.    Radio Reloj at 1400 GMT on 11 May reports that workers from  the Sergio Soto Refinery in Cabaiguan, Sancti Spiritus Province,  have produced, experimentally, the first few tons of oil for  electric transformers. This will mean a substantial contribution  to the national economy. This oil, produced from crude extracted  from deposits in the vicinity of Cristales and Pina, is  essential for electric transformers. The Sergio Soto Refinery  also produces other important petroleum by-products, such as  basic oil.    Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on  12 May report that following significant improvements, the  Hermanos Diaz Oil Refinery in Santiago de Cuba has attained a  production capability that allows this refinery to take up the  slack while the Nico Lopez Oil Refinery in Havana undergoes  general maintenance.    Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 11 May reports that potato  production in Pinar del Rio Province increased by 30,000  quintals in 1994 as compared to 1993. More than 203,000 quintals  have been harvested. According to the Pinar del Rio Province  Agriculture Ministry office, the country's cold-storage  facilities contain enough potatoes to supply the population for  the rest of the year.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 12 May reports that there are  approximately 10,000 self-employed people in Matanzas Province,  or 15 percent of the national total. ""Of these 10,000 people, 60  percent are men; 2,000 are women; 2,000 are retirees. Some 1,500  of the women are housewives, and almost 5,000 people are current  job-holders."" There are approximately 100 applications for self-  employment permits weekly.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 13 May reports that since its  reorganization, Cubanacan Incorporated has a new transport  company called (Veracuba). The report adds that the transport  management in 1993 obtained an income of more than $13 million  and projects an income between $16 and $17 million in 1994. This  will represent an increase of between 20 and 25 percent over the  same period the previous year. Thus, after six years of work,  the company has achieved an increase of between 30 and 40  percent. The new company is prepared to provide more and better  services with a very young, efficient, and trained personnel who  can speak several languages.    In the same newscast Radio Rebelde reports that 140 houses  have been built in Holguin to shelter agricultural and livestock  workers. These are the first of 1,000 houses to be built in the  province this year. The report adds that tobacco production is  expected to increase by approximately 40,000 quintals in Pinar  del Rio. In Camaguey sugarcane workers intend to plant 1,765  caballerias during May. The report concludes by announcing a  plan for the construction of seven small hydroelectric plants in  Granma Province to increase current generating capacity by 11.6  megawatts/hour.     "

The Japan Automobile Dealers Association said sales of cars,  trucks and buses, excluding minivehicles, totaled 4,887,179  vehicles, down 8.4 percent from the previous year. The figure  was the lowest since 1987 when sales totaled about 4,344,000  vehicles, the association said. Sales declined in all  categories for the first time since 1980, underscoring the  severity of the automobile market slump, association officials  said. They said there is little possibility of market recovery  at least until March, with expected sales for 1994 inching up to  around 5 million vehicles.    Of the 1993 total, passenger cars accounted for 3,427,088  vehicles, down 6.9 percent, posting the third straight  year-to-year fall, the association said.    It said sales of cars with engine capacity of over 2 liters  dipped 4.2 percent from the year before to 683,763 while those  of subcompact cars fell 7.5 percent to 2,743,325.    The association said sales of trucks were down 11.7 percent  at 1,632,376 while those of buses totaled 19,025, down 11.8  percent.    Imported car sales grew 9.1 percent to 201,484 vehicles, the  association said. Among 11 major automakers, only three --  Daihatsu Motor Co., Suzuki Motor Corp. and Fuji Heavy Industries  Ltd. -- posted sales growth, the association said.    Industry leader Toyota Motor Corp. suffered a 7.7 percent  drop in sales while sales of Nissan Motor Co., Mazda Motor Corp.  and Honda Motor Co. declined 8.4 percent, 16.8 percent and 14.9  percent, respectively. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s sales also  declined 7.2 percent.    In December, the association said, sales totaled 345,715  vehicles, down 11.1 percent from the year before and down 13.8  percent from the preceding month. It was the ninth straight  month that sales dropped from the year-before levels, the  association said.    Sales of passenger cars slumped 9.3 percent to 251,451 while  those of trucks and buses were down 15.6 percent and 12.3  percent, respectively, at 93,354 and 910, [as received] it said.     "

The groups were helped by improved drugs sales and the weakness of the dollar overseas. Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world's second-biggest drugs company which was formed after an Dollars 11.5bn merger in 1989, turned in a 20 per cent improvement in first-quarter net earnings on an 11 per cent improvement in sales. In the three months ended March, the New York-based company had net profits of Dollars 492.6m or 94 cents a share on sales of Dollars 2.73bn, compared with income of Dollars 409.1m or 78 cents on sales of Dollars 2.46bn a year earlier. Sales were helped by favourable foreign exchange translations, which contributed two percentage points to the improvement in the 1991 quarter. Earnings before taxes rose 18.4 per cent to Dollars 703.7m from Dollars 594.6m. Mr Richard Gelb, chairman and chief executive, said international sales in the 1991 quarter increased 14 per cent, compared with a 9 per cent improvement in domestic sales. Sales of pharmaceuticals and medical devices were particularly strong. Warner-Lambert, a US pharmaceuticals and non-prescription health products group, also reported strong first-quarter earnings. Net income grew 16 per cent to Dollars 139.5m or Dollars 1.04 a share from Dollars 100.3m or 90 cents a share in the first quarter of 1990. Sales rose 11 per cent to Dollars 1.22bn from Dollars 1.1bn. Excluding the benefits of foreign exchange translations, sales advanced 8 per cent in the latest quarter. During the 1991 first quarter, sales of Warner-Lambert's prescription pharmaceuticals went ahead by 17 per cent to Dollars 421m, led by Lopid, a cholesterol regulator, whose sales increased 45 per cent to Dollars 111m in the quarter. Sales of the company's non-prescription health care products rose 8 per cent to Dollars 383m in the latest quarter, led by Listerine antiseptic mouthwash and Halls cough tablets. Worldwide sales of gums and mints improved 3 per cent in the three months to Dollars 257m. Warner-Lambert is waiting for the Food  Drug Administration to approve its Cognex drug to treat Alzheimer's disease. If the approval is forthcoming, analysts believe Cognex will make a substantial contribution to Warner-Lambert's earnings in the 1990s. The company recently submitted additional data on Cognex and new analysis of clinical data to the FDA.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

The increase, if decided, would be the first since fiscal  1986.    The government is also to consider raising the liquor tax,  the sources said.    They said the government's revenue shortfall is expected to  widen in fiscal 1994, starting April 1, as the consumption tax  on automobile purchases are expected to be lowered to 3.0  percent from the present 4.5 percent from April.    The tobacco tax now stands at 6.252 yen per cigarette.    A 1 yen increase in the tax would raise the government's  revenue by about 320 billion yen per year while the reduction in  the consumption tax on automobiles will decrease the revenue by  about 100 billion yen, the sources said.

Sales have been hit by patent expiries and increasing use of generic products, as well as greater discounting to bulk-buyers of medicines which are becoming increasingly aggressive The Japanese hospital market increased 13 per cent at constant rates, up from Dollars 9.9bn to Dollars 12.8bn. However, the market is likely to be hit next year when the health ministry is expected to implement one of its biennial prices cuts - expected to be about 7 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------      WORLD PHARMACY DRUG PURCHASES JANUARY-AUGUST 1993                         (Dollars bn)*  ----------------------------------------------------------------                             Europe        US       Japan Cardiovascular               6.759     4.696       1.961 Alimentary/metabolism        5.128     4.572       2.440 Anti-infectives              3.331     4.772         653 Central nervous system       2.784     2.703       1.761 Respiratory                  2.869     2.942       1.055 Musculo-skeletal             1.648     1.459       1.242 Blood/organs                 1.476     1.186         954 Others                       6.233     6.476       2.767  ---------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                       30.228    28.806      12.833  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Increase %**                     1         4          13  ---------------------------------------------------------------- *Hospital market only. **Excluding currencies.

[Hong Kong] dollars (2.357 billion U.S. dollars), a  government official announced today.    This compared to the actual revenue from last year's land  sales of 17.964 billion H.K. dollars (2.303 billion U.S.  dollars), principal government land agent Jim Hughes said in a  news release.    He said that the government's land sales program for 1994/95  would consist of 28.21 hectares of land involving 40 sites which  are expected to produce between 8,000 and 10,000 flats.    The official announcement was made following the agreement  made by the Sino-British Land Commission earlier this week that  the land disposal program for the 1994/95 financial year should  amount to 117.27 hectares.

This matched the 50 per cent fall in the first quarter. Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman, said the third quarter should not show any further fall from the year before. However, he noted that last year's third quarter had been 'very unsatisfactory'. The fall in profits came on a 6 per cent drop in sales to DM10.39m. Mr Strube said business was still characterised by 'low demand combined with a surplus of supply, resulting in unrelenting pressure on prices'. In the first half of the year, he said, BASF had been continuously in loss at the operating level in plastics and fibres, and also in magnetic tapes. Mr Strube said 'the principal cause of the drop in sales was the soft demand in Germany and other European countries'. By contrast, some businesses in North and South America had done better than last year. The magnetic tape business remained difficult, he said. Prices in the first half of the year were 10 per cent lower than last year, and the company had shut down production at sites in the US, France and Germany. 'We expect BASF Magnetics to make a loss again in 1993, but we are aiming to break even in 1994', he said. In pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, he said, business has suffered significantly from state intervention. 'I need only mention the German Health Care Reform Act and the EC agricultural policy reforms,' he said. The group's drug sales in Germany were down 13 per cent in the half-year, as the result of lower prices in former East Germany and lower volume in West Germany. Mr Strube said that by the end of 1993, BASF would have shed nearly 20,000 jobs since 1989, partly through divesting businesses. In 1994, he said, the group planned to shed more than 4,000 jobs, the majority in Germany. 'An increase in personnel costs in Germany is not acceptable in the next few years, as the revaluation of the D-Mark has further accentuated the existing cost disadvantages in international competition,' he declared. In the first half, group sales were down 7 per cent from DM23.6bn to DM22.0bn. Group profit before tax was DM483m, compared with DM972m. Sales of plastics and fibres were down 12 per cent at DM4.83bn, in dyestuffs down 5 per cent at DM3.75bn and in chemicals 5 per cent at DM2.73bn. Sales in agricultural products were down 13 per cent at DM2.47bn, and in oil and gas were up 4 per cent at DM2.31bn. European sales were down 11 per cent at DM13.35bn. Sales in North America were up 3 per cent at DM4.29bn. Sales in Asia, Australia and Africa were down 6 per cent at DM2.03bn, and in Latin America up 9 per cent at DM1.17bn.   Companies:-  BASF.

From Associated Press      WASHINGTON      Retail sales inched up 0.1% in October, fueled for the third straight month by  the high cost of gasoline, the government said today. Excluding gasoline, sales  fell 0.1% amid continuing signs of fading consumer confidence.    The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $152.3  billion, up from $152.1 billion in September.    The revised 1.3% gain in September was a bit stronger than the 1.1% increase  originally reported. But excluding the gasoline impact, sales were up only 0.9%  that month.    Many analysts now believe that the U.S. economy is in a recession that could be  intensified by a drop in personal consumption. Retail sales represent about  half of all consumer spending, which itself accounts for two-thirds of the  nation's economic activity.    The department said retail sales since August have been artificially inflated  by gasoline prices that surged after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and  disrupted world petroleum markets -- not by increased sales volume.

The Conference Board, a New York business research organization, reported that  consumer confidence in the economy plunged in October to the lowest level since  the 1981-82 recession.    Sales at department stores, a key barometer of consumer sentiment, were off  0.6% after falling 1.1% in September.

This announcement's purpose is to develop capacity among organizations, which have not previously focused efforts on tobacco control, to develop the infrastructure necessary to educate, support, and mobilize their membership to promote and implement Healthy People 2000 tobacco control objectives. The primary constituencies served by the organizations should be minorities (African-Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives), youth, women, blue collar and/or agricultural workers. Tobacco control is defined as preventing tobacco use, encouraging cessation, and protecting both smokers and nonsmokers through public policy and public education.     Organizations that have not traditionally been active in the tobacco control field, but have a newly emerging interest in tobacco control, are encouraged to apply for this award. Upon receiving funding, organizations will be expected to demonstrate a focus on increasing tobacco control capacity within target communities or among an organization's constituents at the national, State or local level. Funding will be used to build the organization's capacity for leadership among its constituency for, and to assist State and local health agencies and other appropriate organizations and agencies in, the development of tobacco prevention and control.     The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of tobacco, with emphasis on target populations specified in risk reduction objective 3.4 and reducing the initiation of smoking by children and youth as described in Objective 3.5. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where to Obtain Additional Information.'')         Authority         This program is authorized under Section 317(k)(3) [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(3)] of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.        Smoke-Free Workplace         The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.         Eligible Applicants         Eligible applicants are public and private, nonprofit, and minority organizations. Experience with tobacco control activities or programs is not required. However, applicants must have established organizational capacities and experience in:     Coalition building;   Leadership;   Advocacy skills;   Impacting policy development at the local, State, regional, and/or national level;   Working with legislators and decision makers;   Serving one or more of the following constituencies: minorities (African-Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives), youth, women, blue collar and/or agricultural workers;   Collaboration with State and local health agencies, and/or other relevant agencies, on programmatic activities.     In addition to the requirements described above, national eligible organizations must have a primary relationship to one of the target populations. A primary relationship is one in which the organization's service to the target population is viewed as the most important component of its mission. The relationship to the target population must be direct (membership, service, advocacy) rather than indirect or secondary (philanthropy, fund raising, educational).     Eligible organizations must have affiliate offices or organizations in more than one State or territory. Individual chapters or affiliates of parent organizations are not eligible to apply.     States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities are not eligible for funding under this program announcement. States are currently funded for tobacco control activities under Program Announcement 332 or by the National Cancer Institute under the America Stop Smoking Intervention Study (ASSIST) demonstration program. CDC intends to support full and open competition among the States at the termination of the ASSIST demonstration program.     In addition to the eligibility requirements above, minority applicants must meet the following criteria:                "," FR940707-2-00111   FR940707-2-00051             Centers for Disease Control and Prevention     [Announcement 484]         Initiatives by Organizations To Strengthen   National Tobacco Control Activities in the United States         Introduction         The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for cooperative agreements to establish programs to demonstrate methodologies to train personnel, provide national leadership, and mobilize constituencies regarding tobacco control programs. This announcement's purpose is to develop capacity among organizations, which have not previously focused efforts on tobacco control, to develop the infrastructure necessary to educate, support, and mobilize their membership to promote and implement Healthy People 2000 tobacco control objectives. The primary constituencies served by the organizations should be minorities (African-Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives), youth, women, blue collar and/or agricultural workers. Tobacco control is defined as preventing tobacco use, encouraging cessation, and protecting both smokers and nonsmokers through public policy and public education.     Organizations that have not traditionally been active in the tobacco control field, but have a newly emerging interest in tobacco control, are encouraged to apply for this award. Upon receiving funding, organizations will be expected to demonstrate a focus on increasing tobacco control capacity within target communities or among an organization's constituents at the national, State or local level. Funding will be used to build the organization's capacity for leadership among its constituency for, and to assist State and local health agencies and other appropriate organizations and agencies in, the development of tobacco prevention and control.     The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of tobacco, with emphasis on target populations specified in risk reduction objective 3.4 and reducing the initiation of smoking by children and youth as described in Objective 3.5. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where to Obtain Additional Information.'')         Authority         This program is authorized under Section 317(k)(3) [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(3)] of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.        Smoke-Free Workplace         The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.         Eligible Applicants         Eligible applicants are public and private, nonprofit, and minority organizations. Experience with tobacco control activities or programs is not required. However, applicants must have established organizational capacities and experience in:     Coalition building;   Leadership;   Advocacy skills;   Impacting policy development at the local, State, regional, and/or national level;   Working with legislators and decision makers;   Serving one or more of the following constituencies: minorities (African-Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives), youth, women, blue collar and/or agricultural workers;   Collaboration with State and local health agencies, and/or other relevant agencies, on programmatic activities.     In addition to the requirements described above, national eligible organizations must have a primary relationship to one of the target populations. A primary relationship is one in which the organization's service to the target population is viewed as the most important component of its mission. The relationship to the target population must be direct (membership, service, advocacy) rather than indirect or secondary (philanthropy, fund raising, educational).     Eligible organizations must have affiliate offices or organizations in more than one State or territory. Individual chapters or affiliates of parent organizations are not eligible to apply.     States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities are not eligible for funding under this program announcement.

The China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) says its overseas  operations are advancing as scheduled.    In the meantime, it says, conditions are suitable for  opening  new areas for petroleum exploration and development.    In an interview with Business Weekly, Zhang Yongyi, CNPC's  vice-president, cited the example of old oil wells in Peru that  have been upgraded by Chinese technicians and are now producing  more oil.    CNPC signed a contract with Petrol Peru last year for  further  development of a 182-square-kilometre block in an old oilfield.  Production at the oilfield, which was discovered in 1874, has  declined after more than 100 years of exploitation.    CNPC, which produces some 140 million tons of crude oil a  year, has mature technology and enough equipment for enhancing  oil recovery, Zhang said.    In a couple of North and Latin American nations, CNPC is  conducting seismic work, Zhang revealed.    In Thailand, CNPC has made progress in developing oil.  Another CNPC official said Chinese are doing preparatory work  for constructing an oilfield.    In Papua New Guinea, CNPC will explore for oil in one block  code- named 160 and another named Kamusi. CNPC is teaming up  with companies from Japan and Hong Kong in the exploration.    After leading a business group to the Central Asian nations  of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan last  month, Zhang said new fields for cooperation will be opened  there. Zhang was travelling with a Chinese Government  delegation headed by Premier Li Peng.    Zhang believes prospects for Chinese co-operation with the  four republics are good since the needs of all five countries  are complementary.    Two letters of intent for closer ties were signed by CNPC  and  the petroleum sectors of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.    More co-operation is expected in the exploration,  development  and trade of crude oil and natural gas.    According to the letters of intent, technical exchanges and  visits to oilfields will be more frequent than before.    CNPC and Turkmenistan reaffirmed their desires to work  together, along with the Japanese industrial conglomerate  Mitsubishi, to develop natural gas.    Construction of a pipeline is being considered to carry  natural gas from Turkmenistan to Japan by way of China. Gas  resources in Turkmenistan are estimated at 20,000 billion cubic  metres.    Zhang cited several advantages for CNPC in improving  petroleum cooperation with Central Asia:    -- Proximity, which ensures convenience in co-operative  exploration, development and trade;    -- Chinese technology, engineering and experience, which  suit  the needs of the four nations;    -- Similar economic and social conditions, which enhance  mutual understanding as the five countries make the transition  from rigid central planning to market economies.

Without regulation, their use has the potential to pose high risks to workers as well as to residents in nearby communities or consumers using household products containing such chemicals. However, while the Agency generally discourages the use of these chemicals in aerosol applications, they may be necessary in products where nonflammability is a critical characteristic. The Agency encourages formulators of aerosols to restrict their use of chlorinated solvents to products that must be nonflammable.     Given that the use of chlorinated solvents may be necessary to offset risks of flammability, the Agency has determined chlorinated solvents to be acceptable substitutes since risks to workers can be reduced by adhering to OSHA standards. Residual risks to residents in nearby communities may remain. The Agency is aware of these potential risks and has the authority to address them under section 112 of the CAA. This section of the CAA lists three of these solvents as Hazardous Air Pollutants, and authorizes the Agency to establish controls for their use. EPA will pursue any appropriate regulations under this authority. Any risks arising from use of these compounds as pesticide aerosols in reformulated products can be addressed using FIFRA authorities.     These solvents are occasionally found in consumer products. Consumer risks were not analyzed under the SNAP risk screens since these risks are controlled under authorities implemented by the Consumer Safety Product Commission, which has already established labeling requirements for use of these solvents.     (d) Oxygenated organic solvents. Oxygenated organic solvents (ketones, esters, ethers, and alcohols) are acceptable substitutes for CFC11, CFC113, MCF and HCFC141b as solvents in the aerosols sector. Most of these compounds have a long history of safe use, and regulations to control any risks due to tropospheric ozone formation or worker exposure are already in place under other relevant authorities.     (e) Terpenes. Terpenes are acceptable substitutes for CFC11, CFC113, MCF and HCFC141b as solvents in the aerosols sector. Terpene-based formulations have a long history of safe use as industrial solvents, and any increased risks due to increased tropospheric ozone formation can be controlled through existing regulations. Additionally, many of these chemicals are naturally occurring organic hydrocarbons and exhibit significant biodegradability.     The use history of these chemicals does not negate the toxicity of these compounds to aquatic life. However, the Agency does not believe that in this case significant adverse effects are to be expected, since in aerosol applications the terpenes volatilize during use and would consequently not be discharged to surface or ground water where aquatic species are to be found.

Overview         Tobacco expansion is the process of puffing leaves of tobacco to decrease the volume of tobacco used in cigarette production. Currently, one of the primary technologies used to expand tobacco in the U.S. relies on CFC11. One and one half million pounds of CFC11 are used annually in the U.S. in this sector.     In the CFC11 process, tobacco is saturated with CFC11 in a stainless steel vessel maintained at 120 degrees Fahrenheit and pressurized to 20 psi. The tobacco is then permeated with hot air (330 F) which expands the tobacco. The CFC11 is vaporized and recovered by cooling and compressing, and is continually recovered and recycled.     The Agency received notification on two potential substitutes: (1) Carbon dioxide technology, an alternative process substitute, and (2) HFC227ea. In this final rule, the Agency is listing carbon dioxide as an acceptable substitute for CFC11 in tobacco expansion.

Cost cutting enabled the group to improve its performance, against increasing competition and health authority clampdowns which reduced sales of some of its leading drugs. Year-on-year comparisons were distorted by one-off gains and the group's acquisition of the Italian pharmaceuticals company Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Fice) in May 1993. Pro-forma figures show underlying sales up 3 per cent at SKr19.87bn and operating costs down 4.2 per cent at SKr14.84bn. One-off gains of SKr842m helped lift operating profits to SKr4.43bn, up 61 per cent from last year's SKr2.74bn. Income after taxes and minority interests was SKr2.66bn. In the third quarter, operating profits rose to SKr1.66bn from SKr996m. However, excluding one-off gains of SKr658m, the figure was just SKr12m higher than a year ago. Pharmacia, privatised by the Swedish government in June, has mounted a cost-cutting drive since its Fice purchase. The programme aims to trim annual costs by SKr1.2bn by 1996 and lift the operating margin to 20 per cent. In the 12 months to September 30, the margin reached 16.7 per cent, compared with 14.7 per cent for the full 1993 year. Sales development has been less successful. Sales of Genotropin, the company's growth hormone drug, fell 6 per cent over the nine months, to SKr1.96bn, due to tougher competition in some markets and cost-containment measures in Spain, Australia and Italy. Sales of Healon (cataract surgery) were 4 per cent lower at SKr1.18bn after being hit by tougher competition and lower prices in the US and Japan. The anti-blood clotting agent Fragmin has been hit by changed reimbursement rules in Japan. Its sales were 9 per cent lower at SKr592m. The group's anti-cancer products, Farmorubicin and Adriamycin, showed a favourable development, with sales rising 13 and 7 per cent respectively.   Companies:-  Pharmacia.

Sales slipped 1.9 per cent to Y296.7bn, while net income fell 15.2 per cent to Y12.8bn, compared with Y15.03bn in the previous corresponding half year. Sales of fibres and textiles fell 1.6 per cent to Y166.1bn, despite higher sales for products used in clothing such as polyester filament and nylon. However, nylon sales to the tyre and carpet industries fell, reflecting the difficult trading conditions in the automotive and construction sectors. Plastics and chemicals sales were 7.9 per cent lower at Y90.8bn. The automotive industry's troubles also hit this division, while the slowdown in sales of electrical appliances and magnetic tapes also had an adverse impact. Chemicals sales moved higher led by caprolactam which is employed in synthetic fibre production. In the group's new products and other businesses area, sales advanced 13.5 per cent to Y39.9bn. Foreign sales of advanced composite materials which are used in the aircraft industry moved against the trend in the division although sales to the sporting goods business strengthened. Toray is forecasting a fall in net income for the 12 months to March 31 next year to Y25bn from Y27.2bn in 1992 and a slight rise in sales to Y600bn for the same term.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of  Finance and the People's Bank of China jointly issued a circular  recently calling on parties to ""resolutely stop"" the short  selling of treasury bonds.    Local finance bureaus, branches of the central bank, and  securities exchanges and centres must take effective measures  against short-selling as of July 1.    The action was taken because some securities intermediaries  are selling more treasury bonds than they actually own by  issuing custody certificates to buyers.    This practice in effect expands the total amount of treasury  bonds, endangering the country's macroeconomic management and  investors' interests.    According to the circular, which will go into effect on July  1, the treasury bonds traded over the counter should be the  paper bonds issued by the State and not the custody certificates.    Institutions trading bonds through securities exchanges or  centres should put all their bonds, paper and paperless, under  the central custody centres of the exchanges and trading centres  .    Only after that will they be able to trade their bonds on  exchanges or State-approved electronic securities trading  systems.    If securities trading institutions issue custody  certificates, they should have an equal amount of note bonds.    If institutions have fewer paper bonds than the amount  registered in the certificates already issued, they should make  up the gap by June 20.    Holders can exchange their certificates for paper bonds any  time. No certificate issuer can refuse a request .    The circular requires the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities  exchanges and all local securities trading centres to draft  their own self-regulating rules. These regulations will be  reported to the Ministry of Finance.    Bond-trading institutions violating the circular's  stipulations will be suspended from doing business for three  months to a year.    Bond-trading institutions are responsible for arranging to  be  examined by the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China  and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.    Trading institutions should set up different accounts for  custody bonds and self-dealing bonds.     "

The group reported net income of Dollars 70.1m, or Dollars 4.53 a share, compared with Dollars 50.6m, or Dollars 3.31 a share, in the second quarter of last year. Sales increased by 10 per cent, from Dollars 710m to Dollars 780m. The figures were at the top end of analysts' expectations. The shares, however, ended the day at Dollars 195 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange for a net fall of Dollars  7/8 . The company said the television network's unit prices improved in the prime time, day time and late night time periods. Network sales were also bolstered by the broadcast of two basketball competition semi-finals during the quarter. In 1991 the semi-finals were aired in the first quarter. But while demand for network television advertising improved, local TV and radio advertising remained sluggish. Sales and profits of the CBS television stations division increased, primarily because of the acquisition of two new businesses, while CBS Radio's earnings fell, due mainly to sales weakness. The company's net interest income was Dollars 8.9m, down from Dollars 10.8m, and its cash and marketable securities at the end of the period totalled Dollars 1.4bn, compared with debt of Dollars 1.1bn a year earlier. For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 88.7m, or Dollars 5.75 a share, up from Dollars 73.9m, or Dollars 4.29 a share for last year's comparative period.

The US basic and specialty chemical producer yesterday posted revenues of Dollars 4.5bn for the quarter , a 4 per cent rise on the year-earlier result of Dollars 4.36bn. The gain was struck on an 8 per cent increase in sales volume, reflecting the moderate expansion of the US economy and the beginning of an upturn in European markets. But prices remained under pressure amid a capacity glut within the world chemical industry. An off-setting factor was the group's extensive streamlining efforts, which resulted in further productivity gains. Cost-cutting in the quarter saved Dollars 40m in research, promotion and administrative expenses, following an estimated Dollars 100m in savings in 1993. The net effect of higher volumes and lower costs was best highlighted by Dow's plastics business. Sales of Dollars 1.6bn were unchanged from the 1993 period, but operating income surged 85 per cent to Dollars 161m. The overall result was a bottom line figure of Dollars 173m, or 62 cents a share, after a provision of 3 cents a share related to a fall in the value of a short-term investment portfolio. The group realised net income of Dollars 402m, or Dollars 1.47, in the first quarter of last year, but the figure was bolstered by a one-time Dollars 1 a share from the sale of the 50 per cent interest in Dowell Schlumberger, an oil-field services group. The consumer specialties division, including pharmaceuticals, agricultural supplies and household products, turned in the most buoyant performance. Sales were up 16 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn and income 52 per cent ahead at Dollars 246m. The hydrocarbons and energy division showed a 9 per cent sales improvement and narrowed its operating loss to Dollars 1m, from Dollars 7m a year ago. Sales of chemicals and performance products slipped 7 per cent to Dollars 1bn. Operating income slumped 25 per cent to Dollars 109m.   Companies:-  Dow Chemical Co Inc.

The New York-based company said net income grew 15 per cent to Dollars 406.3m, or Dollars 1.29 a share, in the first three months of 1992, compared with Dollars 352.5m, or Dollars 1.12, a year earlier. Sales advanced 13 per cent to Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.76bn. Sales growth was led by American Home Product's consumer health care business, which saw a 20 per cent increase to Dollars 438.8bn. Pharmaceutical sales rose 16 per cent to Dollars 1.16bn, while medical supplies and diagnostics were only 2 per cent higher at Dollars 197.8m. Food products sales fell 1 per cent in the quarter. The company said two new drugs - Lodine for osteoarthritis and its Norplant birth control implant - contributed to the strong pharmaceutical sales. Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to the figures, marking American Home Products shares closed Dollars 4 higher to Dollars 81 3/4 in active trading. Genentech, a leading US biotechnology company which is controlled by the Swiss group Hoffmann-La Roche, yesterday unveiled first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 3.5m, or 3 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 129m, against income of Dollars 19.4m, or 17 cents, on sales of Dollars 99.5m last year. The drop in income was attributed to the company's previously announced increase in spending on research and development for 1992. During the quarter, sales of Genentech's Protropin human growth hormone rose 10.3 per cent to Dollars 48.4m. Sales of the company's thrombolytic (clot dissolver) Activase t-PA fell 19.8 per cent to Dollars 44.5m, reflecting results of a controversial clinical trial.  The Financial Times   London Page 25  "

Its share price dropped by Dollars 6.75 to Dollars 99.25 in after-hours trading on Monday and yesterday the stock was trading at Dollars 94.50 in mid-session. First-quarter net income rose to Dollars 298m, or Dollars 1.03 a share, compared with Dollars 204m, or 72 cents, in the same period last year. Sales rose 29 per cent to Dollars 4.69bn from Dollars 3.63bn. However, the pace of growth in net income represented a slowdown from last year's increase of more than 100 per cent. Analysts said they had hoped to see the company outperform their projections of around Dollars 1.04 a share with higher earnings growth in the semiconductor and communications equipment markets. A leading supplier of cellular telephones and transmission equipment, Motorola said sales in that sector rose 57 per cent to Dollars 1.67bn, while orders were up 62 per cent. During the quarter the company resolved a dispute in Japan over market access, reaching an agreement with Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp (IDO) to begin expanding the service area for the Motorola cellular telephone system in the Tokyo and Nagoya areas. The communication products sector, which includes pagers and the two-way radios used by taxi fleet vehicles, had sales growth of 20 per cent, to Dollars 1.24bn, but orders grew just 1 per cent. The company said the lower than expected order growth was partly due to excess inventories among distributors in China. Sales of pagers to the Chinese market exploded last year, apparently in advance of user demand. Sales of semiconductor products, another large segment, grew 26 per cent to Dollars 1.61bn, with orders up 15 per cent. The government and systems technology group, which includes Motorola's share of the Iridium satellite communications venture, reported revenues of Dollars 138m, up 10 per cent. Overall, Motorola said net margin on sales was 6.4 per cent, up from 5.6 per cent in the first quarter of last year.   Companies:-  Motorola Inc.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT932-13313 ,"FT932-13313 _AN-DDWC9AGAFT 930423   FT  23 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low prices snuff out tobacco hopes - Tony Hawkins on a stunning setback for Zimbabwean growers      By TONY HAWKINS   HAVING GROWN possibly the best flue-cured tobacco crop in the country's history, Zimbabwean farmers have been stunned by depressed prices on the Harare auction floors. When the tobacco sales opened last week growers were optimistic that prices would open in the region of USDollars 1.50 a kilogram and hopeful that during the season they would average Dollars 2 a kg. But on the first day the price averaged Dollars 1.29. falling below Dollars 1 on the third day and sliding still further this week to average only Dollars 1.05 during the first week of the sales. That was 34 per cent down on last year's opening price of Dollars 1.60 a kilogram for what was a low quality, high-nicotine, drought-stressed crop. Growers had been warned that the global supply-demand balance had shifted against them and that prices this year would come under pressure, but no-one expected so dramatic a decline, especially given the sharp improvement in the quality of tobacco on offer. 'We are shell-shocked,' said an industry official this week. There is no single explanation for this. Global recession, higher taxes on smoking, cigarette price wars in the US and EC and the increased availability of some grades, especially filler tobaccos, have all contributed to thin order books. The Brazilian crop is up nearly 10 per cent at 400m kg, but, unlike Zimbabwe, the quality is poor. Zimbabwe's farmers are highly critical of the government's monetary policy, which they say has killed the speculation that would normally have resulted in heavy buying by the merchants. They have a point. Repeated government promises to curb public spending and reduce the budget deficit have come to nothing and economists expect the 1992-93 budget deficit to exceed 12 per cent of GDP or roughly double the target in Zimbabwe's structural adjustment programme. In an effort to meet credit ceilings agreed with the IMF, while also accommodating the government's borrowing requirements, the Reserve (central) Bank of Zimbabwe, which in December promised lower interest rates, has been forced to allow money market rates to rise. Merchants are therefore faced with the choice of paying upwards of 40 per cent interest to buy and hold speculative tobacco or borrow offshore at much lower rates, carrying the foreign exchange risk of further Zimbabwe dollar devaluation as well as the probability of being unable to sell and move the tobacco before the loan is repaid in 180 days. The result has been market stalemate; merchants awaiting orders from the manufacturers who traditionally only show their hand in the market in the second half of May or even later, while the growers, indignant at being forced to 'give' their tobacco away at bargain basement prices are withdrawing from the market in the hope that prices will soon recover. Caught in the middle is the monopoly auction floor company, Tobacco Sales, with too much tobacco to store as a result of confident pre-season bookings and subsequent large-scale tearing of tickets, thereby rejecting sales, by growers. At the same time farmers are scrambling to cancel next month's bookings and hold their tobacco back in the hope that when the manufacturers see the quality of the leaf they will start buying heavily. Watching gloomily from the sidelines are the banks. They had hoped for buoyant sales, both to boost national export earnings and to ease market liquidity as tobacco growers repaid their loans. It is estimated that the break-even price for a tobacco farmer is in the region of Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 1.60 a kilogram, depending on the yield achieved. After last year's disastrous drought, when the banks were forced to carry a large number of their customers, a second successive season of loan roll-overs would push up lending rates once again. With less than 2 per cent of the crop having been sold, it is far too early even to begin to guess what the price will average this season. Were the authorities to open a tobacco window at the central bank to finance speculative buying, this might give prices a modest boost. Merchants play this down, however, stressing that the real problem is not the liquidity crunch at home so much as weak global demand. Last year the industry produced 201m kg of tobacco, which sold at an average price of Dollars 1.62 a kg, only half the Dollars 3.25 achieved in the 1991 boom. Current forecasts point to a crop of at least 205m kg this year with price estimates for the season ranging from Dollars 1.40 from the doom-merchants to the optimists' Dollars 1.75. Unless market conditions change radically in the next two months, the probability must be that the 1993 crop will earn little more than last year's Dollars 326m, less than the Dollars 350m achieved in 1990 and substantially below the record Dollars 553m enjoyed in 1991. With tobacco accounting for 40 per cent of export earnings last year, and with mining and industrial exports suffering at the hand of world recession, another year of depressed prices would deflate the dwindling hopes of a significant economic recovery in 1993. In any event, tobacco exports this year will be sharply lower than in 1992 because the foreign sales in the first half the year will be dominated by last year's poor quality low-priced leaf. But a second successive year of low prices would delay Zimbabwe's export recovery by at least 12 months as well as reversing the trend towards increased tobacco production if growers came to accept that the 1991 boom really was no more than a flash in the pan.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Zimbabwe Tobacco  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               Crop size          Total value      Average price            (million kg)  (million USdollars)      (US cents/kg)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993(f)         205-210                  340                165 1992                201                  326                162 1991                170                  553                325 1990                134                  350                260 1989                130                  265                204 1988                120                  262                218  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (f) = forecast.

BRIs do not disappear when the person leaves the building.     The Centers for Disease Control Prevention estimate that over 25,000 cases of the pneumonia caused by     Legionella     occur each year with more than 4,000 deaths. It has been suggested that a large number of these cases occur as the result of workplace exposure [Exs. 433, 4318]. However, specific data on the occurrence of     Legionella    -related cases due to workplace exposure were not available.     Some of the reductions attributable to the proposed standard, such as decreases in the number of upper respiratory symptoms (nose, throat and eye symptoms) and severe headaches have been estimated. Other reductions, however, have not been quantified at this time.     OSHA's estimates are based upon the exposure profile (presented in Table VI5) and OSHA's quantitative risk assessment discussed in detail in the preamble to the proposal). OSHA preliminarily estimates the risk of working in mechanically ventilated workplaces to be 57 severe headaches and 85 upper respiratory symptoms per 1,000 employees over a 45 year work lifetime. By applying these rates to the affected population at risk, OSHA estimates that 3.8 million severe headaches and 5.6 million upper respiratory symptoms will develop in employees over the next 45 years who work in buildings with mechanical ventilation (with the worker population held constant).     A common theme that runs through the literature and the OSHA docket indicates that the principal factor associated with indoor air quality complaints is inadequate ventilation. However, information available does not quantify the effectiveness of ventilation improvements. NEMI reports that: ``ventilation system modifications and improvements are key elements of solving existing IAQ problems and reducing IAQ complaints. In every case where recommended ventilation system modifications and improvements are implemented, the frequency and severity of complaints are reduced significantly'' [Ex. 31183].     Some of the submissions base the effectiveness of ventilation improvements on the NIOSH analysis of indoor air quality investigations [Exs. 31183, 31090]. In approximately 500 indoor air quality investigations, NIOSH found that the primary causes of indoor air quality problems were inadequate ventilation (52%), contamination from outside the building (10%), microbial contamination (5%), contamination from building fabric (4%), and unknown sources (13%). Excluding contamination from building fabric and unknown sources, this suggests that 83 percent of complaints related to IAQ problems would be eliminated by the proposed OSHA standard. For purposes of this analysis, OSHA assumes that the overall effectiveness is, therefore, 80 percent. As shown in Table VI5, OSHA estimates that the proposed standard will prevent 3.0 million severe headaches and 4.5 million upper respiratory symptoms over the next 45 years. This is, approximately, 69,000 severe headaches and 105,000 upper respiratory symptoms per year. These estimates understate the prevalence of building-related symptoms since they only reflect excess risk in only air conditioned buildings. OSHA believes that the standard will also prevent severe headaches and upper respiratory symptoms in heated (but not air conditioned) buildings, and that it will prevent various other adverse health effects. OSHA is seeking additional information upon which to base quantifiable estimates of the other known adverse health effects.     OSHA requests comment on the methodology of estimating the benefits for the IAQ portion of the proposal. Specifically, OSHA requests any studies which document (in quantitative terms) the effectiveness of HVAC maintenance on the decline of indoor air related ailments.         2.

Despite these declines, smoking is responsible for an estimated 390,000 deaths.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs are trying to create a class of present and former smokers claiming to have been addicted to cigarettes at any time in the last 50 years. Yesterday they said the damages could range from Dollars 30bn to Dollars 50bn. Mr John Coale, representing one of the plaintiffs, said outside the court that if the class included 30m smokers and each were awarded damages of Dollars 10,000, the damages would reach Dollars 300bn. 'But I don't think the courts will let someone bankrupt the US tobacco industry,' Mr Coale said. At the hearing, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, the main arguments turned on whether there was enough common ground between the cases of tens of millions of individual smokers to make a class action feasible.

Sales  of recordings by Sony's subsidiary CBS Records Inc. rose 18.8%.    ""They are good numbers,"" said industry analyst Darrel Whitten at  Prudential-Bache Securities (Japan). ""Sony is strategically the best-placed  company to maximize growth with the combination of hardware and software  markets,"" he said.    ""The environment for consumer electronics is not like it was two years ago and  despite that they have done well,"" said senior analyst Virginia Kouyoumdjian at  Baring Securities (Japan). ""The company is in the right areas.    ""It is the only company that has completely integrated operations that will be  able to market entertainment software and hardware together.""    Sony is especially strong in compact discs and came out with the only  innovative product in the audio area this year, the ""Pixie,"" a high performing  mini-stereo that can be stacked, lined up or put on a shelf.    The maker of the Walkman personal stereo moved into the booming record business  by purchasing CBS Records in 1988. ""CBS has been bought and paid for and is  contributing nicely to profits,"" said Prudential Bache's Whitten.    Sony added a new piece of U.S. software, filmmaker Columbia Pictures  Entertainment, early this month.    ""I think there is going to be an impact, perhaps in the fourth quarter and  first quarter next year,"" Whitten said of the Columbia purchase. ""There should  not be much more than a six-month squeeze on earnings.""    Analysts said the company's long-term outlook is good. ""In the long term, it is  still the most exciting company in the world in consumer electronics. There's  nothing like it,"" said Baring's Kouyoumdjian.

0,FT933-8777 ,"FT933-8777 _AN-DHMBNAD7FT 930813   FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Richemont spin-offs are confident - Dunhill and Rothmans shareholders receive restructuring plans for the new groups      By ANDREW BOLGER   A DOWNBEAT announcement from Dunhill Holdings did not dent the confidence of the other participants in the restructuring of the Richemont empire. Shareholders were yesterday sent details of the proposed reconstruction of the tobacco and luxury goods businesses into two new quoted companies and the return of surplus cash to the shareholders of Rothmans and Dunhill. The proposals will result in the creation of two new groups - Rothmans International and Vendome Luxury Group. The new Rothmans will comprise all of Rothmans' existing tobacco businesses and certain tobacco trade marks currently owned or controlled by Dunhill or by Richemont with cigarette brands including Rothmans, Dunhill, Peter Stuyvesant, Craven A and Golden American. Lord Swaythling, chairman of Rothmans, said the company continued to experience recessionary conditions in the main world economies, political uncertainties in certain of its markets and volatility in the currency markets. The competitive trading environment in a number of cigarette markets also created uncertainties, although the new Rothmans had limited exposure in the US, where traditionally high margins have been eroded by the cigarette price wars. He said: 'The new Rothmans group is, however, expected to benefit from cost-efficiency measures already initiated. While the total volume of cigarette sales in many markets is static or in decline, overall worldwide tobacco consumption is increasing. 'This provides opportunities for international tobacco companies to sell quality cigarette brands, particularly to markets where opportunities for export or local production have been traditionally limited through import restrictions, government policy or lack of convertible currency.' Under the reorganisation, the luxury goods businesses of Dunhill will form part of Vendome, the Dunhill tobacco trade marks will be transferred to the new Rothmans and Pounds 75m cash will be returned to Dunhill shareholders. Vendome said it would be one of the world's largest luxury goods groups with a portfolio of premier brands. Its principal brands would be Cartier, Alfred Dunhill and Montblanc, which together accounted for 85 per cent of the sales of Luxco and Dunhill. The combined group's turnover would compromise: jewellery 14 per cent; watches 38 per cent; writing instruments 13 per cent; and leather goods 10 per cent. Mr Joseph Kanoui, the Swiss chairman and chief executive of Vendome, said bringing together Richemont's Luxco and Dunhill luxury goods businesses under unified ownership would enhance their ability to shape and take advantage of changes in the industry. He believed the combination of Luxco and Dunhill would produce purchasing, distribution and other savings. On prospects for Vendome, he said the strength of its brands and management team, the geographical spread of its sales and the integration of manufacturing and distribution activities should enable it to perform well, in spite of the depressed economic conditions in some of its markets. The board also believed that an improvement in economic conditions should favour the Vendome group given that both Luxco and Dunhill have historically grown at rates in excess of the economies of the principal markets in which they operated. Mr Kanoui said that, unlike Dunhill, Luxco had not adopted long-term hedging policies because it believed the geographical spread of its activities gave it a natural hedge against foreign exchange movements. Meetings for shareholders in Rothmans and Dunhill will be held on September 7. Subject to their approval, dealings in the new Rothmans and Vendome shares will start on October 25. Shareholders with 1,000 Rothmans B shares will receive 1,000 new Rothmans units, 500 Vendome units and Pounds 757 cash. Holders of 1,000 Dunhill shares will receive 133 new Rothmans units, 749 Vendome units and Pounds 443 cash. The cash element totals Pounds 525m, of which Richemont will receive Pounds 300m. Following the restructuring, it will own 61 per cent of Rothmans and 70 per cent of Vendome.   Companies:-  Dunhill Holdings.     Compagnie Financiere Richemont.     Rothmans International.

The signs of stronger domestic growth, together with fears of higher oil prices, contributed to a sharp fall in bond prices on Wall Street. The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its closely-followed index of consumer confidence rose to 71.6 this month, against 65.1 in April and a low of 47.3 in February. Sales of domestically made cars jumped to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 6.7m in the middle of the month, compared with analysts' forecasts of sales of 6m. Sales were running at an annual rate of only 5.7m in the first 10 days of May. Sales of light trucks also rose sharply, to an annual rate of 4.9m against 3.7m at the start of the month. Car sales are seen as a key barometer of public confidence. The failure of sales to revive earlier in the year was one of the main reasons for fears of an unusually weak recovery. The increase in consumer confidence was also larger than expected. However, the index remains well short of the 100 plus level normal in a healthy recovery. Mr Fabian Linden, for the board, said the improved figures left 'little doubt that the economy is at long last recovering'. The Federal Reserve reached the same conclusion last week when it decided against further interest rate cuts. For the first time since August the Fed reportedly shifted to a neutral monetary stance, abandoning its bias towards lower short-term rates. More than a quarter of respondents to the Conference Board survey said they expected improved business conditions over the next six months, against less than 10 per cent expecting worse conditions.

For example, personnel in the transportation industries were apportioned according to those potentially exposed to indoor air pollution (office workers) and those who are not (truck drivers). Table VI3 presents the distribution of the 70.7 million employees who work indoors.     No data are available as to the number of employees exposed to poor indoor air quality.

State and Local Governments have adopted an increasing number of ordinances and regulations limiting smoking in public and private worksites. The restrictiveness of these laws varies from simple, limited prohibitions to laws that ban smoking. Forty-five states and the District of Columbia restrict smoking in public workplaces and 19 states and the District of Columbia restrict smoking in private workplaces.           8     A smoking ordinance may mean any local law which addresses public smoking in some fashion to protect non-smokers.            There are 397 city and county smoking ordinances covering 22 percent of the total population [Ex. 4305]. A total of 297 cities and counties mandate the adoption of workplace smoking policies. Typically these provisions require employers (private and public) to maintain a written smoking policy. Ordinances range from requirements for written smoking policies to the total elimination of smoking in the workplace. A total of 505 cities and counties limit smoking, specifically in restaurants. The requirements range from a nonsmoking section of unspecified size to the banning of all smoking [Ex. 4305].     A 1991 survey of company smoking policies shows that of the 85 percent of firms with smoking policies, 34 percent have complete bans and another 34 percent prohibit smoking in all open work areas. Over 90 percent of non-manufacturing establishments have smoking policies [H030 Ex. 77].     Workplace smoking policies are more common in larger businesses. In a survey of personnel managers, 63 percent of those with 1,000 or more employees reported having a smoking policy compared with 52 percent of companies with fewer employees. In the same survey, smaller companies were half as likely as larger ones to have a policy under consideration. Similar findings were reported by the National Survey of Worksite Health Promotion Activities, in which larger worksites were more likely than smaller ones to report smoking control activities. In a survey of private New York city businesses, only 4 percent of companies with fewer than 100 employees had a written smoking policy [Ex. 31030Q].         (b) Number of nonsmokers working indoors.     Based on the National Health Interview Survey, OSHA estimated that 74.2 million employees or 73.01 percent of the U.S. labor force covered by OSHA are nonsmokers. Table VI4 presents the distribution of nonsmoking employees by two digit SIC.     Results of population based surveys show that 88 percent of nonsmokers are aware of the negative health consequences of ETS. Despite this general awareness, exposure to ETS is pervasive [Ex. 498]. To determine the occupational exposure of nonsmoking employees to ETS, OSHA used the estimate provided by the 1991 National Health Interview Survey. The survey, requested information from employed individuals on whether during the past two weeks anyone smoked in their immediate work area. Based on results adjusted for non-response and weighted to reflect national estimates, 18.81 percent reported exposure to ETS. OSHA believes that the 18.8 percent is an underestimate since it is based solely on self reported information and the question was not very specific in defining ``immediate'' work area. A recent reanalysis of a study by Cummings et al. [Ex. 468] shows that 48.67 percent of currently employed nonsmokers reported ETS exposure at work and not at home [Ex. 3442F].

Healthcare reforms, combined with currency devaluations, caused the steep drop from Dollars 47.1bn to Dollars 41.7bn (Pounds 27.8bn). In local currency terms, the European market generated zero growth, according to IMS International, the market research group, against 10 per cent during 1992. The US market was also sluggish, up 5 per cent to Dollars 40.4bn, demonstrating the impact of lower price rises and increasing purchasing power of bulk purchasers. Drugs sales in Japanese pharmacies increased 7 per cent in local currencies, up from Dollars 14.8bn to Dollars 18.2bn. However, growth in the whole Japanese market - including hospitals where most drugs are dispensed - was slower. European sales were held back by Germany, the region's largest market, and Italy. Healthcare reforms in Germany introduced in January last year drove the market down 9 per cent in local currencies, a fall from Dollars 13.4bn to Dollars 11.5bn. The Italian market, which has also been shaken by a series of reforms, plummeted from Dollars 10.1bn to Dollars 7.6bn, a drop of 3 per cent in lire. Sales in France were down in dollar terms from Dollars 11.2bn to Dollars 10.9bn, but increased in francs by 5 per cent. Drugs sales in the UK also dropped in dollar terms, from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 4.6bn, but increased 11 per cent in sterling. Sales in Spain fell from Dollars 4.5bn to Dollars 4bn, but in pesetas moved up 11 per cent. The Belgian market fell from Dollars 1.41bn to Dollars 1.39bn, but rose 5 per cent in local currency. In the Netherlands, sales improved 12 per cent from Dollars 1.39bn to Dollars 1.47bn. In Europe, cardiovascular medicines, the most important sector, declined 2 per cent in local currencies, from Dollars 10.6bn to Dollars 9.2bn. Musculo-skeletal agents - primarily anti-arthritic products - fell 4 per cent, from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 2.2bn. Alimentary and metabolism drugs, mostly anti-ulcerants, reported no growth in local currencies as they declined in dollar terms from Dollars 8bn to Dollars 7.1bn. Some categories posted growth. Anti-infectives - antibiotics and anti-virals  -were the fastest expanding therapeutic category, up 6 per cent, although in dollar terms sales fell from Dollars 4.2bn to Dollars 3.9bn.

The official statistics, the department's foreign  agricultural service said, ""do not reveal the true level of  trade with China,"" and re-exports to China from Hong Kong and  informal trade should be included.    According to the department's latest agriculture trade  highlights, most of the U.S. agricultural sales to China are  bulk products such as wheat and cotton. Forest products sales  are also significant.    It estimated that in 1993, total U.S. consumer food  shipments  to China were 221.8 million dollars, six times greater than  official direct shipments, making China the 12th largest U.S.  consumer food market.    Among the most popular U.S. consumer food in China,  according  to the report, are poultry meat products, such as chicken paws  and wings, in addition to snack foods, including fruit and nuts,  and fresh fruit.

The past year has been one in which we have comprehensively  implemented the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress  and one in which we have advanced victoriously along Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theoy of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Fujian's national economy has developed  speedily and well; its GNP has increased by three-fold,seven  years ahead of schedule; and it has taken a solid step forward  in establishing the socialist market economy structure.  Macrocontrol and regulation have strengthened and improved.  Marked achievements have been made in opening the market.  Foreign economic relations and trade have developed strongly.  The people's lives have continued to improve. New progress has  been made in the formation of the socialist legal system and  spiritual civilization. In particular, Fujian Province has  built closer ties with Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots,  as well as with overseas Chinese and friendly personalities  abroad. Their foreign economic and trade cooperation has entered  a new period of stability and development. [passage omitted]    The year 1994 is a crucial one for the province to move  forward steadily in building socialism. Seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, widening the scope of opening up,  promoting development, and maintaining stability are the main  aspects of this year's work. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theoy of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, and under the  leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core, we will hold high the banner of great  solidarity and great alliance, focus on development and reform,  preserve our political stability, bring about overall social  progress, and lay a good foundation for the materialization of  moderate prosperity in Fujian ahead of schedule.    The materialization of our objectives requires the hard work  of the people throughout the province, as well as the common  efforts of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots, and of  overseas Chinese and Chinese residing abroad.

Sales increased 13 per cent from Pounds 610m to Pounds 690m, but were flattered by the inclusion for the first time of revenues from the Warner Wellcome Consumer Healthcare joint venture. Underlying sales growth of prescription products was 7 per cent, reaching Pounds 558m. Mr John Robb, chairman and chief executive, said margins had been maintained and he expected double-digit growth to continue this year. Margins would remain in the 28 to 32 per cent range. Wellcome surprised analysts with a larger than expected Pounds 52m exceptional charge to restructure its consumer operations. Mr Robb said there would be no further exceptional items related to the Warner Wellcome venture. The shares fell 10p to 605p. Zovirax, the anti-herpes compound and Wellcome's top-selling drug, generated sales of Pounds 270m, up 17 per cent. US sales increased 27 per cent to Pounds 106m, which Mr Robb described as a tremendous achievement. Only 3 percentage points of growth had been achieved through price increases. Zovirax sales in Europe were up 9 per cent at Pounds 90m, but suffered price cuts equivalent to three percentage points. Japanese sales were up only 4 per cent at Pounds 55m, because of doctors' fears of prescribing anti-viral medicines after a competitor's product killed a number of patients. Sales there were now recovering, said Mr Robb. Sales of Retrovir, the HIV and Aids treatment also known as AZT, fell 15 per cent to Pounds 62m. The drug is still struggling with the Anglo-French Concorde trial published last year which questioned its effectiveness in patients who were HIV-positive but without symptoms. Mr Robb said he was not overly concerned about the US Food and Drug Administration advisory committee's delay in considering Zovirax as a non-prescription drug. Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 12.7p. The second interim dividend per share was 5.8p. The company was reporting second interim results as it is changing its financial year-end from August to December. Lex, Page 16   Companies:-  Wellcome.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The deal marks Rothmans' first capital investment in central and eastern Europe, though it has licensing arrangements in Poland and the former Yugoslavia. Rothmans will acquire a 75 per cent shareholding in the venture, to be called Rothmans Nevo, and will build a new cigarette factory in St Petersburg. The factory, with an output of 10bn cigarettes a year, is expected to begin production in mid-1995. The UK-based company's Pounds 55m investment will be phased over several years and will cover construction costs and the supply of plant and equipment. Lord Swaythling, Rothmans' chairman, said: 'This venture is a major long-term initiative with a view to capitalising on the opportunity that Russia represents as one of the largest potential consumer markets in the world'. Russia, with a market estimated at 443bn cigarettes a year, has already attracted large-scale investment from other tobacco multinationals.   Companies:-  Rothmans International.     Nevo Tobacco.

0,FT923-8472 ,"FT923-8472 _AN-CHMBDADTFT 920811   FT  11 AUG 92 / Whisky exports increase by 12%      By PHILIP RAWSTORNE   SCOTCH whisky exports increased almost 12 per cent in value during the first half of the year to a record Pounds 870.7m. The world's thirst for Scotch raised overseas consumption during the six months by 6 per cent to 325m bottles - 20m bottles more than in the same period last year. Mr James Bruxner, chairman of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: 'At a time when recession is affecting many countries around the world, the sales increase is very encouraging.' Sales in the UK were less encouraging. The 12 months to the end of May showed a 9 per cent decrease. Exports to the rest of the European Community, however, rose 10 per cent during the January-June period to Pounds 344.2m and accounted for 40 per cent of total exports. Spain, where demand was boosted by visitors to Expo 92 and the Olympic Games, led the European growth. Exports in June were worth Pounds 23.5m, 188 per cent higher than in the same month last year. The half-year total showed an increase of 49 per cent to Pounds 89.9m. Sales to Greece rose 29 per cent during the six months to Pounds 36.3m; and France recorded a 15 per cent rise to Pounds 98m. The figures underlined the importance of EC markets for the industry, said Mr Bruxner. The threat of higher taxes on Scotch in southern Europe had been averted largely by the recent EC agreement on a minimum duty level of Pounds 1.10 a bottle. Mr Bruxner said the industry would continue to campaign against the discriminatory rate of taxation on whisky and other spirits compared with beer and wine. A review of the rates by the European Commission is to be completed by the end of 1994. Buoyant exports to South America also contributed to the first-half growth. Sales to Brazil were 87 per cent higher at Pounds 13.95m, while Venezuela recorded a 36 per cent increase to Pounds 20.2m. A surge in exports to the US during June, which may have been fuelled by fears of an increase in import tariffs, lifted the six-month total 10 per cent higher to Pounds 111m. Sales to Japan slowed, growing only 6 per cent to Pounds 87m. Over the past 12 months, Japan has been overtaken by Spain as the third-largest market for Scotch exports.

0,FT941-14908 ,"FT941-14908 _AN-EARDHAESFT 940118   FT  18 JAN 94 / Malaysian dam project termed 'abuse' of aid: Major agreed deal against official's advice      By JAMES BLITZ   Mr John Major took the final decision to sign an aid deal with the Malaysian government which a top Whitehall official described yesterday as an 'abuse' of taxpayers' money. The aid programme, to build a hydroelectric dam on Malaysia's Pergau river, has cost the British government more than Pounds 300m and is the largest expenditure ever incurred on a single project by the Overseas Development Administration. However, Sir Timothy Lankester, the permanent secretary at the ODA, told MPs yesterday that in early 1991 he repeatedly advised ministers not to sign the deal because the dam would be uneconomic until 2005 and would have a detrimental impact on the Malaysian economy. The project has since been described by the National Audit Office, the government's accountancy watchdog, as 'a very bad buy', while Labour MPs claim that the aid was part of an illegal deal by which Malaysia bought Pounds 1bn of defence equipment. Sir Timothy told the House of Commons public accounts committee yesterday: 'It was an abuse of the aid programme in terms that it is an uneconomic project.' He said that he had sent 'many memoranda' to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, not to go ahead with the project but that, in February 1991, 'the final decision was taken in consultation with the current prime minister'. The preliminary decision to agree a deal with the Malaysian government was first initiated by Lady Thatcher, when she was prime minister, in the summer of 1988. Ministers later realised that the costs of the project were far greater than had been incurred on any comparable ODA programme. But in a statement made to the public accounts committee yesterday, Mr Hurd said the deal needed to be carried through 'because of earlier commitments' that had been made. He also said the project had led to a significant increase in UK exports to Malaysia. However, there have been repeated allegations that the aid programme was linked to a decision taken by Malaysia in 1988 to buy Pounds 1bn worth of defence equipment. A formal link between the two deals could be illegal under the 1966 Overseas Aid Act, but ministers have repeatedly claimed that the two were unconnected. Sir Timothy told MPs that, as a permanent secretary, he had taken the highly unusual step of formally overruling the deal and demanding that Mr Hurd give him a special 'direction' to 'sign the cheques' for it. Under that procedure, Sir Timothy would have incurred no formal responsibility for the decision. He also disclosed that ODA officials undertook an appraisal mission to Malaysia in 1989 which lasted only two days. Sir Timothy said that 'a more substantial appraisal' was required. However, ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry had put pressure on the ODA to come to a decision quickly because of 'the commercial and industrial context'.

The US steel industry has been suffering from a cyclical downturn in prices and demand, though some of the more nimble, low-cost mini-mill manufacturers, notably Nucor, have avoided the heavy losses suffered by the large, integrated companies. Bethlehem expects to return to profitability this year. Mr Curtis Barnette, chairman, said there were encouraging signs of 'an increase in steel demand and the restoration of fair value for our products.' There had been a significant increase in orders. Its net loss was 54 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 36m, or 55 cents, last time, excluding changes in accounting practice. Sales totalled Dollars 1.02bn (Dollars 995m). Nucor's earnings, lower than most forecasts, were 50 cents a share, up from 38 cents. Sales totalled Dollars 489m, against Dollars 388m.   Companies:-  Bethlehem Steel.     Nucor Corp.

0,FT934-3294 ,"FT934-3294 _AN-DLIC6AEOFT 931209   FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Trading warning clips 4p from Avon Rubber shares      By PEGGY HOLLINGER   Shares in Avon Rubber slipped back in a buoyant market yesterday as the group warned of a toughening trading environment in spite of an 18 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits. The shares closed 4p down at 484p. Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to October 2 rose from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 11m. Sales were 14 per cent higher at Pounds 265.7m. Mr Tony Mitchard, chief executive, said that in spite of an 'excellent perfor-mance' from the main tyres division, recession in con-tinental Europe was likely to affect trading in the current year. 'We are going to be hard pushed to make another gain,' he said. Vehicle output on the Continent was estimated to have fallen by about 20 per cent. The tyre division increased operating profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 6.4m on sales just 5 per cent higher at Pounds 82.7m. The current year had begun somewhat 'slower than we had hoped', said Mr Mitchard. The downturn in the European vehicle industry had hit the components division which nevertheless managed to increase operating profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 3.9m. Sales were 26 per cent higher at Pounds 99.8m. The technical products business, which includes Avon's defence related products, had 'fired on all cylinders', said Mr Mitchard, resulting in a 9 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 5m. Sales were 17 per cent higher at Pounds 70.3m. Cadillac, based in the US, had been held back by a squeeze on prices from General Motors, one of its main customers. The group had lost about Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) in busi-ness, as a result. However, sales were 10 per cent higher in dollar terms, said Mr Mitchard, due to greater demand from US vehicle manufacturers. The inflatables business, which returned a loss of Pounds 403,000 against a profit of Pounds 25,000 last time, continued to be difficult. It was uncertain whether this would remain a core business for Avon, he said. The final dividend was maintained at 11.5p for a total of 16.5p (16.5p). The 5 per cent rise in earnings to 30p was held back by the Pounds 22m rights issue in May.   Companies:-  Avon Rubber.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

These lawsuits were mostly launched by overseas companies or  foreign-funded ventures in China, who complained that their  rights were being violated by Chinese bodies.    But there were also a few Chinese who said their rights had  been violated by foreign firms.    These cases account for 20 percent of the total number of  copyright cases which the court has accepted since its  establishment last year.    Cases now under investigation include a suit launched by the  U.S. Disney Company who said its copyright had been violated by  the Beijing Children's Publishing House, and that launched by  Microsoft, Auto Desk, Lotus, who alleged that five Chinese  companies had pirated U.S. computer software technology.    There were also several Hong Kong and Taiwan companies  seeking compensation for copyright losses through the court.    ""We have sealed up the software and computers in those  accused Chinese companies last week for preserving evidence,""  said Su Chi, chief of the copyright court. He said these  companies are all situated in Zhongguanchun, north-west Beijing,  known as China's silicon valley.    ""But we cannot yet draw any conclusion at this moment,"" he  said, adding that previously a Chinese firm was prosecuted by a  foreign company based on false evidence.    Professor Su, 37, who has studied law in Germany, said his  court will treat overseas and Chinese parties based on the  principle of fair judgement. ""The judge is just a machine to  execute laws at our court,"" he said. ""We exclude any personal  feelings.""    Judgements will be made according to China's Civil  Prosecution Law and Copyright Law, which su said are in line  with German laws and international copyright conventions.    In the court, litigants have equal chances to air their case  and no illegal interference will be allowed. Media and experts  will be invited to hear the judgement if the case contains  nothing confidential.    According to Su, most cases were tried by his court  successfully and the litigants felt satisfied.    Recently, the court has tried a case concerning a  Sino-French  food firm and a Beijing supermarket. The supermarket illegally  used the foreign-invested firm's well-known brand, ""Vie de  France"", to sell Chinese-made bread. The Chinese firm was fined  15,000 yuan for copyright violation, though the illegal profit  was only 700 yuan.    ""This is a warning to any copyright violators,"" Su said.  ""And the French boss told me his investment confidence has  become stronger after the trial and he was preparing to set up  new branches this year in China.""    China never favors local protectionism in court, he added.    Su's court was the first copyright court in China. Now it  has 16 full-time workers, including a computer software expert.  All the judges have court working experience of at least five  years and know English.    Cases tried by the court covered the fields of patents,  brand-names, publications, illegal competition, and pilfering of  commercial secrets. The largest compensation stood at 31  million yuan.    Copyright courts have also been established in some other  major Chinese cities.     "

Consequently, Runzheimer recommended that the observations be ranked from low to high and that the top and bottom 20% of the observations be ``trimmed'' (i.e. eliminated) from the data before averages or trends were calculated. (Data were not trimmed if there were fewer than five observations.) OPM agreed. These procedures reduce the influence of anomalies and make survey results more stable from one year to the next.

0,FT942-6205 ,"FT942-6205 _AN-EFAEIABPFT 940601   FT  01 JUN 94 / States tell cigarette makers to cough up on health costs: Fresh legal attacks by Florida and Mississippi that, if successful and replicated, could force the cigarette manufacturers out of business      By RICHARD TOMKINS   The US tobacco industry is under fresh attack. In the last few days, two states - Mississippi and Florida - have announced plans to take US cigarette manufacturers to court in an attempt to recoup costs incurred in treating smoking-related diseases under medical assistance programmes such as Medicaid. The sums the states are seeking are vast: Florida says smoking-related illnesses have cost the state at least Dollars 1.2bn in medical costs since 1989. If its legal action succeeds, and other states do the same, the cigarette manufacturers could be forced out of business. In its intensifying war against the tobacco industry, the US anti-smoking lobby has backed many attempts to sue cigarette manufacturers for the health costs associated with smoking. All efforts have failed: the industry has yet to pay a cent in damages. But these latest cases are different. Earlier suits were brought against manufacturers on behalf of individuals or groups of individuals seeking compensation for their suffering. Mississippi and Florida are not representing individuals: they are asking the industry as a whole to reimburse them for the direct economic costs of treating smoking-related diseases. The distinction is important because it could deny cigarette makers the opportunity to deploy some of their most powerful defences. In previous cases, manufacturers have successfully argued that individuals who smoke knowingly assume all the risks associated with the habit; that those who become ill cannot conclusively prove that smoking was the cause; or that no one can be sure which manufacturer's cigarettes caused the illness. Mississippi believes it will overcome these defences by filing a claim against all 13 US cigarette manufacturers seeking reimbursement of the health costs it incurs in treating smokers. If it wins, the damages will be split between the companies according to their market share. 'This lawsuit is premised on a simple notion. You caused the health crisis: now you pay for it,' Mr Mike Moore, Mississippi attorney general, said. Florida has gone further by signing into law an act that will specifically deny cigarette manufacturers the right to deploy their traditional defences, arguing that they are irrelevant to the issue of how much the state pays out to treat smoking-related diseases. This will greatly enhance the prospects of a successful suit. 'We're going to take the Marlboro Man to court,' said Florida's Governor Lawton Chiles, who is running for a second term in office. The moves by the two states come against a background of growing hostility to smoking in the US from anti-smoking groups, government officials and legislators at local and national level. Ms Jennifer Lew, managing attorney at the Tobacco Products Liability Project, a Boston-based anti-smoking group, says: 'I think the tide has turned so that this sort of legislation has become politically palatable.' Even so, some are concerned about the implications. Associated Industries of Florida, a business organisation for the state, says the principles enshrined in Florida's new legislation could easily be extended to the manufacture of dairy products, sugar, pharmaceuticals or cars. It says it will fight for a repeal. The cigarette manufacturers will also fight the legislative moves. They will almost certainly challenge the constitutionality of Florida's new law; and in the event that any suit succeeds, they will almost certainly appeal. Ms Lew acknowledged that it could be years before the first case is settled. Financially, that may be no bad thing. Like other states, Florida does well out of cigarette sales. Officials concede that the Dollars 1.2bn it has paid out in medical costs in the last five years is not as much as the Dollars 2bn it has collected in taxes on cigarettes.

0,FT924-7411 ,"FT924-7411 _AN-CKQCNABOFT 921117   FT  17 NOV 92 / Modest rise in high-street sales peters out      By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff   A MODEST improvement in high-street sales petered out last month as uncertainty about the economy continued to undermine consumer confidence. A Confederation of British Industry survey shows that high-street sales slipped back last month after September's modest rise in spite of a reduction in base rates to 8 per cent shortly before last month's survey was conducted. Furthermore, the results did not reflect the latest cut in base rates to 7 per cent. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said that cut should encourage more consumers. The survey, which covered 15,000 retailers between October 19 and November 4, showed that off-licences, shoe shops, book shops and stationers were among the worst hit sectors in October. Mr Whittaker said: 'The economic climate remains uncertain though retailers expect that sales in November will be broadly unchanged on a year ago.' Newsagents and hardware shops moved against the trend, reporting moderately improved sales. Since June official figures have shown a gradual improvement in the annual growth rate of retail sales. Economists believe, however, that rising unemployment will continue to hinder consumer demand as people remain worried about losing their jobs. Official retail sales figures for last month, due out tomorrow, are forecast to show a small fall compared with September and a small increase on October last year. The CBI survey showed a fall in sales for wholesalers and motor traders. Wholesalers reported that sales volumes were sharply down on a year ago following a year-on-year increase in September. Motor traders said business last month had fallen significantly below last year's levels. 'Sales of parts and accessories declined moderately while vehicle sales fell sharply,' Mr Whittaker said. 'This bleak picture is expected to continue in November with volumes falling well below last year's levels.' Details of the survey of the retail sector include: Food and drink. Sales by grocers grew sharply in the year to October following three months of flat sales. Food retailers expect sales to improve on an annual basis this month, but the outlook for off-licences remains bleak. Clothing and footwear. Sales for clothes and shoe shops fell compared with a year ago after sharp sales growth in September. Shoe sales were at their worst levels since April. Footwear and clothing retailers report that stocks remain too high relative to expected sales and both are forecasting further year-on-year falls. Chemists. Sales continued to rise against the trend of the recession. After a setback in September sales volumes increased sharply last month compared with a year ago. But sales remain poor for the time of year. Furniture and carpets. Sales fell in October compared with a year before after strong improvements in August and September. The decline probably reflects the fall in house moves following the return in August of stamp duty on house purchases. Sales are expected to fall again this month. Durable household goods. Retailers reported sales unchanged on a year ago and expect a small increase this month.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

0,FT941-15876 ,"FT941-15876 _AN-EAMCUABAFT 940113   FT  13 JAN 94 / World Trade News: European drugs market stagnant      By PAUL ABRAHAMS   Europe's drugs market continued to stagnate during the first 10 months of last year, following healthcare reforms in Italy and Germany. The value of the seven largest markets fell, in dollar terms, from Dollars 43bn (Pounds 28.8bn) during the 10 months to October 1992, to only Dollars 37.9bn for the equivalent period last year. Net of exchange rates, the seven markets registered no growth, according to figures compiled by IMS International, the specialist market research company. Germany remained the market most severely hit. Pharmacy drugs sales fell 10 per cent at constant exchange rates, down from Dollars 12.25bn to Dollars 10.4bn following the Seehofer reforms introduced in January last year. The Italian market also fell as sales dropped from Dollars 9.33bn to Dollars 7bn (down 3 per cent in lira terms). The British, Spanish and Dutch markets continued to demonstrate double-digit growth in local currencies. Sales in the UK fell from Dollars 4.6bn to Dollars 4.2bn in dollar terms, but increased 10 per cent in sterling. Spanish sales also fell in dollar terms, down from Dollars 4.1bn to Dollars 3.7bn, but rose 11 per cent in local currency terms. The Dutch market increased from Dollars 1.26bn to Dollars 1.33bn, a rise of 11 per cent in local currency. The French and Belgian markets continued to grow, though more slowly than other markets. Pharmacy sales in France dropped from Dollars 10.1bn to Dollars 9.9bn, but increased 6 per cent in franc terms. The Belgian market was static at Dollars 1.2bn, but rose in local currencies by 5 per cent. Some important therapeutic areas registered zero or negative growth. Sales of cardiovascular drugs dropped from Dollars 9.7bn to Dollars 8.4bn, a decline of 3 per cent in local currencies. This was mostly because of a decline in prescribing patented ace-inhibitors and cholesterol-lowering drugs in Germany. Sales of alimentary and metabolism treatments - mostly H2-antagonists for ulcers - were static in local currency terms, but fell from Dollars 7.3bn to Dollars 6.4bn. Musculo-skeletal drugs - mostly anti-arthritic compounds - registered a 5 per cent decline in local currencies, down from Dollars 2.6bn to Dollars 2bn. Blood agents also recorded a fall, down 3 per cent from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 1.7bn. No therapeutic area registered double-digit growth. Central nervous system treatments increased sales by only 2 per cent, while respiratory drugs - mostly for asthma - were up only 3 per cent. The fastest growing sector was anti-infectives - antibiotics and anti-virals - up 5 per cent in local currencies.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.     DEZ  Germany, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

While baking margins are still under pressure, the group's British Sugar division is expected to have gained from the green pound devaluation. Hammerson, the UK's third biggest property company, will tomorrow reveal the damage inflicted by the collapse of the property market in the UK, Canada and Australia, its main markets. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to fall from Pounds 55.5m to around Pounds 43m, while net assets per share may fall from 637p to 470p. It is expected to unveil a cut in its 1992 dividend payout from 20.5p to 10p, as indicated by its interim results in October. Smiths Industries, the defence and aerospace components group, is expected to report on Wednesday a drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 44m to about Pounds 40m. Analysts believe restructuring could lead to significant exceptional costs. Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, reports interim results on Thursday, with the City expecting a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 37.2m to about Pounds 25m. Some expect the interim dividend to be reduced (1.85p last time). UK COMPANIES TODAY COMPANY MEETINGS: Record Hldgs., Parkway Works, Kettlebridge Road, Sheffield, 11.45 USDC Inv.

0,FT941-7782 ,"FT941-7782 _AN-EBWDCAD9FT 940223   FT  23 FEB 94 / SmithKline confident of Tagamet's successors      By DANIEL GREEN   Sales of new products from SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US healthcare company, will be strong enough to counter 'a dramatic fall' in sales of Tagamet, once its best-selling drug, according to Mr Jan Leschly, incoming chief executive. Tagamet loses US patent protection in May and at least 10 generic versions of the drug would then be launched, Mr Leschly said yesterday. Concern over the impact of Tagamet's patent expiry has been one reason for the company's near 5 per cent fall in share price over the past year. But Mr Leschly was 'quite confident' that sales of four new drugs ' antidepressant Seroxat (Paxil in the US), arthritis treatment Relifex (Relafen), cancer drug Kytril and hepatitis A vaccine Havrix ' 'will be able to offset the declining sales of Tagamet'. Sales of the four new drugs more than doubled from Pounds 212m in 1992 to Pounds 463m last year. Pre-tax profits for 1993 rose 12 per cent to Pounds 1.22bn, at the top end of analysts' forecasts. Turnover increased 18 per cent to Pounds 6.16bn, thanks to a strong final quarter. But price pressures in several large pharmaceuticals markets meant that the trading profit margin fell 1.5 percentage points to 19.1 per cent. A fourth quarter dividend of 3.3p per A share makes a total of 10.9p, up 24 per cent. Earnings climbed 5 per cent to 29.1p. Mr Bob Bauman, who leaves to chair British Aerospace in April, said that the dividend cover had now reached the company's target level. SmithKline Beecham eliminated year-end debt for the first time since the 1989 merger of SmithKline Beckman of the US with Beecham of the UK. Net cash amounted to Pounds 38m, compared with Pounds 392m debt. In the divisions, pharmaceuticals sales rose 21 per cent to Pounds 3.48bn. When currency factors are taken out, the growth was 9 per cent. The rise was driven by sales and not prices, said Mr Bauman. Tagamet sales fell 6 per cent to Pounds 673m, with currency gains stripped out. After more than 15 years as SmithKline Beckman's and then SmithKline Beecham's best selling product, it is now second to Augmentin, the antibiotic whose sales rose 17 per cent to Pounds 760m. To improve drugs sales further, Mr Leschly said the group was prepared to enter into alliances both in the US and Europe. Other divisions saw steady progress. Sales at Consumer Healthcare, which includes brands such as the soft drink Ribena and toothpaste Aquafresh, rose 12 per cent to Pounds 1.33bn. Lex, Page 22   Companies:-  SmithKline Beecham.

The report, published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, was based on 30 industrial sectors. It says that 'at the level of individual manufacturing industries, Germany does not so clearly dominate Britain, except in the period from 1973 to 1979'. It adds: 'Almost half the industries showed a superior British productivity growth performance over the entire three decades to 1989.'

The company had net income of Dollars 483.5m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with Dollars 403.8m, or Dollars 1.03, a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 2.05bn, against Dollars 1.76bn. Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, attributed the improved earnings to strong unit volume gains, better product mix, cost controls, productivity improvements and a lower tax rate. Sales and earnings were also helped by a favourable exchange rate, which lifted sales in the quarter by 3 percentage points. Sales outside the US accounted for 45 per cent of the first-quarter total, the same proportion as the previous year. On Wall Street, Merck's results underlined the relative safety of the drug sector, and its shares added Dollars 1 to Dollars 110 3/4 at mid-session yesterday, just shy of their 52-week high of Dollars 110 7/8 . During the 1980s, Merck paced the industry in introducing new drugs, and its first-quarter results reflected the strong sales of a range including Mevacor, Vasotec, Zocor, Prinivil and Vaseretic. Merck said yesterday it had filed a new drug application with the Food  Drug Administration (FDA) for its Proscar drug to treat benign prostate enlargement. The condition afflicts about 60 per cent of all men over 50. The drug could bring in annual sales of Dollars 1bn by the end of the decade. American Home Products, another big US drugs company, also reported improved first-quarter earnings and underlying sales yesterday. The company, which sold its household products and depilatory businesses last June, had net income of Dollars 352.5m, or Dollars 1.12, compared with Dollars 314.5m, or Dollars 1 a share, a year ago. Net sales slid 3 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn from Dollars 1.81bn. However, after stripping out discontinued businesses, sales rose by Dollars 133.2m, or 8 per cent, in the 1991 quarter.

0,FT944-5953 ,"FT944-5953 _AN-ELAD8AC4FT 941201   FT  01 DEC 94 / Management (Management and Advertising): Smoking issue smoulders - Victoria Griffith reports on a controversial US proposal      By VICTORIA GRIFFITH   A US federal government proposal to limit smoking in the workplace could soon make private houses, clubs, cars and the outdoors the only places people can light up, and would make cigarette marketing even more difficult for the already embattled tobacco industry. Hearings on the far-reaching proposal by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will wrap up at the end of this month. Already, sparks are flying over the possibility of sweeping changes. Cigarette maker Philip Morris refused to testify at the OSHA hearings this week after accusing the agency of bias against the tobacco industry. The proposal could mean that smoking in any taxi, hotel room or restaurant would be forbidden. Even cigarette and tobacco companies would have to post 'No Smoking' signs in their offices. According to the proposal, setting aside a separate room for smokers within an office building is not enough. The room would also have to be equipped with its own ventilation system. Even if a restaurant sets aside an all-smoking lounge, for instance, management could not ask waiters to enter the area. Similarly, a conductor could not be forced to walk through the smoking car of a train to collect tickets, and a housekeeper could not clean up a hotel room in which someone had been smoking. The speed with which the anti-smoking movement has snowballed has caught many by surprise. Yet OSHA says it is just trying to protect US workers. 'OSHA's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and illnesses and protect the health and safety of America's workers,' says Joseph Dear, assistant secretary of labour for OSHA. 'We believe the evidence supports our conclusion that air contaminants present a significant risk to employees in indoor environments.' The tobacco industry has been trying to garner opposition to the OSHA proposal through a nationwide advertising campaign. 'This is nothing more than an anti-smokers' pipe-dream,' says the Tobacco Institute. The industry argues that proposals would outlaw smoking in private homes, since a carpenter, repairman, or cleaner could not be asked to enter the house. OSHA says this is simply not true. 'The agency is not proposing to regulate smoking in private homes or private vehicles and is not banning smoking,' says Dear. 'The objective of this proposed rule is to protect non-smoking employees from the effects of passive smoke.' Opposition is fiercer than OSHA may have anticipated, however. The agency has received thousands of protest letters, a few so threatening that OSHA handed them over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. With or without the OSHA proposal, the trend in the US is for more smoking restrictions. Vermont and California have strict limitations in place, and dozens of municipalities have banned smoking in all public buildings. The new OSHA proposal, however, means cigarette restrictions would be put in place much faster, and with more far-reaching consequences, than most observers imagined. The restaurant industry is one of the most outspoken opponents of the proposal. The National Restaurant Association estimates that it will lose Dollars 18bn a year in revenue if the smoking ban is enforced. 'People will still go to restaurants, but they won't have the espresso, dessert or drink they would usually enjoy with a cigarette,' says Robert Harrington, director of technical services for the Association. 'That means they won't be spending as much money.' The furore over the proposal will probably guarantee that smoking in the workplace remains a hotly contested issue. Tobacco industry advocates hope the new Republican Congress will prevent OSHA from moving forward with its proposal by enacting a law protecting smokers. However, anti-smoking lobbyists point out that such a stance could be politically dangerous, as the tobacco industry is, at the moment, extremely unpopular with voters.

Saab-Scania, recently bought out by the investment group controlled by the Wallenberg family, predicted that annual earnings would be lower than the 1990 result of SKr2.2bn. Group sales slipped by 6 per cent to SKr6.94bn (Dollars 1.11bn), mainly because the Scania truck division suffered a 10 per cent fall in sales to SKr5.4bn. Losses at Saab Automobile, the 50:50 joint venture with General Motors, increased by 52 per cent to SKr1.011bn during the period. This reduced profits for Saab-Scania by SKr506m. Excluding Saab Automobile, profits for the rest of Saab-Scania declined 6 per cent to SKr764m. Saab Automobile reported a 16 per cent fall in volume sales to 20,800 vehicles, with demand weakening mainly in the Nordic region. Sales amounted to SKr3.36bn, a 18 per cent fall. Sales for Saab Automobile are not consolidated in Saab-Scania results. Saab-Scania and General Motors are discussing a new injection of capital into Saab Automobile. They will decide whether more funds are needed for the company's rationalisation after a review of its capital structure is completed in June. No forecast was offered for Saab Automobile's 1991 profits. The company noted that rationalisation measures taken in 1990 did not affect the first-quarter results. Scania division earnings were also lower than last year's first quarter, but were not specified. Scania's annual profits were predicted to be below last year's SKr2.9bn. Sales of trucks and buses fell by 6 per cent to 7,800 vehicles. Profits increased at the aerospace division, however, with a 17 per cent rise in sales to SKr1.18bn as orders climbed for the Saab 340 and Saab 2000 commuter aircraft. Earnings for 1991 are expected to exceed last year's SKr111m. Saab Combitech, the defence technology division, reported unchanged earnings on sales up by 38 per cent to SKr622m.

Under the ban, smoking would be limited to the bar area in restaurants seating more than 35 people and nearly eliminated in office buildings. The measures, which the full city council is expected to approve on December 21, would also prohibit smoking at open-air sports arenas and zoos. Outdoor cafes would have to provide no-smoking areas. While other cities had stricter smoking curbs on restaurants and offices, it was the provisions on smoking outdoors that made the New York proposal so tough, the Tobacco Institute said. Philip Morris, the tobacco group, has hinted it would leave New York, where it has its headquarters, and cut its funding to the arts if the ban passed as originally drafted. Restaurateurs said the ban would cut their revenues and cited a survey showing the average restaurant expected an 8.1 per cent sales shortfall, representing a loss of 11,000 jobs and Dollars 27m in tax revenues.

Europe's five largest markets - Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Spain - have all announced or enacted reforms over the last 15 months. Sales in the seven largest markets, which include Belgium and the Netherlands, fell from Dollars 51.6bn (Pounds 34.6bn) in 1992 to Dollars 45.97bn last year, according to IMS International, a market research group. In the German market, Europe's biggest, sales dropped to Dollars 12.66bn from Dollars 14.82bn in 1992 - a fall of 9 per cent in local currencies. Italy, the third largest market, also declined, from Dollars 11.06bn to Dollars 8.45bn. The rate of sales growth fell in every therapeutic category in Europe. The cardiovascular market, which expanded at 7 per cent in 1992, grew only 2 per cent last year to Dollars 10.13bn. The growth rate for treatments for alimentary and metabolism disorders, the second most important category, also fell, down from 8 per cent in 1992 to only 1 per cent last year. The anti-infectives market which include anti-virals, antibiotics and anti-fungal drugs, posted the strongest growth, up 8 per cent last year compared with 9 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile, the US market, the world's largest, expanded only 5 per cent from Dollars 42.95bn to Dollars 45.22bn. Companies operating there have suffered from both political pressure aimed at moderating price rises and the negotiating of discounts by bulk purchasers. The Canadian market grew by 7 per cent in local currency, and rose from Dollars 3.5bn to Dollars 3.514bn measured in US dollars. The Japanese pharmacy market - excluding hospitals - increased by 6 per cent in yen terms, up from Dollars 16.6bn in 1992 to Dollars 20.2bn last year. But the Japanese ministry of health and welfare is implementing a 6.6 per cent price cut and other reforms aimed at limiting drugs spend-ing. Sales of cardiovascular drugs in the 10 largest markets - the US, Canada, Japan and the seven European countries - rose by only 1 per cent in local currency value, although in dollar terms they actually fell from Dollars 21.98bn to Dollars 21.2bn. Among the largest categories, anti-infectives were the best performers, up from Dollars 11.02bn to Dollars 11.7bn, a rise 9 per cent in local currencies. Worst performing were musculo-skeletal treatments - mostly anti-rheumatics. This was the only category to register a year-on-year local currency decline in the 10 markets. Sales fell by 1 per cent, as a series of patents expiring around the world undermined the market, which dropped from Dollars 7.13bn to Dollars 6.91bn.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

The first half of the session saw strong demand for BAT which sent the shares climbing 16 to 1015p. Enthusiasts expected a further advance in the afternoon ahead of a clutch of brokers' recommendations early next week. However, the announcement from Philip Morris sent BAT plunging on fears that a price war might have a severe effect on the group's current year profits. The shares closed near the day's low, down 71 1/2 at 927 1/2 p, with a hefty 14m traded by the close. Hoare Govett moved the stock from a buy to a hold and indicated it could be shaving the current-year forecast by around Pounds 120m to about Pounds 2.1bn. But, Mr Chris Alexander at Lehman Brothers remained confident about the underlying performance of the company and said yesterday's price fall 'had been overdone given BAT's exposure to the US market.' Rothmans was also affected. The shares fell 18 to 657p.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2111 Cigarettes.     P2121 Cigars.

Mr Larry Summers, treasury under-secretary for international affairs, said programmes that end the excessive use of energy are 'strategies' that the bank must pursue. The bank has in recent years increased its activities in the energy conservation field and has advised many countries on restructuring their energy sectors to reduce subsidies and introduce more efficient pricing. Mr Summers yesterday told the Overseas Development Council, a Washington-based research and pressure group on development issues, that the World Bank currently lends 20 times as much for energy production as it does for energy conservation. Mr Summers said subsidised energy prices led to waste and needless pollution.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.

Merck, the world's biggest drugs company, posted slightly better-than-expected profits for the quarter, but the improvement lagged the company's historical strength and reflected the impact of inflation and unfavourable exchange rates. Stripping out accounting changes last year, Merck's 1993 first-quarter net income rose 10 per cent to Dollars 613.8m, or 54 cents a share, from Dollars 559m, or 48 cents. Including accounting changes, the company earned Dollars 96.6m, or 8 cents, in the 1992 quarter. Sales advanced to Dollars 2.38bn from Dollars 2.22bn. Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said price increases had virtually no effect on sales growth. Sales in the quarter were led by new products. Merck reiterated its predictions of moderate earnings growth for 1993, reflecting worldwide healthcare cost-containment measures and an increasingly turbulent and competitive environment in the US. Eli Lilly reported a 16 per cent decline in underlying first-quarter earnings to Dollars 373.5m, or Dollars 1.27, on essentially flat sales of Dollars 1.56bn. The company warned investors in March that slower sales of several important drugs could reduce first-quarter earnings per share by more than 20 per cent. Lilly's net income for the three months, including accounting changes in both years, was Dollars 362.6m, or Dollars 1.23, against Dollars 325.8m, or Dollars 1.10. American Cyanamid, the pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, turned in underlying first-quarter profits of Dollars 118.7m, or Dollars 1.32, up from Dollars 114.8m, or Dollars 1.25, a year ago. Including accounting changes, Cyanamid had a deficit in the latest quarter of Dollars 433.7m, or Dollars 4.82. Sales in the quarter to March 31 rose 1.6 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn, from Dollars 1.38bn. Its agricultural segment had strong sales of crop protection products, but the medical side posted a decline in first-quarter sales. Its chemicals arm unveiled an operating loss, largely linked to accounting standards. In February, Cyanamid said it would spin off its Dollars 1bn chemicals business to shareholders later this year. Warner-Lambert unveiled an 11 per cent rise in underlying first-quarter earnings to Dollars 181.1m, or Dollars 1.34, from Dollars 163.6m, or Dollars 1.22, last year. Including accounting changes and a one-time charge in the latest quarter, the company had net income of Dollars 182.1m, or Dollars 1.35. Monsanto, the US chemicals group, has received approval to expand the use of its Nutrasweet or aspartame artificial sweetener. The Food and Drug Administration approved four new applications for the product, allowing it to be used in most non-alcoholic drinks, confectioneries, commercial baked goods and low-alcohol beer.

Mr Padraig Flynn, European health commissioner, said it was a 'matter of great regret' that member states were unable to agree on a ban, which would end all tobacco advertising in the European Union, except at the point of sale. The proposal has been fiercely opposed by the UK, which favours a system of voluntary restraint, backed by a blocking minority of Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Greece. Lawyers advising the council of ministers yesterday disputed the Commission's decision to press for a ban under single market rules in the EU treaty. The Commission argues that, unless conflicting national legislation is harmonised, publications containing tobacco advertising will not circulate freely around the Union. But the Commission and the Belgian presidency said yesterday they were extremely surprised that the council's legal service had raised such objections after two years of debate on the measure. Mr Flynn said he could not comment on the possible options for the Commission until he had considered the legal base for any new approach to the problem.

Consolidated net income from continuing operations fell 34 per cent, to Dollars 13.9m, on sales off 20 per cent to Dollars 171.5m. The group said it had been hit by enforced price reductions on its products in many European countries. Meanwhile, in the US many patients delayed treatment in the hope that the costs would be reimbursed under the Clinton administration's health care plan. Moreover, devaluations in Italy and Spain, where the group makes nearly half its sales, hurt the figures. The group also pointed out that sales in the third quarter of last year were exceptionally strong. For the nine months, total sales were off 13 per cent to Dollars 548.3m, while net income from continuing operations was down 11.4 per cent to Dollars 52,942. Sales of Saizen, the group's recombinant human growth hormone, rose 4.3 per cent in the first nine months, while sales of Metrodin, a follicle-stimulating hormone, jumped 25 per cent.

The results were aided by currencies. At comparable exchange rates, sales were up 11 per cent and pre-tax profits 10 per cent. The company said profits were less affected by currency because of hedging policy. Earnings per share were up 14 per cent from 6.6p to 7.5p. Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive, said: 'We have had four years of substantial growth. SB is on the right track for ongoing growth. 'Controlling healthcare costs is a priority, but government leaders should understand that medicines, which account for less than 10 per cent of total medical costs in most countries, dramatically lower costs by maintaining health and limiting the need for far more expensive surgery and hospitalisation,' he said. In Europe, pharmaceuticals sales only grew by 3 per cent. Legislation in Italy and Germany cut sales by 15 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. In the UK and France they rose 10 per cent and 19 per cent. The pharmaceuticals division's turnover rose 32 per cent from Pounds 674m to Pounds 886m while trading profits increased 14 per cent from Pounds 215m to Pounds 245m. Performance was helped by US sales up by 25 per cent. Drugs sales were also helped by new products which had not come on stream fully for the same period last year. Sales of new products were Pounds 95m, compared with Pounds 212m for all of 1992. These included Seroxat, an anti-depressant known as Paxil in the US, Relafen, an anti-arthritic, Kytril, an anti-nausea and vomiting treatment, and Havrix, a hepatitis A vaccine. Sales of Augmentin, an antibiotic increased 22 per cent to Pounds 212m, following a weak first quarter last year. Sales of Tagamet, an anti-ulcer compound and traditionally the company's best-selling drug, fell 22 per cent against an unusually strong first quarter in 1992. The medicine comes off patent next month in the US, its largest market. Consumer brands, which include Lucazade and Ribena, generated turnover up 10 per cent from Pounds 322m to Pounds 355m, while operating profits fell 14 per cent from Pounds 43m to Pounds 37m.

0,FT944-3319 ,"FT944-3319 _AN-ELNEAAB9FT 941214   FT  14 DEC 94 / Hurd admits he illegally endorsed Pergau aid      By JAMES BLITZ   Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday acknowledged that he had illegally endorsed an aid donation of Pounds 216m to help build Malaysia's Pergau dam, but refused to apologise in the Commons. In a statement to MPs, Mr Hurd said he would not appeal against a recent High Court judgment that the Pergau project was 'economically unsound' and that his endorsement of the donation in 1991 had broken British legislation on overseas aid. He also revealed that three other contracts signed under Britain's Aid and Trade Provision in the past eight years could be deemed illegal given the judgment. These were a contract for the Ankara metro in Turkey worth Pounds 22m, a Pounds 2.3m television studio project in Indonesia and a Pounds 2.9m contract for flight information facilities in Botswana. Facing repeated demands from opposition benches for his resignation, Mr Hurd said future payments for Pergau would come directly out of Treasury reserves and not the Overseas Development Administration's budget. He also said that the Pounds 48m which the government must pay to Malaysia for the project in 1994-95 and 1995-96 would not be matched by commensurate cuts in ODA funding. This would give the department a surplus to allocate to other projects. Outstanding payments for the other three projects will also come from Treasury reserves to ensure that they fall within the remit of the Overseas Development and Co-operation Act 1980. The necessary supplementary estimates are to be laid before parliament. But Mr Hurd angered Labour MPs when he said the Pounds 24m which the ODA had spent on Pergau in previous financial years would not be restored to the department. Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader, who has taken a close interest in the affair, attacked Mr Hurd. 'What is self-evident to the taxpayer is that this money was misused,' he said. 'The taxpayer believes that the limited budget for overseas aid should be used for the proper purpose, and you should reinstate those funds.' But Mr Hurd also left open the possibility that the ODA budget would suffer a serious cut after 1996-97, when the Treasury will have another Pounds 122m to pay to the Malaysian authorities. Mr Hurd said that the size of the ODA budget in those years would have to be set in forthcoming public expenditure rounds. But Treasury officials could seek drastic reductions in ODA spending in those years to make up for the increased expenditure incurred by their own contingency fund. During angry exchanges in the Commons, Mr Hurd refused repeated invitations from opposition MPs to give a public apology over the issue. Instead, he insisted that Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, had made a commitment that could not be broken. 'I do not feel penitent at taking a fairly robust view of where the interests of this country lie,' he said. However, Sir David Steel accused Mr Hurd and Lady Thatcher of having 'steamrollered' the ODA into the Pergau project. Mr Hurd said that activities financed by the ODA were 'not in general vulnerable to the kind of legal challenge brought in the case of Pergau'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Hyundai Corporation, the group's trading arm, reported that net earnings rose by 3.7 per cent to Won5.45bn (Dollars 6.7m), although sales fell by 1.6 per cent to Won11,000bn as overseas shipments were disrupted by strikes affecting several Hyundai companies last summer. Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest car manufacturer, had a 39 per cent increase in net profits to Won58.2bn as sales rose by 18 per cent to Won7,180bn due to strong exports benefiting from a weak Korean Won. The domestic car sales division, Hyundai Motor Service, suffered a 32 per cent drop in net profits to Won17.3bn as low-interest consumer financing offered by the company to boost sales put pressure on earnings. Sales increased by 20.9 per cent to Won3,903bn. Hyundai Engineering and Construction had a 9 per cent increase in earnings to Won20.7bn as sales rose by 3 per cent to Won2,774bn. South Korea's largest shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, reported that net profits declined by 21 per cent to Won221bn in 1993 as sales fell by 12 per cent to Won2,170bn. The results reflected lower profit margins on ships ordered in 1992 and delivered last year. Industrial disputes at the shipyard last summer also depressed sales. However, HHI, which is seeking a listing on the Seoul bourse, remains the subsidiary with the largest profits in the Hyundai group. Hyundai Precision  Industry, the world's leading container manufacturer, had a loss of Won48.9bn in 1993 against a profit of Won5.5bn in 1992 due to a drop in exports. Sales, however, increased by 6.3 per cent to Won1,340bn. Inchon Iron  Steel had a 20.5 per cent fall in profits to Won11.5bn, although sales rose by 18 per cent to Won1,083bn. It blamed the earnings decline on a rise in the international prices for scrap steel. Hyundai Pipe, the nation's largest steel pipe maker, had a loss of Won4.9bn against a profit of Won1.2bn in 1992. It blamed the earnings drop on price competition from manufacturers in developing nations. Sales increased by 24 per cent to Won321bn. Hyundai Wood Industries, a timber and furniture company, had a loss of Won4.5bn against a profit of Won1.9bn in 1992. Sales rose by 22.6 per cent to Won397bn. Keum-Kang Development, an owner of department stores and hotels, took a loss of Won4.9bn against a profit of Won3bn in 1992.   Companies:-  Hyundai Corp.     Hyundai Motor.

From 6pm last night, tax on each packet of 20 cigarettes rose by 10p and the chancellor promised that duty on other tobacco products would rise by a similar proportion. However, the tax on beer, table wine and spirits was left unchanged as the chancellor responded to complaints from the drinks industry about duties and the increase in cross-Channel shopping and smuggling. The chancellor reduced the duty on fortified wine by 13p per bottle and on sparkling wine by 27p to bring the two duties into line with each other. Mr Kenneth Clarke's action on beer was largely expected as a Treasury select committee last week rejected a call by brewers for beer duty to be halved to curb cross-Channel imports. In his speech, Mr Clarke said cross-border shopping and smuggling had 'meant a loss of duty to the exchequer'. He said that 'no chancellor can remain unmoved in the face of this, but neither can any chancellor simply adopt popular measures to cut taxes on alcohol that would threaten the revenue'.

Ebright has resigned.    Not so surprising was a separate announcement that profits for the big  Philadelphia drug manufacturer dropped 60% to $229 million in 1988. Sales rose  10% to $4.7 billion.    Fewer people are using the company's major product, the ulcer medicine Tagamet,  and SmithKline management has no new drugs ready to take up the slack in sales.  Instead, SmithKline -- the nation's eighth-largest drug company -- is trying to  decide whether to sell or restructure some of its businesses.    These include two Orange County subsidiaries: Beckman Instruments in Fullerton,  a manufacturer of instruments for medical laboratories, and Allergan in Irvine,  a manufacturer of eye-care and skin-care products.    SmithKline recently sold 17% of Beckman's stock to the public as part of the  company-wide restructuring.    Ebright may have resigned because he disagreed with the pace of the changes,  some stock analysts said. Another possible source of friction: Chairman Henry  Wendt, who will assume Ebright's duties, said he would give more autonomy to  subsidiaries, which meant less responsibility for the president.    In a statement, Wendt said that Ebright, 50, resigned over ""differences on  matters of corporate policy.""    Ebright, president since April, 1987, said in an interview only that his  resignation was ""instigated solely by me, over some policy matters that deeply  affect this company.""    Neither man would elaborate.    Two other top SmithKline executives resigned recently, and the company's stock  price is well below analysts' estimates of its break-up value, touching off  rumors that another drug company might try a hostile takeover. Those rumors  weren't allayed by Wednesday's news, stock analysts said.    ""This brings everything else out in the open,"" said Jonathan S. Gelles, an  analyst at brokers Wertheim Schroeder in New York. ""I don't think you can rule  out a takeover.""    Rumored in the past to be interested: British drug manufacturer Beecham Group  PLC and Swiss drug company Ciba-Geigy AG, both of which have said they aren't  interested.    While the parent company is struggling, some of SmithKline's businesses are  doing well enough to be coveted by other companies. Beckman Instruments, for  instance, said Wednesday that profits rose 9% to $42.5 million last year. Sales  rose 11% to $770 million.    SmithKline hasn't ruled out selling more Beckman stock to the public or selling  part of Allergan. Both companies said Wednesday that SmithKline had yet to make  a decision on whether to spin them off.    The parent company also owns SmithKline Bio-Science, which has a laboratory in  Van Nuys. Together the three subsidiaries employ nearly 8,000 in Southern  California.    But even a stock sale may be too little, too late for the company, according to  stock analysts, who said that management hasn't prepared very well for the  decline in Tagamet sales.    Investors Wednesday seemed to agree. They greeted news of Ebright's resignation  by bidding up SmithKline stock $1.375 a share, to $52.    Analysts said that Wendt, 55, should share the blame for the company's  declining fortunes. Wendt became chairman at the same time that Ebright assumed  the presidency. Both are long-term employees.    ""To say Ebright did not do a very good job is evident from the company's  position,"" said Viren Mehta, an analyst at S.G. Warburg & Co. Inc. in New  York. ""But to single out one person is to suggest nobody else is to blame,  which is simply not true.""    Despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars on research, the company has  yet to come up with a new drug to replace Tagamet, once the best-selling  prescription drug in the world.    ""They've spent that kind of money and there's very little in the pipeline,""  said Robert Uhl, an analyst for Salomon Bros. ""They haven't had anything for  five years.""    In addition to these products, SmithKline also makes Dyazide, a blood pressure  drug; Ecotrin, a coated aspirin, and Contac, an allergy medication.    But it was Tagamet that showered profits on SmithKline in the heady 1970s.  SmithKline had the $1.8-billion U.S. market for prescription ulcer medicines  pretty much to itself until 1983, when British drug manufacturer Glaxo Holdings  PLC introduced Zantac.    At the time, patients could take Zantac less frequently and it was thought to  have fewer side effects. And although it was more expensive than Tagamet, it  stormed into the lead within a few years. Zantac now accounts for 46% of the  U.S. market, compared with 29% for Tagamet.    Worldwide, where sales of ulcer medicines totaled $5 billion last year, Zantac  had an estimated 44% market share, compared with 21% for Tagamet.    Although Tagamet still accounted for more than $1 billion in sales last year,  the company said sales of Tagamet were down ""sharply"" in the United States.  That's a problem because Tagamet accounts for a significant portion of  SmithKline's profits.    Mehta, the analyst, estimates that Tagamet sales fell 10% worldwide last year.  He predicted that Zantac will become the first drug in history to have $2  billion in sales this year.    Like other analysts, Mehta said he wouldn't be averse to seeing SmithKline  radically restructure, either prompted from within or from a new owner.    ""At the moment, only Wendt is left from the old guard,"" Mehta said. ""So far he  appears to have the confidence of the board. But one has to ask whether the  situation is getting desperate and how long the board can wait?""    Times staff writer Leslie Berkman contributed to this report.

Sumitomo said the steep fall in profits resulted from high depreciation costs, increased distribution expenses, as well as a rise in net financial expenses. Sales for the year came to Y701.2bn, a decline of 2.2 per cent. Sales of speciality chemicals, including dyes, agricultural chemicals and advanced materials, grew by 2.2 per cent to Y210bn. Aluminium sales were hit hard by the decline in ingot prices, with sales falling 20 per cent to Y63.7bn. Basic chemicals sales were off by 1 per cent to Y427.5bn. Sumitomo said that, given the sluggishness of the Japanese economy, it was unable to expand sales to offset the increase in costs during the year. Non-operating financial income fell marginally to Y27.3bn, while financial costs rose by Y4.6bn to Y30.4bn. Net income per share declined by 9.7 per cent to Y9.39. The dividend for the year came to Y6 per share, unchanged from 1990.  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "

Deepening the mystery, Daniels added, the buyer said he shipped the wine back  to the merchant, but it ""disappeared somewhere between Japan and Los Angeles.""    A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a branch of the  Treasury Department, confirmed the probe but would identify neither buyer nor  seller.

The damning report from the EU's Court of Auditors follows five  years of investigation by Terry Wynn, the Labour Merseyside East  MEP [Member of European Parliament]. ""It's an indictment of not  just the tobacco sector but the whole Common Agricultural  Policy,"" said Mr Wynn yesterday.    ""The report is everything that I have asked for,"" he said.  But he demanded action yesterday fom both the European  Commission and national governments. ""This is a total misuse of  public funds,"" he said. Nearly all of the EU's 180,000 tobacco  growers live in Spain, Italy and Greece. The cost of propping  up the sector was 1.274bn ecus (1bn pounds) last year. The  report notes that changes have been made to policy, but says  that huge and in many cases unnecessary costs will continue. It  blames the European Commission and member states alike.    The most serious allegation in the report concerns the  fraudulent manipulation of the market with the assistance of a  Commission official who later committed suicide, and inadequate  attempts by the Commission to get to the bottom of the affair.  ""In 1990, the Commission carried out an internal inquiry into  the management of the tobacco division,"" the report notes.  ""During the inquiry the Commission received allegations that a  cartel had existed and been aided by the head of division....  The report itself indicates that the possible loss over an  eight-year period could have been as high as ECU 40 million.""    During the 1989-90 period one Italian company and one Greek  company accounted for about half of all the tobacco sold off  from EU stocks. The Commission launched a disciplinary action  against the head of division. But, it notes, ""no action has  been taken to carry out adequate inquiries into the allegations  of a cartel and the consequences for the Community budget."" It  adds: ""There was no evidence of action on the part of the  Commission or a member state to bring suspected wrongdoers to  justice."" The Commission maintains that the investigation is  ongoing, even though the official killed himself last year.    The Court of Auditors says that it found the Commission ""not  as forthcoming as it should have been"" over this affair. And it  makes further requests for ""a copy of a contract with a company,  connected with a retired Commission official, which conducted  (the investigation) and for details of payments made thereunder.""    Large quantities of tobacco were exported at very low prices  from Italy, Spain and Greece with the aid of EU subsidies. In  many cases the tobacco was worthless and simply sent abroad to  claim the cash, mainly to Hungary, Russia and Albania. ""The  tobacco had no real commercial value and the exporter's profit  from such operations was almost entirely derived from the export  refund,"" the report says. A separate investigation is going on  into what appears to be a massive case of fraud involving  exports to Albania, Mr Wynn said yesterday, sparked by his  inquiries. ""Exports from Italy to Albania amounted to 25,906  tonnes in 1990 but 23,087 tonnes or 89 per cent did not reach  its destination,"" the report says, with a lOm ecus cost to the  EU. Fraudulent exports from Greece to Albania cost another  23.4m ecus.    The report says that a large proportion of the EU's  resources  were spent subsidising tobacco for which there is little or no  demand. For two varieties which ""hardly had a market""  overproduction was estimated at 215,000 tonnes in 1987-92.  Altogether the EU spent more than 800m ecus on ""problem  varieties.""    The result of the EU schemes was to make tobacco production  far more profitable than it should have been in proportion to  the amount of land involved. ""The net income (per hectare) was  more than three times as high as as the average net income...for  all types of farms in the same member states,"" the report says.  The level of EU support was 23 times higher than that for  cereals, for instance. The Court of Auditors calculates that if  the EU had handed over the equivalent of the income that tobacco  farmers get in cash, rather than managing the market, the cost  would be halved.     "

0," LA060390-0057   228091    June 3, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition      Calendar; Page 98; Calendar Desk      1493 words      ART FOR RENT IN MUSEUM'S BARGAIN BASEMENT;    A LACMA GALLERY HELPS STRUGGLING ARTISTS BY MAKING IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR  PEOPLE TO RENT OR BUY THEIR ORIGINAL WORKS      By JIM SCHMALTZ      Every week people walk out of the basement of the Los Angeles County Museum of  Art with original pieces of contemporary art -- and security does nothing to  stop them. Some will keep the works in their homes or offices for months;  others will keep them permanently.    Don't sound the alarm. It's all the work of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery, a  little-known showcase hidden away under the museum's Anderson Building, a place  better known for its cafeteria. Created almost 30 years ago as part of the Arts  Museum Council, this busy office and gallery displays, rents and sells  contemporary art created by more than 250 Los Angeles-area artists it  represents.    ""We are expanding the art base of the city by showing all kinds of the people  in Los Angeles that it's possible to support contemporary art,"" said Terri  Smooke, current director of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery. ""We're showing  people how to live with art.""    Acting as an independent gallery within the museum, the gallery has three  goals: exposing emerging artists, making original art more affordable to the  general public and raising money for the county museum's acquisitions fund. The  gallery organizes five exhibits each year, showcasing the work of five artists  each time. Each exhibit hangs for five weeks.    Despite the unimpressive amount of space -- the program occupies a basement  hallway, where exhibits hang, and one small office -- Smooke said the gallery  brings in more than $500,000 a year.    But Smooke and the rest of her all-volunteer staff stress the importance of  launching new talent into the L.A. art world. The Art Rental and Sales Gallery  often provides the best option for struggling artists.    ""We accept only those artists who are not part of the formal gallery system,""  or don't have any official representation, said Smooke, adding that many of the  artists who are chosen have eventually been picked up by established galleries.    Besides giving much-needed exposure to little-known talents, the gallery also  presents an opportunity for the beginning collector. With rental prices ranging  from $15 to $110 for two months (works can be rented only on a bimonthly  basis), museum members of almost any income range can afford to take home an  original work. Non-members can purchase pieces outright, but cannot rent. All  they have to do is walk into the office and ask to see what's available.    ""We're talking the American system here,"" Smooke said. ""Our work isn't priced  like David Hockney and Frank Stella. Almost any person can rent art and keep it  for as long as they would like, or ultimately purchase the art because the  payments apply to the purchase.""    According to Smooke, the renters come from all age groups and backgrounds, with  the only common denominator being museum membership and a desire to experiment  with art.    ""Some people see something in a show and they fall in love with it. Others  simply want to make their living or work spaces more attractive. They want to  enrich their surroundings,"" she said.    ""Our niche in the community is to try and help those people who aren't in the  regular art market yet,"" said Susan Franklin, co-chairman of the five-member  Exhibitions Committee of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery, the group that  chooses the artists who appear in the gallery shows.    Partly because it is under the aegis of the county museum, the gallery is able  to pay 75% of the rental and purchase fee directly to the artists. The gallery  keeps the other 25%. So besides having their work see the light of day, new  artists can also reap immediate financial benefits from the program.    ""It's brought me a regular check every month,"" says artist Stuart Saks, who was  part of a show last spring and currently has eight pieces on rent. ""It's a  wonderful program. It's an entry-level process for beginning artists.""    Marjorie Sievers had her work displayed in a show that ran in February and says  that money isn't the only benefit of participating in the program.    ""People see the announcement, and they say, 'Gosh, the county museum. How  wonderful!' They don't think of it based in a hallway,"" she said.    Sievers, who saw four of her five paintings on aluminum rented the first night  of her show, sees an added advantage in the location of the gallery.    ""All kinds of people, all the collectors, go down to the basement because  that's where the curators and all the office personnel are,"" Sievers said.  ""Some big-time art dealers will see your work down there.""    The gallery is divided into three separate areas that work together to choose,  store and distribute the art. The Exhibitions Committee handles submissions by  artists and refers artists to the Rental Division. This division actually  processes the rental art from the tiny office where as many as 150 pieces are  stored.    The third area, the Corporate Division, rents art to businesses.    ""Exhibition is really the center, the heart of this program,"" Smooke said.  ""That's where we get our credibility in the artists' community because they  understand that this is a serious gallery. It's not just a money-making  venture.""    Franklin and her co-chairman Nancy Freedman look for artists doing something  novel. ""We are looking for artists who are doing something different, something  we haven't seen before, maybe a little bit on the cutting edge. We are  interested in serious work, art that may be a little bit tough for people,""  says Franklin, who receives about eight to 10 submissions per week. ""We don't  want the kind of stuff you see at neighborhood sidewalk art shows. It's beyond  craft.""    After the committee members decide which applicants interest them, they make  studio visits. Sometimes they return two or three times before choosing an  artist for a show.    ""We try to put together a mixture. We show photography, dimensional work,  abstract work -- a real eclectic mix,"" Franklin said.    According to Franklin, who is in her second year of heading the committee (the  council alternates chairmanships every two years), positions on the Exhibitions  Committee are the most coveted in the Art Rental and Sales Gallery, mostly  because its members are the bearers of good news.    ""When you call the artists and tell them they've been accepted, it's a little  bit like that old TV show, 'The Millionaires,' "" Franklin said.    But even an artist's works that are considered unsuitable for exhibition are  often passed down to the Rental Division. Doris Gamson, who heads the Rental  Division, says the goal is to collect a variety of high-quality art that still  maintains a wide appeal.    ""We'll keep an artist's work on hand for five years. We hope that after five  years, they'll be a little more self-sufficient,"" Gamson said.    The more work the better, said Gamson, who sees more renters now than ever.  Currently there are about 450 people who rent art from the gallery. ""We're  getting more popular lately. An average of about 15 to 20 renters a week come  in to look at the art. Before holidays, we have them lined up waiting to get  in.""    The Corporate Division operates much like the Rental Division, except the  corporate renters are required to keep work for six-month increments, and at  least one employee of the corporation must be a museum member. For a $100  consultation fee -- which is credited as a donation to the museum -- a  representative of the Corporate Division will advise the company on how to best  utilize its space.    At any given time, the Corporate Division is working with a minimum of 50  companies, Gamson said. ""And that can range from five pieces to 50 pieces per  job.""    Gamson estimated that 20% of all renters end up purchasing the works, but most  return the art after the initial two months.    ""You might get somebody that picks something that they think they're mad about  today, and in two months they'll change their minds,"" Gamson said. ""Our biggest  individual renter has 60 pieces out now. He sees so many he likes here in the  office, but then they'll end up under his bed. Every once in a while he'll  bring one of them back.""    It's this luxury of relatively painless financial risk that attracts a lot of  inexperienced art lovers into starting collections.    For years, Larry Layne, a San Fernando Valley real estate developer, considered  purchasing art, but with an educational background in business and science, he  felt ill-equipped to deal directly with galleries.    ""I found the concept of walking into a gallery intimidating,"" said Layne. ""I  didn't want to take a financial gamble on something I didn't feel comfortable  with.""    Four years ago, Layne rented his first piece from the Art Rental and Sales  Gallery. Today he has 30 rented works hanging in his office and his Marina del  Rey home. He has purchased four.    ""I learned how I felt about art and how long a piece would own my interest,""  Layne said. ""I've learned a lot about art criticism from the staff at the  gallery.

Some will keep the works in their homes or offices for months;  others will keep them permanently.    Don't sound the alarm. It's all the work of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery, a  little-known showcase hidden away under the museum's Anderson Building, a place  better known for its cafeteria. Created almost 30 years ago as part of the Arts  Museum Council, this busy office and gallery displays, rents and sells  contemporary art created by more than 250 Los Angeles-area artists it  represents.    ""We are expanding the art base of the city by showing all kinds of the people  in Los Angeles that it's possible to support contemporary art,"" said Terri  Smooke, current director of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery. ""We're showing  people how to live with art.""    Acting as an independent gallery within the museum, the gallery has three  goals: exposing emerging artists, making original art more affordable to the  general public and raising money for the county museum's acquisitions fund. The  gallery organizes five exhibits each year, showcasing the work of five artists  each time. Each exhibit hangs for five weeks.    Despite the unimpressive amount of space -- the program occupies a basement  hallway, where exhibits hang, and one small office -- Smooke said the gallery  brings in more than $500,000 a year.    But Smooke and the rest of her all-volunteer staff stress the importance of  launching new talent into the L.A. art world. The Art Rental and Sales Gallery  often provides the best option for struggling artists.    ""We accept only those artists who are not part of the formal gallery system,""  or don't have any official representation, said Smooke, adding that many of the  artists who are chosen have eventually been picked up by established galleries.    Besides giving much-needed exposure to little-known talents, the gallery also  presents an opportunity for the beginning collector. With rental prices ranging  from $15 to $110 for two months (works can be rented only on a bimonthly  basis), museum members of almost any income range can afford to take home an  original work.

0,FT934-9454 ,"FT934-9454 _AN-DKJC4AFUFT 931110   FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers dull      By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN   There was further depressing news in the food retail sector as Smith New Court, the stockbroker, reduced profits forecasts for the leading supermarket groups. In a major review of the market, Smith went further down the negative track than any other broker so far in suggesting that the sector will see virtually nil earnings growth in the 1994-95 financial year. The house, which blamed the recent round of price competition for its move, was previously looking for earnings growth of 7 to 8 per cent. Supermarket shares steadied yesterday, although dealers said this was only a temporary halt, with few signs of buying around. Of the leaders, brisk trading saw Argyll Group stay at 257p with 10m dealt, J. Sainsbury added 2 1/2 at 368 1/2 p in volume of 6.4m, and Tesco slipped 2 to 184p in turnover of 7.1m. A downgrade from Cazenove on First Leisure was said to be responsible for the shares tumbling 20 to 257p. The broker, which has a policy of not commenting on market rumours, was said to have cut its forecast from Pounds 38m to Pounds 36m. The market range is Pounds 38m to Pounds 41m. Forte outshone the market for a second session, with reports of management changes at the Savoy Group possibly responsible. Forte has a majority of shares in the hotel group but a minority of the votes. Forte gained 5 at 224p and Savoy held at 790p. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries rose 13 to 491p as the end of the tobacco price war in the US was marked by a price rise from RJR Nabisco. Its subsidiary RJ Reynolds Tobacco raised cigarette prices to wholesalers by 40 cents a pack. Conglomerate Hanson, which generates much of its profits in the US, was helped by a rise in the US stock market and also by buying of call options, derivatives which give investors the right to buy shares at a fixed price and date and usually indicate confidence that the share price is set to rise. The shares put on 5 1/4 at 275 1/2 p. High street bank National Westminster recovered 8 to 547p in spite of an announcement that Ulster Bank, its Belfast-based subsidiary, was cutting variable loan rates in the Republic of Ireland, including mortgages, by  1/2 percentage point to 7.75 per cent. Drugs group Fisons was weak in a generally stronger sector on consideration of the company's announcement that it had suspended its West Midlands sales manager following allegations of unethical sales practices. Analysts said press allegations that some Fisons salesmen had tried to bribe doctors into prescribing its asthma drug Tilade had only added to the problems of a group already struggling with a weak product pipeline. The shares closed 4 off at 143p, with some additional pressure said to have come from the first half of a large bed and breakfast trade, a deal in which shares are sold just before the close of trading and bought back first thing the next day in order to establish a tax loss. Elsewhere, Glaxo added 6 at 659p, Wellcome rose 8 to 685p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' rebounded 13 1/2 to 409p. In spite of further falls in the price of Brent crude, British Petroleum gained 8 at 360p on heavy turnover of more than 14m shares. Analysts said UK institutions who had been left increasingly underweight of the stock because of persistent US buying had taken the opportunity of a dip in the price to pick up stock. Shell Transport rose 4 to 724p ahead of third-quarter figures due tomorrow. Pittencrieff, the oil and gas group, climbed 18 to 454p as the company announced it had agreed to acquire an additional 24.8 per cent working interest in the Patricia gas field in Alberta, Canada, and adjoining assets for CDollars 6.75m. The share price of FII, the diversified manufacturer, plunged 61 to 280p after the company warned that forthcoming profits would be significantly lower. A profits warning also hit International Foods. The shares fell 19 to 35p after the company said a downturn in European and UK business and delays in some big contracts meant that profits for this year would be 'substantially below market estimates'.

Earnings in the latest quarter were distorted by an extraordinary gain and the cumulative effect of accounting changes which brought the company's net income to Dollars 22.4m, or Dollars 1.22. In the same period of 1991, Cummins suffered a net loss of Dollars 17.2m, or Dollars 1.29. Sales in the three months rose 8 per cent to Dollars 948.1m from Dollars 877.6m. Sales were boosted by strong demand for both its heavy-duty and mid-range engines. Cummins expects North American heavy duty truck engine sales of about 120,000 units for the year, if the economy does not deteriorate. Cummins controls about 38 per cent of that market. For the first half of 1992, Cummins had net income of Dollars 31m, or Dollars 1.70 on sales of Dollars 1.83bn. A year earlier, the company had suffered a net deficit of 27 cents a share on sales of Dollars 1.69bn.  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

When the allegations first surfaced late last year Mr Najib Tun Razak, Malaysian defence minister, described them as 'baseless'. But officials in Malaysia privately admit that a 1988 memorandum of understanding on defence signed between the two countries was a catalyst for better relations. In the early 1980s Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, piqued at what he perceived to be British high-handedness on issues ranging from trade matters to higher fees for Malaysian students studying in Britain, instituted a 'Buy British Last' policy. But that has changed. In recent years British companies have won a substantial share of business in Malaysia's fast growing economy. Not only have British companies made an estimated Pounds 1.3bn of defence sales to Malaysia under the memorandum: British officials calculate civil projects have been worth substantially more than that amount for British companies. When Mr Major visited Kuala Lumpur last September he announced that British companies were negotiating contracts in Malaysia worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds 675m), which would secure 25,000 jobs in Britain. The controversy centres on a UK government decision two years ago to sign a Dollars 234m aid package for building a dam on the Pergau river, in the north of Malaysia. The decision was made against the advice of Britain's Overseas Development Administration (ODA). There have been repeated allegations in Britain that the aid package was directly linked to the defence memorandum - which could be illegal under the 1966 Overseas Aid Act. Earlier this week a ODA official told the House of Commons public accounts committee Mr Major had taken the final decision on the aid deal. Malaysian officials reject suggestions - first aired publicly in a report by the British auditor general last October - that the Pergau project is uneconomic and will result in Malaysian consumers having to pay more for electricity. Tenaga Nasional, partly privatised Malaysian electricity utility, has repeatedly said Pergau is a sound project and there has never no suggestion that, as a result of Pergau, electricity charges would rise. Mr Samy Vellu, minister of energy, said from Malaysia's point of view, the deal had been a good one. Last year's fall in the pound against the Malaysian dollar had made the project cheaper. He told Malaysian MPs it did not matter if others had lost - as long as Malaysia got the better deal. But Pergau has, from the beginning, been a controversial project, with Malaysian opposition MPs questioning the scale and cost of the project and its environmental impact. The 600MW plant and dam at Pergau will cost an estimated MDollars 1.8bn (Pounds 450m at current exchange rates). There have also been questions about the process whereby Balfour Beatty, the British civil engineering company, was awarded the bulk of the work at Pergau. (Balfour Beatty is also a member of an Anglo-Japanese consortium involved in work on a MDollars 8bn international airport being built outside Kuala Lumpur.) Work on Pergau is believed to be 60 per cent complete. UK political row, Page 8   Companies:-  Tenaga Nasional.     Balfour Beatty.   Countries:-  MYZ  Malaysia, Asia.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The move appears to confirm top management focus on the tobacco operations. It comes just weeks after the tobacco, food and brewing group started a price war in the US cigarette market in an effort to bolster market share of its hitherto very profitable brands. Mr Bible will report to Mr William Murray, Philip Morris' chief operating officer. Reporting directly to Mr Bible will be Mr William Campbell, chief executive of Philip Morris's domestic tobacco operations, and the officers who head the international tobacco businesses. Mr Bible, although a long-time employee of PM's tobacco operations, was given the position of executive vice-president international two years ago, when Philip Morris announced senior management changes relating to the retirement of its then chairman, Mr Hamish Maxwell. This post required him to oversee both the international food and the international tobacco operations, and his appointment was interpreted as signal that Philip Morris was focusing on international expansion.

The North Carolina company says the plant will have an eventual production capacity of 10bn cigarettes a year. The 135,000 sq ft plant will be sited in the Izmir region. The company said that it had earmarked more than Dollars 100m for investment in Turkey over the next decade. Turkey is a big market for cigarettes, and consumption is estimated at 80bn a year. However, it is still dominated by Tekel, the state-owned monopoly. The market was only opened to foreign cigarettes in the mid-1980s, but western products have taken an increasing market share. Philip Morris, RJR's big US competitor and manufacturer of Marlboro, has been successful. RJR, however, said that it saw opportunities for its three brands - Camel, Winston, and Salem. It expects to employ 300 people initially at the factory, but said employment could eventually total about 800. Mr Dale Sisel, head of RJ Reynolds Tobacco International, said: 'It's a large market, with significant demand for American-blend cigarettes, and there's plenty of opportunity for us to become a major participant.'

BAT's shares, too, have spluttered after the FDA attacked high-nicotine tobacco. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the latest row, the trend towards tighter regulation is unmistakable. BAT describes the FDA as an 'agency with an agenda' aiming 'to acquire jurisdiction over tobacco so that it can regulate it out of existence'. That makes its Dollars 1bn acquisition of American Tobacco appear all the more heroic - or foolhardy. BAT's shares have underperformed the market by 8 per cent since it moved to increase its exposure to US tobacco, although other unsettling factors have been at work. BAT has been hit by the dollar's weakness and it has only recently become apparent how badly Farmers was knocked by the Californian earthquake. Yet if BAT's tobacco worries are confined to the US, its rating looks decidedly mean. Its tobacco interests are valued on an earnings multiple of around five when insurance is given a market rating. That may only reinforce the logic of hiving off tobacco, even though Philip Morris has just baulked at the idea. After all, cigarette sales in the developing world should more than offset shrinking US demand.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The stiff tobacco tax increase, which could raise an estimated Dollars 16bn a year, passed the health panel of the House of Representatives Ways and Means committee by a 6-5 vote, but could fall by the wayside as healthcare legislation goes through Congress. Mr Clinton had originally considered a steep increase in the tobacco tax, partly to raise revenue to pay for aspects of his reform plan and partly to act as a severe disincentive to smoking, but backed down to 75 cents to placate congressmen from tobacco-producing states in the south-east. Mr Clinton's efforts to push healthcare reform have appeared to lose momentum in recent weeks, but a legislative package is still being painstakingly crafted in Congress. One draft now being circulated by the House energy and commerce committee, under the chairmanship of Mr John Dingell of Michigan, would eliminate the requirement that all but the largest companies be required to buy health insurance for their employees through government-run 'health alliances'.

0,FT932-216 ,"FT932-216 _AN-DGABBABGFT 930630   FT  30 JUN 93 / Gloomy US figures send shares down      By MICHAEL PROWSE      WASHINGTON   A SERIES of gloomy economic statistics raised further questions yesterday about the momentum of the US recovery and prompted a decline in share prices, with the Dow Jones closing 11.35 points down at 3,518.85. The biggest surprise was a 21 per cent drop in new home sales between April and May, the largest monthly decline in more than a decade. Sales fell in all regions except the west. A slowdown was expected after an erratic 21.5 per cent rise between March and April, but analysts had not expected the previous gain to be wiped out. Sales in the first five months of this year are barely ahead of the same period last year. Most forecasters had expected a big gain following falls in mortgage rates to the lowest level in 20 years. Separate figures for the consumer confidence index showed a three-point decline this month to 58.9, the lowest since last October and sharply down from a recent high of 76.7 in January. In a strong recovery, the index would be expected to rise above 100. The Conference Board, the New York-based business analysis group that compiles the index, predicted the economy would remain weak. Its latest survey of 5,000 households indicated consumers were less positive both about prevailing economic conditions and in their expectations for the next six months. Buying plans had been scaled down. Some analysts believe the weakness of confidence is a reflection of uncertainty caused by the bickering in Washington over President Bill Clinton's deficit-cutting economic plan. Sales of many items, such as cars, have held up better than consumer confidence figures might suggest. In a third sign of weakness, the Commerce Department yesterday reported a 0.3 per cent decline in the official index of leading economic indicators in May, the third decline in five months. The leading index is intended to predict economic conditions six to nine months ahead but most analysts see it as a measure of the current economic state. Yesterday's reports, which follow news last week of the third consecutive monthly decline in new orders for durable goods, are certain to raise fresh doubts about the economic outlook. Merrill Lynch, the New York broker, yesterday revised down its forecast for second-quarter growth in GDP to an annual rate of 1.5-2 per cent. The economy grew at an annual rate of only 0.7 per cent in the first quarter. The consensus view on Wall Street is that the economy will regain strength in the second half and growth is forecast at an annual rate of close to 3 per cent. This assumes that low US interest rates will gradually encourage higher spending by both consumers and companies, and that enactment of the Clinton economic plan next month will end a damaging period of uncertainty about tax policy.

Sales rose 16 per cent to R1.92bn from R1.65bn, an improvement due largely to the successful launch of new credit lines to consumers. Trading profit rose 15 per cent to R235.6m from R204.2m, while financing costs dropped slightly to R27.5m from R28.2m. All the group's divisions performed well, with flagship Edgars contributing the bulk of sales. These improved 15 per cent, to R1.27bn from the R1.1bn reported last year. Jet, which is targeted at the lower end of the market, had a very good half, raising sales by 30 per cent to R236.3m from R181.4m. Sales House, the group's other leading division, raised sales 12 per cent to R385.3m from R342.5m. The group attributed the good results to the improved economic climate after the elections in April, and predicted that sales and profits for the full year would be broadly in line with the interim results.

By JILL LAWRENCE, ASSOCIATED PRESS      WASHINGTON      It's increasingly fashionable to knock the tobacco industry, but the salvos  from public officials and consumers have yet to seriously threaten its  political health.    Both sides in the battle over cigarette smoking agree the tobacco lobby is  losing few fights on Capitol Hill and winning significant victories at the  state level.    ""I wouldn't feel sorry for them yet,"" said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.),  chairman of a House health subcommittee. ""They still have a formidable amount  of power in the Congress and influence around this country. They still have  economic clout.""    One of the most powerful industry trade groups is the Tobacco Institute,  representing the nation's cigarette makers. The institute has nine field  offices with three employees each, plus lobbyists in all the state capitals and  some key cities. Its political action committee raises about $200,000 for  federal candidates during each two-year election cycle, and it has Political  Action Committees in many states.    On the other side are anti-smoking groups, growing in both size and  sophistication, making their case with lots of passion and not much money.    The two major national groups are the grass-roots Americans for Nonsmokers'  Rights and the Coalition on Smoking OR Health, which represents the American  heart, lung and cancer associations and other voluntary health groups.    Reinforcing their efforts is Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.  Sullivan, who does not miss a chance to slam the tobacco industry.    He has attacked campaigns to market new cigarette brands to inner-city blacks  and undereducated young women, and reported that smoking costs the country $52  billion a year in bad health and lost productivity. He's also asked advertising  agencies to reject tobacco accounts, TV stations to warn viewers against  smoking and athletic associations to reject ""blood money"" from tobacco  companies seeking to sponsor sporting events.    And that's just this year.    The tobacco lobby lost a big one when Congress passed the smoking ban that took  effect last month on nearly all domestic airline flights. Its only comparable  defeat came in 1983, when the federal excise tax on cigarettes was doubled to  16 cents.    After the airline ban took effect, some congressmen said they would turn their  attention to railroads. Last week, Amtrak announced that it would eliminate  smoking on some trains and in some stations effective April 1.    While keeping damages to a minimum in Congress, the industry often has  prevailed on the state level. Its latest project is to win statewide preemption  laws that impose some smoking restrictions but bar cities or counties from  passing anything more severe.    Such laws are a pivotal industry strategy as more and more localities enact  smoking ordinances. One of the strictest took effect this year in Greensboro,  N.C., a key tobacco state.    ""When you have 95,000 local units of government in this country and you have a  finite amount of resources, then the smart thing to do is to try to limit the  potential for mischief,"" said Walker Merryman, a spokesman for the Tobacco  Institute.    Mark Pertschuk, director of the Berkeley-based Americans for Nonsmokers'  Rights, said his group is getting its best results at the local level. That's  where 90% of anti-smoking activity occurs, from protecting nonsmokers to  banning vending machines and free samples, Pertschuk said.    Preemption laws are thus ""an extraordinary victory"" for the tobacco industry,  he said.    A preemption law recently passed in Virginia placing limitations on public  smoking. What worries Pertschuk more is tobacco interests winning in states  where their crop never has been king, such as Pennsylvania, Florida and  Illinois.    But if some state capitals still are in the grip of the tobacco lobby,  Pertschuk and others believe the industry's hold on Capitol Hill is weakening.    As evidence, they point to the airline smoking ban and a barrage of  anti-tobacco proposals pending or soon to be introduced.    Some of the plans would ban advertising, one would limit ads to text only, and  another would give states the power to limit cigarette billboards.    Others would raise the cigarette excise tax, eliminate tax breaks for business  expenses associated with cigarette advertising, tighten federal regulation of  toxic cigarette ingredients and create a public health agency for tobacco  research and education.    Proponents say they have momentum from the flight ban victory and expect to  achieve at least some of their agenda this year.

He has attacked campaigns to market new cigarette brands to inner-city blacks  and undereducated young women, and reported that smoking costs the country $52  billion a year in bad health and lost productivity. He's also asked advertising  agencies to reject tobacco accounts, TV stations to warn viewers against  smoking and athletic associations to reject ""blood money"" from tobacco  companies seeking to sponsor sporting events.    And that's just this year.    The tobacco lobby lost a big one when Congress passed the smoking ban that took  effect last month on nearly all domestic airline flights. Its only comparable  defeat came in 1983, when the federal excise tax on cigarettes was doubled to  16 cents.    After the airline ban took effect, some congressmen said they would turn their  attention to railroads. Last week, Amtrak announced that it would eliminate  smoking on some trains and in some stations effective April 1.    While keeping damages to a minimum in Congress, the industry often has  prevailed on the state level. Its latest project is to win statewide preemption  laws that impose some smoking restrictions but bar cities or counties from  passing anything more severe.    Such laws are a pivotal industry strategy as more and more localities enact  smoking ordinances. One of the strictest took effect this year in Greensboro,  N.C., a key tobacco state.    ""When you have 95,000 local units of government in this country and you have a  finite amount of resources, then the smart thing to do is to try to limit the  potential for mischief,"" said Walker Merryman, a spokesman for the Tobacco  Institute.    Mark Pertschuk, director of the Berkeley-based Americans for Nonsmokers'  Rights, said his group is getting its best results at the local level. That's  where 90% of anti-smoking activity occurs, from protecting nonsmokers to  banning vending machines and free samples, Pertschuk said.    Preemption laws are thus ""an extraordinary victory"" for the tobacco industry,  he said.    A preemption law recently passed in Virginia placing limitations on public  smoking. What worries Pertschuk more is tobacco interests winning in states  where their crop never has been king, such as Pennsylvania, Florida and  Illinois.    But if some state capitals still are in the grip of the tobacco lobby,  Pertschuk and others believe the industry's hold on Capitol Hill is weakening.    As evidence, they point to the airline smoking ban and a barrage of  anti-tobacco proposals pending or soon to be introduced.    Some of the plans would ban advertising, one would limit ads to text only, and  another would give states the power to limit cigarette billboards.    Others would raise the cigarette excise tax, eliminate tax breaks for business  expenses associated with cigarette advertising, tighten federal regulation of  toxic cigarette ingredients and create a public health agency for tobacco  research and education.    Proponents say they have momentum from the flight ban victory and expect to  achieve at least some of their agenda this year.

The finding, which raises new questions about the Christmas shopping season,  came on a day of mostly downbeat economic news. A large majority of business  economists said the U.S. economy has entered a recession, and new reports said  sales of existing homes fell in October and that the U.S. trade deficit widened  in the third quarter.    ""All these things combined point in the same direction -- that we're getting  deeper and deeper into an economic recession,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief  economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. ""Now, we're really talking about how  long and deep the recession is going to be.""    The notable exception to the dreary list was a sharp rise in auto sales during  November, U.S. car makers reported.    ""Despite the drop in consumer confidence, there's still evidence that consumers  are spending,"" said David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington,  Mass.    Indeed, how comfortable Americans feel parting with their money in the coming  months will help determine the severity of the downturn, because consumer  spending accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.    By one recent gauge, consumers may pull back. Public confidence in the economy  slipped a bit further in November, following sharp plunges since the Persian  Gulf crisis began in August, according to a survey by the Conference Board, a  business research organization in New York.    The board's index of consumer confidence now stands at 61.5, sharply down from  the year-ago level of 115.1.    ""It is likely that the Persian Gulf crisis and pending tax increases have  contributed to the precipitous decline in consumer spirits,"" said Fabian  Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center. Concerns  about unemployment and the shaky financial system also have eroded public  optimism about the economy, analysts said.    The flagging spirits spark worries about this year's Christmas shopping season,  a crucial period for many retailers. Wyss predicted that the season would be  essentially flat or ""pretty bad but not terrible"" for retailers. ""Americans  have to be awfully scared to put their plastic away,"" he maintained.    To the surprise of some, Americans have continued to spend for cars, albeit at  a slower pace than last year.    On Tuesday, U.S. auto makers said mid-November sales of cars made in North  America were 18% higher than last year, with gains for the Big Three -- General  Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- of 16.2%. Car sales are down for the year,  however, by 3.3% for all U.S. auto makers and 8.3% for the Big Three.    While signals from the auto industry have been mixed, the message from the  housing market has been clear: Times are tough. Sales of existing homes dropped  4.7% in October, falling to the lowest level in nearly six years, the National  Assn. of Realtors reported.    The median price of an existing house declined 1.7% to $92,800 in a reflection  of the fragile market. (In the western United States, the median price was  $140,600, up 4.4% from September. Sales in the West were down 5.8%. In  California, the home resale market gained 2.2% in October, the California Assn.  of Realtors reported Monday.)    ""Consumer confidence is a major concern. It's affecting housing, it's affecting  autos, it's affecting retail sales,"" said John Tuccillo, chief economist at the  realtors association in Washington.    The varied signs of economic frailty have finally persuaded an erstwhile  optimistic group, the National Assn. of Business Economists, that a recession  has begun. In a survey released Tuesday, three out of four business economists  said the United States slipped into a recession sometime between July and  November. Two-thirds expect the slump, triggered by soaring oil prices, to last  up to six months.

He has been replaced by two men from the tobacco side of the business: Mr William Murray, who becomes chairman, and Mr Geoffrey Bible, who becomes president and chief executive. The changes take immediate effect. Mr Miles was chairman and chief executive of Kraft, the US food company, when Philip Morris acquired it in 1988, and became chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris in 1991. One of the most difficult periods of his tenure came in April 1993 when Philip Morris cut the price of its best-selling Marlboro cigarettes and other premier brands to regain market share from low-cost competition, sending earnings and the share price into a tailspin. Announcing his decision to go, Mr Miles said he left 'with full confidence that the difficult decisions made over the past two years will be proven right by our results in 1994 and beyond'. However, he said, the recovery of Philip Morris's US tobacco business and the continued growth in international tobacco meant it made sense for an executive from the tobacco side to take charge.

French-owned Carrefour said on Tuesday it would paid the local subsidiary of British American Tobacco Dollars 20m for a 91,000 square metre site in metropolitan Buenos Aires. Carrefour is Argentina's leading retailer and already owns seven hypermarkets there. It is building an eighth in Cordoba. It is expected that a new Buenos Aires hypermarket will be ready next year. Wal-Mart of the US was yesterday reported to have paid Argentina's Bunge y Born industrial and food group Dollars 18m for a prime site in Buenos Aires. El Cronista Comercial, a business newspaper, said that Wal-Mart took an option on the site, currently occupied by a textile factory, that will expire by mid-year. Yesterday Mr Eduardo Elzstain, president of Buenos Aires-based property developer IRSA, said a court had rejected legal objections to his company's development of a hypermarket in the city centre. Mr Elzstain said he hoped the Dollars 30m Abasto shopping centre project, which IRSA took over from the failed El Hogar Obrero co-operative chain, would open in 1996.

The figure accounted for 47 percent of the sales target of  87  billion yuan ($10 billion) set for the year. The bonds went on  sale this month.    Nevertheless, State Council Secretary General Luo Gan urged  financial officials to push the sales drive harder to meet this  year's target well ahead of schedule.    Luo Gan, who is also a State Councillor, stated in a  tele-conference that fulfilling this year's target is of vital  importance to the country's economic development.

0,FT931-5115 ,"FT931-5115 _AN-DCHCJABRFT 930308   FT  08 MAR 93 / Management: An active 'no' to passive smoking - Health Check      By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON   IN THE home, in hotels and in aircraft, busy executives are exposed to it: a human carcinogen so powerful it is classified along with such notorious substances as arsenic, asbestos and benzene. After several decades of intensive research the evidence is that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), or passive smoking as it is known, is a potential killer. Studies show it causes heart disease, lung cancer and chronic respiratory illnesses. In the US alone, 53,000 deaths are attributed to passive smoking every year, making it the third highest cause of lifestyle-related deaths, after active smoking and alcohol disease. Most of the research on passive smoking since 1984 has demonst-rated the causal relationship with fatal diseases - not least the review in 1986 by the US Surgeon General and the National Academy of Sciences. Critics (including those from the scientific community) often cited investigator and other bias in attempts to discredit that work, but they have since been confronted by more meticulous findings. In 1991, an article published by the American Heart Association presented data which revealed passive smoking lowers exercise capacity in both healthy and coronary patients, a hallmark of impaired coronary circulation. Among other immediate effects of passive smoking is the increased clumpiness or stickiness, of clot-forming cells (platelets) in the blood. This plays an important role in plaque and clot formation in coronary circulation. Passive smoking also causes an oxygen supply/demand imbalance by increasing heart rate and blood pressure and interfering with oxygen uptake by the red cells, thereby reducing supply. One researcher exposed healthy young women to pure air contaminated with tobacco smoke while the subjects exercised on a treadmill. The results in heart rate, blood pressure, exhaustion, perceived exertion and oxygen uptake were similar to patients with heart disease. Of the 4,000 or more substances identified as carcinogenic, atherogenic (plaque forming), antigenic (allergy-forming) and mutagenic in tobacco smoke, all those implicated in causing heart disease and lung cancer in active smokers were found in ETS as well. In an earlier Danish study of pregnant women - a study of the ultimate passive smoker, the foetus - marked degenerative changes were noted in the umbilical arteries of newborns of smoking women. The weight of the 'smoking newborn' was, on average, nearly 500g less than their non-smoking counterparts. Children are better off with non-smoking parents: toddlers under the age of one have significantly more bronchitis and other respiratory illness when one or both parents smoke. As the child grows, exposure to passive smoking in the home will lower lung capacity, predisposing the child to lung illnesses later in life. At the office, ETS levels are higher than in the home, due to the higher density of smokers. Employers are getting the message and are justifiably concerned with maintaining productivity and containing health care costs and absenteeism. Insurance industry studies indicate smokers are more likely to have higher health costs and more sick days than non-smokers. A careful analysis of health claims and absentee data of passive smokers is the critical next step. The link between ETS and lung cancer was claimed in research from the Harvard School of Public Health published last autumn in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Those involved used clever innovations to overcome investigator bias: autopsy lung specimens of several hundred non-smokers aged over 35 who had died of non-cancerous and non-respiratory causes (heart attack was the most common cause of death) and independent interviews with survivors regarding occupational and smoking status. The researchers concluded that pathologic (possibly pre-cancerous) changes were higher in non-smoking women, married to a smoker. Possibly the most incriminating link in the connection between ETS and disease came via the tobacco industry. In a survey, published by the American Journal of Public Health, of researchers who had received funds from the tobacco industry's Council for Tobacco Research, 99 per cent of respondents agreed smoking was addictive and 94 per cent believed passive smoking was dangerous to health.

Official figures issued yesterday showed that retail sales volumes rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent in February compared with January. The rise was slightly higher than expected and took the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.4 per cent. There was also an encouraging upward revision to January's sales. They rose by 2.2 per cent month-on-month compared with a provisional 1.6 per cent increase. Since July last year retail sales volumes have risen in every month except December. The Central Statistical Office said sales hit an all-time high in the three months to the end of February. The improvement in the past three months has not been spread evenly across the retail sector. While food retailers' sales rose by 3.3 per cent compared with the same period a year ago, non-food retailers' sales fell by 1.1 per cent. This was mainly due to a sharp fall in the 'other non-food' category of retail sales, which includes confectioners, newsagents, off-licences, booksellers, and toy and sports shops. Sales volumes fell by 6 per cent compared with the three months to February last year. Sales of clothing and footwear - which were particularly strong in February  -and household goods rose 1 per cent and 2 per cent respectively over the same period.

Environmental Evaluation         It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is needed.         Executive Order 12372         This activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).         Executive Order 12778         This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this proposed rule are not retroactive and preempt State laws to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this proposed rule. Before any legal action is brought regarding determinations made under the provisions of 7 CFR part 723, the administrative appeal provisions set forth at 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted.         Paperwork Reduction Act         This proposed rule would impose new record keeping and information collection requirements on domestic manufacturers of cigarettes and related tobacco industry business beginning January 1, 1994. The contents of and justification for the reporting and record keeping requirements will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget, under OMB No. 05600058, for review and approval in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended. Comments regarding these requirements in this proposed rule and suggested alternatives may be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC 20503; and to the Department of Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, room 404W, Washington, DC 20250.         Summary of Statutory Provisions         Section 320B of the 1938 Act imposes certain requirements on ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes'' and those manufacturers are defined in section 301 of the 1938 Act to be those that produce and sell at least one percent of the cigarettes produced and sold in the United States. Section 320B requires that those manufacturers specify each year, in advance, their expected purchases of burley and flue-cured tobacco. The sanction for failing to do so accurately, within certain limits, is that the manufacturer must pay an additional assessment to offset the cost of the Federal tobacco program.     Section 320C provides for additional requirements that must be met by ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes'' to avoid additional assessments. The provisions of section 320C are set out in greater detail below in the description of the content and organization of the proposed rule. Generally, under section 320C manufacturers who are ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes'' must certify each year the percentage of U.S. tobacco used in their cigarettes. If more than 25 percent is imported tobacco, the manufacturer must pay an assessment. Also, if this limit is exceeded, the manufacturer must make compensatory purchases of tobacco from the burley and flue-cured producer loan associations and may be required to pay a penalty for failing to make such compensatory purchases in a timely manner. Under section 320C(f), the 75/25 ratio may be reduced if the Secretary determines that U.S. tobacco supply conditions warrant a reduction due to conditions beyond the control of producers. Also, section 320C requires that manufacturers file reports and maintain records as specified by the Secretary to enforce that section. Failure to file required reports or maintain records, or the submission of false information can lead to criminal penalties as well as other sanctions. Other new provisions concerning assessments on imported tobacco enacted in the 1993 Act will be implemented in a separate rule.         Coverage of the Proposed Rule; Definition of Tobacco         The 75/25 ratio is referred to in the rule as the ``domestic content requirement.'' Since this requirement is a calendar year requirement under section 320C, the proposed rule would apply the requirement first in 1994. The authorizing statute was enacted well into 1993. There is nothing in the Act to provide for making the provisions retroactive.     The requirement applies only to ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes.'' The statute does not limit, as such, the content requirement to cigarettes produced by those manufacturers in the United States. The fact that section 320C applies the requirement only to certain ``domestic'' manufacturers, and given other provisions of section 320C, the proposed rule limits the coverage to cigarettes produced by subject manufacturers in the United States. For that purpose, the rule defines ``United States,'' consistent with section 301 of the 1938 Act, to be the fifty States, the territories of the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. With respect to limiting coverage to domestic production, section 320C(b) provides that the sanctions in 320C(c), (d), and (e) will apply when the use of ``imported tobacco'' exceeds 25 percent. Tobacco becomes ``imported'' only by reference to a domestic market. Hence, it appears clear that the statute was intended to cover only domestic production of cigarettes.              "

The figures suffered from the weakness of the US dollar and strength of the Swiss franc. In local currencies, growth was described by the company as 'solid' at 8 per cent. The turnover was at the low end of expectations, although Sandoz registered shares increased SFr11 to SFr659. No profits figures were disclosed. First-half trading figures will be released at the end of August. Sales at the pharmaceuticals division fell 1 per cent to SFr3.59bn.

Some consumers have not fully understood the  implementation of tax reforms, and fear the new tax system will  further add to inflation.    Sales in major shopping malls in Beijing and Wuhan have been  rising with consumers' favourite commodities including grain,  oil, electric appliances and gold. Sales of television sets,  video cassette recorders, refrigerators and washing machines  went up by 100 to 200 percent.    However, the demand for less than nine percent of the  commodities outstripped supply, and it is not difficult to  stabilise the market. Consumers also only look for a small range  of commodities and the impact of price fluctuations on the  market has not proved particularly serious.    But market fluctuations show that consumers are still  expecting inflation will continue in the near future. They want  to buy goods because they believe that devaluation of money is  faster than that of commodities. They fear the introduction of  tax reforms and further liberalisation of price controls this  year will lead to a surge in prices.    Although consumers are flocking to stores, they are not  buying whatever commodities can be found on the market. They  are proving to be selective, and only want to buy goods with  brand names and of good quality. This might put additional  pressure on inflation as demand for imported products will go up.     "

Cost-cutting measures in France, Italy, Spain and the UK led to a 1 per cent drop in pharmaceuticals sales during January and February compared with the same period in 1993. Sales in the top seven European markets reached Dollars 6.88bn. Meanwhile the North American pharmacy market, which grew only 5 per cent during 1993, appears to be recovering. It posted sales growth of 7 per cent during the first two months to Dollars 8.063bn, according to IMS International, the London-based market research company. US sales were up 7 per cent at Dollars 7.49bn. The Japanese market, excluding hospital sales, dropped 6 per cent during the first two months to Dollars 2.873bn. The market will fall still further this year following an average 6.6 per cent price cut implemented at the beginning of this month. The top ten pharmaceuticals markets in the world registered growth of only 1 per cent to Dollars 17.8bn during the first two months in spite of relatively healthy growth in the US. The collapse of the German market, Europe's largest, appears to be at an end, but sales have not yet recovered to pre-reform levels. Sales in Germany dropped 13 per cent during the first quarter last year. During the first two months this year they rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.95bn. The French market, Europe's second largest and until now one of the most robust, registered its first fall during the present wave of healthcare reform. Sales in January and February dropped 4 per cent from last year to Dollars 1.867bn. The decline followed the introduction of cost-cutting measures at the beginning of the year. Sales in Italy continued to suffer from reforms introduced last year. The market dropped 16 per cent during the first two months to Dollars 1.17bn. The UK market, which expanded 11 per cent during 1993, increased only 8 per cent this year. Sales in Spain were up 3 per cent at Dollars 601m, in the Netherlands up 4 per cent at Dollars 244m, and in Belgium up 1 per cent at Dollars 239m.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   WORLD PHARMACY DRUG PURCHASES JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1994 (USDOLLARS M)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      North America     Japan*    Germany   France  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular           1,303          448        454      442 Alimentary/Metabolism    1,271          539        346      324 Cen Nervous System       1,304          145        214      215 Respiratory                884          383        130      228 Anti-infectives            900          222        215      162 Musculo-Skeletal           360          273        105       81 Blood/Organs               499           60        117       89 Others                   1,542          803        373      326 Total                    8,063        2,873      1,954    1,867 % Change**                   7           -6          7       -4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                           Italy   UK   Spain   Netherlands   Belgium  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular             266   137    113         46         46 Alimentary/Metabolism      211   159     94         56         38 Cen Nervous System         105   111     68         30         38 Respiratory                175    62     88         15         29 Anti-infectives             80   121     72         33         25 Musculo-Skeletal            62    54     31         11         13 Blood/Organs                47    48     16         15         11 Others                     225   120    119         38         39 Total                    1,171   812    601        244        239 % Change**                 -16     8      3          4          1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IMS International  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-hospital market only **Increase excluding currencies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The financial pressures on Isuzu, which has made a loss for three years, recently forced it to announce it was withdrawing from car manufacturing to concentrate on vans and commercial vehicles. It has formed an alliance with Honda of Japan, which will supply it with cars, while Isuzu will supply Honda with recreational vehicles. Isuzu has also formed important alliances with other automotive companies covering for the joint supply of components. Isuzu's pre-tax loss last year was down from the Y54bn in 1991.

Addressing the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva today,  she described the gross human rights violations against innocent  and unarmed Kashmiris as reminiscent of the darkest days of the  Nazi Germany. She said the situation there is intolerable. The  people of held Kashmir are demanding just their freedom. They  cannot be suppressed indefinitely. She pointed out that despite  its repression, India has failed to impose its will on the  indomitable people of Jammu and Kashmir, and intensity of their  resistance has grown. The Kashmiri political leadership,  representing over (?30) parties and groups, has unanimously  declared not to contemplate any solution involving the  continuation of Indian rule.    The prime minister's address was warmly and repeatedly  applauded by the audience.    Referring to the recently held Pak-India talks, the prime  minister said Pakistan had hoped to meaningfully address all  aspects of the dispute. Pakistan stressed upon India to seek a  peaceful rather than a military solution to the Kashmir dispute,  and take visible steps to reduce repression. Instead the  repression increased. Over 40,000 Kashmiri men, women, and  children have been killed so far.    The prime minister demanded that the representatives of  Kashmiri people should be allowed to come and inform the  commission of the repression to which they are being subjected,  and the commission should investigate these violations of human  rights. Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto said: It is time for the world  community to prevail upon India to remove its additional forces  from held Kashmir, in order to put an end to its repression. It  is also time for the world community to force India to free the  imprisoned Kashmiri leaders, lift the Draconian emergency laws  and stop its army to commit all forms of atrocities in Kashmir,  and, finally, allow international human rights organizations,  humanitarian organizations, and media men to visit Kashmir to  ascertain the facts and provide help to the suffering Kashmiris.    She said the settlement of the Kashmir dispute based on the  wishes of the people is the key to peace and progress in South  Asia, reiterating that Pakistan is committed to seeking a  peaceful solution of the Kashmir dispute, as it would pave the  way to normalization of relations between Pakistan and India.  [sentence as heard]    The prime minister also urged the world community to help  preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and  demanded that the consequences of ethnic cleansing must be  reversed. She said the genocide in Bosnia has been continuing  for the past two years. The Security Council has failed to help  the victims of aggression. Humanitarian help has become an  excuse to avoid collective action against the aggressor. The  European Community approved high sounding principles but failed  to stop the aggressor. This state of affairs should end in order  to ensure peace, freedom, and justice for the Bosnian people.    The prime minister said Pakistan's aim is to provide a life  of dignity to its people by banishing poverty and illiteracy,  ensuring the rights of women and their full participation in  society, providing full protection to our children and  safeguarding the basic rights of minorities.    Later, addressing a news conference, the prime minister  urged  India to reduce its level of repression in occupied Kashmir.  This would be a visible signal from New Delhi that it is  sincere in holding talks over the Kashmiri dispute.    Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan cannot afford to  ignore  what is happening in held Kashmir, because it is our common  responsibility to ensure that the Kashmiris get the right of  self determination.

The policies involve projects of agricultural infrastructure  construction, fine-breed livestock production, forestry and  aquatic production, modern agricultural technology and  export-oriented agricultural production.    According [to] the policies, the investment and co-operation  can be in the form of funds, materials, industrial property  rights or special technology.    The policies stipulate that overseas businessmen engaged in  agricultural development and running enterprises in farming,  animal husbandry and aquatic production can be exempted from  land rent for 10 to 15 years.    Those who run joint ventures in forestry enterprises will be  exempted from land rent for 20 to 30 years.    The provincial government has also drawn up preferential  policies for export-oriented agricultural production, including  issuing export licences, and providing pesticides, fertilizer,  seeds and necessary services.

THE CALIFORNIA COST IS $5.8 BILLION.      By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Health care expenses and productivity losses associated with smoking-related  disease cost the nation more than $52 billion every year, according to a  government report released Tuesday.    The Department of Health and Human Services, in a national status report to  Congress, estimated that illnesses caused by smoking impose an average economic  burden of $1 billion per state, although some states run much higher tabs than  others.    California, the most populous state, has the highest estimated smoking cost,  $5.8 billion, the report said. Alaska was lowest, with $82 million annually.  Following California, in order, were New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois,  Ohio and Michigan.    The annual expenses of smoking-related disease average $221 for every man,  woman and child in the nation, ranging from a low of $56 a person in Utah to  $284 in Rhode Island, the report said.    Meanwhile, congressional sponsors of a law banning smoking on virtually all  domestic airline flights vowed Tuesday to fight for no-smoking rules on other  forms of transportation and to attack U.S. trade policies that encourage  tobacco exports.    Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N. J.) and Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said  that they would next press their campaign to apply to Amtrak train service and  other transportation.    The airline smoking ban, which begins Sunday, will apply to domestic flights of  six hours or less. Longer flights, charter flights and overseas flights are  exempt.    The law expands and extends a temporary smoking ban on short domestic flights  that was adopted in 1987.    The HHS report said that expenses related to smoking are borne indirectly by  all Americans in the form of higher private and public insurance premiums and  the increased burden on publicly supported health care facilities and  personnel.    ""Each and every American, including those who don't even smoke, is paying a  hidden tax . . . for the consequences of smoking,"" HHS Secretary Louis W.

And, just  because they file a claim, it doesn't mean it's a smoking claim.""    Further, she said, ""if people are less productive, that's not a cost to society  -- they bear the burden through lower pay, less frequent job promotions or  getting fired.""    The report said that smoking causes more premature deaths than cocaine, heroin,  alcohol, fire, automobile accidents, homicide and suicide combined.    Sullivan said that smoking kills nearly 400,000 Americans each year and is  responsible for more than one of every six deaths in the United States. In  addition, he said, smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated among  low-income, less-educated Americans.    ""I am especially concerned that we make more progress in reaching young people,  women, minorities and blue-collar workers with accurate and compelling  information about smoking and its devastating impact on their health,"" he said  in a statement.    Dr. Ronald M. Davis, director of the HHS Office on Smoking and Health, said  that deaths caused by smoking have increased during the last 20 years, despite  a dramatic decline in the number of smokers. In 1965, 40% of all U.S. adults  were cigarette smokers, compared to 29% in 1987, he said.    Nevertheless, ""it takes a good 20 to 25 years after the smoking rates go down  before we begin to see a decrease in smoking-related deaths and costs,"" he said  in an interview.

Within days of Pakistani prime minister, Ms.  Benazir Bhutto's vile charge at the Geneva meeting of the UN  Human Rights Commission that New Delhi was violating Kashmiri  human rights, the U.S. State Department has taken Pakistan to  task for its failure to protect the rights of non-Muslims who  have been subjected to frequent extrajudicial killings,  disappearance, and arbitrary arrests. The report has said that  religious zealots continue to discriminate against and persecute  non-Muslims basing their activities and part on discriminating  legislation against religious minorities. [sentence as heard]    Pakistani leaders have abused the international fora not  only  to internationalize the Kashmir issue, but also sought to  publicize lies and launched a hysterical tirade against India.  Both the union finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and the  former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah,  have done well to expose the real face of Islamabad at Geneva.  The State Department report is, by and large, in conformity  with similar reports of human rights violations catalogued by  the Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch and the  American Civil Liberties Union.    Members of Pakistan's Hindu, Christian, Ahmediyas, Sikh,  Bahai, and other minority communities were banned from  contesting general seats in the elections in 1985 and were  restricted to voting in a system of separate electorate for  minorities. Ahmediyas have also suffered widespread  discrimination, suppression, and violence since they were  declared non-Muslims in 1974. The U.S. State Department report  has referred to extrajudicial killings, often in the form of  staged police encounters, resulting in the death of suspects as  also death resulting from physical abuse of prisoners and  detainees by police. It says there continues to be persuasive  evidence of misuse of police powers. Corruption, including  extortion, is rampant. Police and jailers often use force to  coerce confession and to compel detainees and prisoners to  discriminate others. Although police in Pakistan are required  by law to obtain a warrant before entering a private home, this  legal requirement is complied more in breach than in compliance  and Pakistan is using the law of blasphemy against minority  groups such as the Christians. This law is a threat to freedom  of expression and belief and it continues to allow exploitation  and intimidation in the name of religion.    Another discriminatory law against minorities pertains to  separate electorates. It not only violates the international  convention on civil and political rights but also the joint  electorates concept under the 1973 constitution. The most  recent encroachment on religious freedom is a requirement that  religion be listed on the national identity cards. Such a  practice amounts to religious apartheid. Even though Pakistan  has acceded to the universal declaration of human rights, its  laws violate article 25 and 18 of this declaration. Pakistan  has moved away from its founding principle of religious freedom.  Laws such as the convention law clearly violate basic  principles of international human rights. Pakistan is also a  signatory to basic human rights conventions. But its laws stand  in direct contradiction to the principles found in these  treaties.    In a new 74 page report, the Amnesty International said last  December that torture, including rape, in the custody of police,  paramilitary, and armed forces is endemic in Pakistan. The  report further said that members of these forces have been  allowed to torture and kill with impunity. Victims and their  families feel great difficulties and danger, if they try to seek  redress.     "

The rate of increase in the importation of cars for the  first  five months of this year was 15 percent, far lower than the rate  of increase in sales in domestic market. This must have  resulted from the considerable old stock of last year carried  forward to this year.

The plan was presented yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Defining competitiveness as a matter of 'incremental excellence', Mr Heseltine pointed to the 'comprehensive deregulation' at the Department of Trade and Industry that was intended to provide 'the most competitive climate within which industry can operate'. The reorganisation involves civil servants taking direct responsibility for export promotion to specific markets, and an eventual total of 100 'export promoters' seconded from industry to link small and medium-size companies to specific markets. The forward plan identifies western Europe, North America, Japan and the Asia Pacific rim as top priority areas, along with environmental goods and services.

The group reported income for the quarter of Dollars 286m or Dollars 1.33 per share, little changed from Dollars 289m or Dollars 1.33, a year ago. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 3.5bn, compared with Dollars 3.4bn the year earlier. The company said that while sales volume increased by 8 per cent in the quarter, selling prices dipped 3 per cent, with the strong US dollar affecting overseas sales. Currency fluctuations reduced income by an estimated Dollars 22m, or 10 cents per share. Mr Giulio Agostini, 3M's chief financial officer, said the company's first quarter in the next fiscal year might also be flat, or fail to match last year. 3M's fourth-quarter performance and its cautious comments on earnings sent the company's shares down Dollars 4 1/8 to close at Dollars 106 7/8 on Wall Street yesterday. For the year, 3M's income was Dollars 1.26bn or Dollars 5.82, up from Dollars 1.23bn or Dollars 5.63 in 1992. Sales for the year were Dollars 14bn, up from Dollars 13.88bn last year. Mr Agostini said the company's cost-cutting measures were proceeding ahead of schedule. 3M expected to shed 5,000 jobs by the end of 1995.

The bill, proposed by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, is due to reach its report stage on May 13. The government, which opposes the bill, was surprised by the scale of support for the measure at second reading when MPs voted by 227 to 17 in favour of it. In an attempt to pre-empt the bill, it is still possible the government will announce before May 13 that it has reached agreement with tobacco manufacturers on stricter voluntary controls on advertising. MPs are being urged by newspaper and magazine publishers to 'reaffirm their support for the freedom of the press, the freedom of speech and the freedom of consumer choice by rejecting any attempts to outlaw advertising of products legally and freely available in the UK'. A statement circulated to MPs yesterday was signed by industry groups including the Newspaper Publishers Association, representing national newspapers; the Newspaper Society, which represents the regional and local press; and the Periodical Publishers Association, representing magazines. The Advertising Association, the umbrella group which has been co-ordinating opposition to the bill, calculates that the publishing industry stands to lose about Pounds 50m a year in advertising revenue if a ban goes ahead.

The second quarter would be tough, he added, but the second half of 1993 would be healthier. The company's performance would be affected by loan provisions made by Canada Trust, the financial services arm, which along with Imperial Tobacco were Imasco's biggest subsidiaries. The group is 40 per cent held by BAT Industries of the UK. Imasco's first-quarter profit was up 5 per cent, but CT's contribution was reduced by the provisions. 'CT is highly conservative in its provisions and has retained its top credit rating right through the recession,' Mr Crawford added. He said that the retailing side had been under pressure but should improve in the second half. In addition, the improvement at Hardee's, the US fast-food chain, was continuing. Imasco's share of the Canadian legal cigarette market was 67 per cent and it was resuming normal exports after complying with a federal request for restraint in 1992. Mr Crawford said that increased smuggling in tobacco products was due to high Canadian taxes. The restraint reduced Imasco's exports but failed to affect contraband traffic because smugglers found cigarettes from other sources.

Tobacco industry spokesmen, during a hearing of the Senate Revenue and Taxation  Committee, said it is a mistake for Gov. George Deukmejian to count on raising  $625 million because of a legal challenge to Proposition 99's required increase  in taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products.    The industry representatives also said the Proposition 99 tax rate of 41.67% on  the wholesale price of cigarettes is so high that the Administration's expected  windfall will never develop because smokers will smoke less and be encouraged  to buy their tobacco products from mail-order firms in states that do not have  the tax.    Supporters of Proposition 99 attacked the Administration for proposing to use  the new revenues to fund a variety of programs that are now financed from  general tax revenues. They argued that the governor's budget proposals violate  a provision of Proposition 99 prohibiting use of the money ""to supplant  existing levels of service.""    Deukmejian Administration officials insisted that their revenue projections as  well as their reading of Proposition 99 are appropriate.    Lonnie Mathis, chief of financial research for the Department of Finance, said  the Administration expects only a 2% reduction in smoking as a result of higher  prices. That expectation, he said, is based on a belief that people who smoke  today are ""hard-core smokers"" who do not plan to quit no matter what the price.    ""We don't think a penny a cigarette is going to have a real significant impact  on those people,"" he said.    Two committee members said they agree with critics that the Administration  budget proposals violate provisions of Proposition 99.    Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), the committee chairman, said he thinks  the Administration ""is asking the Legislature to do something that is  apparently illegal.""    Another committee member, Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), said he also  thinks the Administration is trying to misuse Proposition 99 funds and asked  for a formal legal opinion from the Legislature's chief lawyer. Preparation of  the opinion could take several weeks.      Health Services Plan    The dispute over whether Deukmejian is proposing to use Proposition 99 money to  finance continuing state programs centers chiefly on a new plan to finance  health services for poor Californians with $331.3 million in cigarette tax  money. Deukmejian is also proposing to trim $358 million from a health program  for the same patient group that is financed with general tax revenues.    Garamendi told John Ramey, deputy secretary of the Health and Welfare Agency,  that he thinks the Administration ""eliminated the old program and started a new  one and substituted the source of funds using the cigarette tax. I think that  is illegal.""    Ramey said, ""We don't believe that we are asking the Legislature to do  something that is illegal.""    Dr. James Nethery, a dentist and chairman of Coalition for a Healthy  California, sponsors of Proposition 99, accused the Administration of playing  ""a shell game.""    ""The wording of the initiative is very clear. The funds are not to be used to  replace existing programs, and there is no question in my mind that is exactly  what is happening in this case,"" Nethery said. He said that the coalition would  file a suit to block the spending proposal if the Legislature accepts the  governor's plan.    Opponents of Proposition 99, during their turn before the committee, said they  have already filed suit on the grounds that they believe the tax increase is  illegal because it was not approved by the Legislature.    David R. Doerr, a tax specialist for the California Taxpayers Assn., told  committee members not to count on seeing the money because it is possible that  the courts will rule in the tobacco industry's favor. Doerr said the California  Constitution prohibits voters from raising taxes in any way other than through  a constitutional amendment. Proposition 99 raised the tax by changing a statute  in the tax law.    Department of Finance officials estimate that most of the revenue from  Proposition 99, $595 million, will come from the tax increase on cigarettes and  that about $30 million will come from sales of cigars, pipe tobacco and other  tobacco products.    Norman Sharp, a spokesman for the Cigar Assn. of America and the Pipe Tobacco  Council, predicted that ""the $30 million will never materialize"" because  smokers will either quit or buy tobacco products by mail order.

0," LA042990-0108   211361    April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition      Business; Part D; Page 5; Column 1; Financial Desk      1887 words      MUTUAL FUNDS: REGIONAL FUNDS PUT EGGS IN FEWER BASKETS      By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national  consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine.      People around the country now can invest in a mutual fund that is placing its  bets almost exclusively on companies with a big stake in California.    The new Growth Fund of California soon will start buying shares in companies  that are either headquartered in the nation's most populous state or have  substantial operations here.    It's the latest wrinkle in regional stock funds, which invest mostly in  companies of a single state or group of states.    ""California as a region is economically equivalent to the sixth-largest country  in the world, behind France and ahead of Britain,"" said Dick Ollen, president  of Monarch Investment Services Co. of Springfield, Mass., which will manage the  fund. ""We think there are outstanding opportunities here.""    Sounds good, but how will such a fund perform? This one is untested, so no one  can predict. But the history of regional stock funds isn't encouraging. As a  group, they haven't fared especially well.    Critics complain of self-imposed limitations, usually spelled out in the  prospectus, that hamstring portfolio managers by reducing the number of stocks  they can purchase. ""They all impose some geographic restrictions that could  impair performance,"" said Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of the No-Load Fund  Investor newsletter in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. ""This is another case of funds  probably started for marketing reasons more than anything else.""    Proponents counter that the funds, when run well, have an inherent advantage in  that the portfolio manager can really get to know the companies in his or her  back yard. Certainly, this has been the case with Bing Carlin, who runs the IAI  Regional Fund out of Minneapolis.    IAI Regional concentrates on Minnesota, Wisconsin and five less-populous states  in the surrounding area. Carlin says he has about 300 stocks from which to  choose and knows top managers at many of these corporations as neighbors.    For example, Carlin says he served in the Naval Reserves during the 1960s with  Michael Sullivan, president and chief executive of International Dairy Queen,  and played Pee-Wee football with Michael W. Wright, chairman of Super Valu  Stores Inc. ""And I grew up having snowball fights on Humboldt Avenue in  southeast Minneapolis with Lloyd Johnson, now the head of Norwest Corp.,""  Carlin added.    In this respect, an astute regional portfolio manager often can be the first to  recognize promising stocks. ""We try to find companies before Wall Street finds  them,"" says Carlin, whose fund has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500  index since its debut in 1980.    Mark Byl, senior portfolio manager of the Seattle-based Composite Northwest  Select 50 Fund, agrees that regional portfolios have a research edge, even in  an era when information flows faster than ever. ""Telecommunication advances  allow you to follow other U.S. companies, and even international firms, as  easily as those in your back yard. However, we get insights others won't get  simply by picking up a phone and calling a company once a quarter.""    Byl doesn't consider the geographical limitation to be a problem -- even though  his fund emphasizes stocks in Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Montana and Idaho,  hardly a region with an excessive number of corporations. In Byl's view, having  a smaller ""universe"" of stocks forces a portfolio manager to diversify in other  ways, particularly by industry and type of company.    Of course, even a well-diversified regional fund can falter if the local  economy gets into serious trouble. Consider what happened to the Fund of the  Southwest, part of the Houston-based Capstone Group. For the 15 years ended  March 31, the portfolio showed a total return of 776%, according to Lipper  Analytical Services. But over the last five years of that period, it rose just  58%. Fund of the Southwest concentrates on companies based or doing a large  chunk of their business in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, New Mexico and  Arizona. When energy prices slumped in the mid-1980s, the fund did, too.    Another portfolio, USAA Mutual Sunbelt Era, last year changed its name to USAA  Mutual Aggressive Growth and abandoned its geographic orientation after posting  below-average returns for the previous six years. With roughly $140 million in  assets, it had been one of the largest regional stock funds.    In recent months, three funds that focus on companies in the Washington, D.C.,  area have lagged the market. This list includes the Growth Fund of Washington,  which is not open to California investors.    Costa Mesa is the headquarters of another struggling regional, the Orange  County Growth Fund. Newport Securities Corp. launched this portfolio in March,  1988, in hopes of capitalizing on what has become one of the more economically  diverse urban areas in the United States. ""Orange County's gross county product  amounts to $55 billion, and it's growing twice as fast as the national  average,"" says Jeffrey L. Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities and  portfolio manager of the fund.    Orange County Growth Fund invests at least 65% of its assets in companies  headquartered in the county. Kilpatrick says he can choose from among 300  corporations in more than 80 industries, ranging from Fluor Corp. (engineering)  to Community Psychiatric Centers (hospitals) to Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.  (fast-food).    Despite the geographic concentration of stocks, the fund's holdings aren't  especially vulnerable to a slowdown in the local economy, Kilpatrick says.  ""Very few of the companies do more than 5% of their business in Orange County.  It's not like we're buying a mom-and-pop doughnut shop that will only grow if  Orange County grows.""    At any rate, Orange County Growth Fund has had trouble getting its message  across. The portfolio counts just 175 or so shareholders and $1 million in  assets -- minuscule amounts for a mutual fund. In a bid to attract investors,  Newport Securities has suspended the fund's 5.75% up-front sales load and has  abolished its annual 12b-1 fee.    Kilpatrick argues that Orange County Growth's problems are shared by many  smaller mutual funds, not just those with a geographic focus. But as a group,  regional funds have had a hard time gaining the attention of investors.  Combined, these portfolios account for well under 1% of all equity-fund assets,  according to Lipper.    Apparently, investors prefer to spread their money around the country, rather  than park it in anybody's back yard.

Table, HOW MUTUAL FUNDS PERFORMED ; Table, A SAMPLER OF REGIONAL FUNDS      Column    "," LA042990-0108   211361    April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition      Business; Part D; Page 5; Column 1; Financial Desk      1887 words      MUTUAL FUNDS: REGIONAL FUNDS PUT EGGS IN FEWER BASKETS      By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national  consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine.      People around the country now can invest in a mutual fund that is placing its  bets almost exclusively on companies with a big stake in California.    The new Growth Fund of California soon will start buying shares in companies  that are either headquartered in the nation's most populous state or have  substantial operations here.    It's the latest wrinkle in regional stock funds, which invest mostly in  companies of a single state or group of states.    ""California as a region is economically equivalent to the sixth-largest country  in the world, behind France and ahead of Britain,"" said Dick Ollen, president  of Monarch Investment Services Co. of Springfield, Mass., which will manage the  fund. ""We think there are outstanding opportunities here.""    Sounds good, but how will such a fund perform? This one is untested, so no one  can predict. But the history of regional stock funds isn't encouraging. As a  group, they haven't fared especially well.    Critics complain of self-imposed limitations, usually spelled out in the  prospectus, that hamstring portfolio managers by reducing the number of stocks  they can purchase. ""They all impose some geographic restrictions that could  impair performance,"" said Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of the No-Load Fund  Investor newsletter in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. ""This is another case of funds  probably started for marketing reasons more than anything else.""    Proponents counter that the funds, when run well, have an inherent advantage in  that the portfolio manager can really get to know the companies in his or her  back yard. Certainly, this has been the case with Bing Carlin, who runs the IAI  Regional Fund out of Minneapolis.    IAI Regional concentrates on Minnesota, Wisconsin and five less-populous states  in the surrounding area. Carlin says he has about 300 stocks from which to  choose and knows top managers at many of these corporations as neighbors.    For example, Carlin says he served in the Naval Reserves during the 1960s with  Michael Sullivan, president and chief executive of International Dairy Queen,  and played Pee-Wee football with Michael W. Wright, chairman of Super Valu  Stores Inc. ""And I grew up having snowball fights on Humboldt Avenue in  southeast Minneapolis with Lloyd Johnson, now the head of Norwest Corp.,""  Carlin added.    In this respect, an astute regional portfolio manager often can be the first to  recognize promising stocks. ""We try to find companies before Wall Street finds  them,"" says Carlin, whose fund has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500  index since its debut in 1980.    Mark Byl, senior portfolio manager of the Seattle-based Composite Northwest  Select 50 Fund, agrees that regional portfolios have a research edge, even in  an era when information flows faster than ever. ""Telecommunication advances  allow you to follow other U.S. companies, and even international firms, as  easily as those in your back yard. However, we get insights others won't get  simply by picking up a phone and calling a company once a quarter.""    Byl doesn't consider the geographical limitation to be a problem -- even though  his fund emphasizes stocks in Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Montana and Idaho,  hardly a region with an excessive number of corporations. In Byl's view, having  a smaller ""universe"" of stocks forces a portfolio manager to diversify in other  ways, particularly by industry and type of company.    Of course, even a well-diversified regional fund can falter if the local  economy gets into serious trouble. Consider what happened to the Fund of the  Southwest, part of the Houston-based Capstone Group. For the 15 years ended  March 31, the portfolio showed a total return of 776%, according to Lipper  Analytical Services. But over the last five years of that period, it rose just  58%. Fund of the Southwest concentrates on companies based or doing a large  chunk of their business in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, New Mexico and  Arizona. When energy prices slumped in the mid-1980s, the fund did, too.    Another portfolio, USAA Mutual Sunbelt Era, last year changed its name to USAA  Mutual Aggressive Growth and abandoned its geographic orientation after posting  below-average returns for the previous six years. With roughly $140 million in  assets, it had been one of the largest regional stock funds.    In recent months, three funds that focus on companies in the Washington, D.C.,  area have lagged the market. This list includes the Growth Fund of Washington,  which is not open to California investors.    Costa Mesa is the headquarters of another struggling regional, the Orange  County Growth Fund. Newport Securities Corp. launched this portfolio in March,  1988, in hopes of capitalizing on what has become one of the more economically  diverse urban areas in the United States. ""Orange County's gross county product  amounts to $55 billion, and it's growing twice as fast as the national  average,"" says Jeffrey L. Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities and  portfolio manager of the fund.    Orange County Growth Fund invests at least 65% of its assets in companies  headquartered in the county. Kilpatrick says he can choose from among 300  corporations in more than 80 industries, ranging from Fluor Corp. (engineering)  to Community Psychiatric Centers (hospitals) to Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.  (fast-food).    Despite the geographic concentration of stocks, the fund's holdings aren't  especially vulnerable to a slowdown in the local economy, Kilpatrick says.  ""Very few of the companies do more than 5% of their business in Orange County.  It's not like we're buying a mom-and-pop doughnut shop that will only grow if  Orange County grows.""    At any rate, Orange County Growth Fund has had trouble getting its message  across. The portfolio counts just 175 or so shareholders and $1 million in  assets -- minuscule amounts for a mutual fund. In a bid to attract investors,  Newport Securities has suspended the fund's 5.75% up-front sales load and has  abolished its annual 12b-1 fee.    Kilpatrick argues that Orange County Growth's problems are shared by many  smaller mutual funds, not just those with a geographic focus. But as a group,  regional funds have had a hard time gaining the attention of investors.  Combined, these portfolios account for well under 1% of all equity-fund assets,  according to Lipper.    Apparently, investors prefer to spread their money around the country, rather  than park it in anybody's back yard.

Weak trends in industrial chemicals were more than offset by the continuing strength of pharmaceutical sales. Fourth-quarter sales of the pharmaceutical division, which accounts for nearly half of total group sales, were up a brisk 10 per cent to SFr1.9bn. Sales of Sandimmun, used to combat rejection of transplanted organs, were up 15 per cent, while those of Clozaril, a drug used for schizophrenia, soared 60 per cent. In the full year, pharmaceutical sales were up 7 per cent to SFr7.35bn. Chemical sales were flat in the fourth quarter at SFr585m, but up 2 per cent in the full year to SFr2.5bn. Sandoz said the performance was above the industry average due in part to increases in textile dyestuffs sales in the US, Brazil and parts of Asia. Agro-chemical sales dropped 7 per cent in the fourth quarter to SFr240m because of a delayed start to the 1993-1994 season, but were up 7 per cent in the full year to SFr1.3bn, thanks to new environmentally friendly herbicides and fungicides. Sales of the construction and environment division jumped 12 per cent to SFr1.2bn in the full year, with above average results in the US and the Far East.   Companies:-  Sandoz.

The deal illustrates the growing trend for partnerships between western power equipment suppliers and Japanese companies to exploit fast-expanding Asian demand for power generating capacity. The contract, for a project at Gandhar due to come on stream in 1995, also illustrates importance of local manufacturing content for western suppliers in competitive markets. ABB in Germany will be the main supplier, together with ABB India, of three GT 13E gas turbines and accompanying steam generator and associated equipment. Marubeni will supply waste recovery boilers. The project is funded by Overseas Export Co-operation Finance (OECF), the Japanese export credit agency.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Under a contract with the firm, a group  of Russian engineers in Uruguay is fitting these helicopters  with weapons; they are a civilian version of the mass-produced  combat helicopters. Afterwards, they will be resold to other  countries. The first helicopter has already been purchased by  Peru's Armed Forces.    The Ka-32 helicopters are being delivered from Russia by sea  to Uruguay's free economic zone, to the town of Florida, 90 km  north of the Uruguayan capital. Each helicopter costs no less  than 2.5 million dollars. The newspaper notes that these  helicopters are one of the most promising models in Russia,  which are noted for their high degree of maneuverability.  During the war in Afghanistan, these helicopters, fitted with  weapons, proved their combat effectiveness. In addition to  this, they have a spacious cargo compartment and equipment for  the transportation of suspended cargo. The Ka-32 helicopters can  be used to assemble equipment, lay power lines, and also to  carry out operations to rescue people and equipment during  natural disasters.    The Uruguayan newspaper notes that the intention in Peru is  to use the helicopter to fight the drug mafia. Contracts for  the sale of the military version of the Ka-32 helicopters have  already been concluded with a number of other Latin American  countries.     "

These were yet another set of the quangos in which British governments delight, since they provide high cosmetic value at low cost. The fact that they are usually ineffective doesn't matter, since this is easy to hide. Tecs should not be given public law status, but rather be merged with chambers of industry and commerce, which should. The government should then have a serious discussion with the chambers about standards. Finally, the British Overseas Trade Board could then be closed down and all its resources given to the chambers. We could have got all this right first time if Conservative ministers really had any idea about helping a market economy to work, but better late than never.

This was decided by Bonn by lifting  the halt to arms deliveries to Turkey. Germany sends weapons to  a state that systematically oppresses, drives away, and kills  the Kurds. This signals to the government in Ankara that the  destruction of the Kurdish people continues to be more or less  tolerated.    For this reason the question whether Turkish soldiers in the  southeast of the country fight with German armaments is  important, but not of a central nature. Now it becomes obvious  that Kinkel's order to examine evidence of the use of German  weapons was only a show to calm down critics. One can only call  it cynical how the Federal Government ignores statements by  eyewitnesses, misinterprets films, and adopts the excuses of the  Turkish Government in those instances where German armaments are  clearly visible in photographs.    However, the end of the halt to arms deliveries would be a  scandal even if Turkey were no longer to use any weapons from  Germany against the Kurds. The more armaments are streaming  into the country, the less the military needs to worry about its  stocks, the more unscrupulously can Ankara wage its war in the  southeast. In addition, the symbolic importance of the decision  made by Bonn is even more murderous than the continued use of  German weapons in practice: It confirms to the Turkish  Government its knowledge that, for Germany, good relations with  the geostrategically important NATO partner are more important  than the Kurdish people's right to existence.

The result, while much improved on the Dollars 189.5m, or Dollars 9.97 per share, loss in the last quarter of 1991, was affected by a Dollars 1.4m charge related to the acquisition of majority control of Berlitz by Fukutake, the Japanese publishing group. That deal, which gives Fukutake 67 per cent of Berlitz, was completed on February 8. In the last quarter of 1991, Berlitz suffered from a Dollars 195.4m charge related to write-offs and reserve caused by the bankruptcy of the Maxwell Communication Corporation. Sales in the last quarter of 1992 were Dollars 70.8m, up from Dollars 66.5m a year before. Sales for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 281.3m, against Dollars 259.8m in 1991. Berlitz said net profit for the whole of last year was Dollars 4m, against a loss of Dollars 172m in 1991. Translation sales for the fourth quarter of last year were 19.6 per cent higher at Dollars 7.9m. Publishing sales were Dollars 4.9m, up from Dollars 4.5m a year before. Instruction sales were 4.8 per cent better in the quarter at Dollars 58m. After the Fukutake share deal Berlitz has long-term indebtedness of Dollars 115m.

Sales for the month totalled Y191.9bn (Pounds 835m), with a reported 0.2 per cent increase from a year ago accounted for by the extra day in February this year. The figures provided further evidence that continued strong consumer spending may fail to underpin the otherwise weak Japanese economy, as many economists had hoped. Clothing sales were up modestly by 0.6 per cent, while household goods sales rose by 1.6 per cent. Foodstuffs sales were 7 per cent higher, while miscellaneous goods were off by 5.3 per cent. Sales of highly-priced items such as paintings were depressed. February steel production fell below 8m tonnes for the first time in four years, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said. Output fell by 11.7 per cent to 7.8m tonnes as weak demand forced companies to reduce inventories. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry also revised upward earlier estimates of inventories in January, which are now reported as 12.2 per cent higher than a year ago. Industrial production fell by 4 per cent compared with a year ago. The net operation rate of industrial facilities was 6 per cent lower.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

It is to deal  aggressively with rapidly increasing demand due to the  production shift by home electronics manufacturers and others,  and in addition to expanding the production volume of their  Singapore and Malaysian subsidiaries, they will also increase  exports from Japan. With the high yen in the background,  semiconductor costs are ballooning in the Southeast Asian  market, but it seems that domestic manufacturers are  intensifying a battle for market share, with the same area as  the stage, due to the largest manufacturer NEC working out  measures to strengthen sales.    Along with this sales plan, the company will boost monthly  production in Singapore for 4-megabyte DRAM [dynamic  random-access memory] (dynamic read and write memory necessary  for memory storage operations) and microcomputer ASIC  (application-specific integrated circuits) from 78 million in  the previous fiscal year to 80 million units.    Moreover, they also will expand monthly production for  transistors that are being produced in Malaysia from 2.52  billion in the previous fiscal year to 2.82 billion units in  fiscal year 1994. In either case, they anticipate use for  equipment for the general public produced by home electronics  manufacturers, etc., in Southeast Asia. However, they will  handle it by improving the yield rate at both plants, and the  policy is not to carry out new facilities investment.

Security Forces Director General  Mr. D.K. Arya, in a recent interview to a Bombay newspaper, said  there are at least 3,000 foreign mercenaries active in Kashmir  Valley. These mercenaries are mostly Afghans, Lebanese,  Sudanese, and Egyptians. They have been showing an increasing  presence in the valley and beyond in Doda and Kishtwar and most  of the areas westward. In a recent meeting, the Indian  ambassador to the United States, Mr. S.S. Ray, told the under  secretary of state, Mr. Peter Tarnoff that foreign mercenaries  promoted by external forces are deeply involved in Kashmir  crisis which is one of the important causes for persistence of  terrorist violence there. These terrorists are well entrenched  and possess the most modern system of fire arms, ammunition, and  wireless sets. They have equipment like the ones available with  the organized defense forces only. The number of Halogen [as  heard] 60-mm mortars, rocket launchers, rifles, grenades, sniper  rifles, AK-47 rifles, and ammunition have been siezed from them  in a series of raids conducted by the security forces in the  past few months.    The infiltration of mercenaries began about a year ago  mostly  through Pak-occupied Kashmir. Pakistani soldiers provided them  with cover under a heavy barrage of firing on the Line of  Control as they sneaked into the Indian territory in small  numbers. These mercenaries have excellent training as most of  them fought against Russians and then against Hekmatyar in  Afghanistan. When Afghan war against former Soviet Union ended,  these Islamic militants simply moved to another front, that is,  Kashmir. That is why they are very different from the earlier  Kashmiri militants, who usually adopted hit-and-run tactics.    These mercenaries are being looked after by the  Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] of Pakistan financially and  also with constant supply of sophisticated weapons and gadgets.  They are basically fugitives in their own country, persona non  grata, and would therefore be tried or shot. Their only  motivation for involvement in terrorist activities in Kashmir  comes from an icono of religion [as heard] suggesting suitable  brainwashing by ISI which gives them an added zeal. These  mercenaries are virtually leading the terrorist movement in the  valley at present. The seeds of terrorism originating in Afghan  conflict seems to have boiled over to this part of the world.  Recent media coverages televised in USA and Canada offer  compelling evidence in support of India's mounting concern over  the spread of terrorist violence in South Asia, particularly in  Kashmir valley. Activities of these trained terrorist hordes  have also resulted in such tragic incidents as the bombing of an  Air India airliner over the Atlantic ocean in 1985 and the  attack of the World Trade Center in New York City last year.    Despite the continuing involvement of foreign mercenaries  and  persisting terrorist violence promoted by alien forces, India  has not diluted its commitment to the restoration of the  political process in Jammu and Kashmir. With this aim in view,  the government is at present engaged in the onerous [as heard]  task of bringing peace and normality in the valley. Attempts of  militants to step up violence in the valley and cause  large-scale law and order problem through destruction of Muslim  shrines, including Hazratbal, have been frustrated in the recent  past.    Besides infiltration of foreign mercenaries, narco-smuggling  is also playing a damaging role in Kashmir. Pakistan's drug  barons are engaged directly and indirectly in providing  financial and other support to militants who utilize this money  for procuring modern weaponry with a view to creating law and  order problem in Jammu and Kashmir. Is this the drug and arms  peddling nation that waxes eloquent on human rights at Geneva?  [sentence as heard].  *     "

Income rose to Dollars 16.9m in the quarter, or 19 cents a share, compared with Dollars 4m, or 3 cents, in the fourth quarter of 1992. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 160.8m, up from Dollars 140.9m a year ago. The company said the average gold price received during the quarter was Dollars 388 per ounce, up from Dollars 362 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 1992. For the year, net income was Dollars 133.1m, or Dollars 1.71 a share, up from Dollars 79m, or Dollars 1.13, the previous year. The 1993 results include a tax benefit of Dollars 38.5m. Sales for the year were Dollars 634.3m, against Dollars 613.2m in 1992. Newmont owns 38 per cent of the Minera Yanacocha gold mine in Peru, which began gold production last August.

The investment firm issued an enthusiastic ""buy"" recommendation for tobacco  shares.    ""This publicity only hurts the stocks temporarily, and it has very little  effect on earnings or sales,"" said Roy D. Burry, tobacco analyst for Kidder, in  a comment echoed by other Wall Street stock pickers. ""So it offers investors a  real chance to increase returns.""    But if many on Wall Street played down the damage and talked up the industry's  impressive earnings growth, anti-smoking partisans predicted that the news  would contribute to the troubled image that has made tobacco stocks cheap for  some time. They say the movement will ultimately take its toll on the industry.    ""Money managers are going to wonder before they buy a tobacco stock, 'Is this  going to some day embarrass my client?' "" predicted Rick Krevor, executive  director of the Tobacco Divestment Project, in Boston. ""And the companies are  going to face increasing economic isolation.""    Tobacco stocks stumbled when Harvard University and City University of New York  said last Wednesday that they would sell all tobacco stocks amid predictions  that other institutions may come under increased pressure to do the same. The  same day, Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services, let it be  known that he would ask states to ban cigarette vending machines to limit  tobacco sales to youth.    Philip Morris, the market leader, was off $1 a share to $44.125 on heavy volume  Thursday and fell $1.625 to $42.50 on Friday, again on heavy volume. Other  companies with tobacco interests, such as American Brands, UST and Loews, were  also off Thursday and Friday.    Wall Street analysts acknowledge that tobacco's image problems have been a drag  on tobacco shares for some time.    Although cigarettes are one of the world's most profitable commodities -- with  operating profit margins of nearly 40% in some cases -- even the best stocks  trade at only about 11 times annual earnings. That compares to about 13.5 times  earnings for all stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.    The discounted prices are due to tobacco's image problems, fears of litigation  over health claims and worries about the declining unit sales of cigarettes in  the United States.    Many analysts are skeptical that the threat of further divestments or  Sullivan's initiative will do much harm to the industry's financial condition.    ""Most of the institutions that would be nervous about them have already dumped  them,"" said Allan Kaplan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ""This is old news to  them.""    But Krevor insisted that officials of many institutions aren't even aware that  their pension trustees hold the stocks in their portfolios. Even the American  Medical Assn. was unaware for many years that it held tobacco shares as  investments, he said.    Anti-smoking activists believe that not only universities but government  pension funds, hospitals, mutual insurance companies and other institutions  will be highly vulnerable to the kind of public pressure they can bring.    Kidder's Burry said he doubted that Sullivan's plea to the states would find a  receptive audience. Restaurants, hotels and other businesses profit handsomely  from vending machine sales, he said, and such a ban would also seriously harm  vending machine companies. ""This could mean real economic damage,"" he said.    Even if a large number of states approved such a ban, it would do little damage  to tobacco company sales, analysts predicted, because only about 3% of  cigarette sales are through machines. (An estimated 16% of sales from vending  machines are to minors, said Kaplan.)    And if the machines were banned, a large portion of the sales would probably be  simply displaced to supermarkets and other stores, analysts said.    Last week's news was part of a spate of bad publicity for tobacco. Protests  from Sullivan and civil rights groups about RJR Nabisco's plans earlier this  year to target ""Uptown"" cigarettes to blacks forced the company to cancel the  brand. Then word leaked that RJR planned to market a ""Dakota"" cigarette to  young blue-collar women, again drawing complaints. RJR said the cigarettes were  not targeted exclusively to young women.    Yet analysts are hopeful. U.S. unit sales are falling, but price hikes have  kept U.S. revenue growth at about 8% a year, says Kaplan. Overseas, unit growth  is continuing, and U.S. tobacco companies are seizing market share.    Those trends mean higher earnings and stock prices for industry leaders. Philip  Morris, now increasing profits more than 20% a year, was the best-performing  stock of the 30 Dow Jones industrials in the 1980s. Its shares grew 825% in 10  years, versus 228% for the Dow index.

And if the machines were banned, a large portion of the sales would probably be  simply displaced to supermarkets and other stores, analysts said.    Last week's news was part of a spate of bad publicity for tobacco. Protests  from Sullivan and civil rights groups about RJR Nabisco's plans earlier this  year to target ""Uptown"" cigarettes to blacks forced the company to cancel the  brand. Then word leaked that RJR planned to market a ""Dakota"" cigarette to  young blue-collar women, again drawing complaints. RJR said the cigarettes were  not targeted exclusively to young women.    Yet analysts are hopeful. U.S. unit sales are falling, but price hikes have  kept U.S. revenue growth at about 8% a year, says Kaplan. Overseas, unit growth  is continuing, and U.S. tobacco companies are seizing market share.    Those trends mean higher earnings and stock prices for industry leaders. Philip  Morris, now increasing profits more than 20% a year, was the best-performing  stock of the 30 Dow Jones industrials in the 1980s. Its shares grew 825% in 10  years, versus 228% for the Dow index.

In Spain, Oleg Davydov was a member of the delegation  accompanying Boris Yeltsin during his official visit, and in  Morocco he took part as an Russian observer in the concluding  meeting of the Uruguay round of the negotiations within the  framework of GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]. In  Great Britain he conducted talks with his English colleagues and  business circles, reports POSTFAKTUM.    During his numerous meetings with foreign colleagues from  Spain, Israel, Brazil, Uruguay, Great Britain and other  countries, and with the business circles of Spain and Great  Britain, Oleg Davydov called upon them to actively cooperate  with Russia in trade as well as in economic investment.  Recognizing the difficulties of work by foreign investors in  Russia under conditions of a most difficult crisis, high  inflation and, mainly, the absence of legislation to guarantee  the effectiveness and ensure protection of foreign capital  investments, Oleg Davydov noted that at the present time Russia  is taking definite steps to stabilize the economy. Inflation has  been reduced, although it has been impossible to overcome the  inertia of economic decline. To support the continued movement  of reforms, the government is developing proposals for creating  beneficial conditions for foreign investors, specifically in the  sphere of the light and food industry.    To expand its foreign trade, Russia, according to Oleg  Davydov, intends to bring its foreign trade legislation in line  with the conditions of GATT, which it intends to join in the  near future. For this purpose, there will be a gradual  liberalization of foreign economic ties in accordance with the  conditions of the transitional period. On the road to GATT, a  reduction in export duties is envisioned, with their subsequent  total repeal in the future. The list of goods subject to quotas  and licensing is being reduced, certification of import goods  has been undertaken and a system of certification of export  products is being created, and the preferential financing of  import is being repealed.    Oleg Davydov stressed that Russia intends to adhere to the  right to intellectual property in accordance with the principles  of the Uruguay agreement. While speaking out in favor of a free  and open Russian market, Russia will nevertheless implement a  policy of rational protectionism, without violating GATT  principles.    Noting that British enterprises are most prepared for  cooperation with Russia, Oleg Davydov called upon them to  consider the fact that ""in the next century Russia and China  will define world economic development,"" reports POSTFAKTUM.    Upon his return to Moscow, the minister will meet with harsh  criticism, as expressed in the recommendations of the Duma, ""On  Foreign Economic Activity.""    Specifically, the Committee on Economic Policy headed by  Davydov's former chief, Glazyev, is recommending to the  president that the 12 presidential edicts on customs benefits be  ""brought into line with the legislation"" (in essence, repealed).  To the government it is recommending that it submit to the State  Duma a draft of a federal program for the development of export;  step up work on repayment of debts of foreign states to Russia;  develop measures for preventing economic crimes in the sphere of  foreign economic activity; introduce openness into the  registration of exporters of strategically important raw  material goods, and improve the system of management of foreign  economic activity in the interests of national industry. For  this purpose, it should examine the question of uniting the  functions of the state administration in the sphere of foreign  economic and industrial policy within the framework of a single  department (ministry) on the basis of the MVES [Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations], Goskomprom [RF State Committee on  Industrial Policy] and subdivisions of the Ministry of Economics.

The drug's sales increased by Pounds 145m to Pounds 1.03bn, providing 45 per cent of Glaxo's turnover growth. Dr Ernest Mario, chief executive, said: 'People have been talking about the demise of Zantac for the last six years. It's still doing well and it's continued improvement is not a flash in the pan.' Zantac's growth had been assisted by strong expansion in the US (up 14 per cent) and Europe (up 18 per cent). Although the drug was losing some world market share - 39 per cent in 1992, compared with 40 per cent in 1991 - the market was still grow-ing at 14 per cent, said Dr Mario. Sales of respiratory products increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 512m, representing 22 per cent of group turnover. The overall respiratory market is growing at 13 per cent. Dr Mario said there had been a 15 per cent fall in sales in the US due to wholesale stocking in anticipation of price increases. European respiratory sales increased by 16 per cent. Sales of Ventolin, Glaxo's old asthma treatment, fell 1 per cent (4 per cent at constant exchange rates) to Pounds 239m. Beconase, the newer asthma medicine, increased 9 per cent to Pounds 223m. Serevent, Glaxo's latest asthma treatment, added Pounds 9m sales to total Pounds 32m. Mr Mario said this would be a big product - it had yet to be launched in the US, Japan or Germany, the world's three largest markets. Antibiotic sales increased by 21 per cent per cent. Zinnat, an oral antibiotic, increased sales by 49 per cent to Pounds 160m. Sales of Zofran, the anti-nausea treatment, rose 36 per cent, from Pounds 120m to Pounds 163m. US sales increased by 42 per cent. Imigran, a migraine drug also known as Imitrex, generated sales of Pounds 35m. The full-year figures will include the first contributions from Germany and the US. The migraine treatment has been predicted by analysts to achieve outstanding sales. However, Dr Mario warned the drug's use would not grow explosively. The speed of registration had been disappointing, particularly in the US. Research and development expenditure grew to Pounds 335m (Pounds 277m) and was expected to reach about Pounds 735m (Pounds 595m) by the year end. The group spends more than any other pharmaceuticals company on RD. Operating margins for the first six months were 33 per cent, but were likely to fall to 31 per cent because of additional marketing costs associated with new drug launches, particularly in the US. Investment income from Glaxo's Pounds 1.5bn cash-pile was Pounds 79m (Pounds 77m). Dr Mario said if the group could find a reasonable investment for its cash it would make it. There was little point in distributing funds to shareholders because of the advanced corporation tax implications. Earnings per share increased by 16 per cent from 16.7p to 19.4p, while earnings per ADR rose 17 per cent to 68 cents (58 cents). The dividend is an improved 7p (6p).   Companies:-  Glaxo Holdings.

Mr Michel Charasse, a cigar-smoking former budget minister and now a member of the Senate, the French parliament's upper house, has proposed amending a law against tobacco advertising on television, to allow cars to carry sponsorship stickers. If the senate adopts Mr Charasse's amendment, due for debate next week, it will go on to the National Assembly, which must also give its accord. Tobacco sponsorship is worth an estimated FFr500m (Pounds 61m) a year to French motor racing. He was stirred into action by the previous day's decision by Fisa, the world motor racing federation, to shelve the French grand prix, after courts imposed heavy fines on Renault and the Williams grand prix team for breaking the law. TF1, France's leading television station, also faces court action. To rub salt into the wound, Fisa said the French grand prix could be held elsewhere in Europe. The race was to be held near Nevers, where the mayor happens to be Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister. Formula One is not the only event to suffer. Competitors in next January's Paris-Dakar rally are down 50 per cent and the motorcycling grand prix is under threat.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

To this end, Northern 3  Glucine max L. soybean and Trapezond Nicotiana  tabacum L. tobacco plants were investigated. The callus  culture was produced from the leaf mesophyll on the B5 medium.  Selection for stability to L-azetidine-2-carbonic acid in  soybean and tobacco culture cells made it possible to produce  cell lines characterized by a certain set of stress factor  protection mechanisms. It is speculated that the mechanisms of  stability to azetidinecarboxylate are responsible for the  selected lines' cell resistance to other limiting factors, e.g.,  salinity. The level of this resistance differs in different  lines; moreover, the maximum stress resistance was ensured by  joint incorporation of all proposed protection mechanisms.

Not long ago, Henry Kissinger visited Beijing with a message  that he had been asked by Mrs Thatcher, at that time British  prime minister, to transmit verbally to the Chinese leadership:  ""Mrs Thatcher indicated that it was not an idea of the British  Government that the HS Banking Corporation merge with the  British Lloyds Bank, but that it was a business decision of the  said bank itself, which thereby planned to extend its operations  to Europe. It is for that reason that they will move  headquarters to England, namely to London.""    The fact is that the said bank took the mentioned merger as  a  pretext for its actually moving away, and this only confirms the  earlier opinion held by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Commission. At a conference discussing suitable countermeasures  -- a conference presided over by Ji Pengfei -- it was the  unanimous opinion that assent should be refused to the decision  of the HS Banking Corporation.    The State Council informed Kissinger of this and requested  him to transmit the information to Britain. The HS Banking  Corporation thereupon withdrew its decision to merge with the  Lloyds Bank, but merely bought a parcel of Lloyds Bank shares.    However, after the 4 June incident, the HS Banking  Corporation bought further shares of the Lloyds Bank,  transferred its headquarters to London, and thus, in the end,  did realized its intention of moving away. Since the HS  Banking  Corporation occupied a decisive position in financial circles,  its moving headquarters away from Hong Kong indicated a lack of  confidence in China's policies, and this has had an adverse  effect on the mood of Hong Kong residents. On the other hand, it  is impossible for the said bank to completely withdraw from  business dealings with Hong Kong and China. Its main profits  come from Hong Kong and from business with the interior of  China, a trade which has greatly developed following China's  reform and opening up to the outside world.    Before the HS Banking Corporation moved away, the  British  Government of Hong Kong had gradually transferred some of the  official central bank functions of the HS Banking  Corporation,  such as its monetary administrative functions, to be exercised  by another, separately established organization. This fact shows  that Britain had all along never ceased dispositions with regard  to the bank's withdrawal, and that it was only after the 4 June  incident that the HS Banking Corporation came out openly  with  its actual withdrawal.    Although views differed as to whether the HS Banking  Corporation could effect a withdrawal, the attitude of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Committee toward the said bank remained  one of close cooperation and active coordination, as a means of  strengthening the said bank's confidence in the situation.  Normal contacts were maintained with the two former presidents  Shelby and Purves, cooperating in the recovery at the Hong Kong  stock market and helping Hong Kong's medium-sized and small  Chinese banks in their difficulties. In the formulation of the  Basic Law it was also decided, so as to keep the HS Banking  Corporation from moving away, that the future government of the  special administrative region of Hong Kong would not set up a  central bank. The policies of allowing the HS Banking  Corporation, after 1997, to have certain central bank functions,  allowing it to issue banknotes, operating with participation of  the Bank of China, and other such policies, were to be  maintained.    After the HS Banking Corporation had entered the Inner  China  market, Purves once told me that they had certain bad debts in  the interior, which they could not recover, and he gave me some  details. As soon as I heard of it, I immediately agreed to help  them, asking to be informed of the particular items and  circumstances, and we did help them in their negotiations in the  interior. Later, certain problems were indeed resolved through  these negotiations, but some could not be resolved, and I  reported to him the circumstances of the negotiations, having  him understand and telling him not to be concerned. This work  had certainly shown some positive results for the HS Banking  Corporation.    Beijing did not completely agree with us in the perception  of  the situation, and some of their measures were hard to explain.  For instance, Li Peng (at that time vice chairman) did not  solicit our opinion, also did not keep us informed, when he gave  Rong Zhijian funds (Rong was in charge of the Hong Kong office  of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation; he  is the son of Rong Yiren [2837 3015 0088]), having him buy up in  Hong Kong the shares of the China Light and Power Company of  Hong Kong. When Rong was unable to do so, he bought the shares  of the Guotai Company instead. This process of buying up shares  had positive as well as negative effects. It may have a certain  positive effect from the standpoint of holding back British  capital. However, on the other hand, it will also create a  certain anxiety among Hong Kong's general public: Is it the  intention of Chinese capital with this ""grandiose show of  capabilities"" to effect nationalization of enterprises through  the buying-up of their shares? Will this buying up of shares not  indeed effect a ""lian"" [uniting], then by controlling the  shareholdings a ""he"" [merging], and finally the ""guo"" [nation]  as in nationalization, thus truly achieving a ""lian he guo""  [""United Nations""]? Arousing this anxiety was detrimental to  efforts to keep British capital from moving away and detrimental  to creating a sense of stability that Chinese capital, Overseas  Chinese capital, and foreign capital desired.    Being supported by the their colonial government, the  British-owned financial groups in Hong Kong were not only of a  colonial character, but their character was also, to a certain  extent, monopolistic. This was most evident in the public  utilities and postal service, but also in telecommunications,  resources, electric power, and other such undertakings. In the  face of these facts it was our intention, in order to keep  British finance from moving away, to maintain an attitude that  did not altogether negate their monopolistic character, but to  rather adopt a policy of restricting further amplifications. The  problem of such restrictions was also not be solved by setting  up laws or policies, or by administrative measures of the  government, but rather by allowing the laws of the market to  gradually take effect.    When I once visited the Hongkong Telephone and Electric  Light  Company, they expressed to me their desire to invest in the  interior and expand their business operations. I thereupon  consulted the Chinese minister of posts and telecommunications  on whether that company should be permitted to go into the  interior to help improve the backward state of post and  telecommunications services. We truly needed help from abroad,  financially and technically. However, the minister would not  agree to my proposal, as a matter of principle. He indicated  that we already had four firms inside China, investing in  telecommunications. Hong Kong has invested in Shenzhen, and was  actively maneuvering to enter Jiangsu Province. He said his  ministry opposed this kind of activity because it would result  in a diversity of systems and great confusion, and he also  inclined to refuse all further developments in matters of  telecommunications investments. My efforts, thus, did not find  his support.    Generally speaking, efforts to keep British capital from  moving away have had a certain effect, but results were not  ideal. (End of Installment No. 71)    [5 Jul 93 p 2]    [Text] Giving Chinese Capital a Sense of Stability  Still Requires Economic Measures: Reorganizing the ""Hong  Kong-Macao International"" for the Purpose of Opening the Way for  Investments in China Proper; Limiting Approval of Land Sales Has  Had Positive Effects in Bringing Stability to the Real Estate  Trade    Chinese capitalists have already become a vital new force in  Hong Kong's economy. On the announcement by China that it will  recover its sovereignty over Hong Kong, some Chinese capitalists  hurriedly moved their funds away, and the outflow of capital, as  also the emigration of people, became increasingly serious. In  the interest of Hong Kong's prosperity and of its economy, it  became therefore critically necessary to assure the Chinese  capitalists of the stability of the situation.    We worked on this problem from a political as well as from  an  economic angle. In political respects, we worked for a  broadening of the united patriotic front, and stressing the key  points, tried to persuade the major capitalists, assuring them  first of the stability of the situation, which in turn, we  hoped, would have an effect on the other Chinese capitalists,  and would achieve the objective of stabilizing a large sector or  even the entire situation. At the same time, we employed  economic means to support and help the Chinese capitalists, to  dispel their anxieties and build up their confidence.    Of course, it would not have been sufficient to rely merely  on our work in Hong Kong; it was very important to be able to  rely on China. China did persist in its policy of reforming and  opening up to the outside world, of rapid development of the  economy, and of making increasing use of Hong Kong. Of course,  the attraction of China proper for Hong Kong was also increasing  substantially. As a consequence, Chinese capitalists changed  their views on China, and confidence rapidly increased. That was  the general trend of the stabilization in Hong Kong.    There were quite a few Chinese capitalists who relied on  British support, since they had grown up with the support of  British banks, but some of them also relied on support from  China. China's support was political as well as --and that more  importantly -- commercial support, but the two kinds were  actually hard to separate from each other. Some capitalists were  no doubt guided by purely commercial considerations. However,  there were also those who were guided by political  considerations or by both political and commercial  considerations.    We asked the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China and  organizations with Chinese capital funds to more effectively  contribute to the work of stabilizing Chinese capital, and that  they should broaden their cooperation with the Chinese  capitalists and engage in business. We asked that they assist  the Chinese capitalists with regard to sources of supplies,  short-term loans, and that they also get the Chinese capitalists  to invest in China proper. This policy would have been of  benefit for both sides, as it would have meant profits for the  merchants and would also have been helpful for China's reform  and opening up by increasing exports, attracting capital funds,  and introducing new technologies and managerial experiences.    The arrival in Hong Kong of delegates from various Chinese  provincial and municipal departments and commissions has been an  important ""resource"" for stabilizing Chinese capital. Following  the change in foreign trade policy, the various ministries and  commissions of the central government, as well as the various  provinces and municipalities, have shown a desire to trade by  themselves in the products produced in their territories. They  were eager to contact by themselves markets abroad, and this  provided much opportunity for Chinese capital in Hong Kong, as  it brought them the opportunity to act as agents for the sale of  Chinese commodities, and to engage in either wholesale or retail  business, and also to undertake other types of cooperation. We  supported the move of various provinces and municipalities to  have their departments or commissions set up organizations in  Hong Kong and helped them by introducing connections.    To induce Hong Kong's Chinese capitalists to invest in China  proper, we organized several informatory trips by representative  personalities from Hong Kong industry and commerce to important  provinces and municipalities in China, so as to facilitate more  mutual contacts and mutual understanding, and also to increase  opportunities for mutual business relations. I personally led  several of these groups on visits to Jiangsu, Fujian, Shanghai,  and other places, where I requested leading cadres in these  places to personally receive the visitors. For instance, one  year in Jiangsu, it was provincial governor Gu Xiulian [7357  4423 5571] and in Shanghai Mayor Jiang Zemin [3068 3419 3046]  who personally received the visitors, informed them of the  situation and conditions, and replied to their questions.    In the middle and later years of the 1980's, few major Hong  Kong capitalists invested in China proper. Those who really went  in were medium-sized and small firms. In order to get large and  medium capitalists and shareholders to invest in China proper,  also to dispel their anxieties and increase their confidence, we  reorganized the stock ownership and functions of the ""Hong Kong  and Macao International,"" allotting to it as main task: to bring  large and medium-sized capitalists from Hong Kong, Macao, and  also Overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia to China to invest in  China. It might be done by adopting cooperative methods ""to  build bridges for them and pave the way for them,"" or they might  also be helped in the resolution of their difficulties in their  own independent business operations. Because soon after the  reorganization the 4 June incident occurred, the reorganization  was of little effect.    We suggested that the Bank of China increase its business  dealings with large and medium-sized firms. The work style of  the Bank of China group in Hong Kong was staid and conservative.  Targets of their lending activities were mainly medium-sized and  small firms and industrial enterprises. Their work was quite  successful, but the drawback was that they had few dealings with  major firms. Considering the Bank of China group's development  by itself, and starting out from the needs of united front work,  everybody should expend greater effort and increase business  contacts with the large firms. Of course, risks involved would  be somewhat greater, but that should not stop the further  pursuit of the reform. Acting in this way will lead to new  developments in the business operations of the Bank of China,  will increase contacts with large and medium-sized firms, and  would, in the same manner as in the case of medium and small  firms, through these contacts gradually, in the economic sphere,  bring about a sense of stability also among these large- and  medium-sized firms.    The Sino-British Agreement stipulates that the use of land  in  Hong Kong must be approved by a land committee, and that  approval must not be given for the sale in excess of 50 hectares  per year. China established this principle on a directive from  Deng Xiaoping: Britain should not be allowed to sell off all  Hong Kong government land before 1997; there had to be a  restriction. To facilitate Sino-British negotiations and the  resolution of mutual problems, a special land committee was set  up, and it was furthermore stipulated that half of the income  from the sale of government land by the British Government of  Hong Kong must be left for the use of the future government of  the special administrative region.    Hong Kong's real estate firms, especially the major ones,  were very much in favor of this arrangement. They owned large  tracts of land, and restrictions on the sale of government land  would bring them, the real estate dealers, even higher profits  in their business transactions. In business contacts that we  have had with large real estate firms, some repeatedly requested  us: ""Don't let the Land Committee approve more land deals.""  Because there was this stipulation in the Sino-British  Agreement about not approving too many land sales, and also  since we really did not have any experience as to what effects  our action could have in other respects, we did act in those few  years essentially in accordance with the agreement. Although  some more than permissible land sales might have been approved,  the amount was small and has had some positive effect in  enhancing the sense of stability among the large real estate  firms.    However, we soon also discovered that a few large real  estate  firms gradually came to constitute a kind of monopoly in Hong  Kong's real estate market. I asked the Chinese members of the  Land Committee, and also asked its investigation and research  office, to study this problem and to determine what after all  would be the desirable amount of land for which sales could be  approved, particularly also in the coming years, because if too  many land sales would be approved, it would depress land prices,  while the approval of too few land sales would have the effect  of demand exceeding supplies, and thereby causing steep rises in  real estate prices. This task of assessing the proper limits was  proposed by me after 1987, but I did not get to know the  conclusions from this investigation.

When people started to loose confidence in the  situation, some of the major shareholders of the Bank of East  Asia wanted to withdraw their capital. This caused a dispute  among the shareholders, and a French bank tried to take  advantage of the situation and buy up the shares of the Bank of  East Asia, which was thereby in great danger. It was then that  the chairman of the board of directors, Li Guobao, sought help  from the Bank of China. He approached the Hong Kong branch of  the Bank of China and also approached me in the NEW CHINA NEWS  AGENCY. After a study by the economic leading group of the Hong  Kong Affairs Committee, it was decided to support the Bank of  East Asia, and that the Bank of China should come forward to  render assistance. Shares of the Bank of East Asia, held by the  Bank of China, were not to be sold, and more of these shares  should be acquired, to get Li Guobao out from his dangerous  position.    In the course of supporting Chinese capitalists by means of  economic measures, it also happened that such action caused  losses. The most serious case of this nature was the case of the  Kangli Company. Shortly after I had come to Hong Kong, Cao  Weilian [2580 1218 1670], deputy director of XINHUA SHE, in  charge of economic affairs (a former vice minister in the  Ministry of Machine Building and Electronics, a person with  close links to Jiang Zemin) informed me that the Kangli Company  was a large electronics enterprise in Hong Kong, and that its  manager, Ke Junwen [2688 0193 2429], was a highly esteemed  person with high ideals and great competence in business  affairs. Ke himself also boasted that he will become Hong Kong's  Konosuke Matsushita (the founder of the Matsushita enterprise in  Japan, revered as the ""God of Business""). Cao Weilian had hoped  that Ke Junwen would visit China proper and place investments  there, and Cao personally accompanied Ke on a visit to Fujian,  Jiangsu, Beijing, and other places, and also introduced him to  leading cadres in the central government; Gu Mu [6253 3668], a  state counselor, also met him. Ke, then, proposed cooperation  with Chinese capital, and after we studied his proposals, we  also agreed with him, and would have three parties in Hong Kong,  the Bank of China, Huarun, and China Merchants, jointly raise  capital and cooperate with him. After all the capital was  invested, Ke Junwen ran away. We investigated and found that he  had also used the name of yet another company for large-scale  transfers of Kangli capital and movable property. This was a  serious lesson indeed. Later, experts from China assessed the  value of Kangli's real estate and equipment and stated that its  equipment was still very good, some of it even not yet available  in China, so that the economic loss, fortunately, was not too  serious. However, the continuous losses in business operations  will be a burden for many years to come.    Supporting Chinese capitalists in the development of their  undertakings is also an important aspect. In 1986, Hu Yingxiang  and Li Jiacheng [2621 0857 6134] came together to see me with a  plan for the development of a stretch of ocean west of Hong Kong  island and of Lantau Island, there to build a second airport. As  one location being considered for the project was Chek Lap Kok  Island, another was the area between Lantau Island and Hong Kong  island. They were also planning to reclaim land from the sea  between Lantau Island and Hong Kong and build a new harbor, a  residential area, and a commercial area there, also submarine  tunnels between Lantau Island and Hong Kong, and also between  Lantau Island and Kowloon, and an express highway from Lantau  Island to the new border port of Luomazhou.    After listening to their plan, I fully concurred with them,  convinced that this plan would not only satisfy Hong Kong's  needs for sea, land, and air transportation in the 1990's, but  also those of the first part of the 20th century, and that it  would further enhance Hong Kong's function of import-export base  in South China. I said: ""This is a very good plan, it has to be  reported to Beijing; I can be responsible to do that."" I asked  them: ""Have you talked to the Hong Kong government? Better first  talk to them and get their support."" My concern was that since  Hong Kong was still administered by the British Hong Kong  Government, it stands to reason that so huge an engineering  project would only be possible if it had that government's  consent and support. I also suggested that they should not  divulge the plan to outsiders before having clarified the  position of the British Hong Kong government. Li Jiacheng asked  Hu Yingxiang: ""Do the reporters know about it?"" Hu said he had  already made arrangements to meet the press. I suggested not to  do that, and Li Jiacheng agreed with me, but Hu persisted in  doing it. As a consequence, after publicizing the plan to the  press, there was no response at all from the British Hong Kong  government, who apparently shelved the matter.    After the 4 June incident, the British Hong Kong government  came out with its own plan for building a new airport. I think  things would have been quite different if Li and Hu had first  solicited an opinion from the British Hong Kong government.

Foreign capital  uses Hong Kong mainly to expand activities into Southeast Asia,  especially into China. Since China's reform and opening up to  the outside world, especially after the signing of the  Sino-British Joint Statement, the position of Hong Kong as an  intermediary, and as a springboard and bridge, has foreign  capital increasingly recognize its usefulness and has foreign  capital find Hong Kong increasingly attractive.    Under these circumstances, the opportunity must not be lost  for extensive and close contacts with the diplomatic agencies  and commercial institutions in Hong Kong, stationed there by the  various countries and territories, and we must assist them in  gaining an understanding of China's policies and to resolve  whatever difficulties they may have. That is one of the major  tasks of the branch office of NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY.    With this in mind, the said branch office instituted an  internal division of labor: Main responsibility of the external  affairs department was to maintain broadest contacts with the  diplomatic organizations in Hong Kong, stationed there by the  various countries and territories. The economics department had  mainly to contact the commercial organizations of the various  countries and some mass organizations, as for instance, the  American General Chamber of Commerce. I myself had frequently  accepted their invitations to meet with them, and, at their  requests, had answered some of their questions. Foreign capital  was at that time generally concerned about two problems: One was  whether there could be a political change in China's Hong Kong  policy, and, secondly, they resented the monopolistic position  of British capital in Hong Kong, a situation which they hoped  would be changed.    For instance, bankers from other countries than Britain,  stationed in Hong Kong, resented very much that the HS  Banking  Corporation would enjoy many privileges of a central bank, but  would not have the obligations of a central bank. Especially  American and French banks expressed their criticism to the Hong  Kong branch of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY and to the Chinese  Government, and also expressed the hope that when China will  formulate the Basic Law, it will include restrictions on Britain  in the future monetary policy of what will be the government of  the special administrative region.    I was pondering how to take care as much as possible of the  interests of foreign capital and how to satisfy their demands as  far as possible without unduly offending the British Government  and harming the interests of British capital. Some  foreign-financed banks in Hong Kong are pressing for the right  to issue banknotes. I positively suggested to Ji Pengfei and  Zhao Ziyang [6392 4793 7122] to consider allowing American,  Japanese, and French banks to participate to a limited amount in  the issuing of banknotes, so as to give the Hong Kong currency a  more international character. Later, the Basic Law included a  provision of a decisive character, as it stipulated: ""The right  of issuing Hong Kong currency shall be a right of the Government  of the Special Administrative Region. ... The Government of the  Special Administrative Region...may confer the right to  specially designated banks within legally prescribed  limitations, which banks then may issue, or continue to issue,  Hong Kong currency."" Bankers of other nationalities stationed in  Hong Kong have been quite satisfied with this arrangement. The  basic law consultative committee had admitted as members and  advisors several foreign capitalists and bankers, giving them a  chance to state their opinions.    As the economy of Hong Kong has developed, foreign capital  has become increasingly active in Hong Kong, and it has become  an absolutely indispensable matter, in the interests of Hong  Kong's stability and prosperity, to effectively deal with  foreign capital.    We had attached the greatest importance to our dealings with  the capital funds held in Hong Kong by Overseas Chinese. Apart  from devoting myself personally much effort to contacts with  them on a broad scale, work was also done through relevant  departments in China and organizations of Chinese capital in  Hong Kong. The aim was to dispel their doubts and anxieties,  affirm their resolve to make use of Hong Kong and to enter Hong  Kong, to provide them with facilities, to cooperate with them,  and to render service to them.    Capital of Overseas Chinese refers mainly to the capital  held  in Hong Kong by the overseas Chinese of Southeast Asia. Some of  the major overseas Chinese capitalists of Southeast Asia, such  as Lin Shaoliang [2651 4801 5328] of Indonesia, Guo Henian [6753  7729 1628] of Malaysia, and Xie Guomin [6200 0948 3046] of  Thailand, all have considerable investments in Hong Kong. That  is so because, on the one hand, Hong Kong itself has its  particular attractiveness, and, on the other hand, because of  political considerations. For instance, Lin Shaoliang has close  relations with Indonesia's president Soeharto, and at one time,  when Soeharto's position had become shaky, Lin Shaoliang  regarded Hong Kong as a safe haven for his capital. When the  Malaysian Government for a time behaved anti-Chinese, the  Chinese in Malaysia also often used Hong Kong as safe haven for  their capital. Since China's reform and opening up, Overseas  Chinese capital flowed through Hong Kong on its way to China  proper; the Overseas Chinese had always attached great  importance to the useful function of Hong Kong.

0,FT934-7105 ,"FT934-7105 _AN-DKVCMAAGFT 931122   FT  22 NOV 93 / Drug sales sickly as health ministries strive to cut costs      By PAUL ABRAHAMS   Drug sales in Europe have stagnated in the wake of reforms aimed at curbing spending on pharmaceuticals in Germany, Italy and the UK. Sales in pharmacies in the seven biggest European markets, which together form the world's biggest drugs market, were static at constant exchange rates during the first nine months of this year, according to IMS International, the market research group. In dollar terms they fell from Dollars 38.4bn (Pounds 25.7bn) in the first three quarters of 1992 to Dollars 34bn in the same period this year. Further reforms to limit pharmaceuticals spending, recently announced in Spain and Portugal, will add to the pressure on sales. France is also expected to reveal a new drug pricing scheme. Pharmaceuticals companies are also struggling with sluggish growth in the US, the world's biggest single market. This grew only 4 per cent from Dollars 31.9bn to Dollars 33.2bn. Sales have been held back by the growing power of bulk buyers of health services who can negotiate ever-greater discounts. The Japanese market, the world's second largest single market, rose 13 per cent in yen-terms, up from Dollars 11.3bn to Dollars 14.6bn. However, a 7 per cent price cut is expected to be introduced next year by the ministry of health and welfare. The slowdown in Europe was mostly the result of a collapse in sales in Germany, Europe's largest market. These dropped from Dollars 10.9bn to Dollars 9.3bn, a fall of 10 per cent at constant exchange rates. German pharmaceuticals groups, often highly dependent on domestic sales, suffered by more than the 10 per cent headline figure, however, because of changes in doctors' prescribing habits, away from expensive patented products to cheap non-patented ones. During the first four months, sales at the seven largest research-intensive drug manufacturers fell 16.5 per cent, while sales at the four largest generic companies increased 36 per cent, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. As a result, most drugs companies operating in Germany have announced restructuring programmes. The Italian market also declined, from Dollars 8.4bn to Dollars 6.2bn, a drop of 3 per cent excluding currencies. Drugs sales, excluding exchange rates, increased in five of the seven largest European markets. French pharmacy drug purchases rose from Dollars 8.93bn to Dollars 8.96bn, an increase of 6 per cent at constant rates. Drugs purchases in the UK fell in dollar terms from Dollars 4.1bn to Dollars 3.7bn, but rose 11 per cent in local currency. The Spanish market was one of the strongest in Europe. Although sales fell in dollar terms from Dollars 3.7bn to Dollars 3.3bn, they rose 12 per cent excluding currencies. The Dutch market was also strong, registering a 12 per cent rise, although the market was static in dollar terms at Dollars 1.1bn. The Belgian market was also static at Dollars 1.1bn, but increased 5 per cent excluding currencies. However, growth in France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium was insufficient to offset the decline in Germany and Italy. In the seven largest European markets, the hardest hit categories of drugs have been for cardiovascular problems, muscular-skeletal complaints such as arthritis, and blood agents , for which all registered sales declines compared with the first nine months of last year. Sales of alimentary and metabolism drugs, mostly for ailments such as stomach ulcers, were static.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.     ITZ  Italy, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The deal with the regional administration is to set up a factory near the town of Vyborg, employing at least 600 workers and costing 'several dozen' million dollars. It follows a similar agreement reached by RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and foods group, to produce other well-known western brands in the same part of Russia. The Philip Morris target is to produce 10bn cigarettes a year at the factory, which is expected to be completed towards the end of 1993. Yesterday's announcement in St Petersburg was preceded by a marketing campaign in Russia's second city, with kiosks selling Marlboro at less than the price charged by new private Russian businesses and glossy adverts appearing in the local subway. On Tuesday, Philip Morris executives met Russian government officials to discuss ways in which Russia might repay a debt of Dollars 98.7m worth of cigarettes delivered in 1991 after Moscow was hit by 'tobacco riots' as a result of a domestic shortages. Strapped for hard currency, Russia has offered to repay the debt with a combination of raw materials, real estate and roubles.

0,FT942-11532 ,"FT942-11532 _AN-EEED1ADUFT 940505   FT  05 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries   Despite slipping in response to yesterday's first-quarter figures, BAT Industries' shares are comfortably higher than before it spent Dollars 1bn on US cigarettes last week. The market's favourable reaction might incline Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive, towards further action. The group has made no secret of its ambition to expand in financial services. But simply adding another jewel to the crown - by buying a continental European insurer, for example - would lack the same commercial logic. While an overseas insurer would spread BAT's risk away from the UK, there would be little obvious synergy with Eagle Star. Mr Broughton would have to convince the City that he had struck an exceptionally good deal. The acquisition of American Tobacco was applauded precisely because it addressed a strategic weakness. On that basis, securing additional distribution in UK life assurance should take priority. It is too early to say that the advent of commission disclosure will cause the same upheaval in UK life assurance as Marlboro Friday caused in US tobacco. But a shift in the balance of power towards bancassurance companies seems likely and Allied Dunbar's dependence on a direct sales force could leave it exposed. Acquiring a retail bank or building society would make strategic sense. Yet pushing gearing well above 50 per cent - the current year-end target - would be risky unless BAT can rely on US tobacco to generate cash. That, above all else, may be the value of last week's deal.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2111 Cigarettes.

0," LA052790-0179   225254    May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition      Business; Part D; Page 5; Column 1; Financial Desk      2036 words      MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: BONDS NOT AS RISK-FREE AS THEY MAY APPEAR      By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national  consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine.      The modern investment world, like the world of the ancient Greeks, has its  share of myths, one of which asserts that bonds and the mutual funds that  invest in them aren't very risky.    Actually, bond funds and other types of fixed-income securities can be quite  perilous. In certain cases, they can be more volatile than stocks.    That might surprise some people. Many bond fund shareholders aren't aware of,  or choose to ignore, the downside potential of their portfolios.    Usually, however, the market won't let them turn a blind eye forever. ""You can  tell people about risk, but until they feel it in their wallet, they might not  recognize it,"" says Robert Rodriguez, portfolio manager of the FPA New Income  Fund in Los Angeles.    What's needed is an understanding of the types of risks that investors assume  when they put money into a bond fund. There are several varieties of dangers,  and they don't apply to all categories of fixed-income portfolios to the same  degree.    Take credit risk, perhaps the most obvious type of danger. This measures a  borrower's ability to pay back principal when due and make all interest  payments on schedule. In other words, it estimates how likely an issuer would  be to default on its debts.    Several rating services evaluate the financial strength of corporations and  municipalities (state and local governments) and rate their bonds accordingly.  Standard & Poor's, for example, ranks bonds from AAA down to D (for issues  in default). Anything below BBB is considered speculative, ""junk"" or  ""high-yield"" debt. Why high-yield? Because riskier issuers must offer a higher  interest rate on their bonds to entice investors to buy them.    Just keep in mind that higher yields won't necessarily translate into superior  total returns. When bonds prices fall, for whatever reason, that can more than  offset the interest income received, resulting in a net loss for the holder.    That's been happening lately to junk bond mutual funds, many of which have  fallen flat on their faces despite paying double-digit yields. ""Many fund  investors look too closely at yield when they should be focusing on total  return instead,"" notes Dave Schulz, manager of the Milwaukee-based Newton  Income Fund.    For all practical purposes, Treasury bonds and other debt issues directly  backed by Washington carry no risk of default.    But it doesn't mean these bonds are necessarily ""safe."" Some people assume that  government securities and the funds that hold them can't drop in price. Not so.  All bonds, even Treasuries, fluctuate according to interest rate movements.  Picture a seesaw with interest rates on one seat and bond prices on the other.  When one goes up, the other goes down.    Individual bonds, and thus bond funds, carry different amounts of interest rate  risk. Several factors come into play, especially time remaining until a bond  matures. That is, long-term bonds drop more sharply than short-term ones when  there's an increase in the general level of rates.    The Benham fund group of Mountain View, Calif., provides an example. When  market interest rates rise by 1 percentage point, a one-year Treasury will drop  in value by roughly 1%, a 10-year Treasury will decline by 6.5% or so and a  30-year will tumble 10%. But if rates ease by one percentage point, the reverse  would happen: Prices would climb by about the same magnitude.    When shopping for fixed-income funds, inquire about the ""average maturity,""  expressed in years, of the bonds held. The annual report may list this  information, or you can check with a representative of the fund company.    You might also ask about the portfolio's ""duration,"" a more accurate measure of  interest rate risk, Schulz says. Trying to calculate duration can get  complicated, so just keep in mind that lower numbers represent less volatility.  Newton Income, for example, has a duration of 3, which indicates that the  fund's price would rise or fall by a modest 3% or so if rates changed by one  percentage point, Schulz says.    Portfolios with relatively long average maturities of, say, 20 years or more  will expose you to greater interest rate risk, for better or worse. Short-term  funds, which hold bonds coming due within a year or two, offer the most price  stability. The trade-off, of course, is that short-term funds usually pay lower  yields and don't rise as much during a bond market rally.    Credit and interest rate risk are the big ones. But bond fund investors face  additional dangers. These include:    * Currency risk. Portfolios that hold foreign debt securities usually slip in  value if the U.S. dollar rises. Conversely, a declining greenback tends to push  up the prices of international bonds and bond funds.    Ironically, many advisers recommend having some exposure to foreign bonds,  because this can increase your overall diversification and profit potential.  Think of it this way: If you don't have any foreign holdings, you're  essentially betting that the U.S. bond market will post the best returns in the  world in any given year. That rarely happens.    * ""Call"" risk. This is the threat that a bond might be redeemed by the issuer  before maturity. In return for having to surrender the bond, the holder  typically receives a payment that includes a slight premium to the face value.    Is this bad? It can be, because issuers usually call bonds only after interest  rates have dropped, allowing them to replace costly debt with bonds paying  lower rates.    Corporate bonds that face possible calls in the near future might not  appreciate much in a bond market rally. ""You don't get the same upside price  movement on corporates as with governments, which generally aren't callable,""  says George Stasen, chief operating officer of the Rushmore group in Bethesda,  Md., which offers a mutual fund that holds nothing but Treasury bonds.    In fact, governments as a group have slightly outperformed higher-rated  corporate bonds on a total-return basis from 1972 on, Stasen says, citing  numbers supplied by Shearson Lehman Hutton. That's odd, because corporates  carry credit risk and thus should offer higher returns to compensate investors.  Stasen attributes this anomaly to the fact that corporates, unlike Treasuries  and many other government issues, can be called away, depriving investors of  market profits.    Certain municipal bonds also face call risk. In fact, some observers estimate  that 20% to 40% of the current supply of munis could be retired prematurely by  the mid-1990s. If so, that might cause problems for investors in tax-free bond  funds. A broker can tell you whether a specific bond has call provisions, but  it's harder to size up an entire mutual fund.    Clearly, the bond market isn't monolithic; different types of debt carry  different degrees of risk. ""There's a lot to be said for the flexibility to  move between fixed-income sectors,"" says Rodriguez, who can do so in the FPA  New Income Fund. ""Few people realize that when they invest in a specific type  of bond fund, they're really investing in a narrow sector portfolio.""    That's a good argument for holding a couple of types of bond funds, or at least  one that can move around as the risk-return trade-off changes.      BOND RISK    What makes some bond funds more risky than others? Usually, the more volatile  portfolios hold a large proportion of long-term bonds, lower-rated issues or a  combination of the two.    The following table lists some of the lowest- and highest-risk bond funds  around, as identified by Mutual Fund Values, a publication of Morningstar Inc.  in Chicago. Significantly, portfolios in the latter group tend to have more  erratic long-term returns. However, this doesn't mean volatile fixed-income  funds necessarily make less suitable investments -- that depends on each  person's tolerance for risk.

In fact, governments as a group have slightly outperformed higher-rated  corporate bonds on a total-return basis from 1972 on, Stasen says, citing  numbers supplied by Shearson Lehman Hutton. That's odd, because corporates  carry credit risk and thus should offer higher returns to compensate investors.  Stasen attributes this anomaly to the fact that corporates, unlike Treasuries  and many other government issues, can be called away, depriving investors of  market profits.    Certain municipal bonds also face call risk. In fact, some observers estimate  that 20% to 40% of the current supply of munis could be retired prematurely by  the mid-1990s. If so, that might cause problems for investors in tax-free bond  funds. A broker can tell you whether a specific bond has call provisions, but  it's harder to size up an entire mutual fund.    Clearly, the bond market isn't monolithic; different types of debt carry  different degrees of risk. ""There's a lot to be said for the flexibility to  move between fixed-income sectors,"" says Rodriguez, who can do so in the FPA  New Income Fund. ""Few people realize that when they invest in a specific type  of bond fund, they're really investing in a narrow sector portfolio.""    That's a good argument for holding a couple of types of bond funds, or at least  one that can move around as the risk-return trade-off changes.      BOND RISK    What makes some bond funds more risky than others? Usually, the more volatile  portfolios hold a large proportion of long-term bonds, lower-rated issues or a  combination of the two.    The following table lists some of the lowest- and highest-risk bond funds  around, as identified by Mutual Fund Values, a publication of Morningstar Inc.  in Chicago. Significantly, portfolios in the latter group tend to have more  erratic long-term returns. However, this doesn't mean volatile fixed-income  funds necessarily make less suitable investments -- that depends on each  person's tolerance for risk.

0,FT942-2088 ,"FT942-2088 _AN-EFUD5AEIFT 940621   FT  21 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Philip Morris   It would be too simple to blame Marlboro Friday for the sudden departure of Mr Michael Miles from Philip Morris. True, Dollars 12bn was wiped off the company's market value following its decision to cut the US price of its leading cigarette brand. Shareholders are understandably concerned that they will never see a decent return on that investment, but the shares had been driven up by margins on Marlboro that were unsustainable. The bigger mistakes came earlier, when the price differential between Marlboro and cheaper brands was widened despite falling market share. Since Mr Miles took charge in 1991, though, the bind was partly of his own making. The episode underlines the fact that, despite its food interests, Philip Morris faces bigger challenges in tobacco. It is no coincidence that Mr Miles, who arrived with Kraft Foods in 1988, has been replaced by two tobacco veterans. The margin squeeze experienced across the US industry following Marlboro Friday is likely to change the competitive landscape. BAT Industries' acquisition of American Tobacco in April may be a sign of consolidation to come. The introduction of a new federal excise tax also poses problems, although the sums being mooted are less fearsome than a few months ago. Against that background, Mr Miles' advocacy of plans to split food from tobacco may have seemed like a distraction. While some measures to increase shareholder value would be welcome, squeezing the most from the tobacco business would be a good place to start.   Companies:-  Philip Morris Companies Inc.

B.""-initialed commentary: ""Arms Deliveries to Turkish  War Lords""]    [Text] Bonn's decision to resume German arms deliveries to  Turkey is strange. The Turks' war against the Kurds on the  territory of the Turkish state is a fact, no matter how it is  expressed in terms of international law. The arms deliveries  onesidedly help one party to the war. Of course, this cannot be  an argument in favor of thinking about whether one should also  provide weapons to the other, the Kurdish side -- if it could  pay for them. One should not send any weapons to this region, no  matter what the borders there are like. Borders are not eternal  -- the Germans in particular have been able to experience this  gratefully, despite CSCE guarantees.    The Federal Government's spokesman noted that German weapons  are not used against the Kurds; the evaluation of the  photographs presented by German observers and Kurdish groups did  not prove that they are. The question is whether this should be  the basis on which the Federal Government can give itself a  clear conscience. If it had said that we have informed  ourselves with the necessary care and by using all means  available to us and can, therefore, rule out that the weapons  delivered by Germany are used against the Kurds, this would mean  a bit more.    It would not mean much more and would be far too little for  the decision that has been made now, however. A country like  Turkey needs more weapons than those it is using against the  Kurds. The more it gets for other tasks, the more it can send to  Kurdistan. Therefore, the German deliveries play a role in this  war against the Kurds in any case.     "

The  presentation contained claims against U.S. measures affecting  the sales of tobacco on the U.S. market.    This information was released by the Foreign Ministry  through  an official communique stating that the Chilean Government and  the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador,  Guatemala, Thailand, and Zimbabwe have made a joint presentation.    The presentation was made before the GATT panel, which has  canceled the kinds of measures adopted by the United States,  which affect the import, sale, and use of tobacco on the U.S.  market.    The measure adopted by the United States, the Chilean  Foreign  Ministry states, is based on the U.S. budget law, which imposes  several restrictions on imported tobacco, among them that  cigarettes should contain at least 75 percent of tobacco  produced in the United States. Failure to comply with this  regulation will prompt the imposition of heavy fines, the U.S.  law sets forth. The U.S. law was approved on 10 August 1993.    The Chilean Foreign Ministry states that such regulations  violate GATT agreements, particularly Article No. 3, which  forbids the enforcement by countries of local regulations, that  is, regulations compelling the total or partial use of local raw  materials for any product.    Considering that this regulation affects the importation of  Chilean tobacco, the Foreign Ministry adds, the Chilean  Government supported the presentation to the respective panel,  awaiting a favorable decision, which should be made within the  next few months.

With regard to the national budget, it was determined that  it  has presented positive signs during the first two months of the  year. Holguin was the only province to register an improvement  in its own income.    The analysis on self-employment established that some  craftsmen employ other people in their production, using energy  and raw material of doubtful origin. It was also mentioned that  in many cases it is not a craft activity, but rather an  industrial activity. With the purpose of detecting any  undercover illegality, the participants at the meeting agreed to  review all licenses granted those calling themselves craftsmen.    Another important point of the discussion was the sale of  vehicles received as incentives and the illegal buying and  selling of homes. The analysis determined that intellectuals,  laborers, cadres, and public officials have been involved in  buying and selling cars and motorcycles. It was recalled that  the state has a legal and moral right to appropriate these goods  because their owners signed and accepted a contract stipulating  that the state has preference over the vehicle when the owner no  longer has use for it.    Regarding houses, its was also pointed out that the existing  law, which states that the right to own real estate must not  become a mechanism of gain or exploitation, is being violated.  It was explained that rigorous action will be taken in the event  of these illegal acts and that sanctions will be extended  indefinitely and constantly reviewed to prevent future  occurrences.     "

They said the Commission had opened proceedings and was giving those involved in the cargo-shipping pact - the Transatlantic Agreement - three weeks to disband the cartel. The companies had broken EC rules on competition by teaming up on pricing for US-bound cargo shipments from European ports, they said. The agreement involves the Danish Maersk line, Atlantic Container Line of Sweden, Germany's Hapag-Lloyd and DSR-Senator Joint service, Dutch Nedlloyd Lijnen, PO Containers of Britain, Swiss Mediterranean Shipping and Polish Ocean Lines. Others are Korean Cho Yang Shipping, Hong Kong's Orient Overseas Container Line, Singapore's NOL, Japan's NYK, and Sea Land Services of the US.

The Czech Republic had clearly said several times that no  arms were currently being supplied to Iran, Vondra said at a  press conference upon his return to Prague from the trip on  which he visited also Syria and Pakistan.    For many years Iran had been one of the most trustworthy  partners as regards payments, Vondra said, adding that only  during the last half year had some problems appeared. It  should, however, be noted that some minor problems had arisen  due to the transformation of the Czech economy and partly also  due to the inevitable change in Czech firms' behavior, Vondra  said.    There had been a considerable drop in oil prices recently  and  besides Iran had been handling the consequences of the war with  Iraq. All this was leading Iran to adopt a new economic and  budget policy which also concerned the Czech Republic as many  Czech companies were developing busy trade contacts with Iran  and participating in large investment projects there. Problems  with payments for Czech activities had appeared recently, Vondra  said.    ""These are things which the Czech private sector should be  aware of and proceeding with utmost responsibility while  entering the Iranian market, which is a large one with good  prospects, "" Vondra said.    He said that the Iranian Government started to negotiate new  payment relations with many countries at the beginning of this  year. These problems would probably also be discussed at the May  meeting of a Czech-Iranian joint commission established last  autumn, Vondra said.     "

0,FT942-11268 ,"FT942-11268 _AN-EEFEDADBFT 940506   FT  06 MAY 94 / Going up with smoke: Tony Jackson asks why tobacco is back in favour at BAT      By TONY JACKSON   As the shareholders of BAT Industries queue up for their free cigarettes at their annual meeting in London today, they might care to reflect on a curious shift in their company's strategy. BAT is a kind of corporate Jekyll and Hyde: on the one hand, an Anglo-American insurance giant, on the other the free world's second biggest purveyor of the killer weed, tobacco. For years, Jekyll has been in the ascendant: but as last week's Dollars 1bn purchase of American Tobacco suggests, Mr Hyde is not finished yet. The story of his revival is that of world tobacco as a whole. A decade ago, only a third of the world cigarette market was open to BAT. The rest was accounted for either by China - now a third of the world market on its own - or by state monopolies in countries such as Russia, Japan, France and Italy. Denied room to expand, BAT started to pour its surplus cash into financial services, beginning with the near-Pounds 1bn purchase of Eagle Star Insurance at the end of 1983. But in the mid-1980s, the Japanese market started to open up, followed by Thailand and Taiwan. The Chinese market became slightly less hostile. Then came the crucial event: the fall of the Berlin wall, which opened up the whole of eastern Europe. Thus, says Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive, in the past decade the available market has tripled, most of it happening in the last five years. 'When we first moved into financial services,' he says, 'it was all in the context of seeing tobacco as a cash generator in long-term decline. We never saw it declining as fast as outside pundits, but we were looking to financial services for growth. Now we have two growth businesses.' The American Tobacco purchase scarcely fits the growth scenario, since the US market, by Broughton's reckoning, has fallen by a steady 2 to 3 per cent a year for many years. More than anything else, the deal amounts to buying cash flow on the cheap. Even so, it is hard to believe that BAT would have contemplated it had its thinking on tobacco not undergone a sea-change in the past few years. The logic for the deal is simple enough. The two giants of US tobacco, Philip Morris and R J R Nabisco, could not have bought American on anti-trust grounds: and given the anti-smoking climate in the US, anyone not already in the market would be crazy to get involved. As the number three US producer, BAT thus found itself in a buyer's market. According to Broughton's sums, he would still break even on the deal if consumption fell by 7 per cent a year from now on. This, he argues, is unlikely on a sustained basis. Even if it did happen, he says, the deal would buy him time. A combined business selling 80bn cigarettes a year in the US takes longer to become non-viable than one selling 50bn, as BAT does at present. Then again, if a 7 per cent fall sounds unthinkable, it is worth considering the case of Brazil. In its first quarter statement this week, BAT said its Brazilian cigarette volume had fallen by 17 per cent year on year, leading to a loss of several million pounds. Since this is partly due to such exotic factors as hyperinflation and cross-border smuggling from Paraguay, the comparison is not exact. But it is sobering to reflect that in Brazil, BAT still sells twice as many cigarettes a year - 100bn - as it does in the US. On a wider front, the Brazilian experience suggests that the brave new world of tobacco may have its awkward aspects. BAT's market share in Brazil is 80 per cent. In Chile it is 97 per cent. In fact, more than half of BAT's cigarette sales worldwide are in the 30 or so countries in which it has more than half the market: countries in which, historically, BAT had the official monopoly. Its big competitors such as Philip Morris have no such cosy tradition. As world markets open up, BAT has plenty to lose as well as to gain. Looking further ahead, some of the big old state monopolies have yet to flex their muscles on the world stage. Japan Tobacco, the former Japanese monopoly company which still holds over 80 per cent of its home market, is starting to make headway internationally. But the really terrifying prospect is that one day its Chinese counterpart, the Chinese National Tobacco Corporation (CNTC), might do the same. At present, Broughton argues, the phenomenal growth of the Chinese market must keep CNTC's hands full. 'They're growing at a rate of 50bn cigarettes a year,' he says. 'That's a pretty damned big factory (each year).' But the potential of a company whose cigarette output is roughly equal to that of Philip Morris, BAT, R J R Nabisco and Rothmans combined is slightly unnerving. 'We've developed good relationships with them over the years,' Broughton says cautiously. 'But we certainly wouldn't suggest we know what they're going to do.' Meanwhile, the battle for the brave new markets continues, particularly against BAT's old adversary Philip Morris. The two make an interesting match. Philip Morris has 12 per cent of the world market, BAT 10.5 per cent. Philip Morris is much bigger in the US, BAT rather bigger in the rest of the world. BAT has a range of weapons, from its vast experience of international markets to its panoply of local brands. Philip Morris has a single weapon, but a very formidable one: Marlboro, one of the strongest brand names in the world. 'Philip Morris is the most aggressive competitor we have,' Broughton says. 'They're very active in eastern and central Europe. They appear to use different financial criteria from ours. We've had three cases recently where we've been competing head to head to buy a factory (in eastern Europe). Even in the third one, where we pushed our numbers up a bit, they put in a package three times as high as ours. Either they're right or we are. We don't know yet.' In any case, the main point is that in tobacco, BAT now has plenty to do. According to Broughton, the outside world was always wrong to see BAT as wanting to get out of tobacco. 'The cash was available in greater quantities than could be invested in tobacco, since the opportunities weren't there,' he says. 'Now we have a number of alternative strategies open to us, each of which is viable and sound in its own right. We may not be able to do it all at once, but having competing opportunities is a position I like.' In other words, BAT's ambitions to buy a European insurance company or a UK building society may or may not come to immediate fruition. At the same time, BAT may or may not buy into the French tobacco monopoly when it is privatised, or grab other such opportunities as they turn up. Hyde and Jekyll, it seems, will have to coexist in the same corporate body for quite a while yet.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     XAZ  World.

Distributors of alcoholic  beverages must also conduct inventories to determine their additional tax  payments.    The one-time ""floor tax"" will generate an estimated $300 million in additional  tax revenue for Uncle Sam. Alcoholic beverage manufacturers will incorporate  the tax increase into the price of beverages shipped to retailers and  distributors after Jan. 1.    Although retailers will pay the added tax, most plan to pass it through to  consumers. Some stores are urging consumers to purchase their spirits before  year-end to avoid the tax hike.    The federal excise tax increase will be marked.    The tax on a 750-millimeter bottle of red table wine will jump to 21 cents from  3 cents. The tax on a six-pack of beer will increase to 33 cents from 16 cents.  And the tax on an 80-proof, 750-millimeter bottle of gin will rise to $2.14  from $1.98.    Only the 67-cent tax on champagnes and sparkling wines will not jump.    Although federal regulators have exempted many small shops from the inventory,  the bottle count will be a time-consuming and costly affair for larger stores  and chains such as San Diego-based Liquor Barn, with 63 stores in California.    ""I'm going to guess that we've probably got 50,000 bottles at each store . . .  so we've got an estimated 3 million bottles to count,"" said Liquor Barn  Executive Vice President Lew Silverberg.    Liquor Barn hopes to use results from the federally mandated count for another  tax-related inventory scheduled to be completed Jan. 31. But the excise tax  inventory is decidedly more complicated than a traditional year-end count,  Silverberg said, because retailers who are passing the tax increase along to  consumers must retag merchandise with the new, higher prices.    That takes time, because -- unlike an inventory -- ""we have to physically touch  each bottle,"" Silverberg said. ""The customer wants to know when he looks at the  shelf what the price is, so every item has to be repriced.""    Also, the bottle count is complicated because federal Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms tax schedules vary by beverage type, alcoholic content and  bottle size. Consequently, beer, wine and spirits are each taxed on a different  schedule.    Another complication: Store owners must use conversion tables to determine  their tax burden because wine and distilled spirits are packaged in  metric-sized bottles, and the federal government still computes taxes by the  gallon.    The count ""is a lot of work,"" Silverberg said. ""There's no way to minimize it,  even with all of the modern electronic equipment . . . because that's not going  to (generate) sufficient data for this kind of (tax) return.""    Liquor Barn will spend an estimated eight to 10 hours on the tax inventory at  each store. The chain's employees, as well as inventory firms, will complete  the counts after stores close for the day.    The year-end timing of the bottle count could cause problems for retailers. The  holiday season is the ""time when retailers either make or break it,"" said John  Burcham, executive director of the Bethesda, Md.-based National Liquor Stores  Assn. A count that begins the day after Christmas ""doesn't give retailers time  to collect their wits (and) study the instructions,"" Burcham said.    Similarly, Southern California grocers with extensive alcoholic beverage stocks  must find time during their busiest season to count bottles and compute the  additional tax bite.    The excise tax inventory is ""one of a number of things going on in the retail  food industry that have to be completed,"" said Steve Koff, president of the  Southern California Grocers Assn. Grocers will also program cash registers for  a state sales-tax increase as well as changes in various county sales taxes.    Burcham said retailers who wait until the last minute to review the complicated  inventory regulations will be ""horrified.""    The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is allowing retailers to count  their inventory and figure the additional tax during a ""window"" that begins  today and ends Jan. 10. However, retailers must ""justify"" that total by  incorporating deliveries from distributors and over-the-counter sales that  occur before Dec. 31.    That scheme was designed to discourage retailers from attempting to beat the  tax by ordering massive deliveries from retailers just hours before year-end,  Silverberg said.    And, the bureau won't simply take a retailer's word that a count is accurate.    ""We will have inspectors checking to make sure that people have paid the tax,""  said spokeswoman Kris Meldrum.

0,FT923-10610 ,"FT923-10610 _AN-CG2ASAFKFT 920729   FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: LTV's steel side still in the red      By MARTIN DICKSON and KAREN ZAGOR      NEW YORK   LTV, the US steel group which has been operating for five years under the protection of bankruptcy courts, yesterday reported a sharp rise in second-quarter net income, thanks to a gain from the sale of a business. But its core steel operations remained mired in red ink. LTV's income was Dollars 138.6m, or 95 cents a share, compared with Dollars 13.4m, or 5 cents, in the same period of last year. However, this was due to a Dollars 150m net gain on the sale of its AM General vehicle manufacturing business; without this it would have lost Dollars 11.4m. Sales totalled Dollars 1.53bn, down from Dollars 1.56bn. The company said the results mainly reflected lower quarter-to-quarter steel selling prices and a decline in aerospace and defence operating income due to the AM sale, partly offset by higher missiles division sales and a higher volume of steel shipments. The steel division had an operating loss of Dollars 28.4m, compared with Dollars 23.4m in the same period of last year. Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 947m, and shipments were 8 per cent ahead at 1.88m tons. The company said the loss was due to lower selling prices and higher employment costs, mainly from a new union contract. 'Shipments are up, purchased materials costs are down and operating costs have been reduced,' said Mr David Hoag, LTV's chairman. 'But these gains are not sufficient to offset persistently low prices which continue to impede the company's financial performance.' The group's aerospace and defence business reported income of Dollars 22.4m, down from Dollars 37.4m, while energy products lost Dollars 2.9m, up from Dollars 2.5m. For the six months LTV reported net income of Dollars 95.3m, or 62 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 32.9m, or 39 cents, while sales dipped from Dollars 2.99bn to Dollars 2.92bn. Loral yesterday reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 29m, or 85 cents a share, against Dollars 22.4m, or 83 cents a year earlier, Karen Zagor reports from New York. Sales were slightly higher, at Dollars 681m compared with Dollars 677m. Operating income for the three months to June 31 rose 7 per cent to Dollars 68.8m from Dollars 64.1m. Bookings stood at Dollars 502m in the latest quarter against Dollars 492m last year, while Loral's backlog slipped 5 per cent to Dollars 2.73bn from Dollars 2.88bn. Mr Bernard Schwartz, Loral's chairman and chief executive, said the company expected 'income, bookings, sales and margins to accelerate as the year progresses, with double digit per share earnings increase for the year, without acquisitions'.

Das: ""Indian Nuclear Establishments  Get Clean Chit From IAEA""]    [Text] The recent statement of Vienna-based International  Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, that nuclear establishments in India  are safe is a rebuff to Columbia Broadcasting Service Network.  In a 60-Minutes report a few days back, CBS had charged that  India's nuclear plants are safety hazards. The CBS charge seems  to be a planted story by the vested interests in the U.S.  Administration to create anti-India opinion in international  community to put pressure on India to sign the NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty]. Dr. R. Chidambaram, chairman of  Atomic Energy Commission, has described the American TV story as  malicious, mischievous, and a deliberate attempt to misrepresent  the facts.    Dr. (Maurice Russel), assistant director general for nuclear  safety of IAEA, on Tuesday rightly said that safety or the lack  of it cannot be judged merely by televising or publishing a few  of the good or bad points. According to IAEA, Atomic Energy  Regulatory Board of India is making substantial progress in  implementing the required safety standards, which are comparable  to internationally acceptable norms and levels. According to  international regulation, the same ultimate safety goods can be  achieved by different countries in different ways through  systems or procedures differently adopted to suit the specific  national conditions. Safety is based on an overall safety  consciousness and safety culture, which have their roots not  only in technical capability but also in the sociocultural  makeup of a country and the openness with which safety-related  issues are discussed with the media as well as national  specialists and international counterparts. Dr. (Maurice), who  visited various Indian nuclear installations last week, was  greatly impressed by the team spirit of Indian qualified  personnel in manning the activities of the plants, which  contribute as essential elements toward building a healthy  safety culture. Dr. (Maurice) has offered to cooperate with  India in emergency safety regulations at its nuclear power  plants.    In fact, the Clinton administration has of late shifted from  its earlier policy and undertones of its policy are biased  against India. Various officials of U.S. Administration have  been issuing irresponsible statements on various aspects of  Indian life, be it trade, human rights, environment, management,  defense, or India's national integration. Based on half-baked  truths, they have been issuing statements on India and have been  trying to pose as if they are the best world preachers. Despite  the vows of interest in participating in India's economic  resurgence, America has been misleading the world community  about India's nuclear policy. By its report on the safety  conditions in the Indian nuclear installations, CBS was trying  to frighten the world when it said that India's nuclear  installations pose safety hazards.    The U.S. Administration has also been insisting on pursuing  the proposal of keeping South Asia a nuclear-free zone in the  face of India's discernible reluctance. The USA is least  bothered with the existence of nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles in Central Asia. It is also not bothered by the  continuing transfer of missile- related technology from China to  Pakistan, including the shipment of Chinese M-11 missile parts  to Islamabad. The USA deliberately kept its eyes and ears  closed when nuclear technology was being clandestinely stolen  from USA by Pakistan. The double standard of the USA on Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty has prevented India from signing the NPT  so far. On the part of India, it is prudent to ignore pinpricks  and statements from the U.S. officials and should not materially  change its nuclear policy of utilizing atomic energy for  peaceful purposes only, necessary for development requirements  of the nation. [sentence as heard] The USA must realize that  preventing others from acquiring nuclear capability will prove  ineffective as long as it perpetuates retention of its own and  others' nuclear arsenals. If the U.S. is really interested in  South Asia to pull back from nuclear threshold, it should  promote such a dialogue rather than exacerbate tensions by  encouraging Kashmiri militancy. India's perseverance and  firmness on the nuclear issue could bring this home.     "

Now that the group is better managed, cash is being generated and its balance sheet is under control, investors will focus on whether BET has yet formulated a plan that will inject some more excitement into its portfolio of businesses. Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, reports full-year results on Thursday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to come in at between Pounds 640m and Pounds 690m, compared with Pounds 504m last year. The company will benefit substantially from favourable exchange rates, so attention will be focused on underlying sales growth. Of particular interest will be the progress of Zovirax, the shingles and herpes treatment that is Wellcome's best-selling medicine. Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group, reports its third-quarter results on Thursday. The group is expected to report pre-tax profits of between Pounds 55m and Pounds 70m during a difficult three months. Demand on the continent was slow during August, and recovery in the UK and US has been hesitant.

0,FT933-1619 ,"FT933-1619 _AN-DIWC2ACBFT 930923   FT  23 SEP 93 / Gain in readers held by Times      By RAYMOND SNODDY   THE TIMES is continuing to hold on to a circulation increase of more than 30 per cent nearly three weeks after the newspaper cut its weekday cover price by 15p to 30p. The official ABC sales figure for the first week of the price reduction shows an average sale of 461,000. The average figure for August was 354,280. Sales in the second week are expected to be about 468,000. Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, which is owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International media group, said yesterday: 'It's a success. People agree that price is a factor, including university lecturers and civil servants - our core readership.' Wholesalers say that the main loser has been The Daily Telegraph, which has a cover price of 48p. According to some it has lost as much as 4 per cent. Other papers have not been seriously affected. Sales of The Independent, which costs 45p, were less than 1 per cent lower, although at this time of the year sales ought to be rising. The broadsheet market as a whole is estimated to have risen by just over 1 per cent. Mr Stothard said yesterday that he was receiving as many as 40 letters a day on the price cut, most of them from former readers of The Daily Telegraph and those who used to buy The Times two or three times a week and now take it more regularly. The ABC figures for The Sun, another News International paper, indicated that its 5p price reduction to 20p increased the sales of the popular tabloid by 234,341 to 3.832m in August, an increase of nearly 7 per cent.

0,FT942-16545 ,"FT942-16545 _AN-EDJAAACDFT 940409   FT  09 APR 94 / International Company News: A whiff of austerity at Tabacalera - Chairman Pedro Perez is going back to basics      By TOM BURNS   As secretary of state for the economy Mr Pedro Perez struggled for five years to reduce the public deficit, to increase Spain's competitiveness and to curb tax evasion. Since last October Mr Perez has been conducting a similar battle as chairman of Tabacalera, the government-controlled manufacturer and monopoly distributor of tobacco. Tabacalera's balance sheet is not unlike what Spain's has looked like since the domestic economy dipped into recession two years ago. Profits at the tobacco group's parent company tumbled by 46 per cent to Pta10.7bn (Dollars 78.6m) in 1993. Mr Perez is thus again fully involved in cutting costs, in lifting productivity and combatting tobacco smugglers. If all goes to plan, Mr Perez expects profits at Tabacalera, of which the government holds 52 per cent and foreign investors 38 per cent, to recover by 30 per cent this year. Last month the board approved a 45 per cent dividend cut in line with the 1993 profit shortfall. 'So far Perez is looking good. He is creating a sense of austerity at Tabacalera and that is new,' says Mr Joaquin Tamames, senior partner at Axel, the Madrid investment bank. The dividend cut was welcomed as 'realistic'. Tabacalera expects to reduce operating costs by 10 per cent this year, partly by slashing sponsorship expenditure and partly by personnel cuts. Victims of the austerity programme range from the ocean-going yacht Fortuna (a Tabacalera brand), which was forced to pull out of the round-the-world race, to a top symphony orchestra festival in Madrid which has been cancelled following a ruthless cut to Pta250m from Pta1.2bn in the annual budget of Tabacalera's arts foundation. Tabacalera's labour force, which stood at 8,000 when Mr Perez took over at the group, is likely to be reduced by more than 1,300 in the medium-term. By the end of March almost 500 had accepted voluntary redundancy terms negotiated by Mr Perez with the unions last November. Tabacalera's chairman has still not tackled the issue of scaling down the 13 production plants that the group operates in Spain. But he is anxious to make use of the new labour regulations that permit companies to enforce geographical and functional mobility on their employees. The clampdown on tobacco smuggling, following the introduction of legislation at the end of last year to allow stronger policing and heavier fines, should have at least as important an impact on the 1994 margin as will the cost cuts. Tabacalera estimates that some 20 per cent of the high quality brand tobacco  -Winston and Marlboro - acquired in Spain last year was smuggled and that contraband increased by more than 40 per cent between 1992 and 1993. Tabacalera's sales fell overall by 7 per cent last year and this was not because Spaniards, who have the highest per capita cigarette consumption in the EU, were smoking a lot less. The contraband legislation appears to have delivered startling results. In January and February this year Tabacalera's sales were up 7.3 per cent on the first two months of 1993 and sales of Winston and Marlboro shot up by 22.6 per cent. 'If sales continue to climb, by the summer we will be seeing a clear change in the trend with the smugglers on the retreat,' says Mr Pedro Arbex, a tobacco industry analyst at Madrid brokers Benito y Monjardin. The final plank of Mr Perez's platform in his first year as chairman has a somewhat deja vu air to it, as it has to do with the 'back to the core tobacco business' strategy that has been promised off and on since 1991 by his previous two predecessors. This time the chances are that Mr Perez will succeed in pushing the policy through. This is in part because Mr Perez inherits Tabacalera's Pta17.25bn disposal last July of 50 per cent of its food subsidiary, Royal Brands, to RJR Nabisco of the US. Should the US group take up its option to buy Royal Brands outright in March next year, Tabacalera will be forced to concentrate fully on its tobacco business and will have the cash at hand to do so productively. It is also because Mr Perez has completed complex negotiations with Cubatabaco, the Cuban government's tobacco business, which, by virtue of the Spanish company's partial financing of tobacco processing in Cuba, will gain Tabacalera a near monopoly of Cuban cigars in Europe. Mr Perez, who was almost a chain smoker when he was a politician but now sticks to Havanas, plans several more 'core tobacco business' initiatives for the European market before the year is out. He is also preparing joint ventures aimed at eastern Europe and east Asia, but is keeping his cards close to his chest.   Companies:-  Tabacalera.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

0,FT942-14101 ,"FT942-14101 _AN-EDUD3AG3FT 940421   FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar earnings jump but share price weakens      By LAURIE MORSE      CHICAGO   Caterpillar, the Illinois-based manufacturer of engines and heavy equipment, reported record sales and earnings in the first quarter, and said demand for its products in Europe had begun to improve. However, the results fell short of Wall Street expectations, and Caterpillar's stock dropped by Dollars 4 1/2 to close at Dollars 103 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earnings jumped to Dollars 192m, or Dollars 1.89 a share, from Dollars 34m, or 34 cents a share, in the 1993 first quarter. Sales rose to Dollars 3.28bn, from Dollars 2.69bn a year earlier. Sales within the US were up 21 per cent at Dollars 1.65bn, while sales outside the US advanced by 23 per cent, to Dollars 1.52bn. 'Return on sales in the first quarter was almost 6 per cent, about double the rate for all of last year,' said Mr Donald Fites, chairman. 'That's a significant improvement and we anticipate further improvements as European economies, which have been depressed, pick up momentum.' Analysts noted that much of the improvement in Caterpillar's sales outside the US was the result of dealers building inventories during the quarter, and positioning for anticipated demand. In last year's first quarter, dealers were trimming inventories in response to weak demand. Caterpillar said that at the end of the quarter its worldwide workforce totalled 51,671, up 3 per cent from a year earlier. Two years after the United Auto Workers union ended an acrimonious strike at Caterpillar's factories, the union and the company still do not have a contract. 'Product and shipment volumes from UAW-represented facilities, however, continue to meet or exceed plans. Quality levels continue to exceed pre-strike levels,' the company said.

The U.S. announcement on withdrawal of all  restrictions on imports of hand loom exports from India is a  major gain for India. India on the other hand has agreed to  dilute tariff barriers to entry of high-valued U.S. textile  exports which will go a long way to meeting the American  sensibilities about the textile trade. For even now, the  textiles industry is a major source of employment generation in  that country. In view of the importance of textiles for  employment of U.S. labor, the United States had for the last  decade been insisting on more gradual phasing out of the  controversial Multi-Fiber Agreement -- MFA -- which tended to  depress imports of textile items into the world's largest  economy.    The MFA had imposed some arbitrary quotas on textiles  exports  from the manufacturing countries which India had always  maintained was the subtraction from the rule-based trading  regime. MFA is now proposed to be phased out in 10 years.  Although the details of India's opening up of the textiles  market to the United States has yet to be worked out, in a sense  this should be of considerable importance. Currently Indian  tariff on textile imports is around 85 percent and there are  some quantitative restrictions besides. Under the commitment  given now, India will be obliged to bring down the tariff rates  and remove some of the quantitative restrictions. The areas of  restrictions will to a large extent determine the possible  volume of imports from the United States. The withdrawal of  U.S. restrictions on Indian hand loom imports should certainly  mean a major step up in activities in some segments of Indian  hand loom industry. The textiles industry as a whole employs  about 15 millions in India. The synthetic textile industry is  capital intensive and, therefore, the employment generation in  this sector is limited. On the other hand, rough and ready  estimates indicate that the hand loom sector employs no less  than 8 to 10 million workers and any increase in exports could  bring about a significant improvement in their economic  situation. Indeed, the cotton sector alone is expected to be  the biggest beneficiary of any increase in exports since it is  this item that accounts for nearly of the hand loom sector's  exports. However, the bilateral concession to India on textiles  is a just a windfall profit and demonstrates the negotiation  skills of a team which had gone to Marrakesh for signing the  agreement on completion of the Uruguay round.    There are some major differences with the United States over  the general stand Washington has taken on multilateral issues  relating to the new order. The United States had been in the  vanguard of those developed countries which had demanded linking  of social policy issues with trade policy. In effect, these  countries are demanding that the labor standards, particularly  the wage levels in the developing countries, should be taken  into account in deciding the framework for conducting  international trade. If these developed countries succeed, this  would virtually take away the comparative advantage of the  developing countries in the form of lower wages. The United  States is advancing all this concern for labor in the name of  raising standards of living in all countries. Its effect could  be quite the contrary. The activist policies followed by the  United States to shut out imports selectively from different  countries, which it dislikes on some grounds or other, had been  noticed even by many of the developed countries. In fact, the  ministerial declaration on the accession to the Dunkel final act  is carrying an exhortation to the effect that no signatory  should take unilateral action which could jeopardize the flow of  trade among the nations. This has obviously been introduced to  discourage countries like the United States from using trade  restrictive measures under its various omnibus legislations like  Super 301 or Special 301 between now and the formation of the  World Trade Organization.

Parent company sales were up just 3.8 per cent to Y512.68bn. The company said it had achieved savings worth Y65bn, more than offsetting a Y38bn negative impact from appreciation in the yen over the period. Canon has been hedging foreign currency and shifting production overseas. Sales of copiers fell by 3 per cent, cameras by 12 per cent and telecommunications equipment 4 per cent. However, a 12 per cent rise in revenues from computer peripherals, its largest product line, was enough to redress the balance. Other optical equipment, the smallest division, showed the sharpest growth at 42 per cent. Domestic sales grew 6 per cent overall, while exports were up only 3 per cent, reflecting the increase in overseas production. By the end of the current year an estimated 30 per cent of all sales is intended to come from products made outside Japan, up from 25 per cent a year earlier. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, this week put Canon's long-term debt under review for possible upgrade because of improved competitiveness. First-half net earnings per share rose from Y14.93 to Y20.44, from which a maintained interim dividend of Y6.25 is being paid. TDK, the magnetic tape and computer peripherals producer, suffered a 26.5 per cent fall in worldwide net profits to Y2.49bn for its first quarter to June. Sales dipped 2.3 per cent to Y117.81bn and pre-tax profits were down 23 per cent to Y4.95bn. The company blamed price-cutting in some of its consumer markets and disappointing demand for magnetic heads used in hard disk drives.   Companies:-  Canon Inc.     TDK Corp.

At verification, we were able to examine in detail only one of those pricing proposals. This proposal, dated January 9, 1991, was specifically for 1991 (all the prices and discounts mentioned referenced 1991 only) and was silent on the effective period of the terms it quoted. We also reviewed a letter that was dated January 20, 1994, the last day of verification, and was faxed to the respondent on that day by the customer in question. This letter attempted to show that the January 9, 1991, pricing proposal constituted the date of the agreement regarding the essential terms of sale for all sales made to that customer after that date. This letter also discussed renewal of the pricing arrangement. However, not only was this letter unclear as to exactly what kind of agreement the parties had reached pursuant to the proposal, but it also did not indicate when renewal was discussed. In accordance with the Department's practice, the date of any such renewal would constitute a new date of sale. Also in accordance with our practice, we required some form of documentation attesting to the date of renewal, yet no documentation apart from the faxed letter was provided. Lafarge was also unable to provide any such documentation for the other customers in question.     Without some documentary evidence of a renewal prior to the POI, we cannot assume that the terms of the January 1991 pricing proposal were in effect during the POI. See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Forged Steel Crankshafts from the Federal Republic of Germany, 52 FR 28170, 28172 (July 28, 1987) (Crankshafts from the FRG); and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Gray Portland Cement and Clinker from Mexico, 55 FR 29244, 29248 (July 18, 1990) (Gray Portland Cement from Mexico). Because we have no such evidence, we have determined that the dates of sale for the shipments at issue are within the POI. Accordingly, we have included them in our final dumping analysis. We do not think, however, that the pricing information contained in the invoice listing referred to by respondent is appropriate for use in our dumping analysis. This data was only submitted at verification to support the reconciliation of Lafarge's reported POI sales with its financial statements (information previously submitted in its responses). For purposes of making CV-to-price comparisons in our dumping analysis, this listing constitutes new information under 19 CFR 353.31(a)(i), and was therefore not timely submitted. It is not the Department's practice to accept new information at verification, because it leaves no opportunity for petitioners to analyze the sales reporting and provide deficiency questions, and no opportunity for petitioners to analyze and comment on these sales. In addressing this issue previously, we have stated:            The untimely submission of key information *** precluded the Department from conducting a reasonable and thorough analysis of this information prior to the verification, just as petitioners were unable to comment on the new [information] *** The purpose of verification is to establish the accuracy of a response rather than to reconstruct the information to fit the requirements of the Department.

However, we do not think that use of the petition rate as BIA for these sales, as suggested by petitioner, is warranted. In this case, we are using partial BIA because Lafarge has provided responses to our questionnaires. When we resort to partial BIA, it is our practice to use the highest non-aberrational margin based on respondent's reported sales. This is an adverse figure, yet is based on the respondent's calculated margins. Therefore, we have used as BIA for these sales the highest, non-aberrational margin calculated for any of respondent's reported U.S. sales of cement.         Comment 2         Petitioner contends that certain reported U.S. cement sales alleged to have been made under an exclusive supply contract dated outside the POI should be included in the Department's analysis. Petitioner argues that the Department was unable to verify that these sales were in fact made pursuant to a Master Agreement that Lafarge claims was an exclusive supply contract. Accordingly, petitioner maintains that respondent failed verification with respect to these sales. Furthermore, petitioner contends that, even if the Department had been able to verify these sales, respondent never had an exclusive supply contract with this particular customer. Petitioner asserts that the Master Agreement is neither ``exclusive'' nor a ``contract.'' Therefore, petitioner argues that the Department should determine that the appropriate date of sale for these particular sales is the date of invoice, which is within the POI, and the Department should include these sales in its dumping calculation.     Respondent maintains that the Department should consider the date of the Master Agreement as the date of sale for the subject sales. Respondent argues that the blanket purchase orders issued by the customer prior to the POI indicates the customer's commitment to purchase its requirements from the respondent for specific products at the specific prices set by the Master Agreement.

The archbishop, in a speech in which he defended the church's right to express views on political issues, called on the government to have the 'moral courage and the moral self-respect' to increase aid. 'I do not underestimate the financial difficulties and political pain which the government faces,' he said. 'But if we think the going is rough here, let us remember the calamities unfolding in other parts of the world struggling with the catastrophe of mass starvation, chronic poverty and disease.' Dr Carey's comments came as Mr David Bryer, director of Oxfam, one of Britain's leading overseas aid charities, expressed fears that the Treasury was seeking cuts of up to 15 per cent in the Overseas Development Administration budget. Dr Carey said in London that many people feared they had no 'real stake' in Britain.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

Blue chips  were slightly lower, but the broader market finished mostly higher.    Traders said Tuesday's rally left the market ripe for profit takers, and those  skeptical of the quality of the rally continued to sit out the session.    The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 0.42 at 2,809.73 after gaining 56.95  Tuesday to close above the 2,800 level for the first time. New York Stock  Exchange volume was 192.3 million shares, compared to 162.1 million Tuesday.    In the broader market, which did not rise as sharply Tuesday, 878 stocks moved  higher and 725 declined.    A number of traders said institutional buyers were largely absent from the  market.    ""It looks like they are still trying to sort out what their game plan is for  1990,"" said Anthony Woodruff, head trader at Kidder, Peabody & Co.    Nevertheless, analysts were mostly pleased by the day's performance. ""It's  positive that the gains are still kept,"" said A. C. Moore, director of research  at Argus Research. ""It was an opportune time for traders to sell into the  gains.""    Shares of several technology stocks, which helped support Tuesday's rally,  continued stronger. International Business Machines Corp. rose 7/8 to 98 7/8,  Digital Equipment Corp. added 1 3/4 to 85 7/8, Apple Computer rose 1/4 to 37  1/2, Microsoft was ahead 1/2 to 89 1/4 and Compaq rose 1 3/4 to 84 3/4.    Takeover speculation sent Paramount Communications Inc. stock sharply higher  and CBS Inc. shares lower as unconfirmed rumors surfaced that CBS was about to  bid for the entertainment and publishing giant.

In Tokyo, the markets were closed for the New Year holiday. They were to reopen  today.    CREDIT    Bond Prices Fall on Home Sales Report    Bond prices declined Wednesday as the government reported robust sales of new  homes in November, another sign of healthy economic activity.    The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 3/8 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 face  amount. Its yield climbed to 8.03% from 7.99% late Tuesday.    The Commerce Department said sales of new homes surged 9.6% in November, the  steepest gain in four months. Analysts said the report threw water on recent  talk of a real estate industry slowdown.    Since long-term fixed-income investments such as bonds are considered a safe  haven during periods of economic sluggishness, prices tend to decline after  positive economic news.    A sharp rise in crude oil and other commodities prices, which triggered  inflation fears, also spurred some bond selling Wednesday, analysts said.    The main piece of evidence expected to move the bond market is Friday's  government report on employment for December, and some economists are  forecasting a healthy addition of 220,000 jobs.    The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8.3125%, down from 8.50% late Tuesday.    CURRENCY    Dollar Mixed but Firmer Overseas    The dollar ended mixed Wednesday against major foreign currencies after firming  overseas amid reported efforts by the Bank of Japan to drive it down.    Gold prices slipped in New York and abroad.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery  settled at $394 an ounce, down $5.60 from Tuesday. Republic National Bank in  New York quoted a late bid for gold at $394.35, off $5.40.    Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust & Co. in Chicago, said technical  factors were largely responsible for the dollar's movements. But he said  trading remained thin as a number of dealers extended their long New Year's  holiday.    In Tokyo, the New Year's holiday continued with markets closed Wednesday. The  dollar was quoted in London at 145.70 yen, compared to Tuesday's 144.09. In New  York, the dollar stood at 145.25 yen, down from 146.40 Tuesday.    The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling dropped to $1.6080 in  London from $1.6115 late Tuesday and rose to $1.6115 from $1.6085 in New York.    COMMODITIES    Gold Futures Below $400 an Ounce    Gold futures prices fell decisively below $400 an ounce in trading marked by an  absence of buyers from Far Eastern markets, which were closed for the holidays.    On other commodity markets, sugar, energy and orange juice futures all climbed  sharply; livestock and meat futures were mixed, and grains and soybeans  advanced.    Gold futures settled $5.60 to $5.80 lower on New York's Commodity Exchange with  the contract for delivery in February down $5.70 at $396.40 an ounce, the  lowest close since Nov. 17.    Silver futures ended 2.9 to 3.3 cents lower, with March at $5.22 an ounce.    Sugar futures surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange on talk  that Mexico had bought a large amount of sugar and that the United States is  likely to increase sugar imports as a result of frost damage to sugar cane in  Mexico and Florida over the Christmas weekend.    Sugar futures settled 0.50 cent to 1.20 cents higher, with March at 14.22 cents  a pound.    Energy futures continued to soar on supply concerns before the American  Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory report. The report, released after the  close, showed larger-than-expected declines in U.S. stocks of unleaded gasoline  and petroleum distillates, including heating oil. Crude oil stocks were down  slightly and near expectations.    West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 11 to 79 cents higher, with February  at $23.68 a barrel; heating oil was 0.81 cent to 1.47 cents higher, with  February at 78.20 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 1.50 to 1.76 cents  higher, with February at 67.23 cents a gallon.    Orange juice futures soared for the sixth straight day on the New York Cotton  Exchange amid supply fears linked to the Christmastime freeze in the Florida  citrus belt and the continuing suspension of orange juice exports from Brazil,  which halted shipments last week while it assesses the damage in Florida.    Orange juice futures finished 1.8 to 8 cents higher, with January at $1.7205 a  pound.

Sales to pharmacies in the seven largest markets in the five months to May fell from Dollars 20.727bn (Pounds 13.8bn) last year to Dollars 19.422bn, although after excluding exchange rate changes they increased 0.9 per cent, according to IMS International, the London-based market research company. That compares with 8 per cent growth for the whole of last year. The seven countries represent about 85 per cent of west European sales. The German market fell from Dollars 5.797bn last year to Dollars 5.18bn after the introduction of reforms in January. The decline in local currency terms was 11.1 per cent. Italian sales were also affected by reforms which took effect in April. Revenues dropped from Dollars 4.708bn last year to Dollars 3.704bn. In lira terms, the fall was 1.8 per cent. The French market, Europe's largest and the world's third biggest after the US and Japan, continued to rise. Sales were up from Dollars 4.846bn to Dollars 5.181bn, an increase of 6.5 per cent in local currency. Modest health care reforms are in the process of being implemented and a more comprehensive package is expected next year. The growth of the UK market continued, up 11.6 per cent in local currency terms, although in dollar terms it fell from Dollars 2.162bn to Dollars 2.045bn. A package is expected to be introduced to control the increase in the UK's national health service drugs bill. Spanish sales continued to grow fast, up 13.6 per cent excluding exchange rate factors, but down in dollar terms from Dollars 2.017bn to Dollars 1.996bn. The largest therapeutic category remained cardiovascular medicines, although this market fell by 3.1 per cent from Dollars 4.609bn to Dollars 4.201bn. Doctors in Germany are understood to have been prescribing cheaper heart drugs. Sales of alimentary and metabolism treatments, which include anti-ulcer drugs, increased 0.1 per cent excluding exchange rates, although in dollar terms they declined from Dollars 3.497bn to Dollars 3.262bn. In local currency terms, sales of central nervous system medicines were up 3.9 per cent, antibiotics and anti-virals rose 8.8 per cent. The EC formally agreed yesterday to set up an agency to manage a new scheme for authorising medicines in the EC single market. The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products is set to begin work on January 1 1995, but only if EC leaders have agreed on a headquarters site. Contenders include the UK, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DRUG PURCHASES BY PHARMACIES IN WESTERN EUROPE JAN-MAY 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country                 Total           Growth*                   purchases**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- France                  5,181               6.5 Germany                 5,180             -11.1 Italy                   3,704              -1.8 Spain                   1,996              13.6 UK                      2,045              11.6 Belgium                   650               5.8 Netherlands               666              13.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Excluding exchange; per cent ** Dollars million Source: IMS International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

This compared with a loss of CDollars 4.9m, or 7 cents, in the correspondingquar-ter of 1992. Sales were CDollars 291.5m, against CDollars 329m a year earlier. The lower Canadian dollar only partly offset sharply lower base metal prices, Cominco said. Mining and integrated metals operations showed an operating loss of CDollars 22.2m, compared with an operating profit of CDollars 6m, on sales of CDollars 227m, against CDollars 256m. The Red Dog mine in Alaska continued to show losses, as did the Sullivan mine and Trail smelting operations in British Columbia. Fertiliser profits slipped to CDollars 5.9m, and sales were lower because of poor weather in the US market. The Quebrada copper project in northern Chile is now in full construction with a workforce of 2,000 at the site. Inco is responding to lower nickel prices by driving costs down further and may cut back production again later this year, Mr Michael Sopko, chairman, told the annual meeting in Toronto. 'Russian nickel exports overhang the market like a cloud,' he said. Inco is looking to offshore laterite deposits for future expansion, because they can be mined by open-pit methods and show lower costs. Stelco, Canada's second-biggest steelmaker, lost CDollars 38m, or 51 cents a share,in the first quarter, against a loss of CDollars 32m, or 45 cents, a year earlier. Sales were little changed at CDollars 575m. Rio Algom's first-quarter profit jumped 43 per cent to CDollars 7m, or 15 cents a share, on revenues of CDollars 258m, up 8 per cent.

The company said non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first six months to September rose 15.8 per cent to Y10.87bn (Dollars 88.3m) from Y9.38bn, on a 1.2 per cent rise in sales to Y116.08bn from Y114.66bn. After-tax profits, however, fell 8.5 per cent to Y3.28bn from Y3.59bn, due to a rise in tax payments. Fujisawa said a 16 per cent rise in exports offset a 1.4 per cent drop in domestic sales. Sales in the domestic market were hurt by slack demand for its antibiotics and anti-ulcer agent. The company, however, benefited from cost-cutting efforts and increased the ratio of in-house products. It spent Y14bn on research and development during the half-year, 12.1 per cent of its sales. For the full year to March, Fujisawa expects a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y17bn and a 2 per cent rise in sales to Y233bn. After-tax profits are expected to increase 7 per cent to Y6.5bn. Ono Pharmaceutical, a medium-sized Japanese drugs company, also posted firm first-half profits thanks to its diabetic neuropathy drug. Sales for the half-year to September grew 16.2 per cent to Y45.9bn. Pre-tax profits rose 10.3 per cent to Y17.5bn. Net profits rose 2.7 per cent to Y7.4bn. For the year to March, Ono expects a 14.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y34.4bn on a 17.2 per cent increase in sales to Y93bn.  The Financial Times   London Page 29  "
0," LA021289-0060   17444    February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition      Travel; Part 7; Page 8; Column 3; Travel Desk      699 words      CONSUMER REPORT;    AID FOR THOSE AT HOME      Travelers who run into trouble abroad naturally find it distressing, and for  the family back home it can be equally worrisome.    A friend, for example, was trapped in Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Her  parents were frantic, unable to get through to her (or she to them) because of  security on telephone lines.    As it transpired, she was safe in a hotel on the outskirts of Haifa.    More recently, another friend was in Jamaica when Hurricane Gilbert hit last  fall. Again, there were agonizing hours of uncertainty as members of his family  tried to get through to his hotel, only to find that the lines were down.    He, too, was safe. But for a desperately long time, people closest to him  didn't know anything.    In another instance in 1985, the son of friends decided to ""find himself . . .  maybe write a book"" in the northern part of the Canadian Yukon. With a warm  coat, stout shoes and a backpack, he took off on his great adventure,  promising, of course, to keep in touch.    Typical teen-ager that he was, he didn't.    Weeks went by, then months, and not a word from the young man. His parents were  beside themselves.      Communing With Nature    Here again, the story had a happy ending. He was living in a tiny makeshift  logging village, communing with nature and the locals, quite safe and having a  whale of a time.    But there wasn't a telephone within 100 miles and, as he later said, there  wasn't exactly a post office on every corner, either.    What do you do when you're at home and you are concerned about the welfare of a  relative or friend who was last heard of abroad and who, you believe, may be in  danger?    Meet the State Department's Overseas Citizens Service, which comprises the  Citizens Consular Service and the Citizens Emergency Center. OCS, a branch of  the State Department's Consular Affairs Bureau, just celebrated its 10th  anniversary.    The OCS considers itself the government's ""people's desk,"" serving individual  Americans, while the State Department takes care of broad policy and  government-to-government contacts.

A friend, for example, was trapped in Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Her  parents were frantic, unable to get through to her (or she to them) because of  security on telephone lines.    As it transpired, she was safe in a hotel on the outskirts of Haifa.    More recently, another friend was in Jamaica when Hurricane Gilbert hit last  fall. Again, there were agonizing hours of uncertainty as members of his family  tried to get through to his hotel, only to find that the lines were down.    He, too, was safe. But for a desperately long time, people closest to him  didn't know anything.    In another instance in 1985, the son of friends decided to ""find himself . . .  maybe write a book"" in the northern part of the Canadian Yukon. With a warm  coat, stout shoes and a backpack, he took off on his great adventure,  promising, of course, to keep in touch.    Typical teen-ager that he was, he didn't.    Weeks went by, then months, and not a word from the young man. His parents were  beside themselves.      Communing With Nature    Here again, the story had a happy ending. He was living in a tiny makeshift  logging village, communing with nature and the locals, quite safe and having a  whale of a time.    But there wasn't a telephone within 100 miles and, as he later said, there  wasn't exactly a post office on every corner, either.    What do you do when you're at home and you are concerned about the welfare of a  relative or friend who was last heard of abroad and who, you believe, may be in  danger?    Meet the State Department's Overseas Citizens Service, which comprises the  Citizens Consular Service and the Citizens Emergency Center.

Speaking on the White House lawn after a meeting with South African President Nelson Mandela, Mr Clinton said the fund would be chaired by Mr Andrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta and US ambassador to the UN. Separately, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US government agency charged with encouraging US investment overseas, announced that it would provide political risk insurance for two private equity funds totalling Dollars 150m to invest in southern Africa. Mr Mandela has been winning considerable support from US venture capitalists on his visit to the US, but no new direct US aid package beyond the Dollars 600m the Clinton administration has already committed to South Africa.

0,FT934-13045 ,"FT934-13045 _AN-DJXAPABXFT 931023   FT  23 OCT 93 / Smoke signals in the east: A look at western tobacco groups' bids to broaden their markets      By PHILIP RAWSTORNE   The Marlboro cowboy may have looked bedraggled and saddle-sore in the US this year but he is still riding high elsewhere in the world. The cigarette brand's manufacturer, Philip Morris, has fought fiercely in the past six months to protect its advertising icon. It is anxious to restore Marlboro's standing in the US. But protecting home sales is not the only motive. It also fears that any further slippage in its standing in the US would hit its growing international business. The emphasis on strengthing an image in new markets is not unique to Philip Morris. As the US, along with other western markets, have turned away from cigarette consumption in the face of health lobbies and government regulation, the multinational producers have had to look elsewhere - such as the Far East - for sales growth. This week came evidence that Philip Morris' strategy is paying off. Its daring decision in April to cut prices in the US by 20 per cent reversed some of the fall in sales over recent years. Marlboro's market share in the US has risen from 24 per cent to 25.7 per cent. More spectacularly, results for the quarter to September showed operating profits outside the US up 15 per cent on the same period a year before. Although the US, where 500bn cigarettes are consumed a year, and western Europe, where 750bn are smoked annually, will continue to be important markets for Philip Morris and other tobacco groups, such as BAT Industries, R J Reynolds and Rothmans International, it is the international market that will provide the long-term opportunities. What has transformed the prospects for the multinationals has been the opening of new markets in Asia and the Pacific Rim and in eastern Europe. A decade ago, 4,500bn cigarettes were smoked a year worldwide. But 60 per cent of the market was closed to the multinationals by trade barriers. Removal of restrictions in the fast-growing economies of the Far East and the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, have now given western multinationals access to all but 5 per cent of a global market that has grown to 5,330bn cigarettes, in spite of recent worldwide recession. Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand, for instance, have lifted trade barriers since the mid-1980s - usually under pressure from a US government that was discouraging smoking in its own backyard. China, the biggest market in the world with an annual consumption of 1,705bn cigarettes, still restricts imports to hard currency outlets, but has said it will open the door wider in 1995. Philip Morris this year signed a co-operation agreement with the state tobacco company to produce Marlboro cigarettes. In Europe, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, tobacco multinationals headed the race by western companies to establish operations in the former communist states, a market of 643bn cigarettes. Such emerging markets present almost a mirror image of conditions in the US and western Europe. In the Far East and east Europe, the smoking habit is spreading and is socially acceptable. Anti-smoking campaigners are less vociferous. Restrictions on advertising are relatively weak or weakly enforced. The contrast between the mature and developing markets can be stark. While a Los Angeles court recently removed a child from the custody of a mother who smoked, children sell cigarettes on almost every street corner in Manila. Whereas in the west, the health hazard is top of people's minds, in Russia's parlous economy the jobs created by the investments of tobacco companies weigh more heavily. Moreover cigarettes have the status of a currency which, unlike the rouble, does not depreciate. Tobacco multinationals are flourishing in these conditions. World sales of international brands, such as Marlboro, grew by 7 per cent a year between 1989 and 1992. BAT, which exported 45bn cigarettes in 1989, almost trebled the number to 129bn last year. US companies shipped 18bn cigarettes to the Pacific Rim in 1985; last year, the number rose to 87bn. To cope with the demand from these markets, Philip Morris is completing a Dollars 400m expansion of its plant in North Carolina, increasing production capacity by 50 per cent. BAT is investing Pounds 175m in its Southampton factory in southern England to double annual production to 55bn cigarettes. The inroads made into Far East markets - where many consumers aspire to what they perceive to be a western lifestyle - is almost certainly producing the biggest contributions to profit, although no group gives a regional breakdown. Philip Morris has secured 12 per cent of the Japanese market, the world's fourth largest. BAT's Kent and Lucky Strike brands both rank in the top five of Japan's best-selling imported cigarettes. The two groups dominate the now growing imported sector in Taiwan. Rothmans International this year merged its tobacco interests in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong to strengthen its operations in the region. Mr Nyren Scott-Malden, analyst at BZW, says: 'The move enables it to use the cash built up in the mature markets of Malaysia and Singapore to exploit the biggest growth markets in the world.' Outside the Far East, slower economic growth mean returns from investments will take longer to secure. Sir Patrick Sheehy, BAT's chairman, says significant profits on the group's east European ventures are not expected for at least 10 years, 'possibly 25'. Establishing operations in the former Soviet bloc also requires a deal of management agility to surmount obstacles presented either by the absence of any framework of commercial law or a maze of regulations. 'Businessmen,' says Sir Patrick, 'are marooned in a command economy.' In Russia, BAT is setting up a joint venture with Yava, Moscow's largest cigarette factory; Rothmans is investing Pounds 55m in a joint venture in St Petersburg; and Philip Morris this year bought into its third cigarette company. Other ventures are being set up in the the CIS and other east European countries; in the Czech republic, Philip Morris paid Dollars 400m for a majority of the Tabak company which controls 80 per cent of the country's tobacco market. BAT has gained a 50 per cent share of the Hungarian market through a Pounds 20m joint venture with a local factory. Equipped with modern machinery, these factories are now improving low-priced local cigarette brands. The expectation is that over the next few years, such investments will begin to reap rewards comparable with those in the Far East. All this is not to suggest that the multinationals have given up in western markets. For instance, the breaking of state cigarette manufacturing monopolies, as rules for new market entrants have been relaxed, in Italy, France, Spain and Portugal, have provided further opportunities for international brands. Marlboro now controls 43 per cent of the Italian market and 35 per cent in Germany. Sales of BAT's Lucky Strike brand in France have risen by 27 per cent a year since 1989 to 1.2bn cigarettes. But demand in the mature markets US and western Europe markets is falling under constant and growing pressure of health lobbies and increasing government controls on advertising. The need to keep the Marlboro cowboy looking proud in China and elsewhere will remain the first priority.   Companies:-  Philip Morris Companies Inc.     BAT Industries.     Rothmans International.

0,FT944-4611 ,"FT944-4611 _AN-ELGCWAGYFT 941207   FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (12): Balance is back in the black - A look at the recovery      By TONY HAWKINS   Drought and trade liberalisation pushed Zimbabwe's balance of payments deep into the red in 1991-92, since when there has been a strong recovery. In part, this reflects sluggish growth and depressed imports, but this year exports should recoup most of their 1992 losses caused by drought and depressed commodity prices. Strong primary export growth in 1994-95 could push the current account into surplus if import demand remains weak, exacerbating the upward pressure on the exchange rate arising from aid and capital inflows, mainly portfolio and hot money rather than foreign direct investment (FDI). Foreigners disinvested during the 1980s, and although there has been a small net inflow (Dollars 35m) since 1990, the country's stock of foreign investment has tumbled from Dollars 7bn in 1980 to Dollars 2.6bn in 1992. Zimbabwe is sub-Saharan Africa's third largest host country for FDI after South Africa and Nigeria. The Zimbabwe dollar, devalued by 17 per cent at the end of 1993 as part of an exchange control liberalisation package, regained 5.5 per cent of its value in the first half of the year, but has since resumed its slide, taking its depreciation to 19 per cent so far this year, including the 17 per cent official devaluation. Given a 12 to 15 per cent inflation differential with Zimbabwe's main trading partners since January, the real exchange rate has been appreciating, thereby compounding manufacturing industry's export woes. Commodity exporters, however, seem happy with the rate for the time being, although a further downward adjustment is expected in 1995, with the rate falling from ZDollars 8.4 to the US dollar to around ZDollars 10 in a year's time. In 1991 tobacco, gold and ferrochrome accounted for just over half of exports. Tobacco has since lost ground but is recovering, as also is ferrochrome and nickel. Gold earnings will increase substantially this year and next and new mineral exports will come on stream with diamonds and platinum making Zimbabwe an increasingly minerals-dependent exporter in the second half of the decade, while there are high hopes that horticulture will recoup some of the ground lost by tobacco. Since the launch of ESAP, Zimbabwe's foreign debt has increased 44 per cent to Dollars 3.8bn at the end of 1993 (from 39 per cent to 69 per cent of GDP). Last year, debt service payments absorbed 30 per cent of exports, but this ratio will fall as exports recover, though it will remain uncomfortably high for the next few years.  -------------------------------------------- MAIN EXPORTS 1991-93 (FIGURES IN DOLLARS M)  -------------------------------------------- Commodity                       1991     1993  -------------------------------------------- Tobacco                          532      365 Gold                             225      235 Ferrochrome                      155      142 Nickel                            97       56 Cotton lint                       65       26 Steel                             29       16 Manufactures                     340      450  (of which, Clothing/Textiles     92     122)  -------------------------------------------- Totals                         1,765    1,555  --------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------- BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 1991-93 (IN DOLLARS M)  -----------------------------------------------                       1991       1992       1993  ----------------------------------------------- Exports              1,785      1,530      1,585 Imports              1,700      1,780      1,480 Trade balance           85       -250        125 Net services          -345       -350       -180 Investment income     -290       -285       -255 Net transfers            -         40         25 Current balance       -550       -845       -285 Capital account*       420        715        465 Overall balance       -125       -130       +180  ----------------------------------------------- * Adjusted for unrecorded flows  -----------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZWZ  Zimbabwe, Africa.

The group takes in the J Lauritzen Shipping Group, DFDS, the North Sea freight and ferry group, and the Danyard shipyard. Sales were up to DKr4.89bn from DKr4.33bn, but the result was hit by a rise in net financial costs to DKr230m from DKr142m and a DKr54m loss on the disposal of vessels. The J Lauritzen Company made a loss of DKr289m, against a loss of DKr118m. The company's fleet of refrigerated cargo vessels was hurt by low freight rates and the weakness of the dollar against the krone. The holding company said it has increased the shipping company's capital by issuing subordinated loan capital of DKr150m. The shipyard also moved into a loss of DKr42m, compared with a profit of DKr66m. The group has predicted a full-year loss of the same order as in 1993, when there was a net deficit of DKr178m. FLS Industries, the industrial conglomerate which is a leading global supplier of cement mills and machinery, has reported an increase in first-half net profits to DKr176m from DKr126m in the same period of last year. Sales advanced to DKr6.45bn from DKr5.6bn, which was mainly a reflection of the domestic building materials group Aalborg Portland being classified as a subsidiary rather than as an associate company. Codan, Denmark's biggest non-life insurance group, recorded a first-half net loss of DKr146m, against a profit in the same period last year of DKr503m.

Zantac, an ulcer treatment, is vital to the UK group. In the last financial year it generated sales of Pounds 2.17bn, equivalent to 44 per cent of group turnover. About half Zantac's sales are in the US. The case was brought by Glaxo after Novopharm, a manufacturer of generic (unbranded) drugs, sought government permission to make generic Zantac. The Canadian group had challenged Glaxo's patents on the grounds that the version of Zantac marketed by the British company, known as Form Two and whose patents expire in 2002, was no different from another version, Form One, which has never been marketed but whose patents expire in December 1995. The victory comes as a significant relief for Glaxo. Had Novopharm won, it would have been able to market generic versions of Form Two Zantac from January 1996. Sales of drugs whose patents expired recently have halved within 12 months. Novopharm was unavailable for comment last night. Normally, such cases go to appeal. Worldwide sales of Zantac increased 11 per cent in the last financial year. Sales in the US rose 13 per cent. Dr Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive, said Zantac's performance was remarkable. However, this month he warned that there remained other threats to the Zantac franchise besides the Novopharm challenge: The expiry next year of the US patents of Zantac's main competitor, SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet. Zantac will have to compete with cheap generic versions of that drug. Generic versions of Form One Zantac after its patents expire at the end of 1994. New-generation drugs, such as Astra's Losec. However, in spite of those threats, Dr Sykes insisted, Zantac's franchise had a positive future.   Companies:-  Glaxo Holdings.     Novopharm Inc.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The Pakistani announcement in Islamabad  puzzled many here, and more so its logic given by that country's  Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan. Islamabad alleged that the  Indian Government had gone back on its commitment to lease the  Jinnah House for the use of the Consulate General and refused to  facilitate the acquisition of suitable premises for the  Consulate General. It also accused the government of  Maharashtra of making it difficult for the Consulate General to  carry out its assigned functions. On their very face, these  charges look flimsy and unconvincing. For example, India is on  record of having rejected Pakistan's plea for the use of Jinnah  House as long as 1983 when General Zia approached New Delhi with  this request. Subsequently, India gave no impression that it was  not firm on its rejection of the Pakistani request. India was  also not obliged to find a place for Pakistan in Bombay.  Pakistan knew it and yet it made the Jinnah House and its  failure to find a suitable place for its Consulate General as an  excuse for winding up its work in Bombay.    Pakistan seems to have perfected the art of accusing others  of the sins which it itself commits. India's High Commission in  Islamabad and its Consulate General in Karachi worked under all  kinds of trying conditions. In May 1992, a senior diplomat, Mr.  Rajesh Mittal, was abducted and tortured by Pakistani  intelligence agencies. It was such an awful incident that even  Amnesty International deplored it. Before that, the wife of an  attache was abducted while shopping and questioned about the  activities of her husband and other staff members of the High  Commission. In Karachi, the Indian staff was kept under  constant intimidation. Those Pakistani Sindhis and Muhajirs who  visited the consulate were branded as Indian agents. In August  1992, the two countries signed an agreement on the code of  conduct for treatment of diplomatic, consular personnel in the  two countries. They reaffirmed their commitment to the Vienna  Convention of 1962 on diplomatic relations and the Vienna  Convention of 1963 on consular relations. However, as the year  1992 came to a close, Pakistan gave this accord its own  interpretation and asked India to curtail the strength of its  staff in Karachi to less than one-third, that is, from 68 to 20.  The Pakistani order mainly hurt the Muhajir community in Sindh.  Muhajirs are refugees from India. They still have family ties  in India. The Indian Consulate was issuing 700 visas a day to  them to visit their relatives. The community which has been  suffering political deprivations and discriminations because  mainly of their language, Urdu, will now be denied the facility  to meet relatives in India.    Pakistan's sudden decision to close the consulate in Bombay  came at a time when India, after the Geneva episode, was trying  to create conditions for the restart of efforts to normalize  relations with this important neighbor. This desire has  received a setback. There could have been two reasons why  Pakistan chose to close down its consulate at this time. First,  because of its domestic compulsion, the government of Ms.  Benazir Bhutto was trying to preempt the reopening of  India-Pakistan dialogue on normalization of relations. Ms.  Bhutto finds herself in an acutely embarrassing situation after  the loss of face in Geneva. She calls it her victory, but the  opposition remains unconvinced, especially in view of all the  claims before the withdrawal of Pakistan's resolutions from the  United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva that a large  number of commission members were willing to vote for the  resolution. At present, Ms. Bhutto's government will find it  difficult to restart negotiations with India.    The second reason may be Pakistani intelligence agencies'  strategy to keep the Muhajirs from meeting their relations in  India. Muhajirs have been the special target of the military  operations in Sindh, which began in May 1992. A section of the  Urdu press feels no compunction in accusing the Muhajirs of  being anti-Pakistan.     "

The rise was caused by governmental and industrial efforts  to  diversify markets and to open new markets in former and current  communist countries and Southwest Asia, according to the  ministry.    Southeast Asian countries placed orders worth a total of  2.58  billion dollars, or 50 percent of the overseas orders, followed  by Middle Eastern nations at 1.81 billion dollars, up 319  percent from 1992.    Former and present communist countries such as Russia and  Vietnam placed orders of 684 million dollars.    Engineering work accounted for 2.31 billion dollars, or 45  percent, and construction work for 1.62 billion dollars.    By company, Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co. ranked  first at 1.3 billion dollars, followed by Dong Ah Construction  Co. at 1.19 billion dollars and Daewoo Engineering Co. at 628  million dollars.

When a building is new, some contaminants are given off quickly and soon disappear. Others continue off-gassing at a slow pace for years. Common office supplies and equipment have been found to release hazardous chemicals_especially duplicators and copiers. Bulk paper stores have been found to release formaldehyde [Ex. 31087A20].

Many of these scales carry microbes, most of which are short lived and harmless. Clothing, furnishings, draperies, carpets, etc. contribute fibers and other fragments. Cleaning processes, sweeping, vacuuming, dusting normally remove the larger particles, but often increase the airborne concentrations of the smaller particles. Cooking, broiling, grilling, gas and oil burning, smoking, coal and wood generate vast numbers of airborne indoor pollutants in various classifications.         3. Controlling Indoor Air         Control of pollutants at the source is the most effective strategy for maintaining clean indoor air. However, control or mitigation of all sources is not always possible or practical. In the case of ETS, this means restricting smoking to separately ventilated spaces. General ventilation is, therefore, the second most effective approach to providing acceptable indoor air [Exs. 31061G, 31075J].            "
0,FT931-12873 ,"FT931-12873 _AN-DA0B8AB4FT 930127   FT  27 JAN 93 / Management: Blow for passive smokers      By VICTORIA GRIFFITH   The US Environmental Protection Agency's recent classification of second-hand cigarette smoke as a first-class carcinogen is prodding many US companies to reassess workplace smoking rules. The judgment makes employers which do not ban smoking more vulnerable to lawsuits. The EPA ruling blamed passive smoke for 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year in the US. New federal regulations, to be issued as a result of the EPA report, could soon make it mandatory for companies with more than 10 employees to prohibit smoking at the workplace altogether. Such regulations would mean the end of employee smoking rooms. 'Because the smoking room uses the same ventilation system as other offices in the building, it doesn't provide enough protection to non-smokers,' said Fran Dumelle, deputy managing director of the American Lung Association. Many US companies have already banned smoking, and groups of smokers can increasingly be seen huddled outside large office buildings. Concern over smokers traipsing out of doors in inclement weather has prompted some of the more innovative companies to erect external 'smoking shelters'. They look like bus shelters and shield smokers against rain, wind and snow. The ALA also recommends that companies offer 'smoker sensitivity training', which explains to non-smoking employees how difficult it is for smokers to quit. Many employers also adopt a series of motivational programmes to encourage smokers to give up. These often include support groups with worksite meetings, free counseling and discounts on nicotine patches. Cigarette companies say the problem should be addressed in another manner. 'With improved ventilation systems, non-smokers would not be bothered by people smoking,' said Thomas Borelli, director of science affairs for Philip Morris.   Countries:-  USZ  USA.

This is the finding of a nationwide survey of 3,000 owners  of  Chinese-built cars over a period of three months. Results of  the survey, conducted by the State Statistical Bureau and the  China Automobile Industry Corporation, were announced here today.    Improvement in the Chinese people's living standards will  give a major push to the buying of family cars, the survey says.    It indicates that a growing number of well-to-do Chinese  have  bought cars for private use. And more and more autos are  expected to be driven home in China in the coming decades.    The survey shows that the most popular Chinese-built cars  are  the Audi from the China First Automobile Group Corporation  (CFAGC), the Santana from the Shanghai Volkswagen Auto  Corporation, Ltd. (SVAC), and the Jetta from the Fow-Volkswagen  Auto Corporation, Ltd. (FVAC) [name as received].    Heavy-duty trucks praised by consumers surveyed are the  Huanghe from the Jinan Heavy-Duty Motor Works (JHMW) and the  Jiefang from CFAGC, it says.    A few enterprises such as CFAGC and SVAC were valued by the  consumers as the best automobile enterprises in China.    China has 116 motor works, but their output and  manufacturing  technology lag behind world standards. The survey was aimed at  helping China's auto corporations to adapt to the market and  improve their manufacturing technology and quality so as to  raise their competence on the world market.    The auto industry, as one of the backbone industries in  China, has registered high growth in recent years. In 1993,  China produced 1.31 million autos, an increase of 20 percent  over 1992.    Statistics show that China had 8 million Chinese-built autos  by the end of 1993, 16 percent higher than the 1992 figure.     "

Following a meeting last Wednesday evening, Finance  Minister Muhammad al-Razzaz told me that he is in the service of  the ""exporters,"" because export has become a national strategy  and a priority in the development plan.    The finance minister said that finance policy has been  greatly concerned with promoting exports, making efforts to  remove all barriers facing exporters, and eliminating or  reducing burdens on exports. The Finance Ministry is remedying  any problem impeding exports. The pertinent agencies, such as  Customs and Sales Tax, now go to production sites at exporters'  requests to effect customs procedures regarding exports. Also,  warehouse construction is being expanded in new urban areas to  simplify and facilitate measures, especially those concerning  exports.    Recently, two resolutions were issued to overcome obstacles  and relieve exporters. The first resolution was made following  complaints regarding delays in exporters' receipt of rebates of  customs and sales tax paid on exported goods which have been  exported. Under this resolution, exporters will recover the  customs and sales tax they pay on Egyptian exports through an  immediate rebate system. This system dispenses with long waits  and the requirement to submit documents. A committee has been  formed in the Customs Agency to determine the customs and  general sales tax that must be returned under this system. The  committee is comprised of representatives of the Customs Agency,  Sales Tax Agency, and the Industrial Supervisory Agency, and a  member of the Federation of Industries appointed by the chairman  of the board of the Federation of Egyptian Industries.    This committee will have a technical secretariat. The  secretariat will receive requests and data from brand-name  manufacturers who import production materials, produce products  on production lines, and export these national products under  the drawback system. The technical secretariat will study these  requests and present them to a committee formed to determine the  value of the customs and sales tax to be returned to each  national producer who exports under this system. The taxes are  then returned based on the export customs previously authorized  by the committee. Exporters will thus not have to submit  documents for each shipment separately.    The second resolution concerns reducing the burden of  guaranties that must be provided for goods cleared to enter  Egypt or be transported from one place to another under special  regulations--which are the ""temporary permission,"" ""transit,""  ""warehouses,"" and ""temporary clearance (except for passenger  vehicles)"" regulations. The following guaranties can be provided  in lieu of payment of customs and general sales tax:     -  Monetary security or bank guarantee.    -  Pledges of governmental ministries and agencies, and public  authorities.    -  A guaranty document, equal in value to the taxes due, issued  to  the credit of, and callable by, the Customs Agency and the Sales  Tax Agency.       Under the ""temporary permission regulation,"" payment of  taxes  due can also be guaranteed by a declaration guaranteed by not  more than 80 percent of the net worth of a firm's assets and  subsidiaries according to its most recent authorized balance.    All of these measures are designed to reduce the burdens on  exporters and thus enable them to stand up to foreign  competition policies.    These facilities are not limited to exporters. The customs  committees can implement procedures at production and loading  sites based on the exporter's request. The commodity will be  exported directly from the relevant customs house--without the  repetition of customs measures with respect to it. This will be  done in conjunction with the establishment of a centralized,  specialized administration for temporary permission and  drawback, and the shortening of procedures to recover fees,  taking into account that exported commodities are not subject to  the sales tax.

The EOC report actually draws particular attention to the success of a number of Tecs, notably Tyneside, Birmingham, North West Wales and Hertfordshire, in attracting skilled women back into the workforce. This is the kind of programme that we would like to see all Tecs taking up. What unfortunately is still continuous is the stereotyping of occupations and, in consequence, of training opportunities, which holds women back from taking up careers in areas non-traditional for their sex. It is in this context that the phrase 'not one jot of difference' was reported. Segregation of jobs by sex is deep-rooted and to counteract it will take a great deal of political will and effort.

Slovakia needs the help of foreign investors because it  lacks sufficient resources of its own to revive the economy,  Moravcik said after meeting with the mission, headed by OPIC  Vice President Christopher Finn and made up of 25 business  leaders.    U.S. investment in Slovakia remains low, said Moravcik,  noting that the government would like individual countries to  have adequate shares. He added that Slovakia was mainly  interested in investment in the manufacturing sector. U.S.  investors have expressed interest mainly in the energy industry,  production of goods important for environmental protection, and  tourism, Moravcik noted.    Moravcik said Slovakia offered good conditions for  investment, though some changes to the legal system are needed,  as is the creation of a stable political situation. OPIC is an  independent U.S. Government agency focused on supporting  economic growth in countries with developing market economies by  stimulating private U.S. investment activities.     "

General Dynamics, which has been shrinking through asset sales to cope with huge overcapacity in the US defence industry, reported earnings of Dollars 57m, or Dollars 1.80 a share, from continuing operations. These are against Dollars 36m, or 82 cents in the same period last year. Sales totalled Dollars 793m, down from Dollars 852m. The latest quarter was boosted by a non-recurring gain of Dollars 9m, or 28 cents, from the recognition of previously-deferred gains from asset sales. The per-share earnings figure was helped by the company's repurchase last July of some 30 per cent of its stock. The nuclear submarines business increased the earnings rates for 688 class and Trident vessels, while the armoured vehicles business lifted income due to productivity increases and expanded production for foreign markets. Businesses which General Dynamics classifies as discontinued, but not yet sold, earned Dollars 4m, compared with Dollars 50m a year ago, when the figures included Dollars 44m from businesses sold in the past year. For the six months the company reported earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 98m, up from Dollars 66m. Northrop, meanwhile, reported second-quarter income of Dollars 53m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, compared with Dollars 51m, or Dollars 1.08 a share. Sales totalled Dollars 1.31bn, down 9 per cent on the same period of 1992. The company attributed the increase in net income primarily to improved operating profits in its aircraft business and a lower loss in missiles and unmanned vehicles. Figures in the second quarter last year were depressed by a Dollars 9m loss provision.   Companies:-  General Dynamics Corp.     Northrop Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Personal monitoring studies have confirmed the role of the workplace as an important microenvironment of ETS exposure to nonsmokers. Spengler et al. [Ex. 4288] and Sexton et al. [Ex. 4280] demonstrated by personal monitoring of respirable suspended particulates (RSP) and the use of time-activity questionnaires that exposures to ETS both at home and at work are significant contributors to personal RSP exposures. Coultas et al. [Ex. 466], in a pilot study of 15 nonsmokers in Albuquerque, New Mexico, collected questionnaires and samples of saliva and urine to determine workplace ETS exposure. Personal air samples were obtained pre- and post-workshift. Exposure to ETS was reported by 13 of the 15 subjects. The mean number of hours of exposure was 3.4 (    #    2.1). Basically, although the levels of cotinine, respirable particles, and nicotine varied with self-reports of ETS exposure, the general trend was a direct relationship between increasing incidence of self-reporting of exposure and actual biomarker data. Coghlin, Hammond, and Gann [Ex. 461] found similar results for 53 nonsmoking volunteers studied by use of personal nicotine monitors, diaries, and questionnaires. They also found that the closer a nonsmoker was to a smoker, the higher the probability that the nonsmoker would report exposure.    Presently, vapor phase nicotine and respirable suspended particulate matter (ETSRSP) are the most commonly used markers for ETS because of their ease of measurement, knowledge of their emission rate from tobacco combustion, and their relationship to other ETS contaminants [Ex. 4311]. Controlled experiments have shown that vapor phase nicotine varies with the source strength, and shows little variation among brands of cigarettes. Field studies have also shown that vapor phase nicotine concentrations are correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked, and further that weekly average nicotine concentrations are correlated with ETS-RSP [Ex. 4311].

A few examples illustrating the impact of ETS on nicotine and RSP concentrations in workplace and domestic microenvironments are shown in Tables III10 and III11. Studies of RSP in public access buildings by Leaderer et al.

Leaderer and Hammond [Ex. 4189] measured weekly average vapor phase nicotine and RSP concentrations in 96 residences. Vapor phase nicotine measurements were found to be closely related to number of cigarettes smoked and highly predictive of RSP generated by tobacco combustion. The mean RSP background in the absence of measurable nicotine was found to be 15.2    #    7 g/m3. The mean RSP value in the presence of nicotine was 44.1    #    30 g/m3. The weekly mean nicotine concentration in the 47 residences with detectable nicotine values was 2.17 g/m3 (Table III10).    Summary statistics of additional studies on personal monitoring for nicotine are shown in Table III11 [Ex. 4263]. These studies show that the median exposures ranged from 5 to 20 g/m3.    Summary nicotine data analyzed by the U.S. EPA [Ex. 4311] suggest that average nicotine values in residences where smoking is occurring will average 2 to approximately 10 g/m3, with peak values of 0.1 to 14 g/m3 as shown in Table III10. Offices with smoking occupants show a range of average nicotine concentrations similar to that of residences, but with considerably higher peak values. RSP mass concentrations in smoker-occupied residences show average increases of from 18 to 95 g/m3, with individual increases as high as 560 g/m3 or as low as 5 g/m3. ETSRSP concentrations in offices with smoking occupants on average appear to be about the same as in residences. Restaurants, transportation, and other indoor spaces with smoking occupants have a generally wider range of increases in particle mass concentrations due to ETS than residential or office environments [Ex. 4311].    In summary, field data show that RSP is elevated by one to two orders of magnitude during smoking, and that nicotine released during smoking is easily detectable in both homes and workplaces by area or personal monitors.

The profits, which translate into earnings per share of 12 cents against three cents a year ago, were struck on revenues of Dollars 153m, up from Dollars 129m in the same quarter of 1992. Higher product sales, royalty income and contract revenues contributed to the 19 per cent increase in turnover. Mr Kirk Raab, president and chief executive, said that while the results were very good, it was 'even more important' that the company had filed for approval to market Pulmozyme, a new cystic fibrosis drug, in the US, Europe and Canada. Pulmozyme is claimed to reduce the rate of respiratory infection and improve lung functioning in patients. Mr Raab noted that as recently as five years ago the drug was merely a 'scientific idea'. In line with Genentech's heavy investment in research and development, first-quarter RD expenses were Dollars 74.2m, up from Dollars 66m in the first quarter of 1992. The RD spending represented 48 per cent of total revenues in the quarter. Sales of Protropin, a human growth hormone, increased by 8 per cent to Dollars 52.2m. Sales of Activase t-PA, a heart attack drug, were 11 per cent higher at Dollars 49.2m. Genentech also said it had begun Phase II trials of a genetically-engineered treatment drug for patients infected with the HIV virus. On Wall Street, where biotechnology stocks have suffered along with other drugs stocks amid concern about the Clinton administration's plans for healthcare reform, Genentech's share price declined by Dollars  1/2 yesterday to Dollars 33 5/8 before the close.

Pakistan has been pampered by the  uncalled-for statements based on half-truth by President Clinton  and other officials of the USA. Suffering from innate sense of  political insecurity pretending to rule with the help of ISI  [Inter Service Intelligence], Ms. Bhutto seems to have lost all  [word indistinct] bearing and composure. [sentence as heard]  She is suffering from the illusion that she can annex Kashmir,  it being a Muslim-majority border state, or by championing the  cause of Muslims in Kashmir she can seek leadership of the  Islamic world. She has not only forgotten that millions of  people in her own country are deprived of fundamental freedom  and basic human rights, but also that she is losing support all  over the world by deporting terrorism to India and other  neighboring countries.    To expose Pakistan's false propaganda against India on human  rights violation, India as of late allowed nongovernmental  organizations, individuals, and envoys of various countries to  see for themselves the condition in J and K. This has helped  India in enhancing its credibility at the international forums.  Innocent people are being butchered by Pakistan-trained  extremists in the valley. Thousands of foreign mercenaries,  especially Afghans, are attacking Indian security forces before  mingling with masses at crowded places to avoid retaliation.  And if in retaliation any civilian is killed in cross-fire,  Indian forces are blamed for violating human rights.    Delhi-based ambassadors and high commissioners of 10 Western  and Islamic countries visited J and K last week and met leaders  of Hurriet Conference at the residence of their leader, Mirwaiz  Umar Farooq, who was there with their leaders like Maulvi  Ansari, Qazi Abdullah, Professor Ghani and Javed Ahmad. The  envoy's team also met among others acting president of the JKLF  [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]; human rights commission  officials; and [Kashmir] Governor, General, retired, K.V.  Krishna Rao. These diplomats from Bulgaria, Hungary, Nigeria,  Senegal, Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and  Canada have met people holding all shades of opinion and have  realized the role played by Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. The  reaction proves the success of the center's federal government's  new policy to open up Kashmir and invite the envoys to visit it.    The separatists would not have to adjust [as heard] to the  fact that the other side of the story would also get  international exposure. Only last month, ambassadors of  Belgium, Greece and Germany had visited Kashmir to assess the  situation for themselves. India has also invited the member  countries of the ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] to send  their envoys to the state. It has permitted the International  Committee of the Red Cross to send a team to the state and is  currently negotiating with Amnesty International too which is  keen in visiting the valley. Earlier, U.S. secretary of state  [title as heard], Ms. Robin [Raphel], had paid a visit on her  own to the valley. The misunderstanding and falsehood spread by  the Pakistani lobby is gradually being cleared up and there is  now a greater appreciation of the Indian position that it is the  victim of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.    On the basis of Vienna Declaration, the UN Human Rights  Commission on 4 March adopted a resolution condemning terrorism  and calling upon the international community to fight the menace  at the national, regional, and international levels. It also  expressed concern at the gross violation of human rights by  terrorist groups by saying that it cannot be justified under any  circumstances. It is a big blow to Pakistan which is spreading  fundamentalism in various countries.    In Kashmir, Pakistan has tried to create religious cleavages  and divide. It has resulted in the ethnic cleansing and  large-scale displacement of people. Efforts are being made to  change the demographic profile of the Kashmir Valley. Coming to  Pakistan's own record of human rights, the latest reports of  Asia Watch and Human Rights Commission of Pakistan are  eye-openers as they have accused the Pakistani Government of  severe abuse of human rights of minorities and women in  particular.

It plans a dividend increase to SKr9 from SKr8.50 despite the earnings decline. It also expects demand is likely to remain slack this year, with a possible further fall in profits if the recession deepens. Sales fell 4 per cent to SKr17.5bn as orders dropped 5 per cent. All divisions experienced weaker earnings. The cemented carbide group, the company's biggest unit, saw earnings slip by 25 per cent to SKr1.18bn. Earnings for the steel division tumbled by 42 per cent to SKr279m, while the saws and tools unit posted a SKr16bn loss against a profit of SKr91m in 1990. The Process systems division had the smallest earnings decline, with a 16 per cent drop to SKr166m. Sandvik said it would eliminate 1,000 jobs this year from its labour force of more than 26,000, and has reserved funds in its 1991 accounts for this restructuring measure. Kemira, the Finnish state-owned chemical group, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of FM522m (Dollars 116m) for 1991, against a profit of FM139m in 1990. It blamed weak demand for titanium dioxides and fertilisers, two of its main product areas. The price of fertiliser also fell in Europe last year due to growing imports from eastern Europe. Sales fell 5 per cent to FM10.8bn. Profitability was also harmed by rationalisation measures, including the closure of facilities in Finland, Sweden, the UK and Belgium. However, Kemira expects results to show a recovery this year.  The Financial Times   London Page 46  "

Profits after financial items fell to SKr893m from SKr1.12bn in the same 1991 period, disappointing stock market expectations. The B shares fell Skr4 to close at SKr169. Sales were virtually static at SKr9.55bn (Dollars 1.3bn), although on a pro-forma basis they rose 10 per cent. Income from ongoing operations fell 4 per cent to SKr963m from SKr1.01bn. The group said a 20 per cent fall in Swedish tobacco sales in the first quarter was a significant reason for the downturn - the result of hoarding prior to an increase in tobacco tax at the end of last year. It saw an increase in one-off costs to SKr83m from SKr3m, largely because of an early settlement of a lease. It incurred a SKr150m deficit from its share of losses in the Sara Travel and Hotel group, in which it holds 46.4 per cent. On the plus side, the group benefited from currency gains totalling SKr180m. The weaker Swedish currency had a particularly positive impact on Kabi Pharmacia, which increased sales by 16 per cent to SKr3.95bn from SKr3.40bn and lifted lifted operating income to SKr779m from SKr746m. Sales growth was particularly marked in the UK and Spain, although prices were generally under heavy pressure. Last week, Kabi finalised a deal to buy the Italian pharmaceutical group Erbamont in a deal worth up to Dollars 1.3bn. Procordia's second-biggest unit, United Brands, lifed sales by 47 per cent to SKr1.96bn from SKr1.33bn, but operating income slumped 43 per cent to SKr118m from SKr207m. The fall came in spite of the inclusion of Swedish Match, which the group acquired last August, and reflected the drop in income from tobacco.   Companies:-  Procordia.

The sector had its third consecutive year of sales decline in real terms last year. Sales rose 0.7 per cent to Pounds 17.3bn - but fell 1.2 per cent in real terms. The effects of weak demand have been exacerbated by rising costs, widespread discounting and overcapacity. Verdict estimates that clothing sales space has grown by 25 per cent since 1982 but says many big retailers, such as Burton Group, Next and Sears, have reduced their outlets. Sales of specialist retailers fell faster than the market average last year, with mail-order companies and market stalls reversing the trend of and recovering market share. Even Marks and Spencer, by far the biggest clothing retailer, lost market share last year. Its 15.4 per cent share was 0.1 percentage points lower than in the previous year. The report says, however, Marks and Spencer has been better able to defend its margins because of its low cost-base, buying power and refusal to indulge in widespread discounting. The report suggests it is no coincidence that three of the strongest-performing clothing retailers - Littlewoods, CA, and River Island  -are all private companies, which have similarly been able to adopt longer-term trading strategies during the current downturn.

Now the city has formed labor export relations with a dozen  countries and regions, and every year the city sends about 1,000  people to work abroad.    Most of the workers will be engaged in housing construction,  machine operation, clothes-making, crop-raising and livestock  farming.    In 1980 when the Shantou Overseas Labor Service Company  started its labor export service, its business was limited to  countries and regions in southeast and central Asia.    Now its business has expanded to some countries in Europe,  America and Africa.    Experts noted that the people of Shantou have a tradition of  working abroad. With the rise of Shantou's fame in labor  exports, more and more people from Shantou will participate in  the labor export service.

Deliveries of the bottom-of-the-range C-Class model had exceeded expectations by reaching almost 200,000 since the launch last summer, he said. Total turnover at Mercedes, which is the vehicles arm of the Daimler-Benz group, rose 28 per cent to DM16.1bn (Dollars 9.4bn) in the period, with passenger vehicles contributing DM9.5bn of this. Sales for the full year were likely to rise 7 per cent to exceed DM69bn, and the company was now confident of returning a positive result for 1994. Losses in 1993 totalled DM1.2bn, Mr Werner said. Saying that Mercedes' performance was running counter to the continuing down-trend in the rest of the car industry, Mr Werner said even the loss-making commercial vehicles business was gaining market share in some sectors. Car registrations in Germany had risen 41 per cent to 67,300 in the three months ended March, pushing up market share 2.2 points to 8.2 per cent. Full-year registrations were expected to top 200,000. Elsewhere in western Europe numbers rose 46 per cent to 45,000 vehicles. Japan and the US both showed increases of more than 30 per cent, he added. Mr Werner said factory capacity utilisation had been stepped up to 70 per cent from 65 per cent last year, and boasted that the gap between Mercedes' and Japanese manufacturers' productivity was closing rapidly. Meanwhile, the truck, van and bus business was still 'somewhat strained' by large numbers of relatively new vehicles taken off the road and mothballed by their owners during the recession. Foreign heavy truck operations, notably Freightliner in the US and Mercedes do Brasil, increased output 17 per cent to 26,500 units.   Companies:-  Mercedes-Benz.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's chairman, said the strong quarter demonstrated the effectiveness of the company's restructuring. Net income amounted to Dollars 151m, or 82 cents a share, compared with Dollars 111m, or 64 cents, for the same period last year. Sales rose to Dollars 3.3bn, from Dollars 3.1bn a year ago. Operating income rose to Dollars 363m, from Dollars 273m. As expected, Tenneco yesterday also said it had agreed to purchase German automotive components maker Heinrich Gillet for Dollars 113m in a deal that will close by the year-end. The company's Packaging Corporation of America, boosted by rising prices for its containerboard output, saw operating income jump 24 per cent, to Dollars 63m, from Dollars 51m last year. Sales improved to Dollars 562m, from Dollars 513m. For the first nine months of the year, Tenneco had net income of Dollars 376m, or Dollars 2.04 a share, on sales of Dollars 10bn, compared with Dollars 256m, or Dollars 1.55, on sales of Dollars 9.8bn last year. Tenneco's JI Case farm and construction equipment subsidiary saw third-quarter operating income jump to Dollars 73m, from last year's Dollars 5m. Tenneco sold 29 per cent of its stake in Case in a public offering in June. Case, which reported earnings separately yesterday, said its third-quarter net income was Dollars 29m, or 39 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 1bn. Pro-forma comparative figures for the same 1993 quarter were Dollars 28m, or 38 cents, on sales of Dollars 841m. For the first nine months of the year, Case had net income of Dollars 119m, or Dollars 1.23 a share, on sales of Dollars 3.2bn, up sharply from last year's Dollars 18m, or 19 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.9bn.

But its core steel operations remained mired in red ink. LTV's income was Dollars 138.6m, or 95 cents a share, compared with Dollars 13.4m, or 5 cents, in the same period of last year. However, this was due to a Dollars 150m net gain on the sale of its AM General vehicle manufacturing business; without this it would have lost Dollars 11.4m. Sales totalled Dollars 1.53bn, down from Dollars 1.56bn. The company said the results mainly reflected lower quarter-to-quarter steel selling prices and a decline in aerospace and defence operating income due to the AM sale, partly offset by higher missiles division sales and a higher volume of steel shipments. The steel division had an operating loss of Dollars 28.4m, against Dollars 23.4m in the same period of last year. Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 947m and shipments were 8 per cent ahead at 1.88m tons. The company said the loss was due to lower selling prices and higher employment costs, mainly from a new union contract. The group's aerospace and defence business reported income of Dollars 22.4m, down from Dollars 37.4m, while energy products lost Dollars 2.9m, up from Dollars 2.5m. For the six months LTV reported net income of Dollars 95.3m, or 62 cents a share, against a net loss of Dollars 32.9m, or 39 cents, while sales dipped from Dollars 2.99bn to Dollars 2.92bn.

Although the U.S. side was concerned about the  transparency of our country's formula for calculating profits  generated by the monopoly, as well as a restructuring of the  monopoly system, it did not demand specific readjustments. The  two sides will continue discussions in future rounds of talks.    Vice Economic Minister Hsu Ko-sheng indicated: The U.S. side  believes that the lack of transparency regarding our country's  formula for calculating profits generated by the monopoly has  resulted in unfair competition for U.S. manufacturers. We  stressed, however, that the calculation of profits generated by  the monopoly is not opaque because it is subject to supervision.  Also, our side revealed that the plan for readjusting the  monopoly system would be finalized by the end of June 1995. In  principle, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau's  management rights will revert to the central government, and the  collection of profits generated by the monopoly also will come  under the taxation system.    Also, we will introduce adjustments in accordance with  GATT-specified principles. Vice Minister Hsu said:    [Begin Hsu recording] Our future restructuring means that we  will no longer adopt the so-called monopoly profit calculating  method but rather will bring the collection of profits generated  by the monopoly under the taxation system. This means we will  collect import and excise taxes and take other measures as  necessary. Under our future reversion to the taxation system,  we will definitely comply with GATT's so-called principle  governing the transparency of national income. [end recording]     "

Wings (1.25pm) is a 1927 silent, famous for its aerial photography. Richard Arlen and Charles Rogers play young men who join the US Army Air Corps during the first world war, and there is the added attraction of Clara Bow as an ambulance driver. This was the first winner of an Oscar for Best Picture. Animal Crackers, part of C4's Marx Brothers season, their second film, was made only three years later, yet it seems to inhabit a different world. This is the one where Groucho plays Captain Spaulding and tells Margaret Dumont 'You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, which doesn't say much for you.' (12.45 am). Conductor Claudio Abbado told television director Christopher Swann: 'I would like you to make a film of my Peter And The Wolf recording using those Spitting Image puppets.' So Swann did. Thirty puppets, many life size, were created by Roger Law, and the voices are provided by Roy Hudd, who plays Prokofiev, and the members of Theatre de Complicite (4.25pm BBC2). That is followed by the new plasticene animation film The Wrong Trousers, 'starring' Wallace and Gromit, the creations of animator Nick Park (5.20pm). That in turn is followed by Porgy And Bess (5.50pm), a three-hour recording of Trevor Nunn's highly-praised 1986 Glyndebourne production.

It was helped by rapid sales growth at Wartsila Diesel, its diesel engine division. Sales at the unit were ahead by 98 per cent at FM2.8bn, pushing up group sales to FM5.52bn, a 48 per cent increase over the previous year's figure of FM3.74bn. The weaker value of the markka, heavily devalued following its flotation last autumn, contributed, but Metra said it had benefited from a surge in worldwide demand, especially for its power plants. Metra said it held more than 20 per cent of the world market for power plants over 1MW. Demand was strongest in Asia Pacific. Metra said penetration of the Chinese market was paying off. Almost one-third of Wartsila's FM3.5bn order book was accounted for by China. Metra said sales in its Sanitec household ceramics business were up by one-third to FM1.24bn. The third core division, the locks and security device maker Abloy, increased sales by 28 per cent to FM849m. Metra said it expected similar profits growth to continue in the rest of the year. Amer, the Finnish consumer group which includes Wilson Sporting Goods in the US, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of FM41m in the six months to the end of August, up sharply from FM25m the previous year. Sales were ahead, by 13 per cent, to FM3.76bn. But Amer said the figures were flattered by the lower value of the Finnish markka following its effective devaluation last autumn. Some 68 per cent of the company's sales are outside Finland, with North America making up 46 per cent. Excluding exchange rate factors, sales were down 5 per cent.

The result was scored on a 4.7 per cent rise in operating revenues, at Dollars 59.1bn. In the fourth quarter alone, Philip Morris posted after-tax earnings of Dollars 1.2bn. This compared with Dollars 767m last time, but the previous year's figure was depressed by a Dollars 455m charge to cover restructuring in the food division. Operating revenue in the final quarter rose from Dollars 13.7bn in 1991 to Dollars 14.9bn last year - an 8.9 per cent improvement. Philip Morris's earnings per share last year stood at Dollars 5.45, up by 20 per cent over the 1991 (again, before accounting-related charges). The company had already signalled that it expected a rise of one-fifth in earnings per share, and the shares edged ahead only Dollars  1/8 on the news to Dollars 73 5/8 before the close. Mr Michael Miles, Philip Morris's chairman, said the group was 'optimistic' about prospects for 1993. He based this view on 'our growth and productivity initiatives, increasing volume momentum, and a narrowing of price gaps in a number of our key categories'. Philip Morris surprised the stock market at the time of its third-quarter results when it revealed that US cigarette shipments, in volume terms, had fallen slightly, and were expected to dip further in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, it said that cigarette volume for the full-year was down by 0.5 per cent, mainly due the previously-announced stock adjustments in domestic shipments and lower level of Russian exports.

Stripping out one-time gains of 1 cent a share in the 1992 quarter and 4 cents a share a year earlier, Corning said its earnings per share rose 4 per cent in the latest quarter. Sales grew 20 per cent in the three months, to Dollars 1.15bn from Dollars 963.5m. For the first nine months, Corning earned Dollars 257.2m, or Dollars 1.36, against Dollars 231.2m, or Dollars 1.24 last year. Sales advanced to Dollars 2.87bn from Dollars 2.43bn. Mr James Houghton, chairman, said earnings from consolidated operations showed strong growth in the quarter. The modest earnings performance, in spite of strong sales growth, was blamed on a Dollars 15m decline in earnings from Corning's equity companies, particularly Dow Corning. Equity income from Dow Corning, the 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning which was once the leading US manufacturer of silicone breast implants, dropped Dollars 12m in the quarter. Although Dow Corning did not take any charges linked to its now defunct silicone breast implant operations, the joint venture yesterday reported a 60 per cent drop in third quarter net income. For the latest quarter, Dow Corning's net income was Dollars 16.4m, against Dollars 40.5m, on sales of Dollars 500.6m against Dollars 458.7m. About half of the profits fall was blamed on losses in financial transactions linked to the recent upheaval in European financial markets. Weak operating results accounted for the rest of the earnings decline.  The Financial Times   London Page 29  "

The after-tax deficit amounted to Dollars 15m, compared with a small Dollars 5m profit in the first quarter of 1991. For 1991 overall, RJR made a net profit of Dollars 368m. The company's operating income, struck after amortisation charges of Dollars 152m (Dollars 153m) but before interest costs, totalled Dollars 664m, against Dollars 647m a year earlier. Net sales overall were 5 per cent higher at Dollars 3.64bn. Tobacco sales rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn, driven by the international business. Excluding the effects of a significant Russian order in 1991, overseas sales would have been up by 10 per cent, with volumes increasing by 8 per cent  - principally in the Middle East and Asia. In the domestic market, there was 'a slight volume increase'. The results benefited from price increases but this was more than offset by higher marketing expenditures. The total 'business unit contribution' - before amortisation  - was Dollars 651m, against Dollars 648m. Net sales of food products were just 2 per cent higher at Dollars 1.54bn, and the business unit contribution increased from Dollars 171m to Dollars 189m. In contrast to the flat operating performance, RJR Nabisco's interest costs fell sharply because of relentless financial restructuring. Cash interest payments fell from Dollars 307m to Dollars 250m, while non-cash interest charges were Dollars 126m, compared with Dollars 294m.  The Financial Times   London Page 31  "

The announcement followed a dramatic recovery of popularity by the ruling Labor government, which leads the conservatives by about 12 points in the polls, compared to a deficit of 12 points in October. Mr John Hewson, the conservative leader, acknowledged that he had been unable to win widespread public support for the opposition's Fightback manifesto, launched in November last year. The revised version retains original proposals for a goods and services tax (GST), tariff cuts, labour market deregulation and cuts in public spending to balance the budget. However, the opposition has responded to criticism by church and welfare groups by exempting basic foods and child-care from the GST, dropping plans to cut unemployment benefits, raising family allowances, and deferring cuts to job creation programmes. The revised package also includes cuts in personal income taxes, ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.3bn) for public spending on infrastructure projects, and a streamlined depreciation regime - swiftly welcomed by business organisations. The increased spending would be financed by bringing forward the privatisation of Australia and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Modest as this is for what we get back (employment, sales of equipment, benefits of scientific research, etc), it has, since 1964, come out of our overseas aid budget, which Baroness Chalker is naturally reluctant to cut. But Unesco is not primarily an aid agency; its field of activity encompasses science, education, environment, culture and communications. If the office of public service and science and the education, environment and national heritage departments were to share the load with the Overseas Development Administration, each would be required to pay only Pounds 2.13m a year and would be getting an excellent bargain. And Britain would once again be in a position to influence international policy on matters of great concern.

Interviews with 1,210 foreign visitors to London last summer found that only 1 per cent were worried about their personal safety in the city. This contrasts strongly with research carried out last year which indicated that a large number of UK residents regarded London as a dangerous city to visit. The research by Lunn Poly, the travel agents' chain, found that more than 70 per cent of UK residents surveyed thought it was more dangerous to visit London than travel abroad. Litter, another common complaint by Londoners and UK visitors, was mentioned as a problem by only 2 per cent in the authority's survey. More than 40 per cent of the foreign visitors said they had experienced no problems, but of the 57 per cent who had problems, 15 per cent thought London was expensive. Asked what they saw as London's attractions, 69 per cent mentioned the city's heritage. Overseas Visitors to London Survey Summer 1993.

Xu Qing, deputy secretary of the  Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and director of the  State Council Office for Checking Unhealthy Tendencies in  Business Activities, pointed out: The work of correcting the  irregularity of spending public funds on sightseeing tours  abroad has a good momentum, but the task remains very arduous.  All localities and departments should take a further step to  formulate measures, improve and strictly enforce rules and  regulations, perpetuate the correction results, prevent a  comeback, and strive for remarkable new interim achievements  this year.    State Councillor Li Guixian and Hou Zongbin, deputy  secretary  of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, attended  the forum and expressed their views on the matter. Others  present at the meeting included Li Shizhong, State Council  deputy secretary-general; Xia Daosheng, State Council Foreign  Affairs Office deputy director; and responsible persons of the  Foreign Ministry, the Public Security Ministry, and nine other  departments which have the authority to approve overseas travel  requests, as well as the responsible persons of the departments  of which more personnel are involved in overseas travel on  official business.    Xu Qing said in his speech: Generally speaking, all  localities and departments, attaching importance to this matter,  have worked in accordance with the central authorities'  instructions and seriously reexamined those overseas travels  which were actually sightseeing trips in disguised form made by  officials at government expense since 1 July 1992. Some  provinces and municipalities have sternly dealt with problems  discovered through the reexamination. At the same time, they  have stopped and canceled a number of unnecessary overseas  official business study tours and training activities. However,  the progress of the work is uneven. Other localities and  departments are not as serious and meticulous in reexamining  overseas travels, nor are they sternly dealing with discovered  problems. In some organizations and localities, the practice of  making overseas sightseeing trips in disguised form at  government expense remains unchanged. Some localities and  organizations are still organizing government-funded  inter-regional or inter-departmental overseas sightseeing tours.    Xu Qing put forward a three-point view on this year's work:    -- It is necessary to continue doing a good job in screening  the overseas travels which were actually sightseeing trips in  disguised form made by officials at government expense since 1  July 1992, and to stop the unhealthy tendency of making such  trips. No locality nor department is permitted to organize  government-funded overseas sightseeing tours under any pretext.  Anyone who makes an overseas sightseeing trip in disguised form  at government expense should be required to pay the ""three  expenses [san fei 0005 6316]"" and be dealt with seriously. To  deal with the travel regulations violators, we must not merely  warn them not to repeat the violation.    -- To stop the unauthorized overseas sightseeing trips, we  should take both stopgap and radical measures this year. The  stress of the work should be put on stopping unhealthy  tendencies, enforcing discipline, and preventing a comeback.  First, we should get at the root of the problem. In  particular, the central government organs should proceed from  strictly formulating official business overseas travel plan and  examine official travel requests in a responsible way. Second,  we should closely watch the applications for travel to popular  destinations and resolutely reduce excessive overseas travels.  Third, we should stop any government-funded overseas travels  processed through the tourism department and improve the control  of overseas training activities by the proper departments.  Fourth, it is necessary to improve rules and regulations and the  procedures for examining and approving overseas travel  applications.    -- It is necessary to step up supervision and inspection,  and  to accept the supervision by the masses. Any organizations or  individuals who violate the travel regulations should be placed  on file for investigation and sternly dealt with.    The responsible persons of the State Science and Technology  Commission, the National Tourism Administration, and the State  Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs delivered reports at the  meeting on their efforts to correct the irregularity of overseas  sightseeing tours at government expense.

The pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 5.07m to Pounds 7.81m during the six months to September 25 on turnover up 13 per cent at Pounds 55.1m (Pounds 48.6m). Sales in Japan, where the group set up marketing operations in July 1991 and now employs 35 people, grew strongly and accounted for 10 per cent of the first-half total, against 6 per cent last time. Earnings per share increased to 10.4p (6.6p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 1.7p (1.5p). The shares rose 20p to 329p. Mr Peter Williams, chairman, said the outcome reflected 'a continuation of the steady improvement in trading conditions in most of our markets. New orders have increased consistently over the last 18 months suggesting that a soundly based recovery may be in prospect.' Operating profits in the seasonally weaker first half more than doubled to Pounds 4.02m (Pounds 1.9m) as margins expanded from 4 per cent to 7.3 per cent. Mr Williams noted that the analytical systems businesses were now making a material contribution alongside continuing strong performances from operations in its core technology of superconductivity - Research Instruments, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Instruments and Superconducting Technology. 'In the second half we expect this trend to continue,' he said, 'and in the operations most affected by recession - Plasm Technology and Medical Systems - there are also encouraging signs of recovery'. Income from the 49 per cent stake in Oxford Magnetic Technology, the magnetic resonance imaging joint venture with Siemens, increased to Pounds 3.43m (Pounds 2.81m). Despite funding additional working capital requirements, the group ended the period with net cash of Pounds 14.3m, compared with Pounds 7.85m at March.   Companies:-  Oxford Instruments.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. at an  estimated cost of more than $300 million has been at least temporarily dropped  after five months of testing in several cities, company officials said Tuesday.  Most smokers apparently did not like Premier's taste or smell.    ""Very simply, it did not perform as we hoped it would in the test market,"" said  David Fishel, senior vice president of public relations at R. J. Reynolds, a  subsidiary of RJR Nabisco. That test market was limited mostly to the cities of  Phoenix, Tucson, Ariz., and St. Louis.    However, the Winston-Salem, N.

""All we're doing is discontinuing the test market,""  Fishel said. ""We may reintroduce it, or something like it, at another time.""    The Premier cigarette was designed to reduce smoke released into the air and  appease the anti-smoking movement. But the product had the opposite effect,  with health groups objecting to what they saw as an effort to make smoking more  acceptable without addressing health concerns.    ""Not only did the cigarette pose possible serious dangers to smokers, but to  nonsmokers as well,"" said John F. Banzhaf, executive director of the  Washington-based consumer group, Action on Smoking & Health. ""After all, it  did not have any smoke, which is the one warning that ordinary cigarettes give  to nonsmokers.""      Concern About Ads    The American Medical Assn. expressed delight at RJR's move.

""If they hadn't pulled it off the market, there would have been a regulatory  brouhaha,"" said Dave Stewart, professor of marketing at USC. Stewart recently  consulted with Federal Trade Commission officials who were concerned that  advertisements that positioned Premier as a cigarette with a ""cleaner smoke""  were misleading.    Meanwhile, RJR -- which makes the Winston, Salem and Camel brands -- said it  will continue to test-market two other unusual cigarettes that were introduced  to a few cities in recent weeks. One, which is rolled in special paper and  appears to emit less smoke than most other brands, is called Vantage Excel. The  other, Chelsea, is said to have somewhat of a vanilla taste.    For RJR Nabisco, which earlier this month was acquired by the New York  investment firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for a record $25 billion,  the move to drop Premier is viewed by some analysts as a setback. Just five  months ago, RJR officials openly discussed spending more than $1 billion to  roll out the brand nationally.    ""Most analysts were expecting this,"" said Sarah A. Sheckler, vice president at  the Chicago investment firm Duff & Phelps Inc. ""I'm a smoker. I tried it.  And like most other people, I didn't like the taste, either.""    Certainly RJR is not the first major company to face a setback with a new  product line. In fact, marketing executives say that fewer than one in seven  new products are successful. Coca-Cola was forced to put Classic Coke back on  the shelves alongside its new formula after a consumer backlash. Even Procter  & Gamble's relatively new orange juice line, Citrus Hill, has not met the  company's expectations.    Some industry analysts even credit RJR for jumping out far ahead of the  competition in its testing of new cigarette products. ""It was a very bold  experiment but it didn't work,"" said Lawrence Adelman, senior vice president at  the New York investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ""Their failure could  dissuade others from making it.""    ""If RJR had been successful with Premier,"" said USC marketing professor  Stewart, ""every manufacturer would have soon come out with a smokeless  cigarette. This means it's back to the drawing boards for all of them.""      Plenty to Say    But a spokesman for RJR's chief rival, Philip Morris, denied that his company  was preparing to market a smokeless cigarette. What is more, he declined to  comment on the Premier brand. ""Our policy is not to comment on RJR or anything  that the competition does,"" spokesman Steve Weiss said.

In fact, Crow says that he will soon be shipping back thousands of dollars  worth of Premier cigarettes to RJR.

The Malaysians do not know that the UK has specific guidelines and rules which govern our Overseas Development Administration budget, and that the question of whether these monies should have been used for Pergau is what has caused so much upset. If Sir Tim Lankester, as head of the ODA, advised Baroness Chalker, minister for overseas development, not to fund a dam which he said would not be of benefit to the poor and would be an abuse of ODA funds, then it was , in my opinion, time to refer the project to the Department of Trade and Industry and allow the tiny, frozen Pounds 1.8bn aid budget to be used more for the use of uplifting the poorest people in the poorest countries. If we untie aid and trade, then there will be no more Pergau dams from a small department which can then get on more effectively with its genuine raison d'etre.

However, the group lifted first-quarter net income to Dollars 245.2m, from Dollars 216m in the 1991 quarter. Earnings per share increased Dollars 1.18, compared with Dollars 1.06. Revenues were Dollars 3.83bn, compared with Dollars 3.86bn. Mr William Alley, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Each of our five core businesses, as well as our specialty businesses group, reported higher operating income in the quarter and an increase in operating margin. 'These results were achieved despite continued weak world economies, higher taxes on tobacco and distilled spirits and the stronger US dollar,' Mr Alley added. American Brands said profits from tobacco, its largest core business, were slightly ahead of year-earlier levels, in spite of a stronger dollar and an increase in UK cigarette taxes. The company's American Tobacco unit posted record revenues and operating income, up 9 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively. Total cigarette unit sales rose 2.6 per cent, including exports, while domestic cigarette sales rose 0.5 per cent. The Franklin Life Insurance unit posted a 26 per cent increase in operating income as a result of higher realised gains on investments. Operating income in distilled spirits rose 41 per cent, reflecting the acquisition by Jim Beam Brands of seven brands from Seagram.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "

Sales at the Tokyo-based company fell 2.1 per cent to Y266.1bn, led by a 5.3 per cent decline in sales of electronic materials and components to Y182.7bn. TDK said that overseas demand from the automobile and computer industries was strong. However, sales had been hit by declining demand from manufacturers of audio and video equipment. The company said it had successfully increased sales to the computer industry of products such as semiconductors and magnetic heads for hard disc drives, metal magnets, and chip capacitors. TDK also managed to increase sales of magnetic recording media, such as tapes and floppy disks, by 5.7 per cent to Y83.38bn. Sales outside Japan grew by 1.8 per cent to Y139,977 in spite of the rise in the value of the yen, accounting for 52.6 per cent of sales. Net earnings fell by 23.9 per cent to Y10.1bn. On a parent company basis, TDK's results were much worse, with pre-tax profits down by 47.6 per cent to Y11.4bn. The weaker parent company figures reflect the softness of domestic Japanese demand, as well as a decline in exports to Europe following the start-up of operations at TDK's magnetic recording media factory in Luxembourg in October last year. TDK said it had given up hope for a recovery in the second half of the year.

The US pharmacy drugs market has recovered strongly, rising 7 per cent during the first six months, compared with growth of only 3 per cent during the same period last year. Sales increased from Dollars 22.7bn (Pounds 14.6bn) to Dollars 24.3bn, according to IMS International, specialist market research company. Pharmacy sales in Japan rose from Dollars 9.4bn to Dollars 10.4bn, but rose only 1 per cent in yen terms. The sector has been hit by government-inspired price cuts introduced in April. In Europe's seven largest markets, drugs sales slipped from Dollars 23bn during the first six months last year to Dollars 22.2bn in the same period this year. The figures, however, were distorted by currency devaluations and fluctuations. In local currency terms, sales increased 2 per cent compared with a growth rate of 10 per cent during the first half of 1992 and 1 per cent in the 1993 period. The German market continued to recover from last year's steep falls. Sales rose 6 per cent compared with an 11 per cent fall during the same six months last year. All therapeutic categories registered growth, apart from asthma products, which fell 1 per cent. All other European markets registered decelerating growth or even falls in sales. The Italian market fell 7 per cent, following last year's drop of 2 per cent. The French market was static after growth last year of 7 per cent. The UK remained Europe's fastest growing market, up 8 per cent, though this was less than last year's 13 per cent growth. The Spanish market also decelerated, growing at 3 per cent compared with 11 per cent. Sales in the Netherlands rose 5 per cent, (13 per cent). and those in Belgium 4 per cent (6 per cent).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD PHARMACY DRUG PURCHASES, JANUARY-JUNE 1994 (in US Dollars m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      N America     Japan*    Germany    France   Italy  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular           4,228     1,619       1,543     1,487     866 Alimentary/Metabolism    4,238     2,005       1,136     1,010     670 Central Nervous System   4,355       525         683       691     353 Anti-infectives          2,512     1,343         403       673     470 Respiratory              2,713       793         681       463     241 Musculo-Skeletal         1,141     1,005         347       263     204 Blood Agents             1,160       852         249       365     215 Others                   3,939     2,243       1,363     1,006     704 Total                   24,286    10,385       6,405     5,958   3,723 % Change**                   7         1           6         0      -7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             UK     Spain    Netherlands   Belgium  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiovascular             446       380            154       157 Alimentary/Metabolism      520       312            185       124 Central Nervous System     356       217             98       124 Anti-infectives            188       243             50        91 Respiratory                406       200            115        76 Musculo-Skeletal           176       103             37        44 Blood Agents                43       109             35        32 Others                     510       348            146       134 Total                    2,645     1,912            820       782 % Change**                   8         3              5         4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-hospital market only   **Increase excluding currencies Source: IMS International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Pre-tax profit, excluding the restructuring charges, was up 4.3 per cent to Pounds 660.3m. Both the tobacco and luxury goods divisions showed improved operating profits, in spite of what the group describes as difficult markets. Mr Johann Rupert made no comment on the outlook. However, the directors are recommending a 4.5 per cent rise in dividends, to Pounds 6.15 per unit of shares and participation certificates. Mr Rupert said the group aimed to maintain a steady growth in dividends, above the rate of inflation. 'We look at our cashflows and the condition of our underlying businesses when we make the decision,' he said. Although tobacco sales volume was down 8 per cent, sales value rose 3 per cent to Pounds 2.49bn, thanks to currency effects. Tobacco operating profit was up 3.3 per cent at Pounds 424.2m. Jewellery, pen and leather goods sales improved, but watch sales were flat. Among associates, contributions from the US catalogue shopping business soared 69 per cent, to Pounds 11m. However, losses on the FilmNet satellite broadcasting service deepened to Pounds 25.7m from Pounds 7.3m. Mr Rupert recalled that three years ago he predicted a five-year turnround for this business. Of the restructuring charges, some Pounds 75.1m came from costs and capital gains taxes arising from various changes in shareholdings of the tobacco and luxury goods interests last summer. A further Pounds 123.8m in tobacco production rationalisation costs were announced by Rothmans last week. The portion of the restructuring costs attributable to Richemont was Pounds 87.1m.

During the first quarter, the total  retail volume of consumer goods amounted to 352.24 billion yuan,  up 25.2 percent from last year's corresponding period. After  being adjusted for price increases, the sale volume rose 5  percent in real terms, thus maintaining the strong momentum of  steady growth.    Consumer markets in our country are well stocked this year.  According to a breakdown of consumer goods based on an analysis  of supply and demand by relevant departments, supply and demand  are basically balanced for 58.7 percent of the 726 major  commodities, whereas the supply of 29.7 percent of the  commodities outstrips demand. Sales of various brand-name,  special, and new products have increased sharply. In the food  category, brand-name foods and beverages, as well as fresh fruit  and aquatic products, have enjoyed extremely brisk sales. Among  clothing and accessories, brisk sales of cashmere and fur  clothing, underwear, and leather shoes have continued unabated.  Among daily necessities, the sale volume of home electrical  appliances has increased 30 percent or more in some areas when  compared to last year's corresponding year. Sales of cameras,  videocassette recorders, and some small home electrical  appliances have consistently been strong.    As urban and rural markets go, last year's vast disparity  between consumer markets in urban and rural areas has begun to  narrow as consumer markets in rural markets have grown more  rapidly. Increases in peasants' incomes have somewhat improved  purchasing power. During the first quarter, the retail sales  volume of consumer goods at or below the county level totaled  142.5 billion yuan, up 22.3 percent from last year's  corresponding period. The retail sales volume of consumer goods  in the cities was 209.8 billion yuan, up 27.3 percent from last  year's same period. Hainan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and  Tianjin are among the regions which posted increases of 30  percent or more in their total retail sales volumes of consumer  goods.     "

The tobacco products business continued the largest single contributor and escaped the impact of recent sharp tax increases at retail. The Canada Trustco financial services subsidiary, on a consolidated basis, was second-largest contributor but was affected by the recession and larger loan loss provisions. Overall, first-quarter profit was CDollars 51.9m (USDollars 44.7m), down 22 per cent from CDollars 66.6m a year earlier, equal to 38 cents a share, against 50 cents. Revenues were CDollars 1.1bn, up 1 per cent. Hardees Food Systems made a negative contribution because of difficult fast-food markets in the US, but improvement is expected with aggressive marketing and cuts in overhead. The Canadian drug store business did better despite the recession. Imperial Tobacco is expected to gain cigarette market share in Canada beyond the present 60.2 per cent, offsetting the impact of retail tax increases. Imasco expects a slow second quarter, but results should pick up with the North American economy in the second half this year. St Laurence Cement, controlled by the Swiss Holderbank Group, had a first-quarter loss of CDollars 13.2m, or 32 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 961,000, or 2 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 58.6m against CDollars 105m. BP Canada had a first-quarter loss of CDollars 6.2m against a profit of CDollars 6m, or 12 cents a share, a year ago, on revenues of CDollars 73.5m against CDollars 92m.

0," LA022689-0108   23644    February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 2; Metro Desk      2715 words      IMPORTED GUNS: JUST WHAT IS A SPORTS WEAPON?      By JOHN HURST, Times Staff Writer      Hundreds of thousands of foreign military-style assault weapons are being  imported into the United States despite a federal law that prohibits the  importation of any firearm that is not for ""sporting purposes.""    The 1968 Gun Control Act makes it illegal to import any firearm unless it is  ""generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to  sporting purposes. . . .""    The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms uses that law to ban cheap  foreign-made handguns and some other firearms, but Israeli Uzis, Chinese AK-47s  and other foreign-made assault weapons are pouring into the country with the  approval of federal authorities.      Ban Held Possible    ""I don't think the law is being properly applied,"" said Rep. Howard L. Berman  (D-Panorama City), who has introduced legislation to ban the possession, sale,  manufacture and importation of assault weapons. ""These are not weapons that can  be reasonably construed as having legitimate sporting functions. And I think  the existing law could easily be applied to ban the (importation of) civilian  versions of the Uzis and AK-47s. . . .""    Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), author of a similar bill on the state  level, said that after learning of the federal importation law he is drafting a  state resolution to ask the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to  re-evaluate its policy of allowing Uzis and AK-47s into the country.    Both the Uzi and the AK-47 -- semiautomatic versions of fully automatic  military rifles -- are increasingly used by drug dealers and youth gangs on the  streets of Los Angeles and other American cities, according to law enforcement  officials.    The weapons have been used routinely in street crimes that often get little  attention outside the areas in which they occur, law enforcement officers say.  But the firearms have also been used in widely reported mass murders.    An Uzi was among the weapons used in San Ysidro on July 18, 1984, by a deranged  gunmen who killed 21 people and wounded 15 others at a McDonald's restaurant.  And a Chinese AK-47 was used in the Jan. 17 attack in a Stockton schoolyard  that left five children dead and 30 wounded in a matter of minutes.      Popular Chinese Model    More than 88,000 AK-47s, most of them from China, were imported into the United  States from January, 1985, through November, 1988, according to federal data.  About 75,000 Uzi carbines have been imported from Israel since 1980, according  to Action Arms Ltd. of Philadelphia, sole U.S. importer of the weapon.    Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms officials say their policy of allowing  importation of Uzis and AK-47s as sporting weapons is based on a decision made  20 years ago by the Treasury Department firearms evaluation panel, which held  meetings during a two-month period in December, 1968, and January, 1969, and  then disbanded.    The bureau, in a written response to questions from The Times, said the federal  firearms panel did not examine Uzis or AK-47s, but determined that several  civilian models of other military weapons made in foreign countries ""had a  particular use in target shooting and hunting.""    ""It was recommended that these types of semiautomatic versions of . . .  military rifles be approved for importation,"" the bureau statement said. The  bureau said that years later it used that evaluation in deciding to permit  importation of Uzis and AK-47s as sporting weapons.      'Saturday Night Specials'    But a former member of the federal firearms panel told The Times that the  six-member body paid scant attention to the importing of foreign rifles and  concentrated instead on handguns in an attempt to screen out cheap ""Saturday  night specials.""    Harold E. Johnson, a former Army weapons expert and now a private firearms  consultant, said the federal panel looked briefly at four semiautomatic  versions of foreign military rifles to make sure that they were not readily  convertible from semiautomatic to fully automatic fire.    (A fully automatic weapon, also called a machine gun, fires a steady stream of  bullets with a single pull of the trigger. A semiautomatic weapon fires one  bullet for each pull of the trigger.)    The panel did not try to determine whether the rifles were suitable for  sporting purposes, said Johnson, but the particular weapons examined ""were  basically (suitable as) target rifles and relatively expensive. . . . There was  a lot of interest (in these rifles) in match shooting and a lot of collector  interest. But they were never used in crimes that I know of because they were  too big and expensive.""      Less Expensive Types    As for the smaller, less expensive imports such as the Uzi and AK-47, Johnson  said: ""Nobody had ever thought about those. They weren't imported back in those  days.""    The question of what constitutes the sporting purposes of a firearm has become  a central issue in the increasingly heated debates over proposed federal, state  and local legislation to outlaw assault weapons. Opponents of the firearms say  they are instruments of death, specifically designed to kill human beings.  Their defenders say they are not only collectors' items and guns that are  useful for self-defense, but also are suitable for sporting purposes.    What are the sporting purposes of a firearm?    The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said a weapon must be suitable for  hunting or target shooting to be a sporting firearm and therefore importable.  Target shooting, said the bureau, does not include what is called ""plinking"" --  shooting at tin cans.    In the case of handguns, the bureau uses objective criteria developed by the  Treasury Department firearms evaluation panel to determine whether the weapons  are importable. The criteria, meant to prohibit importation of cheap handguns,  include such features as barrel length, weight, caliber, safety mechanisms and  construction.      Lack of Criteria    But for rifles and shotguns, few such objective importation criteria exist.    To be importable for civilian use, a rifle -- like other weapons -- cannot be  capable of automatic fire. Neither can it be readily convertible to fully  automatic fire -- a judgment that is somewhat less objective.    Finally, there are the highly subjective hunting and target shooting questions.    In 1986, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms denied importation of a  South African riot shotgun called the Striker 12, maintaining that the weapon  had little hunting or target shooting value.    The bureau was unimpressed with the applicant's argument that ""combat shotguns  are importable because they have sporting use, such as bowling pin shooting  competitions.""    The effect of the importation ban, however, was short-lived. A copy of the  Striker 12 was soon produced domestically by an Atlanta company that called it  the Street Sweeper. It is advertised to the American public as having ""awesome  firepower, 12 rounds in less than three seconds.""      From Favored Nations    But neither the Uzi nor the AK-47 has been forced to undergo such a domestic  reincarnation. In the case of the Chinese-made AK-47, domestic production would  almost certainly cause an increase in price due to the higher cost of American  labor. The prices of both weapons are held down somewhat because both China and  Israel enjoy ""most favored nation"" status as trading partners of the United  States and pay low import fees.    Defenders of assault weapons argue that some of the firearms, such as the  American-made AR-15 and M1A, are popular and effective target rifles.    But are the Uzi and the AK-47 suitable for target or hunting purposes?    First, the Uzi.    The most popular model of the Uzi, made by Israel Military Industries, is the  carbine. It is a civilian copy of the submachine gun named after Uziel Gal, who  began development of the weapon for the Israeli armed forces in 1949.    The civilian version, like the military model, is a compact black rifle with a  folding stock that allows it to be fired from the hip as well as the shoulder.  With the stock folded, the import-model carbine is only 24.4 inches long, and  the ease of concealment causes concern among law enforcement officials. The  weapon holds magazines containing up to 32 rounds of 9-millimeter ammunition.      Controlled in Israel    Although Americans in most states can buy the Uzi carbine across the counter,  it is not available to most civilians in Israel, where strict gun control laws  are in effect, according to Ilan Mor, spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in  Los Angeles. He said an exception is made for residents of settlements under  threat of terrorism, who may be issued weapons.    The Uzi carbine -- which sells for $500 to $700 -- was first introduced into  the United States for the civilian market in 1980 after several models were  rejected by federal authorities as too easily convertible to fully automatic  fire.    While the weapon finally approved for importation is not easily converted into  a fully automatic rifle, independent entrepreneurs have put a conversion kit on  the American market with which to do so.    ""Anybody with any mechanical ability should (be able) to do it in an hour,""  said a federal weapons expert, who asked not to be identified.    Such fully automatic Uzis subsequently began turning up in the hands of  criminals, but many of the conversion kits, which have been deemed illegal,  have been confiscated and the supply seems to be drying up, said the federal  weapons expert.      Collector Customers    C. B. Stern, operations manager for Action Arms, importer of the Uzi, said that  two-thirds of the customers who answer a company questionnaire said they bought  the weapons as collectors' items.    ""The other third,"" he said, ""is everything between home protection, plinking,  target shooting, self-defense . . . survival -- some people think Armageddon is  around the corner and they want to be ready.""    As for target shooting -- one of the sporting criteria for importation -- the  Uzi, with its 9-millimeter pistol ammunition and short 16.1-inch barrel,  doesn't have the range or accuracy for rifle competition, gun experts say.    The public education division of the National Rifle Assn. indicates that Uzis  are not used in the national championship large-bore rifle competitions,  co-sponsored by the NRA. Neither is the weapon suitable for any kind of serious  hunting, gun experts say.    Ammunition magazines for the Uzi, which contain 20 to 32 bullets, are illegal  under the hunting regulations of some states that limit the amount of  ammunition a rifle may hold.      Not for Killing Animals    Jerry Upholt, executive director of the California Wildlife Federation and the  California Sportsman Lobby, said the Uzi does not have the range for hunting  game.    ""I'm not aware of anybody that uses an . . . Uzi to go hunting,"" he said.    As head of the Sportsman Lobby, Upholt opposes abolition of assault rifles. He  said that rather than being a hunting weapon, the Uzi is ""more suitable for  protection of the home and for recreation. . . . A lot of people like to go out  in the country and set up cans. . . . People love to plink with it.""    The real appeal of the Uzi carbine to the non-criminal buyer, say many gun  experts, is its aura as an Israeli commando weapon.    ""These are real fantasy toys (for) cabbage patch commandoes,"" said a federal  gun expert who asked not to be identified.    Ray Holt, general manager of B & B Sales, a popular gun store in North  Hollywood, said of the weapon:    ""The Uzi is designed to break in the door and kill everybody.""      Enter the AK-47    The Chinese AK-47 arrived on the American scene in 1984, four years later than  the Uzi, but it seems to have overtaken the Israeli weapon in popularity,  probably because many models are cheaper -- selling for less than $300 -- and  because the AK-47 is much more powerful.    The AK-47 was developed as a fully automatic submachine gun by Mikhail  Kalashnikov for Soviet troops shortly after World War II and subsequently was  adopted by the armed forces of other Communist Bloc countries.    There is inescapable irony in the importation into the United States of the  civilian version of the weapon. Twenty years before an AK-47 was used by a  crazed gunman to kill Asian-American schoolchildren in Stockton, the military  version of the weapon was used by North Vietnamese troops to kill American  soldiers in Southeast Asia.    The AK-47 is being exported by a poor Third World communist country to a  wealthy capitalist nation, where it is used with increasing frequency by black  gang members to kill other impoverished blacks on the streets. While the weapon  is readily available in U.S. cities, strict gun-control regulations in China  prohibit ordinary citizens in urban areas from possessing AK-47s, or anything  comparable.      Holds 30-Round Clips    The AK-47 comes equipped with three banana clips, each holding 30 rounds. Drum  magazines holding up to 100 rounds are also available. A bayonet is frequently  included. Some models have folding stocks that make them more easily  concealable.    The main importers of the AK-47 are China Sports Inc. of Santa Fe Springs and  Keng's Firearm Specialty Inc. of Riverdale, Ga.    The annual Complete Book of Assault Rifles magazine said in its 1989 issue that  a dozen special ""National Match AK-47s,"" equipped with 20.9-inch barrels and  accurate enough for target competition, have been imported from China.    But the standard AK-47 with its short 16.3-inch barrel and 7.62x39-millimeter  ammunition does not have the range or the accuracy to satisfy most serious  competitive shooters.    None of the competitors in last year's national championship large-bore rifle  competition, co-sponsored by the National Rifle Assn., used an AK-47, according  to the NRA's public education division.    ""Most of the people who buy the guns use them to plink with,"" said Steve  Langford, marketing director of China Sports. ""It is a gun that can be fun to  shoot.""      Overkill for Game    Langford said the AK-47 is also used to hunt small- and medium-size game. But  the AK-47, while powerful enough to rip through one side of a car and out the  other in a drive-by shooting, is considered a marginal hunting weapon because  of its lack of range and accuracy.    Some hunting enthusiasts give the AK-47 a lukewarm endorsement.    Upholt of the California Wildlife Federation said he does not know anyone who  uses an AK-47 for hunting, although he noted that it is only slightly less  powerful than the lever-action 30-30, which is used for hunting deer at  relatively close range.    ""It could be used for that purpose,"" said Upholt, who then expressed the view  of most hunters: ""I prefer a bolt action.""    Wayne Klein, a chief game warden in Northern California with the state  Department of Fish and Game, said his officers have not encountered AK-47s in  the field, but he has received reports of hunters with such weapons buying deer  hunting licenses.    ""They acquired a gun and want to go deer hunting, but they're not deer  hunters,"" Klein said. ""It's a trendy type of thing. Most deer hunters have  their favorite guns that they've been using a long time, not some Russian thing  that shows up.""      Regulation Problems    As with the Uzi, the AK-47 also encounters the problem of regulations in some  states, other than California, that limit the number of bullets that can be  held in a hunter's rifle. Hunting magazines that hold five rounds may be  ordered for AK-47s, but are not standard equipment, gun dealers say.    Beyond the practical and legal questions, there is a philosophical issue in  using an AK-47 with a 30-round banana clip to hunt deer.    ""It flies in the face of tradition as far as I'm concerned,"" said Lanny  Clavecilla, information officer with the California Department of Fish and  Game.    ""A tenet of deer hunting,"" he explained, ""is to cleanly take the animal with  one shot.""    Times staff writers Rich Roberts and David Holley contributed to this story.

By JOHN HURST, Times Staff Writer      Hundreds of thousands of foreign military-style assault weapons are being  imported into the United States despite a federal law that prohibits the  importation of any firearm that is not for ""sporting purposes.""    The 1968 Gun Control Act makes it illegal to import any firearm unless it is  ""generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to  sporting purposes. . . .""    The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms uses that law to ban cheap  foreign-made handguns and some other firearms, but Israeli Uzis, Chinese AK-47s  and other foreign-made assault weapons are pouring into the country with the  approval of federal authorities.      Ban Held Possible    ""I don't think the law is being properly applied,"" said Rep. Howard L. Berman  (D-Panorama City), who has introduced legislation to ban the possession, sale,  manufacture and importation of assault weapons. ""These are not weapons that can  be reasonably construed as having legitimate sporting functions. And I think  the existing law could easily be applied to ban the (importation of) civilian  versions of the Uzis and AK-47s. . . .""    Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), author of a similar bill on the state  level, said that after learning of the federal importation law he is drafting a  state resolution to ask the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to  re-evaluate its policy of allowing Uzis and AK-47s into the country.    Both the Uzi and the AK-47 -- semiautomatic versions of fully automatic  military rifles -- are increasingly used by drug dealers and youth gangs on the  streets of Los Angeles and other American cities, according to law enforcement  officials.    The weapons have been used routinely in street crimes that often get little  attention outside the areas in which they occur, law enforcement officers say.  But the firearms have also been used in widely reported mass murders.    An Uzi was among the weapons used in San Ysidro on July 18, 1984, by a deranged  gunmen who killed 21 people and wounded 15 others at a McDonald's restaurant.  And a Chinese AK-47 was used in the Jan. 17 attack in a Stockton schoolyard  that left five children dead and 30 wounded in a matter of minutes.      Popular Chinese Model    More than 88,000 AK-47s, most of them from China, were imported into the United  States from January, 1985, through November, 1988, according to federal data.  About 75,000 Uzi carbines have been imported from Israel since 1980, according  to Action Arms Ltd. of Philadelphia, sole U.S. importer of the weapon.    Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms officials say their policy of allowing  importation of Uzis and AK-47s as sporting weapons is based on a decision made  20 years ago by the Treasury Department firearms evaluation panel, which held  meetings during a two-month period in December, 1968, and January, 1969, and  then disbanded.    The bureau, in a written response to questions from The Times, said the federal  firearms panel did not examine Uzis or AK-47s, but determined that several  civilian models of other military weapons made in foreign countries ""had a  particular use in target shooting and hunting.""    ""It was recommended that these types of semiautomatic versions of . . .  military rifles be approved for importation,"" the bureau statement said. The  bureau said that years later it used that evaluation in deciding to permit  importation of Uzis and AK-47s as sporting weapons.      'Saturday Night Specials'    But a former member of the federal firearms panel told The Times that the  six-member body paid scant attention to the importing of foreign rifles and  concentrated instead on handguns in an attempt to screen out cheap ""Saturday  night specials.""    Harold E. Johnson, a former Army weapons expert and now a private firearms  consultant, said the federal panel looked briefly at four semiautomatic  versions of foreign military rifles to make sure that they were not readily  convertible from semiautomatic to fully automatic fire.    (A fully automatic weapon, also called a machine gun, fires a steady stream of  bullets with a single pull of the trigger. A semiautomatic weapon fires one  bullet for each pull of the trigger.)    The panel did not try to determine whether the rifles were suitable for  sporting purposes, said Johnson, but the particular weapons examined ""were  basically (suitable as) target rifles and relatively expensive. . . . There was  a lot of interest (in these rifles) in match shooting and a lot of collector  interest. But they were never used in crimes that I know of because they were  too big and expensive.""      Less Expensive Types    As for the smaller, less expensive imports such as the Uzi and AK-47, Johnson  said: ""Nobody had ever thought about those. They weren't imported back in those  days.""    The question of what constitutes the sporting purposes of a firearm has become  a central issue in the increasingly heated debates over proposed federal, state  and local legislation to outlaw assault weapons. Opponents of the firearms say  they are instruments of death, specifically designed to kill human beings.  Their defenders say they are not only collectors' items and guns that are  useful for self-defense, but also are suitable for sporting purposes.    What are the sporting purposes of a firearm?    The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said a weapon must be suitable for  hunting or target shooting to be a sporting firearm and therefore importable.  Target shooting, said the bureau, does not include what is called ""plinking"" --  shooting at tin cans.    In the case of handguns, the bureau uses objective criteria developed by the  Treasury Department firearms evaluation panel to determine whether the weapons  are importable. The criteria, meant to prohibit importation of cheap handguns,  include such features as barrel length, weight, caliber, safety mechanisms and  construction.      Lack of Criteria    But for rifles and shotguns, few such objective importation criteria exist.    To be importable for civilian use, a rifle -- like other weapons -- cannot be  capable of automatic fire. Neither can it be readily convertible to fully  automatic fire -- a judgment that is somewhat less objective.    Finally, there are the highly subjective hunting and target shooting questions.    In 1986, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms denied importation of a  South African riot shotgun called the Striker 12, maintaining that the weapon  had little hunting or target shooting value.    The bureau was unimpressed with the applicant's argument that ""combat shotguns  are importable because they have sporting use, such as bowling pin shooting  competitions.""    The effect of the importation ban, however, was short-lived. A copy of the  Striker 12 was soon produced domestically by an Atlanta company that called it  the Street Sweeper. It is advertised to the American public as having ""awesome  firepower, 12 rounds in less than three seconds.""      From Favored Nations    But neither the Uzi nor the AK-47 has been forced to undergo such a domestic  reincarnation. In the case of the Chinese-made AK-47, domestic production would  almost certainly cause an increase in price due to the higher cost of American  labor. The prices of both weapons are held down somewhat because both China and  Israel enjoy ""most favored nation"" status as trading partners of the United  States and pay low import fees.    Defenders of assault weapons argue that some of the firearms, such as the  American-made AR-15 and M1A, are popular and effective target rifles.    But are the Uzi and the AK-47 suitable for target or hunting purposes?    First, the Uzi.    The most popular model of the Uzi, made by Israel Military Industries, is the  carbine. It is a civilian copy of the submachine gun named after Uziel Gal, who  began development of the weapon for the Israeli armed forces in 1949.    The civilian version, like the military model, is a compact black rifle with a  folding stock that allows it to be fired from the hip as well as the shoulder.  With the stock folded, the import-model carbine is only 24.4 inches long, and  the ease of concealment causes concern among law enforcement officials. The  weapon holds magazines containing up to 32 rounds of 9-millimeter ammunition.      Controlled in Israel    Although Americans in most states can buy the Uzi carbine across the counter,  it is not available to most civilians in Israel, where strict gun control laws  are in effect, according to Ilan Mor, spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in  Los Angeles. He said an exception is made for residents of settlements under  threat of terrorism, who may be issued weapons.    The Uzi carbine -- which sells for $500 to $700 -- was first introduced into  the United States for the civilian market in 1980 after several models were  rejected by federal authorities as too easily convertible to fully automatic  fire.    While the weapon finally approved for importation is not easily converted into  a fully automatic rifle, independent entrepreneurs have put a conversion kit on  the American market with which to do so.    ""Anybody with any mechanical ability should (be able) to do it in an hour,""  said a federal weapons expert, who asked not to be identified.    Such fully automatic Uzis subsequently began turning up in the hands of  criminals, but many of the conversion kits, which have been deemed illegal,  have been confiscated and the supply seems to be drying up, said the federal  weapons expert.      Collector Customers    C. B. Stern, operations manager for Action Arms, importer of the Uzi, said that  two-thirds of the customers who answer a company questionnaire said they bought  the weapons as collectors' items.    ""The other third,"" he said, ""is everything between home protection, plinking,  target shooting, self-defense . . . survival -- some people think Armageddon is  around the corner and they want to be ready.""    As for target shooting -- one of the sporting criteria for importation -- the  Uzi, with its 9-millimeter pistol ammunition and short 16.1-inch barrel,  doesn't have the range or accuracy for rifle competition, gun experts say.    The public education division of the National Rifle Assn. indicates that Uzis  are not used in the national championship large-bore rifle competitions,  co-sponsored by the NRA. Neither is the weapon suitable for any kind of serious  hunting, gun experts say.    Ammunition magazines for the Uzi, which contain 20 to 32 bullets, are illegal  under the hunting regulations of some states that limit the amount of  ammunition a rifle may hold.      Not for Killing Animals    Jerry Upholt, executive director of the California Wildlife Federation and the  California Sportsman Lobby, said the Uzi does not have the range for hunting  game.    ""I'm not aware of anybody that uses an . . . Uzi to go hunting,"" he said.    As head of the Sportsman Lobby, Upholt opposes abolition of assault rifles. He  said that rather than being a hunting weapon, the Uzi is ""more suitable for  protection of the home and for recreation. . . . A lot of people like to go out  in the country and set up cans. . . . People love to plink with it.""    The real appeal of the Uzi carbine to the non-criminal buyer, say many gun  experts, is its aura as an Israeli commando weapon.    ""These are real fantasy toys (for) cabbage patch commandoes,"" said a federal  gun expert who asked not to be identified.    Ray Holt, general manager of B & B Sales, a popular gun store in North  Hollywood, said of the weapon:    ""The Uzi is designed to break in the door and kill everybody.""      Enter the AK-47    The Chinese AK-47 arrived on the American scene in 1984, four years later than  the Uzi, but it seems to have overtaken the Israeli weapon in popularity,  probably because many models are cheaper -- selling for less than $300 -- and  because the AK-47 is much more powerful.    The AK-47 was developed as a fully automatic submachine gun by Mikhail  Kalashnikov for Soviet troops shortly after World War II and subsequently was  adopted by the armed forces of other Communist Bloc countries.    There is inescapable irony in the importation into the United States of the  civilian version of the weapon. Twenty years before an AK-47 was used by a  crazed gunman to kill Asian-American schoolchildren in Stockton, the military  version of the weapon was used by North Vietnamese troops to kill American  soldiers in Southeast Asia.    The AK-47 is being exported by a poor Third World communist country to a  wealthy capitalist nation, where it is used with increasing frequency by black  gang members to kill other impoverished blacks on the streets. While the weapon  is readily available in U.S. cities, strict gun-control regulations in China  prohibit ordinary citizens in urban areas from possessing AK-47s, or anything  comparable.      Holds 30-Round Clips    The AK-47 comes equipped with three banana clips, each holding 30 rounds. Drum  magazines holding up to 100 rounds are also available. A bayonet is frequently  included. Some models have folding stocks that make them more easily  concealable.    The main importers of the AK-47 are China Sports Inc. of Santa Fe Springs and  Keng's Firearm Specialty Inc. of Riverdale, Ga.    The annual Complete Book of Assault Rifles magazine said in its 1989 issue that  a dozen special ""National Match AK-47s,"" equipped with 20.9-inch barrels and  accurate enough for target competition, have been imported from China.    But the standard AK-47 with its short 16.3-inch barrel and 7.62x39-millimeter  ammunition does not have the range or the accuracy to satisfy most serious  competitive shooters.    None of the competitors in last year's national championship large-bore rifle  competition, co-sponsored by the National Rifle Assn., used an AK-47, according  to the NRA's public education division.    ""Most of the people who buy the guns use them to plink with,"" said Steve  Langford, marketing director of China Sports. ""It is a gun that can be fun to  shoot.""      Overkill for Game    Langford said the AK-47 is also used to hunt small- and medium-size game. But  the AK-47, while powerful enough to rip through one side of a car and out the  other in a drive-by shooting, is considered a marginal hunting weapon because  of its lack of range and accuracy.    Some hunting enthusiasts give the AK-47 a lukewarm endorsement.    Upholt of the California Wildlife Federation said he does not know anyone who  uses an AK-47 for hunting, although he noted that it is only slightly less  powerful than the lever-action 30-30, which is used for hunting deer at  relatively close range.    ""It could be used for that purpose,"" said Upholt, who then expressed the view  of most hunters: ""I prefer a bolt action.""    Wayne Klein, a chief game warden in Northern California with the state  Department of Fish and Game, said his officers have not encountered AK-47s in  the field, but he has received reports of hunters with such weapons buying deer  hunting licenses.    ""They acquired a gun and want to go deer hunting, but they're not deer  hunters,"" Klein said. ""It's a trendy type of thing. Most deer hunters have  their favorite guns that they've been using a long time, not some Russian thing  that shows up.""      Regulation Problems    As with the Uzi, the AK-47 also encounters the problem of regulations in some  states, other than California, that limit the number of bullets that can be  held in a hunter's rifle. Hunting magazines that hold five rounds may be  ordered for AK-47s, but are not standard equipment, gun dealers say.    Beyond the practical and legal questions, there is a philosophical issue in  using an AK-47 with a 30-round banana clip to hunt deer.    ""It flies in the face of tradition as far as I'm concerned,"" said Lanny  Clavecilla, information officer with the California Department of Fish and  Game.    ""A tenet of deer hunting,"" he explained, ""is to cleanly take the animal with  one shot.""    Times staff writers Rich Roberts and David Holley contributed to this story.

Changes in its capital base are the best indication of the insurer's performance - as a mutual, it does not report conventional profit figures. The growth came despite a move by Prudential Securities, the broking arm, to set aside Dollars 430m to cover the costs of settling thousands of claims from investors in limited partnerships sold by the firm in the 1980s. After these charges, Prudential Securities still managed to maintain after-tax earnings at Dollars 145m, down only slightly from Dollars 150m the year before. Mr Robert Winters, Prudential chairman and chief executive, said the results of the securities arm showed that customers had not lost confidence in the broker. Following the widely-publicised limited partnership problems, which continue to dog it, the broking firm has embarked on an extensive advertising campaign to try to rebuild investors' trust. The increase in Prudential's capital base compared with a rise of only Dollars 80m the year before, when the insurer suffered losses from Hurricane Andrew. Among individual insurance lines, the Prudential said sales of property and casualty insurance sales had fallen slightly during the year, to Dollars 441m in new premiums, reflecting efforts to cut its exposure to catastrophe losses. Sales of life insurance and annuities in North America climed to Dollars 2.7bn in annualised premiums, up from Dollars 2.1bn the year before. Sales in the Far East and Europe rose by around a third, though from a far smaller base. Bank of Boston is to acquire privately-held Pioneer Financial, a co-operative bank, for Dollars 118m in cash, Reuter reports from Boston. Bank of Boston said Pioneer Bank, with Dollars 773m in assets and Dollars 720m in deposits, is the largest co-operative bank in Massachusetts. The acquisition is expected to close this autumn.

Mr David Macdonald, chairman, admitted that the results fell short of expectations because of depressed economic conditions in the UK and the US. He attributed the pre-tax gain to continued reduction in bank debt and struck a cautious note for the second half.

Operating profit fell to Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 2.33m) largely due to a Pounds 200,000 loss in the clothing division (Pounds 200,000 profit).

The report says the Treasury lost Pounds 470m in duties and value added tax through cross-channel personal imports of alcoholic drinks, almost double the amount foregone in 1992. Almost 30 per cent of all beer purchases were bought in bulk and brought into the UK by van. Whitbread estimates that this practice has created a bootlegging trade representing Pounds 22m in profit last year. Legal beer imports of 1.25m barrels are equivalent to the total beer sales of 4,500 pubs, or 15.3 per cent of the take-home beer market. Whitbread believes that 60 per cent of cross-channel beer imports substitute for UK pub and club sales and 40 per cent of European purchases substitute for the take-home market. In addition to losses on beer, the purchase of 83.7 litres of wine and spirits by cross-channel shoppers - excluding air travellers - amounted to a retail loss of Pounds 677m. The popular perception that cross-channel shopping is a south-east phenomenon is contradicted by Whitbread's statistics, which show that 45 per cent of cross-channel consumers come from outside London and the south-east. The central region of England accounts for Pounds 200m in retail losses and the Yorkshire and north-east region brought home Pounds 100m worth of beer. On top of retail losses in alcoholic drinks, the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association estimated that cross-channel shopping for duty-paid tobacco cost the Treasury about Pounds 100m in 1993. Last year only 37 per cent of channel passengers bought beer in continental Europe but the industry fears that figure will increase unless the UK reduces its duties on alcohol.

The rise was largely due to timing factors, as the company's Gallagher subsidiary maintained its claimed market share in the UK at 40 per cent. Meanwhile, earnings from US cigarette sales, though continuing a partial recovery from the effects of the price war begun last summer, were 23 per cent lower than a year ago. The company recently reached agreement to sell its American Tobacco subsidiary to BAT Industries for Dollars 1bn. The increase in volumes in the UK of 44 per cent was due to 'distortions caused by a change last year in the timing of the UK government's budget,' said Mr William Alley, chairman and chief executive. Operating income from non-US tobacco sales more than doubled, to Dollars 94m, on sales up 49 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn. American Tobacco, meanwhile, saw operating income slide to Dollars 70m, on sales of Dollars 406m (Dollars 419m a year ago.) Its volume gains of 15 per cent in the quarter were slightly ahead of the industry average, resulting in an increase in market share, the company said. The volume growth was led by low-price brands, which rose 20 per cent, while premium brands rose only 8 per cent. With the benefit of a lower tax rate, down to 31.3 per cent from 36 per cent a year ago, American Brands reported overall net income of Dollars 164m, or 81 cents a share, up from Dollars 151m, or 75 cents, a year ago.

Like Philip Morris, which reported earlier in the week, American Brands benefited from a favourable comparison with a year in which US cigarette makers were badly hit by a bout of price cutting in their domestic market. American Tobacco, the group's cigarette manufacturing operation, contributed operating profits of Dollars 49m compared with a loss of Dollars 35m last time. The prior year's losses included a Dollars 30m restructuring provision. Earlier this year, American Brands agreed to sell American Tobacco to BAT Industries of the UK, for Dollars 1bn, but the sale is undergoing an anti-trust review by the Federal Trade Commission because BAT owns Brown  Williamson, the third biggest US tobacco group. Group revenues rose 11 per cent to Dollars 3.7bn and operating profits rose 39 per cent to Dollars 345.4m. Earnings per share rose to 75 cents from 42 cents helped by a reduction in the tax charge to 42 per cent from 47 per cent. Mr William Alley, chairman and chief executive, said the company had experienced broad gains across most of its operations. Gallaher Tobacco, the UK's biggest cigarette company, increased its contribution by 5 per cent even though last year's third-quarter benefited from trade buying in advance of an August 1993 price increase. Non-tobacco operations increased their contribution to operating profits by 6 per cent to a record Dollars 182.5m.

REYNOLDS, the domestic US tobacco arm of the R. J. R. Nabisco food and cigarettes group, is to match the large price-cuts in full-priced cigarette brands that its big rival, Philip Morris, announced earlier this month. Reynolds said yesterday it would slash the price of its Winston brand by Dollars 4 a carton, or 40 cents a packet. It would also apply 'increased promotional activity' to its Camel brand, although it declined to be more specific. 'Frankly, we'd like to stay light on our feet,' Reynolds said. But the Reynolds cuts will apply to June only, and no other brands will participate. The company said yesterday it would reassess in late June. Winston is one of Reynolds' flagship brands and the one which competes most closely with Philip Morris' Marlboro. Camel is also a non-menthol, full-priced brand, although its total US market share, at around 4.1 per cent last year, was smaller than Winston's, taking close to 7 per cent. Philip Morris' decision to reduce the price of Marlboro, the best-selling US cigarette brand, by 40 cents a packet (from around Dollars 2.10-Dollars 2.20 to Dollars 1.70-Dollars 1.80), sent the cigarette market into turmoil earlier this month. Tobacco stocks plunged on the prospect of a ferocious price-war in one of the most profitable consumer product sectors. Reynolds, which has almost 29 per cent of the US cigarette market, against Philip Morris' 43 per cent, said immediately it intended to remain competitive, but had not previously detailed its response. Philip Morris shares were Dollars  3/8 lower, at Dollars 46 3/4 , compared with almost Dollars 65 ahead of its price-cut announcement.

The shares rose 8p to 372p, reflecting the drugs sector's recently acquired responsiveness to yield considerations. Group turnover was Pounds 1.48bn (Pounds 1.52bn), a figure depressed by the sale of the personal care business, which contributed Pounds 53m in the first quarter of 1993. The pharmaceuticals division was clearly split between sharp rises in sales for newer products and declines for more established drugs. Sales of ulcer treatment Tagamet, whose US patent expires next month, were 3 per cent lower in constant currency terms at Pounds 153m. Sales of antibiotic Augmentin, the company's biggest product, fell by 8 per cent to Pounds 191m. It was hit by measures implemented in January to cut Italy's drugs bill which also affected other SB products. Some of those measures have since been reversed. The best-performer of the newer drugs was anti-depressant Seroxat/Paxil, with sales up sharply to Pounds 77m. New launch Kytril, an anti-emetic for chemotherapy patients, more than doubled sales to Pounds 29m. It is competing directly with one of the stars of Glaxo's portfolio, Zofran. The group's over-the-counter medicines business, which should receive a further boost in the second quarter with the launch of an OTC version of Tagamet, increased sales by 11 per cent to Pounds 150m.

Best Information Available        As stated in the preliminary determination, we have based the duty deposit rate for all exporters other than the three identified above (the ``all others'' rate) on best information available (BIA). One exporter, Abel Industries, indicated that it would not participate in the investigation. Further, given that information has not been presented to the Department to demonstrate otherwise, Abel and all other PRC companies not participating in this investigation are not entitled to separate dumping margins. As such, because Abel decided not to participate in this investigation, we are basing the ``All Others'' rate, which will also apply to Abel, on BIA. This is similar to our use of the BIA-based ``All Others'' rate in other recent antidumping duty investigations.

In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns less adverse margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions for those respondents that did not cooperate in an investigation. As outlined in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium (58 FR 37083, July 9, 1993), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. Here, since at least one PRC exporter failed to respond to our questionnaire, and because we presume all exporters to be centrally controlled absent verified information to the contrary, we are assigning a margin of 126.94 percent (the highest margin in the petition, as recalculated by the Department for methodological inconsistencies at the time of the initiation of this case) as BIA to all exporters other than those responding exporters which have shown their independence from control in common with one or more other exporters of the subject merchandise.        Separate Rates        The three participating exporters, ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng, have each requested a separate rate. ZMEC and ZLIP are companies owned by ``all the people'' and for five of the six months of the POI, Lansheng also was owned by ``all the people.'' In the sixth month, Lansheng was restructured into a share company. To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department employs the criteria developed in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (Sparklers) and amplified in     Silicon Carbide.     Under this analysis, the Department assigns a separate rate only when an exporter can demonstrate the absence of both     de jure     1  and     de facto     2  governmental control over export activities.          1     Evidence supporting, though not requiring, a finding of     de jure     absence of central control includes: (1) An absence of restrictive stipulations associated with an individual exporter's business and export licenses; (2) any legislative enactments decentralizing control of companies; or (3) any other formal measures by the government decentralizing control of companies.           2     The factors considered include: (1) whether the export prices are set by or subject to the approval of a governmental authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements; (3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management; and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding disposition of profits or financing of losses (    see Silicon Carbide    ).

By SHARI ROAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Californians are prepared to accept and pay for a restructuring of the state's  health-care system but fault government leaders for failing to initiate change,  said sponsors of the fourth annual Gallup California Health Care Poll released  Wednesday.    While Californians remain firm in their opposition to health-care rationing and  compromising the quality of care, 73% said they would agree to higher taxes --  an average of $43 per person, per month -- to pay for health care for the poor  and uninsured, the survey found.    Respondents also expressed support for additional taxes on alcohol and taxing  firearms to pay for indigent health care. But government leaders received low  marks for their handling of problems in health-care access and financing.    ""The public is ready to make the hard choices in health care that their elected  leaders are not,"" said pollster George Gallup. ""The public favors concrete ways  to meet the health needs of the poor and to improve the health-care delivery  system, and apparently is willing to foot the bill.""    The telephone poll, an annual event co-sponsored by the California Assn. of  Hospitals and Health Systems and the three Hospital Councils of California,  questioned 1,004 Californians regarding health-care issues and personal-health  habits. The Hospital Council of Southern California represents 84% of hospitals  in the region.    The responses reflected those expressed in a Los Angeles Times Poll conducted  in January, which revealed Americans' willingness to pay higher taxes to expand  health-care coverage and their belief that government should take the lead in  improving the system.    In the Gallup Poll, two-thirds said that poor people with no Medi-Cal coverage  deserve more service. More than half said that government is paying too little  to hospitals for poor people on Medi-Cal.    ""A significant proportion of Californians believe that health care is a right,""  said Robert Nielsen, senior vice president of the Gallup Organization. ""They  were very clear that some form of government ought to take care of it. Eighty  percent of Californians said that government had a responsibility.""    Half said they disapproved of the Legislature's performance on health-care  issues, and 36% said they disapproved of Gov. George Deukmejian's performance,  while 29% said they approved.    ""The major crisis in health care is a crisis in leadership,"" Nielsen said.  ""It's very clear what the general public wants, but it's not very clear who is  going to assume the major burden and carry the political ball and make it  happen.""    As in past years, a majority -- 61% -- opposed health-care rationing while 25%  favored it. Under a rationing plan, services would be prioritized and those  perceived of lowest priority would not be paid for. More than three-quarters  said they would not be willing to accept a lower quality of health care even if  it cost less.    But, along with support for an increase in personal taxes, the poll revealed  high interest in selective tax measures to pay for health care -- especially on  products that are viewed as detrimental to health. The proposed 1990 California  ballot initiative designed to cover some indigent health care costs by taxing  alcohol drew a 79% approval response while 18% opposed it.    Increased traffic violation fines were also supported, although by a lower  margin (57% to 39%). A majority favored a new proposal to tax firearms to pay  for indigent health care (70% to 27%) but opposed sales tax increases (40% to  57%).    More than eight of 10 people favored the controversial proposal drafted by  state health officials for employer-mandated health insurance, with 50% saying  they ""strongly agreed"" that employers should be required to provide basic  health insurance to their employees and another 34% saying they ""agreed.""    ""Business must be alerted to the finding that 84% of the public are saying that  the employers should be the ones responsible for funding health care through  employee benefits,"" said Stephen Gamble, president of the Hospital Council of  Southern California. ""Our health-insurance system in America is based upon  employer-employee contributions to the pool to finance health care.""    Gamble said legislators traditionally have not viewed health care as an  ""election issue."" But he predicted that public opinion will influence  legislators to propose a major restructuring of the state's health-care system  through a 1992 ballot initiative.    ""By then we should have legislation passed to put on the ballot for a  better-organized system for the financing and delivery of health care in  California,"" he said.    The survey also found:    Health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations gained  popularity, with 29% of respondents enrolled in such programs compared to 19%  in 1989.    Pollution was cited most frequently (by 22%) as the state's greatest health  threat, a result that mirrored last year's findings. AIDS was cited as the  major health threat by 19%, and 11% pinpointed the cost of health care.    The majority of women from 35 to 54 indicated that they were on a diet to lose  weight in the last year. One-quarter of males said they dieted.    Two-thirds said they exercised at least three times a week.    More Californians said they had been tested for the AIDS virus -- 24% this year  compared to 18% last year. Non-whites were much more likely to express concern  about contracting the AIDS virus.    Respondents appeared to favor personal control regarding right-to-die  decisions. In response to the question, ""Should terminally ill adults be  allowed to end their own life or not?"" three-quarters of Californians said yes  and one-fifth said no. A majority, 86%, believed that a relative should be  allowed to make a refusal-of-life-support decision.    Acknowledgment of illegal drug use rose from 20% to 21% in 1990. Whites were  more likely to have used illegal drugs than any other racial group (22%)  compared to Latinos (21%), Asians (19%) and blacks (16%). Drug use rose with  educational level.

The college is the chief educational center of traditional  Chinese medicine in China.

Yu Tiecheng, assistant to the president of the college, said  that with more and more people becoming interested in  traditional Chinese medicine, the college will expand its  enrollment of overseas students.    He said that the students to be enlisted into the college  next year will reach 500. Last year there were more than 400  overseas applicants for study at the college. But the shortage  of buildings limited the capacity of the college, which took on  only 70.    The construction project includes 12,000-square-meter  residential buildings and a 5,000-square-meter classroom  building.    Sponsored by the Tianjin Traditional Medical College, the  International College of Traditional Chinese Medicine offers  undergraduate and post-graduate courses of traditional Chinese  medicine, acupuncture and traditional Chinese pharmacy.

EFFECTIVE DATE:     September 26, 1994.          FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Jennifer Stagner, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 4821673.          Final Determination:     We determine that fresh garlic from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated weighted-average margin is shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.       Case History       Since the publication of our affirmative preliminary determination on July 6, 1994 (59 FR 35310, July 11, 1994), no new information has been added to the case record. No interested party has filed case or rebuttal briefs or has requested a hearing.   On July 5, 1994, Global Trading Inc., an interested party in this investigation, alleged that there are methodological errors in the petition data regarding constructed value and U.S. price.       Scope of Investigation       The products covered by this investigation are all grades of garlic, whole or separated into constituent cloves, whether or not peeled, fresh, chilled, frozen, provisionally preserved, or packed in water or other neutral substance, but not prepared or preserved by the addition of other ingredients or heat processing. The differences between grades are based on color, size, sheathing and level of decay.   The subject merchandise is used principally as a food product and for seasoning. The subject garlic is currently classifiable under subheadings 0703.20.0000, 0710.80.7060, 0710.80.9750, 0711.90.6000, and 2005.90.9500 of the     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States     (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.       Period of Investigation       The period of investigation (POI) is August 1, 1993, to January 31, 1994.       Best Information Available       The Department made the following efforts to obtain information from PRC exporters in this investigation: In March 1994, we sent an abbreviated section A questionnaire to the PRC Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and cables to the U.S. Embassies in Beijing and Tokyo and the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong. In April 1994, we sent an abbreviated section A questionnaire to the China Chamber of Commerce of Imports  Exports of Foodstuffs, Native Produce, and Animal By-products (China Chamber); since no response was received, we made follow-up requests to MOFTEC, the U.S. Embassies in Beijing and Tokyo, and the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong.   On May 11 and 12, 1994, the Department received information from MOFTEC and the American Embassy in Beijing, respectively, containing the names and addresses of 40 producers/exporters of the subject merchandise in the PRC. On May 18, 1994, the Department sent 40 antidumping questionnaires to the named firms and to MOFTEC and the China Chamber. On May 31, 1994 and June 21, 1994, we sent questionnaires to two additional firms at their request.   The Department received partial questionnaire responses from only nineteen companies. Of the nineteen companies, five firms stated that they did not export the subject merchandise to the United States. Four firms submitted limited information on the PRC garlic industry. Two firms submitted limited information on their U.S. sales. Eleven firms submitted critical circumstance data, and one firm stated that it could not provide the requested information. No firm submitted factors of production information or complete U.S. sales data, and no verification was conducted. Given the lack of complete, usable questionnaire responses, we determine, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, that the use of best information available (BIA) is appropriate for sales of the subject merchandise in this investigation.   In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology. Under this methodology, the Department normally assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions for those respondents who did not cooperate. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings, Other than Tapered Roller Bearings, and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany (54 FR 18992, May 3, 1994).)   In considering the application of BIA in this case, we have taken into account that, in cases involving the PRC, the Department assigns a single rate to all PRC exporters unless a company establishes that it is entitled to a separate rate. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the People's Republic of China (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994)). In this case, no company has demonstrated that it should receive a separate rate. Consequently, all of the companies must receive a single rate. Given that this single rate includes non-respondent companies, we have followed our standard practice and applied an adverse BIA rate, which is the highest margin alleged in the petition (    i.e.,     376.67%). (See Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Fresh Garlic from the People's Republic of China (59 FR 9470, February 28, 1994).) This margin applies to all manufacturers, producers and exporters of fresh garlic in the PRC.   Global Trading, Inc. (Global Trading), a U.S. importer of the subject merchandise, challenged the Department's reliance on petitioners' data. In particular, Global Trading questioned petitioners' average yield per acre figure in the constructed value calculation, based on its own research in China. Global Trading also challenged petitioners' calculation of U.S. price as being ``far from the actual'' price.   The Department's practice with respect to challenges to petition data was outlined in the Administrative Review of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Steel Wire Rope from Mexico (SWR from Mexico) (58 FR 7533, February 8, 1993), which established that the need for the Department to address petition deficiencies is limited. In that review, the Department stated that the ``rights [of a non-respondent company] are strictly limited to those comments that it can support without submitting any information on its costs or prices for the record,'' and the company ``is restricted to identifying clerical and methodological errors in the petition on the basis of public information.'' The Department found that to allow a company to selectively submit information when it did not submit an adequate questionnaire response would permit the company to manipulate the outcome of the proceeding. The Department determined that such actions would defeat the purpose of the BIA rule, which is to provide respondents with an incentive to cooperate fully in antidumping proceedings.

The eight major U.S. auto makers said they sold cars and light trucks at an  average daily rate of 28,417 during the Dec. 11-20 period last year, compared  to a rate of 34,921 during the same time the year before.    The Big Three -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. --  were hit the hardest, with their sales falling 22% during the period. Sales  during the period for autos made in the United States by foreign manufacturers  mostly were higher.    Sales of light trucks fell 14% during the period, bringing total vehicle sales  down 18.6%.    During December, 1988, consumers flocked to showrooms to buy vehicles before  incentives expired on Dec. 31. That pushed the selling rate for mid- and  late-December to its highest of the year.    Incentives also were in effect during December, 1989, but they didn't spark the  same kind of demand as they did a year earlier.    ""The problem is you've got a tired market,"" said auto analyst Joseph Phillippi  of Shearson Lehman Hutton of New York. ""You're facing a market that's at least  partially saturated.""    Since 1985, more than 77 million new cars and trucks have been sold in the  United States, or about one for every three Americans.    Furthermore, experts say the slowdown of the U.S. economy has contributed to  the auto industry slowdown, as consumers curtail or delay major purchases.

HONG KONG INVESTMENT IN PRC:    Hong Kong Developer in Hubei Real Estate Projects    Coastal International Holdings, which has invested HK$4.5  billion (Hong Kong dollars) in Chinese real estate, will join  hands with Wuhan City's Urban Construction Commission to develop  and redevelop 1,000 mu of land on both banks of the Han Shui.  At present, Coastal International has three projects in Wuhan.  Two are in real estate and the other is a 400-million-yuan  project to build three bridges, which are expected to be  completed before the end of 1995. Involvement in this project  gave Coastal International the opportunity to participate in the  redevelopment of urban areas in Hankou and Hanyang, which are  also in Hubei Province. (Hong Kong HSIN PAO in Chinese 20 Feb 94  p 2)    Banker Views Effects of Real Estate Tax    A series of tax system reforms, including the introduction  of  a value-added land tax, which China launched early this year has  caused varying degrees of confusion which is of concern to the  banking sector in Hong Kong. Analysts hold that recent changes  in tax policy will have a great impact on foreign investors and  have expressed their preference for a relatively long  consultation and adaptation period, which they believe is  necessary.    Wu Lianfeng, assistant general manager of the Nanyang  Commercial Bank, noted that China is only now preparing to  reform its taxation system after more than 10 years of  implementing the reform and opening up policy. However, he also  pointed out that the value-added land tax, the consumption tax,  and other laws and ordinances introduced early this year only  provide a framework and that many specific procedures need to be  worked out and improved. He noted that different  interpretations of the new laws and regulations by the central  and local governments have already caused a certain degree of  confusion and disorder in their implementation and have  disrupted investment projects by foreign businessmen.    Chim Pui-chung, a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council  who represents the banking and finance functional constituency,  also urged China to give consideration to foreign investors'  legitimate interests while continuing to exercise macroeconomic  regulation and control. He warned that as other Asian countries  were making efforts to improve their investment environment to  attract foreign investors, China should follow suit; otherwise  foreign funds could move elsewhere.

Recently, Jialing has  operated as a holding company and has filed an application with  the mainland authorities to gain commensurate status there.  Jialing's businesses cover import-export, equity investments in  industrial and commercial enterprises, real estate investments,  information services, securities, transportation, hotels, and  the importation of capital and technology. Last year, 70  percent of its income came from real estate investments, mostly  in Hong Kong. According to Jialing's chairman, Liu Guangbing,  the company will increase investment in the mainland this year.

The joint ventures will produce suspension  springs and ignition systems. The total value of the deals was  41.75 million yuan. According to Denway's general manager, Xie  Gancheng, a feasibility report is being completed on increasing  the firm's auto output by 100,000 units. At the moment, Denway  produces 50,000 cars a year. Xie said the reason Denway had  bought into the components factories was to increase the  proportion of domestically made components used in its products  and to supply components to other auto companies in China or to  overseas buyers.

The Mainland Affairs Committee pointed out that  the increase was mainly because Taiwan's banking, financial, and  securities sectors has increased investment in Hong Kong last  year.

Kaul]    [Text] India has welcomed the major aspects of the January  14th Moscow Declaration on nuclear nonproliferation as broadly  what India has been advocating. India considers any step, big  or small, aimed at general and complete disarmament to end all  weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, as a  positive development. It has, however, refrained from signing  the present Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as New Delhi  considers it to be discriminatory. The treaty in effect tackles  only the countries without nuclear weapons and not those in the  nuclear club. The treaty virtually seeks to legitimize and  perpetuate the retention of nuclear weapons in the hands of a  few countries.    India's stress on general and complete elimination of  nuclear  stockpiles stems from its ethos. The land of Lord Mahavir and  Lord Buddha has always believed in peace and tranquility and in  avoiding the path of confrontation. During recent past, India  achieved the distinction of having won its freedom through  nonviolence. The world now stands at a threshold so far as  stock piling of nuclear weapons is concerned. Even if there is  no direct confrontation, the mere presence of these stockpiles  poses immense threat to the security of mankind. World public  opinion by and large has been in favor of complete elimination  of such weapons and a ban on their further production.    Outside the arena of international politics, there are  eminent personalities who have hailed India's demand for  complete elimination of nuclear weapons and its refusal to sign  the discriminatory NPT. Dr. Thanat Khoman, internationally  known jurist and diplomat and Thailand's former deputy prime  minister and founder member of ASEAN, said in New Delhi in last  November that India did the right thing in not signing the  discriminatory NPT. The London-based leader of Campaign For  Nuclear Disarmament (CND), Mr. Bruce Kent, at the end of his  two-week tour of India a couple of days ago said that nuclear  powers do not have a right, moral or otherwise, to preach  nonproliferation to the rest of the world. He said the NPT  itself is not just about nonproliferation, but about disarmament  as a whole and it has been made to look as if the whole issue is  only about stopping non-nuclear states from crossing the nuclear  threshold. The CND leader added that the nuclear powers have  won pretty little to fulfill their own NPT obligations of  shedding their own nuclear arsenals. The ground reality also  points to this direction.    Far from eliminating their nuclear arsenals, the latest and  the 39th explosion conducted by China on the fifth of October  1993 has belied the hopes of even a nuclear test moratorium.  The discriminatory nature of the current NPT is also clear from  the fact that whereas the United States showed tremendous  concern about Iraq's nuclear capability because it posed a  threat to Israel, the same concern has not been shown about  Pakistan's nuclear program because it is aimed at India. On the  contrary, it is widely believed that Pakistan's nuclear  capability was actually built somewhat within the knowledge of  Washington.    Keeping the discriminatory nature of the present NPT in  view,  India has affirmed the need to alter the treaty on  non-discriminatory basis. The NPT review conference is to be  held next year and India has not accepted the suggestion that  the treaty should be extended indefinitely and unconditionally  in its present form. Public opinion, even in Western countries  too, is (?gearing) round to a recognition that attempts should  be made to dispense with nuclear weapons. There is now a  growing realization in America too that the arms race made the  United States the world biggest debtor. Both Germany and Japan  have also started to question the discriminatory nature of the  NPT. Japan has been the only country to have suffered the  consequences of a nuclear attack and India in keeping with its  commitment to general disarmament has urged Japan to take  advantage of the opportunity next year at NPT review conference  for removing its discriminatory nature. India has also asked  Japan to join India in its initiative at the UN for a convention  prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons as  necessary first step for the elimination and prevention of  nuclear war. Efforts at nongovernmental level aimed at complete  disarmament and a comprehensive test ban are also going apace.  Former U.S. Defense Secretary Mr. Robert McNamara, has revealed  in Bangalore recently that Indian and American experts have  agreed to an action plan to work for freeing the world from  nuclear arsenals.

It said all divisions contributed to the sales increase. The Basle-based group, which normally provides a full financial report in April, indicated it achieved 'a significant increase' in group profit. In 1992, consolidated net income rose 29 per cent to SFr1.9bn. Roche said operating profit last year was boosted by 'a better utilisation of production capacity and consistent management of costs'. The significant increase in net income was also due to 'another healthy result in the non-operating sector'. The group says that it has been only marginally affected by government pressure on drug prices in many countries. In Italy, the most recent European country to act in this area, Roche said it achieved real growth in sales last year, although the devaluation of the lire hurt the Swiss franc result. Investors have showed great confidence in the group, bidding up its non-voting shares 51 per cent last year after a 60 per cent rise the previous year. Its current market capitalisation of about SFr61bn makes it the world's most highly valued pharmaceutical group. The group had liquid reserves of more than SFr12bn at the end of 1992. The pharmaceutical division, which accounts for more than half of total sales, reported a 13 per cent rise in revenue to SFr7.8bn. The leading drugs (Rocephin, an anti-infection treatment, Dormicum-Versed, a mild anaesthetic, Roaccutane for treating severe acne, Furtulon for treating solid tumours and Roferon-A for cancer and anti-viral therapy) continued to record volume increases. Sales of the self-medication business, Roche Consumer Health, surpassed SFr1bn. Sales of vitamins and fine chemicals advanced 7 per cent to SFr3.3bn, due to strong demand for vitamin E, beta-carotene and the feed additive Astaxanthin. The diagnostics division reported a 10 per cent rise in revenues to SFr1.7bn, while revenues of the flavours and fragrances division were up 8 per cent to SFr1.4bn.   Companies:-  Roche Holding.

Last year's results included an $850-million provision for the Valdez spill.  Without that, Exxon said, it would have earned $990 million in the 1989  quarter.

Ashland, based in Ashland, Ky., reported record net income of $100 million for  the quarter ended June 30, 1990. The amount was more than double the $44  million in 1989. Sales were $2.2 billion, the same as in last year's quarter.    Exxon Chairman L. G.

Earnings from U.S. exploration and production activities were $81 million, down  from $289 million in 1989. But earnings from foreign exploration and production  operations rose $75 million to $464 million.

0,FT931-3683 ,"FT931-3683 _AN-DCOCJABJFT 930315   FT  15 MAR 93 / Russia and Ukraine fail to agree on Soviet debt      By CHRYSTIA FREELAND      MOSCOW   RUSSIA and Ukraine have failed to reach an agreement on the former Soviet Union's foreign debt. After a meeting led by their prime ministers in Moscow on Friday the two Slav countries appear further apart then ever. Their failure may jeopardise the recent initiative by G7 leaders to cobble together an aid package to bolster Russian President Boris Yeltsin's beleaguered government. However, Ukrainian officials claimed a breakthrough on energy prices and supply, saying that, for the first time, Russia had agreed 'in principle' to take into account transit fees for goods imported and exported through Ukraine. However, the prime ministers' meeting, promoted as the forum at which the escalating economic conflict between the neighbours would be resolved, did not produce a single specific agreement and was overshadowed by the power struggle being waged a few blocks away in the Russian parliament. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister, said he would seek a return to a temporary accord according to which Russia would assume the management of the foreign debt but a final resolution of the division of the debts and assets would be postponed. BAT Industries, the leading British tobacco company, yesterday acquired a majority stake in Ukraine's largest tobacco factories. The Prylucky tobacco factory, 125km east of Kiev, produces nearly a fifth of Ukraine's total cigarette output and is one of the most coveted prizes in the fierce battle between western tobacco companies for a share in the Ukrainian cigarette industry. BAT will control 65 per cent of the new A/T BAT- Prylucky Tobacco Company, and the management and workers of the Prylucky plant will initially hold 35 per cent. This is part of a wider trend in the industry to compensate for declining smoking in the west.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.     A/T BAT Prylucky Tobacco.

Their total spending also rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 3.2bn. The picture in June was less encouraging. Tourist numbers, at 1.6m, were 6 per cent higher than in June last year but spending was flat at Pounds 630m. Tourism last year was affected by the Gulf War, which cut visitor numbers and spending from 1990. One of the biggest areas of growth in the first six months of this year was the US, with 1.5m visitors, up 32 per cent from the same period last year. The recent weakness of the US dollar means travel has become more expensive for US citizens, and there are doubts that the first half's growth will be sustained for the rest of the year. The number of visits from western Europe reached record levels in the first six months of the year, up 5 per cent to 4.82m. Travellers from the rest of the world rose 21 per cent to 1.46m.

'I think we are spending a ton of money in private insurance and government tax payments to deal with the healthcare problems occasioned by health habits, particularly smoking,' Mr Clinton said yesterday. 'You do have to find some way to recover some revenues to cover people who now don't have coverage.' Higher tobacco taxes are reported to figure on a list of potential ways of raising money to pay for overhauling the healthcare system, which Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, who heads the White House task force, is now working on, along with other 'sin taxes' such as alcohol and gun levies. The Los Angeles Times said yesterday that Mrs Clinton had ruled out the option of taxing employees on company health insurance benefits, viewing this as too damaging to her husband's chances of re-election in 1996. Mr Clinton said he had not ruled anything out, and White House officials said revenue options remained under consideration. Healthcare reform is likely to save money over the long term; it is seen as essential if the federal budget deficit is to be reduced, because programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid are the fastest-growing items of government spending. Extending coverage to the 35m people who do not have company health insurance, but are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, is expected to cost anywhere from Dollars 12bn (Pounds 8.40bn) to Dollars 44bn a year. Costs of subsidising long-term nursing home care could drive the bill higher. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that treating employer-paid health insurance as a taxable benefit where it exceeds a reasonable average could bring in Dollars 113bn over five years, and would introduce stronger incentives to curb medical inflation.

The Russia Country Fund will enable US financial institutions, such as pension funds, for the first time to invest directly in private enterprises in Russia and other former Soviet republics, with their investments partially guaranteed by the US government. The closed-end fund seeks to raise Dollars 100m in project finance and venture capital for new businesses, expansions and privatisation, with an emphasis on enterprises in the energy and environmental fields. The Russian government will contribute up to Dollars 25m. The Overseas Private Investment Corp (Opic), a US government agency set up to encourage American investment in emerging economies, will provide a Dollars 50m loan guarantee to protect private institutions providing the additional capital. Investors will be offered what Opic described as a 'blended instrument', composed of one-third equity and two-thirds debt. The agency will extend guarantees on the principal and interest of the debt portion.

The company reported net earnings of Dollars 92.9m, or 45 cents a share, up from Dollars 64.5m, or 32 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales were up 2 per cent at Dollars 2.3bn. Mr John Creighton, president, said the figures reflected 'a slowly improving economy and solid accomplishments within our business improvement plans'. The company's forest products division was helped by the controversy over saving the Northern Spotted Owl, which has curtailed the supply of timber from public lands in the western US and sent the price of supplies rocketing. Operating earnings here were up 13 per cent at Dollars 126.5m. The company's pulp and paper business saw profits rise 84 per cent to Dollars 68.3m, helped by better pricing of some products, reduced maintenance spending as well as improved productivity in pulp and corrugated box manufacturing. In the first half the company made Dollars 179.5m, or 88 cents a share, compared with Dollars 51.4m, or 26 cents, a share after a 1991 accounting change which cut 30 cents a share from the total. Sales were up 4 per cent at Dollars 4.5bn. For the second half, Mr Creighton said lower long-term interest rates should produce some improvement in single family home construction, while no resolution of Northwestern timber shortages should also help keep wood product values strong. Weyerhaeuser, the largest exporter of US forest products, would also benefit from the weak dollar.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

The offer would remove control of National Directory Services (NDS) from Australia and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC), the government-owned telecommunications carrier. Australia Post, which is government owned, would not comment. The bid would provide an initial payment of ADollars 400m, (USDollars 298.5) followed by further payments of up to ADollars 2bn over 15 years, depending on performance. The bid offers the Labor federal government a small contribution towards reducing the 1992-93 budget deficit, expected to exceed ADollars 10.5bn, following a deficit of more than ADollars 9bn in the year to June. However, it is likely to be opposed by backbench Labor MPs because it would transfer majority ownership of NDS to GTE, which would hold a 52 per cent stake through its subsidiary GTE Directories Corporation. The bid will be opposed fiercely by AOTC, which said it had not seen the proposal and claimed that overseas experience showed it would be a mistake to split the directory service from the main telecommunications carrier.

During the quarter, Merck's earnings rose to Dollars 705.7m, or 62 cents a share, compared with Dollars 634.8m, or 55 cents, a year earlier. Most analysts had expected profits of 61 cents a share in the latest quarter. Sales advanced 3 per cent to Dollars 2.54bn from Dollars 2.46bn. On Wall Street, the results helped lift Merck's shares by Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 at the close. Merck attributed its improved earnings performance to cost control measures, improved productivity, a better product mix and strong unit volume gains. It said its results also benefited from restructuring and a lower tax rate. For the first nine months, net income was Dollars 1.49bn, or Dollars 1.31. A year earlier, the company earned Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 1.19. Merck's 1993 results were muddied by restructuring charges in the second quarter. In the same period of 1992, results included charges of Dollars 462.4m for accounting changes. Stripping out restructuring charges in 1993 and the 1992 accounting changes, Merck said its net income rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.01bn, or Dollars 1.77 in the first nine months of 1993. Sales grew to Dollars 7.5bn from Dollars 7.06bn. The company said that sales growth was held back by the sale of its Calgon Water Management business in the second quarter and by the impact of a strong dollar. In the human and animal health segment, unit sales of its high blood pressure treatment Vasotec, anti-ulcer drugs Pepcid and Prilosec and the anti-cholesterol drug Zocor were strong. The company's Proscar drug, to treat symptomatic benign prostate enlargement, also contributed to the sales gain. However, sales of cholesterol-lowering Mevacor continued to erode in the nine months. It is planning a Dollars 6bn takeover of Medco Containment Services, the biggest US mail-order drugs distributor. Merck said it intended to finance the acquisition through a combination of equity, cash and debt financing. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year.

0,FT941-11226 ,"FT941-11226 _AN-EBFAAABJFT 940205   FT  05 FEB 94 / Build-up of allegations behind the Malaysian dam: The Pounds 234m Pergau aid project may have some disturbing parallels with the arms-for-Iraq affair      By ROBERT PESTON and JIMMY BURNS   'Great Britain plc has come out of all this very well,' Lord Younger, the former defence minister, said this week. He was commenting on the controversial events which led to a Pounds 1bn arms deal between the UK and Malaysia in the late 1980s. British companies may have benefited, but allegations about the deal are troubling the government. Two Commons committees are investigating whether the arms package was secured as a direct consequence of the promise of substantial aid to Malaysia. In October a National Audit Office report criticised the government's commitment to provide Pounds 234m to a Malaysian hydro-electric dam project  -the most ever provided for a single scheme under the Overseas Development Administration's Aid and Trade Provision. In a parallel with the arms-for-Iraq affair, the question is whether the government breached its own guidelines or the law in securing the arms deal in 1988. Another allegation has emerged in the past week that the government suppressed evidence in a criminal case against a Malaysian banker to prevent embarrassment to the Malaysian government. This case also echoes the arms-for-Iraq affair. It involves Mr Lorrain Osman, former head of the Hong Kong operations of Bank Bumiputra, the Malaysian state-owned bank. In a 1990 High Court appeal by Mr Osman against moves to extradite him to Hong Kong, the Foreign Office applied for public interest immunity certificates to prevent disclosure of government documents in thecase. This was the first time the government had used such certificates to prevent disclosure of information in a criminal case. It was the direct precedent for its failed attempt to use them to prevent disclosure of ministers' knowledge of arms sales to Iraq in the Matrix Churchill case in 1992. In the Osman case the certificates were allegedly used to withhold evidence of a supposed cover-up of the involvement of senior Malaysian politicians, including Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, in lending by the bank to the failed Carrian Corporation. The allegations were made under parliamentary privilege by Mr Robert Parry, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside. The Foreign Office is still refusing to disclose the contents of the documents withheld. If they say what Mr Parry alleges, they would have been unwelcome news for Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, who had developed a close relationship with Dr Mahathir. In 1989 she said: 'I hope that I am not presuming in describing him as a friend, whose counsel I have found invaluable, as well as a very skilful and tough negotiator for Malaysia's interests.' They took the leadingroles in the negotiations on the Pounds 1bn arms deal. Lady Thatcher, ever the champion of the UK defence industry, wanted to persuade Dr Mahathir to end his 'Buy British Last' trade policy, introduced at the beginning of the decade as a reprisal against withdrawal of concessions on fees paid by Malaysian students in British universities. She succeeded in March 1988 when a protocol for a substantial defence contract was agreed. According to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, this contained a reference to 'aid in support of non-military aspects under this programme'. Lord Younger, who signed the protocol, said this week that the aid reference was included in error. He had not noticed the reference at the time. The Foreign Office, which was 'totally clear all along that there could be no link', pointed out the mistake to him soon afterwards. Lord Younger wrote to the Malaysian government saying there could be no link between arms and aid. Negotiations were continued by Lady Thatcher personally when she went to Kuala Lumpur in September 1988. In a meeting with Dr Mahathir from which all officials were excluded, a memorandum of understanding on Pounds 1bnof British arms sales was agreed. The following month, the development administration received a strong recommendation from the Department of Trade andIndustry that Malaysia's Pergau dam scheme should be regarded as a strong candidate for Aid and Trade Provision cash support. The DTI has a formal role in recommending schemes for such support, but the final decision is supposed to be taken by the Overseas Development Administration. The Pergau scheme was expensive and rapidly became more costly. A contract estimate of Pounds 316m in January 1989 by Trafalgar House and BICC, the UK companies which would build the dam, roseto Pounds 397m on March 31. At about this time, Dr Mahathir was visiting London. Lord Younger met him in his hotel room, but he said there was no discussion of aid. In April 1989, the UK government made a formal aid grant offer toMalaysia. The final offer was not made or accepted by the Malaysians until 1991, when the cost of the scheme had reached Pounds 417m, including a British contribution of Pounds 234m. The magnitude of the British subsidy was unusual. There wasalso a breach of normal Whitehall procedures in that the offer was made againstthe advice of Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the administration, and of Baroness Chalker, the overseas development minister, who regarded the scheme as uneconomic and a bad use of scarce resources. Businessmen and officials admit privately that there was an informal link between the offer ofaid to Malaysia and the winning of civil and military contracts for British companies. One businessman closely involved in UK-Malaysian trade relations said: 'You and I know that there is a connection between winning arms sales in Malaysia and offers of aid - but the question is whether anyone was stupid enough to leave explicit evidence.' In ethical terms, that link might be wrong, 'but you don't win contracts against competition from the French and the Americansif you take ethics too seriously'. The British government is not discussing the affair in terms of ethics, but in terms of the law. Ministers and Whitehall officials insist there is no legislation banning ministers from offering aid in return for defence business. The central piece of foreign aid legislation, the 1980 Overseas Development and Co-operation Act, does not cover the subject of military assistance. But if there was no breach of the law, there may have been a contravention of official Aid and Trade Provision guidelines,described by one official as the administration's 'bible'. Its commandments include: 'The aid programme may not be used to procure equipment of a military nature or for a military use.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     MYZ  Malaysia, Asia.

The figure does not  include the overseas offices of Korean banks.    At the end of 1992, the number of overseas branches stood at  2,656, meaning the figure rose by 27.3 per month over the next  year. Based on these statistics, the current total is estimated  at more than 3,000. But out of the branch offices, only 494 are  actually conducting business and the remaining 2,490 are just  offices handling liaison affairs and research. Of the branch  offices, 1,495 are based in Asia, 694 in North America and 407  in Europe. By country, 659 are located in the United States, 624  in Japan, 192 in Hong Kong, 184 in China and 143 in Indonesia.    Last year 128 new offices were set up in China, reflecting  Korean companies' keen interest in that country. Vietnam and  Russia attracted 31 and 19, respectively.    By sector, manufacturing numbered 1,102, followed by trading  at 693: Transportation and fishing at 296: Tourism at 234 and  construction and services at 214.    Meanwhile, banks have 145 overseas offices, up 15 from 130  at  the end of 1992.

The transactions involving forged certificates occurred between March 15 and March 19, leading the Jakarta stock exchange to suspend until April 1 trade in Indah Kiat and Indorayon, two of the region's leading wood-pulp companies, Inco, a nickel producer, H M Sampoerna, a cigarette company, and Semen Gresik, a cement producer. When the suspension is lifted, brokers must obtain stock exchange clearance of the companies' share certificates as part of any transaction. Brokers doubt, however, the exchange's ability to verify certificates within the four days in which trade must legally be completed. Mashill Securities, a local brokerage company, alerted the stock exchange 10 days ago to the fraud but, with the market on holiday last week, trade in the affected companies was not suspended until Monday. At least five foreign broking houses have been left holding fake certificates and face possible losses, brokers say. The two people implicated in the crime have fled the country, reportedly to Hong Kong, and Interpol has been alerted. While the fraud's size, estimated at Rp12bn (Pounds 3.8m), is not substantial, its details have alarmed brokers who fear more scandals may unfold. The suspects had been dealing in the market for a year, making single trades of up to Rp1bn prior to the 'sting', say brokers who fear forged shares in other companies may await discovery. The forged certificates are also of exceptional quality, passing tests required by brokers such as ultra-violet checking of watermarks and carrying brokers' stamps recording former transactions. Details on the forgeries have also led brokers to speculate the criminals may have had access to confidential company share registers.   Companies:-  Indah Kiat Pulp and Paper Corp.

The government was last year forced to postpone JR East's flotation because of the plunging Tokyo stock market. Stockbrokers and the ministry of finance are hoping that the listing will bring back confidence among individual investors, who have been disillusioned by the fall in the share price of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which is part-owned by the government. The auction procedure is an attempt by the government, which faced mounting criticism over the initial high pricing of the NTT offer, to keep the offer price of JR East at a reasonable level. NTT shares, offered publicly in 1986 at Y1.197m, soared to Y3.18m the following year. However, the stock fell to an all-time low of Y453,000 last August, prompting criticism that it was offered at an inflated price by the government. The outcome of the JR East listing will affect the timing of that of other government-owned companies, including Japan Tobacco and the remaining six railway groups. The government also intends to float the remaining 65.7 per cent stake that it holds in NTT. Half of the 4m shares owned by JNR Settlement, which holds debts and shares of Japan National Railways, the former national railway operator, will be offered in the first tranche. JNR Settlement will auction 600,000 shares, and will fix a price for the remaining 1.4m shares based on an weighted average of the auction bids. Investors, including foreigners and individuals, may take part in the auction by submitting bids for a minimum of 50 shares by August 11. Successful bids will be decided on August 26, and the initial public offering price fixed on August 30.   Companies:-  East Japan Railway.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

ANXIOUS DEALERS HAVE BEEN CUTTING  BACK ON ORDERS.      By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DETROIT      Car and truck sales were better this October than last, but that isn't saying  much, industry executives, dealers and analysts noted Monday. With some  exceptions, they reported a steadily worsening sales outlook.    The 10 companies building cars and trucks in America posted a modest 5.7% daily  sales increase over the previous October (904,754 total units sold this year  versus 824,148 last year).    That increase, however, masked a falloff in dealer orders that is blamed for  upcoming production cuts. Worker layoffs and rollbacks, scheduled for November  and December, were announced last week.    ""Sales are not the greatest. They kind of stink,"" said Jerry Brunner, general  manager at Stella Buick in Chicago.    A year earlier, sales in October and November were undercut by elaborate sales  contests and discounts in September. They were aimed at unloading unsold  1988-model cars from dealer lots.    Sales were particularly bad last year at General Motors, which helps to explain  GM's relatively strong year-to-year sales increase of 9% in cars and light  trucks.    Still, not even GM tried to put on a cheery face. ""We expect increased  competitive pressures as manufacturers respond to slower dealer ordering  patterns due to declining consumer confidence and fluctuating market  conditions,"" said J. B. Fitzpatrick, marketing vice president.    Despite rising gasoline prices and economic uncertainty since the Aug. 2  invasion of Kuwait, there has been no outright collapse in car sales.    They have generally continued at the weak pace that has prevailed all year,  except for certain of the foreign-owned ""transplant"" auto makers building cars  here. Japanese auto makers, selling American-built as well as imported cars in  the United States, continue to eat away at the market share of U.S. companies.    GM and Ford Motor Co. reported surprisingly weak financial results last week.  They have announced temporary plant closings in November and December, idling  tens of thousands of workers. Chrysler Corp. reported a $214-million loss.    Weaker-than-expected earnings were blamed partly on the auto industry's  increasingly costly system of rebates, underscoring how hard it is to sell cars  these days. The average rebate is said to exceed $1,200 per car.    Now, dealers nationwide are grumbling about lower customer traffic and weaker  sales. In turn, they have slashed new-car orders. Potential buyers ""are really  holding on to their money,"" said Tom Lamberto, sales manager at Gengas  Chrysler-Plymouth in Philadelphia.    Analysts said one explanation for the seemingly more favorable sales reports  from auto makers -- in contrast to dealers' complaints -- is the bigger role  played by fleet sales in the overall auto market. Sales to fleet buyers tend to  be less volatile than sales to the general public, and October is a big sales  month for fleets.    But others, including auto analyst Clifford J. Swenson of Economic Consulting  & Planning Inc. in New York, believe that underlying car sales aren't as  bad as suggested by the weak dealer orders. By this line of reasoning, dealers  are responding more to predictions of a recession than to how many cars they  are selling.    ""The dealers at this point are very nervous,"" Swenson said. ""They're the ones  who end up carrying excess inventory, if sales fall off. We are, overall, very  optimistic compared to the general outlook. The industry is planning for a  recession, but whether that emerges is another question entirely.""    Sales in October equalled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.1 million  domestic cars, Ford officials estimated. That is about what it has been all  year.    The Detroit-based companies reported a sales increase of 6.1% in cars but a  1.2% drop in trucks in October. Transplant car sales surged 36.5%, and served  to replace sales of imports, which dropped 9.2 %.    Ford car sales slipped 1.6% for the month while Chrysler's improved 6.3%.    Sales rose 13% at Honda, 138% at Mazda, 23% at Nissan and 73% at Toyota, which  said it had the best October in its U.S. history.    ""Sales are excellent -- very excellent,"" said Joe Pestano, sales manager at  Downey Toyota.    Mitsubishi sales dropped 1.2 %.    Researcher Amy Harmon in Detroit contributed to this story.

At MMD, a 10 per cent improvement in sales, to Dollars 783m, largely reflected two acquisitions completed over the past year. The company, controlled by Dow Chemical, bought the Rugby Group, a generic drug manufacturer, late last year and Kodama, a Japanese pharmaceuticals group, in early 1994. Excluding their contributions, revenues would have showed a 6 per cent decline from Dollars 709m a year ago. Sales of Cardizem, a cardiovascular medication, were down 1 per cent, although a strong performance by the lower-margin Cardizem CD, a once-a-day formulation of the product, helped to offset the loss. Sales of Seldane, an allergy remedy whose patent expired last April, were down 10 per cent. RPR credited robust sales of its prescription products, especially in North America, for an 8 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars 1.04bn. Profits were up 45 per cent at Dollars 102.5m, or 76 cents a share, against Dollars 71m, or 51 cents, a year ago. The 1993 figure reflected a pre-tax charge of Dollars 27m, or 13 cents. The results, which were slightly better than Wall Street had forecast, represent a turnround of sorts from the second quarter, when earnings had come in well under expectations. On Wall Street yesterday, RPR's share price closed Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 36 1/4 . Although MMD suffered a 12 per cent slide in profits to Dollars 126m, or 45 cents, the result exceeded analysts' forecasts of 36 cents. The stock made steady headway as a result, closing Dollars 1 higher on the day at Dollars 25 3/4 . For the first nine months of 1994, MMD posted earnings of Dollars 330m, against Dollars 375m, excluding a Dollars 180m pre-tax charge. Revenues were up 9 per cent at Dollars 2.3bn. At RPR, net income for the nine months was Dollars 168.8m, against Dollars 284.8m, on revenues of Dollars 2.88bn, virtually unchanged from a year ago.   Companies:-  Marion Merrell Dow Inc.

He succeeds Tim Lankester, who is moving to head the education department following the controversial departure of Sir Geoffrey Holland to become vice-chancellor of Exeter university. Vereker, 47, cut his teeth in the education department's more controversial jobs, serving as the first chairman of the Student Loans Company, established to start the gradual replacement of student grants with loans. He also defies Whitehall stereotypes by being a graduate of Keele university, albeit one who was previously educated at Marlborough college. Vereker graduated with a combined honours degree in English and political institutions. He now becomes one of Whitehall's youngest permanent secretaries, and presumably has a chance of moving eventually to be permanent secretary of the education department - both Lankester, and Sir Geoffrey's predecessor Sir John Caines moved to that job from heading the ODA. Sir Geoffrey remains sphinx-like about why he left the education department after less than a year. He moved there after five years as permanent secretary at Employment, and favoured merging his old department's responsibilities for training with the education department.

0,FT923-11500 ,"FT923-11500 _AN-CGXAXACWFT 920724   FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Net income plunges by 45% at ITT      By MARTIN DICKSON      NEW YORK   ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 45 per cent drop in second-quarter net income, due mainly to sharply lower earnings at its ITT Hartford insurance subsidiary, accounting adjustments and restructuring action at the Sheraton hotels business. The group reported net income of Dollars 106m, or 75 cents a share, compared with Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.43, in the second quarter of 1991. Sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 5.36bn. Net income would have been Dollars 131m, or 95 cents a share, compared with a restated Dollars 206m, or Dollars 1.53, if the non-cash accounting adjustments were excluded. The figures also included after-tax portfolio gains at ITT Hartford and ITT Financial of Dollars 22m, or 17 cents a share, compared with Dollars 6m, or 5 cents, in the same period of last year. ITT Hartford saw income drop from Dollars 117m to Dollars 41m. The company said this was 'mainly due to unfavourable adjusted underwriting income caused by higher catastrophe losses, largely from several weather related events, along with continued adverse developments in workers' compensation and reinsurance'. ITT Sheraton had an operating loss of Dollars 14m, against a profit of Dollars 15m, after restructuring its headquarters operations to make them more efficient. Excluding this charge, the company would have reported a small profit, although still below last year. Among the group's seven other major businesses, the automotive, financial and communications operations produced higher operating income; fluid technology and the Rayonier paper business were flat; and the defence and components businesses showed drops. For the six months ITT reported a net loss of Dollars 336m, or Dollars 2.62 a share, after taking a Dollars 580m non-cash accounting adjustment. In the first half of last year it made Dollars 406m, or Dollars 2.99 a share. Sales rose 3 per cent to Dollars 10.44bn.  The Financial Times   London Page 25  "
0,FT941-5703 ,"FT941-5703 _AN-ECDC4AHGFT 940304   FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg ahead on steady foreign demand      By MATTHEW CURTIN      JOHANNESBURG   South Africa had a better day yesterday in an unusually volatile week and the overall index finished 50 higher at 4,931, writes Matthew Curtin in Johannesburg. The bullion price's descent below Dollars 380 an ounce took the gold shares index 19 lower to 1,904. Industrial shares, however, remained buoyant, led by strong overseas demand for Iscor, the steelmaker which produced unexpectedly good half-year results last week. The stock lost 2 cents on the day at R2.86 but the industrial index climbed 46 to 5,679. The contradictory set of circumstances facing investors was dominated in mid-week by initial confidence and then disillusionment with the degree of progress in talks between the African National Congress and the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party. The weak gold bullion price and falling global markets also contributed to instability, but deal-ers reported steady, if more subdued, demand from over-seas investors for blue chip issues. Mr Mike Brown at the stockbrokers, Frankel, Pollak, Vinderine, said that local institutions were proving strangely hesistant, still weighing up the shift in market sentiment at the end of 1993, brought on by the wave of foreign buying which changed notions of value on the JSE. Overseas investors could be forgiven for a wait-and-see approach as elections loomed, but local fund managers might be missing out on an opportunity to pick up good value scrip before another bout of foreign investment.

Zhang Zhigang, the region's top foreign trade official, said  that businesses from 21 countries and regions have set up nearly  300 joint ventures in Ningxia, among which, four projects  involve an investment of ten million U.S. dollars apiece.    Besides manufacturing industry, Zhang said, overseas  investment were expanded to many other sectors, especially the  service industry in this region in northwest China.    Zhang said four loans by foreign governments have also been  signed or listed on the agenda in 1993. They involve a total of  27.46 million U.S. dollars.    Over the past years, the region has received 17.5 million  U.S. dollars of aid from international society. These funds  have financed 11 projects and contributed to the development of  local economy, the official said.    The region exported 111 million U.S. dollars worth of  products last year, Zhang said.    While exporting more than 240 kinds of goods, the region has  diversified the overseas market, Zhang said.    By giving enterprises more rights in international  co-operation, Zhang said, the region has greatly improved its  performances in the international economic competition.    According to the official, many enterprises in the region  are  now engaged in contracting of overseas construction projects,  labor services and operation of overseas ventures.     "

Because many more loans were granted in the third and fourth  quarters last year, the situation of enterprises being short of  funds was eased. In December, the growth rate of industrial  production across the country increased considerably, showing an  increase by 29.8 percent as compared with the same month in the  previous year and close to the highest point before the work of  macro regulation and control was strengthened.    Sales were brisk in the domestic market. In December, the  total volume of social commodity retail sales was 35.3 percent  higher than the same month in the previous year and was up 29.7  percent over November last year. The volume of grain, edible  oil, and household electric appliance sales increased sharply.  That month, the sale of grain was 1.41 million tonnes over the  same month of the previous year, constituting a sharp contrast  with the accumulated decline of 18 percent in the volume of  sales during the first 11 months. Sales of color television  sets were up 82.1 percent over the same month of the previous  year. The volume of sales of cassette recorders and  refrigerators also increased by a relatively large margin. The  sales of the means of agricultural production began to increase,  and sales of commodities such as chemical fertilizer,  pesticides, and plastic for agricultural use also increased  greatly.    The range of the rise of commodity prices in December was on  the high side. Daily living expenses in 35 large and medium  cities rose by 23.9 percent, of which the prices of consumer  goods rose by 17.2 percent and service charges by 38.6 percent.  Inflationary pressure increased further.    On the whole, the situation of economic operations is  basically normal at present. In the next stage, it will be  necessary to do a good job in work to give explanation to  reform, improve the operation of reform, and make efforts to  guard against marked inflation while ensuring the smooth  progress of reform in various aspects.

0,FT922-894 ,"FT922-894 _AN-CFYA4ADVFT 920625   FT  25 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Clouds gather over BAe      By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM   A SPATE of negative stories drove British Aerospace down sharply. The fall started early as the market focused on a company presentation at Tuesday's aerospace and defence conference at Charterhouse Tilney, where the company had talked of problems in its civil aviation order book. The early doubts were quickly followed by unconfirmed speculation that BAe would issue a profits warning within the next few days. Sentiment was further weakened by reports that UBS Philips  Drew was about to issue a sell note detailing large provisions likely to be required because of problems in the regional aircraft division. Mr Brian Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite is already predicting that BAe will have to make provisions of around Pounds 1bn for rationalisation and the regional aircraft subsidiary. He also believes the company will be forced to cut the dividend by 50 per cent, but he adds: 'The defence side continues to trade strongly.' The shares reacted by falling 20 but were helped off the bottom by bargain hunters and eventually settled 17 down at 250p after 5.6m traded. BP drilling fears British Petroleum shares, weakened on Tuesday by a series of profits downgrades by leading broking houses, were given further rough handling yesterday following reports that drilling at the company's latest operations in Colombia had been suspended for environmental reasons. Cusiana is widely regarded as one of BP's biggest exploration triumphs in recent years. At the close of business, BP was trading a net 6 lower at 238p, with specialists said to have been very nervous about the stock finishing below a previous long-standing closing support level of 240p. Turnover was a good 5.7m shares. Tobaccos upset Tobacco issues finished above the day's lows but still well down after the US Supreme Court ruled against them on liability from personal injury lawsuits by smokers. The court ruled that, in spite of the health warning printed on cigarette packets since 1966, the manufacturers are not protected against legal action. This could have important implications for the industry, with a possible 50 cases waiting to be heard in the US, seeking millions of dollars in damages. Rothmans 'B' ended 19 weaker at 1091p, while BAT Industries, with a larger exposure to the US tobacco market, lost 24 at 733p, after touching 705p. Turnover in BAT was a hefty 9.5m shares. Mr Simon Willis, analyst at County NatWest, said it is important to remember that the tobacco industry pushed for the case to be heard by the Supreme Court, believing it would be protected by the post-1966 health warning. Although this has proved wrong, he pointed out that each case will have to be decided individually, and as yet no big award has ever been made against the tobacco companies. Wellcome weak Speculation surrounding Wellcome's share offer, with some details due to be announced today, helped to weaken the shares, which dropped 18 to 913p. Although the drugs group is only due to indicate the size of the offer, talk in the market focused on the price, with most talk putting the shares at between 800p to 850p. At the moment, Wellcome Trust holds 75 per cent of the group and is today expected to relinquish up to two-thirds of its holding. A big agency cross in Granada saw 6.55m shares moved at 255p, while total turnover in the stock reached 17m with the price down 11 at 255p. More holiday price war worries knocked 13 off Airtours at 253p and a further 2 from Owners Abroad at 73 1/2 p. Solid results from First Leisure sent the shares forward, although they receded in late trading to close a net 3 up at 308p. Rank Organisation was in demand, edging a penny ahead to 670p in chunky volume of 2.5m. The latest news about the flotation of Lasmo's North American oil refining businesses triggered an initial flurry of selling which saw the shares down to 169p, but was quickly followed by covering of short positions taken out in the stock. The shares ran up to touch 177p but later slipped back to close 2 firmer on the day at 174p. Turnover was a hefty 5.3m shares. Another downgrade in publishing group Pearson, this time said to be from Cazenove, further depressed the shares, which closed 23 lower at 380p. A downgrade in RTZ left the shares 10 adrift at 584p. SG Warburg cut Pounds 30m from its profits forecast for this year to Pounds 355m and snipped its dividend forecast from 21p to 20.5p, blaming poor gold and copper prices. Some exceptionally heavy business associated with programme trade activity was said to have been behind the more excessive moves in banking shares. The UBS Phillips  Drew buy recommendation boosted Abbey National 3 to 277p, but worries about exposure to losses in India continued to unsettle Standard Chartered, 6 off at 425p. Merchant banks gave further ground, SG Warburg ending 18 cheaper at 512p and Kleinwort Benson 5 lower at 286p. Reports of a broker profits downgrade left Redland 12 off at 498p. Dealers said some analysts had reduced their estimates to around Pounds 210m. The second line construction stocks included several weak performers, notably CALA, down 8 at 64p, and Costain, off 3 at 48p. Whitbread 'A' fell 8 to 411p in spite of comment by chairman Mr Sam Whitbread that 'we are beginning to see the first tentative signs that business may be looking up'. Bass, hit Tuesday by negative comments from Lehman Brothers, eased 3 to 595p, although Lehman's preferred companies, with more emphasis on the international spirits trade, fell even further. Guinness lost 11 to 558p and Allied-Lyons 8 to 641p. Ratners slipped another  1/2 to 7 1/2 p on further good turnover of 3.6m shares. The poor sentiment in British Aerospace spilled into Rolls-Royce, which declined 6 to 155p as turnover rose to 7.2m shares. A profits downgrading knocked Vickers down 8 to 139p. US investment bank Lehman Brothers reduced its current year forecast by Pounds 11m to Pounds 20m to reflect continued difficulties at the company's Rolls-Royce Motor Cars sub-sidiary. A profits warning by Henlys Group caused a slide in the shares of 22 to 55p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (15).

The companies include the Goldman Sachs Corporation and the  Tams Consultants Incorporation in the United States and the  Well's Pacific Corporation Ltd. in Italy and the Asia Pacific  Group in Taiwan. They are now competing with each other to win  the bid for the expansion of the airport.    HNTB Architects, Engineers and Planners, one of the most  renowned firms of its kind in the United States, has expressed  its interest in designing of the expansion project.    The Shanghai Rainbow Airport received 65,000 flights with  seven million passengers last year.    The blueprint for the expansion of the airport has been  approved by the China Civil Aviation Administration and the  Shanghai Municipal Government.    The new airport will occupy 20.4 square kilometers, five  times the area of the present one. It will be able to receive  260,000 flights with 40 million passengers a year by the time  its expansion is completed, five and six times the present  capacity, respectively.    A total of seven billion yuan will be invested in the  expansion of the airport. Bids will be invited for the  expansion of the airport's lounge building and its second runway  construction, according to Du Chuncai, general manager of the  airport.     "

US District Court Judge Terrence Boyle, presiding in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, has retired to consider the evidence from 16 expert witnesses brought by Glaxo and Novopharm, a Canadian maker of generic (unbranded) drugs. Sales of Zantac, an ulcer treatment, are worth about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.3bn) a year. If Novopharm won the case, it would be able to sell a generic version of Zantac from 1995. Mr Ian Smith, a drug sector analyst at broker Lehman Brothers in London, estimates that Glaxo would then lose Dollars 700m of revenue in the first year alone. The case was brought by Glaxo after Novopharm sought government permission to make generic Zantac. Novopharm is challenging one of Glaxo's two main patents on ranitidine hydrochloride, the active ingredient in Zantac. It is arguing that a specific crystalline form of the drug, known as Form 2, is not sufficiently innovative to warrant a patent. Novopharm says that the two versions are chemically the same, but Glaxo says Form 1 has never been sold and Zantac is based on Form 2. A less specific patent for ranitidine hydrochloride runs out in 1995, but Form 2 is protected until 2002. Over the past eight days Judge Boyle has heard eight witnesses from each company presenting legal and chemical arguments on the originality of Form 2. The outcome of this case is likely to affect another being brought against Glaxo by a Canadian generics maker called Genpharm. That case is due to be heard in May 1994. These companies are struggling over the future of a money-spinning drug at the peak of its earning power. Sales over the next few years are likely to fall. Zantac's arch-rival Tagamet, made by UK company SmithKline Beecham, comes off patent next year. Generic drug manufacturers are poised to launch a cut-price version. Zantac is also being challenged by a newer drug from Swedish company Astra. At the same time government pressure on the pricing of drugs generally remains high, especially in the world's biggest market, the US.   Companies:-  Glaxo Holdings.     Novopharm.

Jiang Ming, head of CATM, said that cigarettes were a  special  kind of product, harmful to people's health. China has always  practised strict control over the production and marketing of  cigarettes, he said.    China has imposed a state monopoly and a high-tax policy on  the tobacco industry to restrict its production scale.    However, according to the senior official, the illegal  production and marketing of counterfeit cigarettes had become  rampant in some localities in recent years, which prompted CATM  to organize a joint crackdown on fake and smuggled cigarettes,  with relevant departments of public security, customs and  taxation.    Marked results had been achieved in the crackdown, said the  administrator. Official statistics show that since 1993, CATM  has tracked down 514,000 boxes (a box contains 50 cartons of  cigarettes) of smuggled cigarettes, seized 64,000 boxes of  counterfeit cigarettes and burnt in public 51,000 boxes of them.    The CATM has also smashed 50 production centers of fake  cigarettes and banned over 100 wholesale markets which sold fake  and smuggled cigarettes.    The administrator said that China practised the system of  state monopoly on the tobacco industry as early as in the 1980s.  A large number of locally run tobacco enterprises have been  closed down since then, particularly in 1993. The year saw a  sharp reduction of the nation's tobacco enterprises from 300 to  100.    The CATM renewed permits for nearly 1,000 enterprises which  are considered qualified for the production and marketing of  cigarettes.    The official stressed that the system of tobacco monopoly is  of great significance in checking illegal tobacco activities and  it will further safeguard the interests of the nation and of the  vast number of smokers.

In the third quarter of 1993, the company had a net loss of Dollars 24.2m or 91 cents per share. Sales in this year's third quarter were nearly unchanged from a year ago at Dollars 1bn. Much of the loss was attributed to a Dollars 27m one-time charge linked to the sale of the company's Canadian subsidiary, Rainy River Forest Products, and to high debt servicing costs. On an operating basis, Boise Cascade earned Dollars 28.4m in the quarter, up from Dollars 5.3m in last year's third quarter. Operating income for its paper and paper products division rose to Dollars 2.2m from a year-ago loss of Dollars 27.8m, while income from its office products division rose to Dollars 10.7m from Dollars 8.3m last year. Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific said it earned Dollars 87m or 98 cents per share in the third quarter, turning around a net loss of Dollars 36m or 42 cents per share last year. Operating profits rose to Dollars 348m in the quarter, up from Dollars 214m. Georgia-Pacific said its pulp-making operations returned a profit for the first time in many quarters, earning Dollars 83m compared with a loss of Dollars 10m a year ago. Building products, Georgia Pacific's largest division, earned a record Dollars 262m in the quarter, up from Dollars 210m last year. Third-quarter sales for all divisions rose to Dollars 3.3bn from Dollars 3.0bn last year. For the nine-month period, Georgia-Pacific earned Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.59 per share, on sales of Dollars 9.4 bn, up from last year's Dollars 2m or or 2 cents per share on sales of Dollars 9.1bn. Louisiana-Pacific, the US forest products group, unveiled record third-quarter earnings of Dollars 95.1m, or 86 cents a share, more than double last year's Dollars 41.5m or 38 cents a share. Sales for the quarter jumped to Dollars 818.4m from last year's Dollars 629.4m.

The move is important symbolically as an effort to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the US, particularly given Toyota's huge market power in Japan, where it claims 42 per cent of car sales. It will also help Toyota meet a growing domestic demand for estates (station wagons). Toyota will import the right-hand-drive version of its Camry Wagon, manufactured at its plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, to be sold domestically as the Scepter. The company has set an ambitious sales target of 700 units a month. It will compete against Honda's US-made and designed Accord Wagon, whose sales have averaged 836 a month this year. Nissan said yesterday it would next year start importing to Japan a small wagon to be manufactured at its Mexican assembly plant. Honda remains the leader in so-called reverse imports, with average monthly imports of 1,146 units of three different models of the Accord. The cars tend to be sold as premium products without the extensive discounting now available on domestically-made models. Nissan has been selling an average of 192 UK-made Primera models, while Mitsubishi has sold 46 US and Australian-made models each month. Mazda has sold about 160 US-made cars bearing the Ford marque each month. Ford owns a 24 per cent stake in Mazda. Total sales of imported vehicles in Japan in the first six months of the year came to 85,129 units, down 12.7 per cent from a year ago. European marques were hit hardest. Sales of BMW and Mercedes have held up fairly strongly, the companies claiming 17.18 and 19.12 per cent respectively of the imported market. Sales of Volkswagen-Audi vehicles, however, have slipped by 20 per cent, although the company has managed to retain its position as the leading importer, with 21.36 per cent of the market.

The US tobacco, food and brewing company said the division, which traditionally accounts for more than half of group operating profits, made Dollars 1.016bn at the operating level, down from Dollars 1.027bn in the same period of 1992. Operating revenues for the division were 4.2 per cent higher at Dollars 2.54bn, but domestic cigarette shipments were down by 1.1 per cent. Marlboro, the best-selling cigarette brand in the US and whose market position has been threatened by the explosive growth in discount cigarettes, saw an 8.3 per cent fall in shipments, to 22.6bn units. The inroads being made by discount cigarettes - which Philip Morris suggested yesterday account for 39 per cent of the US cigarette industry - prompted the group to announce the effective price cut of about 40 cents a packet for Marlboro. At the time, Philip Morris warned that the move could cut operating profits from its domestic tobacco unit by as much as 40 per cent this year. The US tobacco division, contributed to an overall 10.8 per cent advance in Philip Morris's first-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars 1.22bn, a much slower growth rate than the company has reported in recent years. Total revenues were up by 8.1 per cent at Dollars 15.2bn. The international tobacco operations saw a sharp 18 per cent operating profits rise, at Dollars 675m. On the food side, the US businesses improved by 14.7 per cent, to Dollars 626m, while the international food division reported a 10.5 per cent gain, at Dollars 242m.

Amgen, whose sales in the first three months of the year had failed to live up to expectations, bounced back with revenue growth of 21 per cent in the three months to June, to Dollars 414m. Sales of Neupogen, its treatment for chemotherapy patients, rose 13 per cent to Dollars 212m, while revenue from Epogen, used in connection with dialysis treatment, advanced 26 per cent to Dollars 176m. During June, the company won regulatory approval to use Neupogen in connection with high-dose chemotherapy, and to recommend an increase in Epogen dosages on its packaging, both of which should support sales growth in future. With research and development spending up from Dollars 53m to Dollars 64m, Amgen reported net income of Dollars 107m, or 77 cents a share, up from Dollars 100m, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. A legal award had added 6 cents a share to earnings in the 1993 quarter. Half-year net income was Dollars 201m, against Dollars 190m. Post-tax profits at Genentech, which is majority owned by Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, jumped threefold in the second quarter as product sales rose by more than a third. The company reported net income of Dollars 33.4m, or 28 cents a share, up from Dollars 10.4m, or 9 cents the year before, and broadly in line with market expectations. Behind the growth in product sales, to Dollars 152m, were a 32 per cent rise in Activase, a drug used to prevent blood clotting, to Dollars 73.5m, and an 11 per cent advance in sales of the company's two human growth hormones, to Dollars 59.5m. Sales of Pulmozyne, taken by cystic fibrosis sufferers, launched in the first quarter, reached Dollars 18.7m. Mr Kirk Raab, president and chief executive, said Activase sales growth could be further reinforced by a recent recommendation from a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee. This could lead to larger dosages of the drug being taken in the treatment of heart attacks. Research and development spending, at Dollars 73m, was down from Dollars 84m a year before when a one-off charge of Dollars 13.7m was included. Spending on RD would increase in the second half of the year as later-stage clinical trials started on a number of additional products, Genentech said. For the half-year as a whole, net income rose to Dollars 72m on sales of Dollars 394m, up from Dollars 25m on sales of Dollars 323m. Sales at Upjohn, the US pharmaceuticals company, slipped in the second quarter on growing generic competition to some of its biggest products. The slowdown, however, was not as rapid as some industry observers had expected. The company reported post-tax earnings of Dollars 120m on sales of Dollars 891m, down from Dollars 125m on its sales of Dollars 895m the year before. Earnings per share, at 67 cents, were 3 cents lower than the corresponding period but comfortably ahead of market expectations at around 60 cents. Upjohn said US sales of Xanax, the anti-anxiety treatment which is its biggest-selling drug, had fallen 64 per cent to Dollars 80m during the period. US sales dropped 8 per cent overall, to Dollars 500m. Outside the US, however, revenues rose 11 per cent to Dollars 391m, buoyed in part by higher sales of Xanax. Mr John Zabriskie, the company's recently appointed chairman and chief executive, pointed to recent registration filings in 25 countries for Freedox, a haemorrhage treatment, as a sign of Upjohn's attentionto the development of new products. Patent expiries on a number of its drugs in the US and the takeover of US rival Syntex have pushed Upjohn to the top of most analysts' lists of potential takeover candidates in the pharmaceuticals industry. For the first half as a whole, net income fell to Dollars 255m, or Dollars 1.43 a share, from Dollars 253m, or Dollars 1.55, the year before.   Companies:-  Genentech Inc.     Upjohn.     Amgen.

This was despite a 4 per cent drop in turnover from DM29.7bn to DM28.5bn. Mr Ernst Pieper, chief executive, said that, in the first quarter of the current year, pre-tax profits were less than the DM130m in the comparable period of the previous year. He said that the current year would be difficult for the group in the light of the general economic downturn. But he was confident that the group would 'come through' relatively well because of its mixture of businesses. Some analysts' predictions of a 10 per cent drop in profits for the year were speculation, he added. 'Catastrophic' conditions in the steel industry and a difficult metals market would be balanced by a strong performance from other parts of the group, including energy, transport, ship-building and plant construction, Mr Pieper said. As a measure of his confidence, he pointed to a 4 per cent increase in the order intake to DM6.2bn in the period from October to December 1992. Sales dropped 5 per cent to DM6bn, mainly because of falling steel and base metals prices. As previously announced, the dividend for 1991-92 is to be held at DM10 per share, the same level as in the previous year. Mr Pieper, 64, appointed chief executive of Preussag in 1990 following the company's acquisition of the Salzgitter steel and engineering group from the west German government, will step down as chief executive at the beginning of next year. His successor is to be Mr Michael Frenzel, 45, who was appointed deputy chief executive in March last year. MAN, the engineering and truck group, said yesterday that orders improved by 25 per cent in the second quarter of the current financial year, compared to the first quarter, when they dropped sharply. In the six months to December, total order intake was 14 per cent down at DM7.4bn. Sales for the six months were DM8.2bn, the same level as in the first half of the previous year.

Several other subsidiaries of multinational companies also face heavy taxdemands. Among them is British American Tobacco and Perkins. However, Firestone, headed by Mr Manuel Balbis, who is also president of Argentina's American Chamber of Commerce, has taken the most aggressive stance towards the DGI, Argentina's tax department. He said: 'Our net worth is about Dollars 22m. There is no way we can pay the kind of money they are asking for.' The dispute began in 1985, when companies bought and sold government tax rebates on an apparently legal secondary market. The companies now being pressed for payment paid their taxes with rebates bought from Koner-Salgado, an Argentine conglomerate. A DGI investigation in 1985 found evidence of fraud in Koner-Salgado's tax rebates. It subsequently rejected payments made with its certificates. However, Mr Balbis claims the DGI's findings were not made public until 1988, when Firestone ceased buying from Koner-Salgado. The case has come to a head after a final deadline for payment expired last week. The Supreme Court ruled that companies must pay first before negotiating with the DGI. Growinginterest in Argentina by foreign investors could be undermined unless a satisfactory compromise can be found. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said: 'We are prepared to discuss (anything) within the law and we are doing that.' He added, however, that 'it is not within the powers of the DGI not to collect (taxes) that the law requires it to collect.' However, a diplomat monitoring the case said the government would try to put off the problem until its finances were in better shape.  The Financial Times   London Page 31  "
0,FT934-2629 ,"FT934-2629 _AN-DLMDEACMFT 931213   FT  13 DEC 93 / Smoke gets in Europe's eyes: Divisions among EU health ministers and advertisers over tobacco products      By DIANE SUMMERS   Peter Mead is a 30-a-day smoker who thinks tobacco advertising should be banned. He knows it isn't entirely logical, but he feels some degree of reassurance every time he sees a cigarette advertisement. 'At the back of my mind I have to believe the government wouldn't allow something that's going to kill me to be advertised.' Mr Mead is chairman of Abbott Mead Vickers, a top UK advertising agency which refuses tobacco company business. Dominic Proctor, London chief executive of New York-based agency J Walter Thompson, which has among its clients the tobacco company Gallaher, the UK subsidiary of the US company American Brands, takes the rather less exceptional line for an advertising man. 'There should be freedom to advertise anything which it is legal to market,' he says. In Brussels today the arguments which currently divide the advertising industry will be reflected in a debate between European Union health ministers. Under discussion is a European Commission draft directive that would ban all tobacco advertising, apart from point-of-sale material, across the EU. The Commission's action has been prompted by research showing tobacco products cause 430,000 deaths a year in EU countries. Among the middle-aged population, tobacco products are responsible for at least a quarter of all deaths. The Commission also says prohibiting advertising will overcome the problem of differing rules across member states preventing the free flow of, for instance, magazines containing cigarette advertisments. In response, the tobacco and advertising industries point out that the keenest advocates of the plan - France, Italy, Portugal and Spain - either have state-run tobacco companies or allow other companies to operate a monopoly. It would be harder for others to compete against the dominant players in these countries if they were not allowed to promote their products. They also warn that a ban could set a worrying precedent: today Brussels wants to outlaw tobacco advertising, tomorrow it could be fast cars, children's toys, pharmaceuticals or Black Forest gateaux. For the moment, at least, it is likely that the Commission will be unable to persuade EU states to support its directive, as it has been since the directive was first put on the table in 1991. Realising that agreement is unlikely, supporters of a ban will probably not push for a vote today. In the past it has been Germany, Denmark, Holland, Greece and the UK which have blocked a comprehensive ban. Greece, under its new Socialist government, may have softened its stance. But the four remaining opponents have enough votes under the qualified majority voting system to continue blocking its progress. The position of the UK could prove pivotal. It has been the most vociferous opponent of an EU-wide ban and it is widely thought that Denmark and the Netherlands would switch sides if the UK were to change its position. So far the British have preferred a policy of a voluntary approach to restricting advertising and high taxes on tobacco products - the duty on tobacco was increased by 7 per cent in last month's Budget. Tobacco advertisers in Europe believe they have won a reprieve - but no more. Privately, many in the advertising industry see public opinion forcing an end to tobacco advertising in Europe within three or four years. An indication of the mounting pressure of public opinion is already being seen in the UK. The government is expected soon to announce it will be negotiating tighter 'voluntary' controls with the tobacco and advertising industries. Options include an end to poster advertising, a ban on tobacco advertisements in womens' magazines, removing shopfront advertising, and larger health warnings on packs. Proposals along these lines could help to head off the threat of cross-party support growing for a private member's bill introduced by Labour MP Mr Kevin Barron which the government is highly likely to want to block. Such proposals would also provide something for ministers to offer at a European level as an alternative to the proposed ban. The advertising sector accepts that such a move in the UK could presage an eventual crumbling of UK resistance to a EU wide ban. And it is already preparing accordingly even though the European Commission calculates that tobacco advertising makes up less than 3 per cent of advertising for all goods and services in the 12 member states. For example, Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman of More O'Ferrall, the hoardings company which has operations across Europe says: 'The job of our marketing has been to broaden the base of customer demand in all our markets, so that we are not too dependent on one sector.' While there is clearly movement towards further restrictions in Europe, voluntary or otherwise, there is no definitive answer to one question which ought to be central. Does a ban on advertising cut the number of smokers? The Tobacco Advisory Council, the UK trade body, says that the sole purpose of tobacco advertising is to promote competition and encourage existing smokers to switch brands. It estimates that the value of business from smokers who switch is worth Pounds 3bn a year. It denies that advertising encourages smoking. Not so, according to Dr Clive Smee, the department of health's chief economist. Last year he reported that studies of Canada, Finland, New Zealand and Norway, where tobacco advertising bans have been in operation, showed 'a fall in smoking on a scale which cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors'. But his research appears to clash with a study by Michael Stewart, an econometrician, in the May edition of the International Journal of Advertising. That showed a slight increase in smoking in those countries where there has been a ban. A possible reason is that banning advertising also means no health warnings to put off smokers, except on packets. 'This increase is not quite statistically significant, but clearly refutes the belief that advertising bans have appreciably reduced consumption,' concludes Mr Stewart. As he points out, the space now devoted to the health warnings is the 'equivalent of millions of Ecus of ongoing anti-smoking advertising' across Europe. If European health ministers decide that they want to impose a ban on advertisments, they may need to seek some alternative ways of funding those warnings. But the niceties of this debate are unlikely to worry the tobacco companies, although they will continue to lobby vigorously against any measure which could affect sales. The companies already know that tobacco consumption in western European markets is dropping as concerns about the health effects spread and as smoking becomes less socially acceptable. The decline is not sharp - about 2.5 per cent in volume terms in EU countries over the past five years - but it is steady and shows no sign of slowing. In contrast, new markets are opening in Asia and the Pacific Rim, and in eastern Europe, where smoking is gaining in popularity and sales. In China, for example, cigarette sales grew from 1,649bn to 1,705bn in between 1991 and 1992. With such virgin territories to play for, the possibility of an ban on advertising in Europe may ultimately appear to be a a small distraction.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           TOBACCO ADVERTISING IN THE EU: BEING STUBBED OUT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (TV advertising is banned                        Cigarettes per capita throughout EU)                                   per annum (1991)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- France       Banned                                               1,714 Portugal     Banned                                               1,503 Italy        Banned - widely circumvented by indirect advertising 1,691 Belgium      Severe restrictions; total ban in the pipeline       1,681* Denmark      Local radio ban, other controls through voluntary              agreement                                            1,556 Germany      Banned on radio.

But the company said it was continuing discussions with Paramount and with other US media groups with a view to smaller acquisitions in individual divisions. The privately-owned German group had been rumoured as a potential buyer for Paramount because of its healthy financial position and its desire to expand in the electronic media field. The group has repaid all its debt and has accumulated liquid funds totalling DM425m. Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive, said Paramount was 'too expensive' and that such a 'grandiose investment was beyond imagination'. He stressed that it would be incompatible with Bertelsmann's conservative investment approach. Group operating profits for the year grew by 20 per cent to DM1.43bn on sales 6.5 per cent higher at DM17bn. Net income was DM660m. Bertelsmann achieved its highest growth in its music division which includes the Arista Records company of the US. Sales for the division, which accounts for a third of total, turnover rose 13 per cent to DM4.42bn. Gruner + Jahr, the second-largest division which comprises newspapers and magazines, recorded a 4 per cent rise in sales to DM3.75bn. Book clubs, with 23m subscribers worldwide, continued to show good results. Sales of the printing and manufacturing division were down 3 per cent to DM2.99bn, mainly due to a fall in the price of paper. In electronic media, gratifying results came from RTL, the largest private channel in Germany. But Vox, the private television venture featuring a mix of news and general programmes and launched at the beginning of the year was disappointing. A new design for Vox is planned for November. Premiere, the only pay-TV channel in Germany, was due to break even this autumn, the company said. Bertelsmann stressed it had achieved particularly good results in the US with Bantam Doubleday Dell, the publishing group reporting profits for the year. Mr Wossner said the current business year would be more difficult because of the general recession, but results similar to those recorded in 1992-93 could be expected.   Companies:-  Bertelsmann.

Compact discs continued to be the chief catalyst of the market's expansion. Sales of CDs rose by 18 per cent in the first six months of this year after a 19.4 per cent increase to a total of 1.4bn units during 1993. The US was one of the most buoyant areas of growth for CDs, with a 25 per cent rise in unit sales during the first half of 1994. This reflects the continued trend for consumers to replace their collections of vinyl records and cassettes with CDs, and the wider availability of budget CDs. However, the pace of CD sales growth is starting to slow in more mature markets, notably in Italy. The IFPI also detected a reduction in the rate of CD sales growth in some Asian countries where piracy is a problem. One of the fastest growing areas of the music market is CD singles, where sales have continued to increase in spite of a slight decline in overall single sales. The number of CD singles sold worldwide rose by 55 per cent in 1993 and grew again in the first half of this year. The increase in CD sales has predictably depressed demand for cassettes. The IFPI noted a decline in sales of cassettes for the first time last year to 1.35bn worldwide from 1.47bn in 1992. The drop continued - albeit at the slower pace of 4.6 per cent - in the first six months of this year. The traditional vinyl market appears to be in terminal decline. Sales of vinyl LPs fell sharply to 80.4m in 1993 from 114.9m in 1992. The IFPI reported another fall in the first half of 1994.

The result was up fractionally on profits of SKr758m in the same 1992 period and followed an increase in second-quarter profits to SKr561m from SKr505m. Sales surged to SKr49.6bn from SKr40.8bn in the first half, almost entirely because of the impact of currency movements rather than increased volumes. The company noted that market conditions continued to be difficult, with demand generally weaker in Europe but better in North America. Operating income after depreciation rose by 6 per cent to SKr1.6bn as a result of a better performance in most countries. The two main exceptions were North America and Spain, where the company's total operating income from household appliances fell by SKr500m. Electrolux has been hit by heavy product launch costs in North America, while the company's Spanish activities have suffered from weak market conditions and from the impact of an 'inflexible labour market' on its restructuring efforts. Analysts said that they welcomed signs that the company's long-running problems in North America were being resolved and said that they were encouraged by the company's assessment that its income in the region should gradually improve in the second half. They also noted the performance of the group's outdoor products division, where sales rose 43 per cent to SKr8.25bn from SKr5.76bn. Sales in the group's main division, household appliances, rose a more modest 17.8 per cent to SKr27.0bn from SKr22.9bn. Industrial product sales were up 22.5 per cent to SKr8.93bn, while commercial appliance sales rose 13.4 per cent to SKr4.98bn. Outdoor products and industrial products improved their operating income during the period, while household and commercial appliances both registered a decline. The latest figures included a SKr200m gain from the sale of most of the company's stake in the Australian company Email, but this was entirely offset by a capital loss on the disposal of the company's direct sales operation in France.

This is the first aid-funded project to be cancelled since the international donor community restored financial assistance to Kenya last November. Balance-of-payments aid had been frozen for two years over allegations of corruption and economic mismanagement, problems which have not been fully addressed. The British High Commission yesterday said it had been 'unable to agree on mutually acceptable conditions for further support for the Kenya Indigenous Forest Conservation project'. The ODA is believed to have pressed the Kenyan government to end the illegal allocation of protected forest areas to members of the ruling Kanu party and their acolytes. It also demanded an end to unregulated logging concessions, which are destroying Kenya's tropical hardwood forests. It is believed the vation project was cancelled when the government failed to provide these assurances. Government officials were unavailable for comment. Land has always been a political issue in Kenya because of the scarcity of arable land for a rapidly growing population. It is a main cause of ethnic violence in Kenya. Dr Richard Leakey's resignation as director of the Kenya Wildlife Service last month was also triggered by the political hunger for land. He contended that his refusal to grant mining or commercial concessions within Kenya's nature reserves provoked a vendetta against him.   Countries:-  KEZ  Kenya, Africa.

He said there were 'some signs of a slow improvement in the US, but it is too early to say this for the UK'. He was reporting results for the first quarter of the current financial year, which showed pre-tax profits up from Pounds 226m to Pounds 236m, helped by a Pounds 20m disposal profit. The group does not reveal operating profits at the first quarter stage, but analysts suspected that interest receivable was slightly lower and operating profits were down. Recession is still affecting many of the group's businesses. However, in the US Cavenham Forest Industries was seeing markedly higher prices for lumber used in the construction industry. Mr Martin Taylor, vice chairman, said prices were 30 to 40 per cent higher than six months ago. This could be a leading indicator of an upturn in construction However, any increase in demand has yet to work through to Hanson's aggregates business. Mr Taylor said another good sign was that DuPont, the leading maker of titanium dioxide, had removed its price discounts on the chemical which could help Hanson's SCM subsidiary. In the UK, profits at Imperial Tobacco were higher, he said, but otherwise there were no signs of 'green shoots'. The group's brick and aggregates operations were not seeing any upturn in demand yet. He declined to comment on negotiations in the US between the coal industry and miners. In the US, 44 per cent of the group's coal mining capacity has been hit by a strike since the beginning of this month. He said a judgment on the case against Costain over the sale of Costain's Australian coal mining business, was expected in the next week or so.   Companies:-  Hanson.

The move could bring in combined revenues of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 980m) a year by 1998. In a year-end spate of approvals, the US Food and Drug Administration gave the go-ahead for Paxil, an antidepressant made by SmithKline Beecham, Manoplax, a heart drug from Boots, and Tilade, an asthma treatment developed by Fisons. Paxil, branded as Seroxat in Europe, should be the biggest seller of the three. Analysts believe it could become one of only a handful of 'blockbuster' drugs with sales of eventually of more than Dollars 1bn a year throughout the world. Sales in the US should begin in the next few weeks. SmithKline Beecham shares rose 12p to 496p on New Year's Eve. The approval of Fisons' Tilade ends a long period of uncertainty for the company. The drug, upon which Fisons has pinned hopes for rapid growth in the 1990s, has been awaiting US approval for almost six years. In a departure from the company's usual practice, it will co-promote Tilade with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US-based pharmaceuticals subsidiary of Rhone-Poulenc, the french chemicals group. In return, Fisons will co-promote Azmacort, RPR's asthma treatment, which works by a different mechanism. Tilade will not be launched in the US until the second quarter of 1993, but its shares advanced 15p to 245p on New Year's Eve. Fisons also announced that it was abandoning attempts to revamp production of one of the suspended drugs, Iron Dextran, a blood product, to meet FDA requirements. Boots was given a bigger boost than it expected by the terms of the approval of Manoplax. The FDA's advisory committee had recommended approval only for heart patients who could not tolerate the class of treatments called ACE inhibitors. The ruling allows Manoplax to be given to any heart patient not responding to other treatments. Analysts forecast sales rising to Dollars 250m a year by 1998, and Boots shares responded with a gain of 12p to 561p. The FDA approved a fourth UK product, Indiclor, an imaging agent used in the treatment of cancer and made by Amersham International. Although sales are likely to be small in relation to the size of the company, Amersham shares rose 17p to 619p. Drug shares lifted, Page 13   Companies:-  SmithKline Beecham.     Boots.

Bhattacharya]    [Text] The latest review of the Indian economy suggests  that the gross domestic product during the current financial  year ending March 1994 will be between four and five percent.  This may not be an achievement worth a celebration. But at the  same time, it is not an easy task either to clock a four or five  percent GDP growth in only the third year of the economic  reforms. The experience of economic reforms all over the world  has shown that there is a sharp decline in growth of GDP in the  first few years after the introduction of structural adjustments  and economic reforms policies. This is because the industry and  other economic agents take their own time to get adjusted to the  new rules of the game. As a result, GDP growth is the first  casualty. The fiscal squeeze, which normally accompany such  reforms and structural adjustment, has also been rather modest,  some critics argue. This will mean that there has been  virtually no fiscal squeeze in 1993-94. The hope now is that  the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, will present a budget  for 1994-95 in February that seeks to reduce the fiscal deficit  to a more manageable level and in consistence with the pursuit  of economic reforms and structural adjustment policies of the  government.    The government's optimism on the GDP growth can also be  explained from the fact that the agricultural sector will once  again do reasonably well during the current year, exceeding the  production levels reached in 1992-93. Monsoons have been good  this year and there has been no slippages in the timely supply  of fertilizers. Even the procurement prices for major crops  during both the commercial rabi [spring] and main kharif  [autumn] seasons were announced well in time, ensuring that  farmers go ahead with their plans for sowing in full knowledge  of the likely returns the crops might fetch in the market.  Since the weightage of agricultural production in the GDP is  quite substantial, any increase in the farm output helps the  economy record a reasonable growth rate even if industrial  production lacks behind the targets.    Such optimism has now been further boosted by the fact that  the industrial sector has at last begun to see some light at the  end of the long tunnel called recession. The depression of  demand witnessed in most consumer durable sectors in this  country for the last two years seems to be over. A large number  of industries, including those in the transportation sector like  the automobiles manufactures, are reporting higher sales. The  six-monthly performance of the most companies operating in the  consumer durable sector have shown a marked improvement in the  sales. Excise duty collections, which is one of the key  indicators of the degree of manufacturing activity in industry,  has also begun picking up.    If all this gets reflected in GDP as they should, there is  no  reason to doubt the government's projection that the GDP growth  this year would cross four percent. There is, however, a need  for striking a note of caution here. A GDP growth of four  percent may be a reasonably satisfactory performance for an  economy in its third year of economic reform, but this is  decidedly far below the potential of an economy of India's size  and resources. As the finance minister has often reiterated in  the past India should look forward to an annual growth rate of  around 10 percent in the next decade and only then can it live  up to the world's expectations of being an uncaged tiger.    Quite clearly, the need for the hour is to get on with the  second phase of economic reforms without any delay. It is an  acknowledged fact that future growth will not come to much from  industry as from the services sector. The potential of the  services sector in this country lies virtually untapped. The  financial sector reforms are now under way. Once the R.N.  Malhotra Committee's report on liberalizing the insurance sector  is accepted by the government, one can hope for further reforms  in this crucial area of the economy also. The financial markets  and the capital market too are gradually getting liberalized.  This should in near future allow the entrepreneurial talent of  the Indian businessmen to exploit the potential availability in  this sector in competition with foreign firms. In the financial  sector also, more new private banks are being set up, stepping  up the pace of economic activities in the economy through a  transparently competitive environment. In the coming years, the  services sector would take a clear lead in terms of the  economy's GDP growth. And, as long as such reforms process  continues unimpaired, there is every reason to achieve a higher  a GDP growth of around 10 percent in the next few years.     "

0,FT941-6679 ,"FT941-6679 _AN-ECAD7AB5FT 940301   FT  01 MAR 94 / Customs to fight EU duty challenge      By NEIL BUCKLEY   Customs and Excise said yesterday that it would fight any attempt by the European Commission to overturn UK excise rules and allow British consumers to order cheap alcoholic drinks and tobacco from across the Channel by phone. Since the advent of the single European market last year, UK shoppers have been able to bring back as much alcohol and tobacco as they want from EU countries for personal use - within certain generous guidelines - without paying UK excise duty. But anyone buying and transporting goods on behalf of someone else still has to pay excise. The European Commission plans to challenge that rule, saying that, provided duty is paid in the country of purchase, imports do not have to be transported by the buyer in person to avoid excise. That would allow UK customers to place orders for alcohol or cigarettes with commercial couriers or mail order operators, which would transport goods on their behalf. 'The commission's opinion is that if you pay for the transport of the goods it's as if you were transporting them,' the commission said yesterday. It is expected to make a proposal in May or June clarifying its directive 92/12. The UK argues that the directive means shoppers must physically transport the wine themselves. 'We will continue to apply our interpretation and fight it in the courts,' Customs and Excise said yesterday. If necessary, it added, it would go to the European Court. Any further relaxation of restrictions on alcohol imports from continental Europe could devastate the UK brewing industry. The Brewers and Licensed Retailers' Association said personal imports of beer reached 1.8m hectolitres last year - equivalent to 15 per cent of all beer drunk at home. When wine and spirits imports are added, drinks retailers in the UK are estimated to have lost business worth Pounds 700m, while the government has lost Pounds 300m in excise and value added tax.

'It is feared that unless a regular food pipeline into Juba is established urgently a large proportion of the population will starve,' said a report issued yesterday after a meeting of international aid agencies in Juba on Tuesday. The report by Britain's Oxfam, Christian Aid and Cafod (Christian Fund for Overseas Development) and the Norwegian Church Aid group said the city's 293,000 people had run out of food and 'face imminent starvation'. The population of the city, 1,300 km south of the capital Khartoum, has been swollen by refugees from Sudan's nine-year civil war. The report said airlifts had been intermittent during early July and since July 18 no flights carrying food for civilians had been allowed to land at Juba, southern Sudan's main town. The mainly Christian-animist Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army (SPLA) has been fighting the Khartoum government since 1983 over what it sees as Moslem domination of Sudan. It wants a referendum in the non-Moslem south and other marginal areas, with the option of separation. The agencies appealed to the government and SPLA to approve a resumption of the UN relief flights and establish safe corridors out of Juba for civilian evacuation .

Although the results were broadly in line with expectations, Wall Street was disappointed that Merck's earnings growth had fallen below 20 per cent levels. The company saw annual earnings increase by 19 per cent in both 1991 and 1990, and by 24 per cent in 1989. Shares in Merck lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 3/8 before the close yesterday. Fourth-quarter results were distorted by the adoption of new accounting standards, which brought net income for the three months to Dollars 609.1m, or 53 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.6bn. In the same period of 1991, Merck earned 529.8m, or 46 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.31bn. For the full year, Merck had net income of Dollars 1.98bn, or Dollars 1.72 a share, 6 per cent below earnings of Dollars 2.12bn, or Dollars 1.83 cents, posted in 1991. Stripping out after-tax charges of Dollars 462.4m, or 40 cents, for the adoption of new accounting standards, net income rose 17 per cent to Dollars 2.49bn, or Dollars 2.15 cents, in 1992. Sales were 12 per cent higher at Dollars 9.66bn, against Dollars 8.6bn. Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said strong unit volume, cost controls, better product mix and a lower tax rate contributed to income growth for the year. Warner Lambert, another large pharmaceuticals company, unveiled a 14 per cent increase in underlying fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 137m, or Dollars 1.02 cents, from Dollars 121m, or 90 cents, a year ago. Sales rose to Dollars 1.47bn from Dollars 1.34bn. In the 1991 quarter, Warner Lambert recorded an after-tax charge of Dollars 418m, or Dollars 3.11, which led to a net loss of Dollars 297.1m, or Dollars 2.21. For the whole of 1992, net income was Dollars 643.7m, or Dollars 4.78, on sales of Dollars 5.6bn. In 1991, after-tax charges of Dollars 524m brought net income down to Dollars 34.8m, or 26 cents, on sales of Dollars 5.06bn. Excluding charges, Warner-Lambert said earnings rose 15 per cent in the year.   Companies:-  Merck.     Warner Lambert.   Countries:-  USZ  USA.   Industries:-  P2833  Medicinals and Botanicals.

The 35-year-old man, who works for a Japanese company, made  this announcement last week on a special program aired by  Beijing television aimed at helping Chinese bachelors studying  or working abroad and returned students who are still single to  find mates.    The hostess, Yang Guang, said that she found out that many  young people studying or working abroad are looking for partners  from within China. However, their dreams often cannot become  true because they live abroad.    ""I am waiting for my luck, but it's really not easy,"" said  29- year-old Lu Qing, who studied law in New Zealand and has  opened a law office in Beijing. ""Life abroad is dull. We missed  China and our hometowns every day. After returning to China, I  find my life is colorful and happy.""    The 80-minute program presented nine such bachelors, some of  whom were introduced by their family members or friends in  China. Most of them, with master's or doctor's degrees in hand,  have passed their 30th birthday.    In recent years, China has made a series of preferential  policies including the freedom to return and leave again to  encourage students studying abroad to return to China. More and  more students have begun to come back.     "

Sales rose by just 1 per cent to FFr12.6bn in the half-year to June 30 in the face of tough trading conditions but profits improved at a faster rate due to improved operating efficiencies and cost reductions, the company said. CarnaudMetalbox, formerly known as CMB Packaging, was formed three years ago through the merger of the packaging interests of Metal Box of the UK and the French Carnaud. It forms Europe's biggest packaging concern with about 85 per cent of its sales of plastic and metal packaging materials in Europe. Operating profits were 8 per cent higher at FFr1.2bn as productivity improved and the profits margin widened from 9.1 per cent to 9.8 per cent. Net profits were flattered by a net reduction in exceptional restructuring charges. Mr Jurgen Hintz, the American chief executive who was brought in a year ago to ease the frictions that had accompanied the birth of the merged company, said customers were 'responding to the group's improved quality, service and marketing performance'. The company said packaging markets remained generally weak but expected its results to maintain their progress over the full year. Capital expenditure was a shade lower at FFr713m and the number of employees was cut by 6 per cent to 30,740 during the half year. Net debt fell 15 per cent to FFr5bn. Sales would have been 3 per cent higher had comparable exchange rates and company structure applied during both periods, the company added.

Petitioner also urges that although the Central Bank is not granting CATs in new export contracts, it is unclear whether the same or different benefits could be granted without using export contracts which are currently required to obtain CAT benefits.    (6) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings: The agreement requires exporters to maintain separate accounting records for subject and non-subject merchandise. Petitioner argues that as only one company, American Flower, maintains separate records of duty and tax exemption benefits received for exports of non-subject merchandise, the Department cannot confirm whether flower producers and exporters have received countervailable benefits on exports of subject merchandise. Petitioner contends that flower producers and exporters were eligible to apply for the income tax exemption if they had tax-exempt export profits and if they segregated domestic and export sales income in calculating income tax. Consequently, petitioner asserts, it is unlikely that new flower producers and exporters not previously subject to the agreement will maintain separate records for the subject merchandise.    Respondents argue that the GOCR and ACOFLOR have pledged to maintain controls to monitor receipt of benefits and that the GOCR is committed to eliminating incentives that distort trade. Respondents argue that it is unlikely that the flower producers and exporters will use the following six programs after termination:    (1) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases: Respondents argue that, in most cases, it will not always be feasible for flower producers and exporters to switch equipment from the production of a product which is non-subject merchandise to subject merchandise product.    (2) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on Imports: Respondents made the same arguments as above for the Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases.    (3) Accelerated Depreciation: Respondents assert that there are two separate government agencies, Ministry of Finance and CENPRO, which have established government controls to block access to the use of accelerated depreciation.    (4) CIEX: Respondents argue that this program was terminated in 1988. Respondents argue that even if some of the funds authorized for this program in 1988 were not actually distributed until 1991, the GOCR made no CIEX distributions to flower producers and exporters. The respondents also argue that the fact that such funds may have actually been distributed in 1991 does not alter that fact that the CIEX program was effectively terminated in 1984 for lack of funding and officially closed in 1988.    (5) CATs: Respondents argue that the only verified fundamental changes to the CAT program are those reducing or restricting its benefits.    (6) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings: Respondents contend that with the continuation of GOCR controls, the GOCR will not grant exemptions unless the claimant can demonstrate that the income for which an exemption is sought is not derived from exports of the subject merchandise. Respondents also note that this program is being phased out.        Department's Position:     Section 355.25(a)(2) of the Department's regulations provides that the Department may terminate a suspension agreement despite the fact that the subsidy programs have not been abolished, provided the Department concludes that the requirements of this provision are met. As explained in Comment 1, the Department determines that the original signatories have complied with the terms of the agreement and the requirements of 355.25(a)(2)(i).

The restructuring, including a 13 per cent cut in staff, rationalisation of research and development, and other cost-cutting measures, will lead to a special pre-tax charge of about Dollars 180m. Most of the Dollars 250m savings should be achieved this year. Mr Fred Lyons, MMD president, said: 'We are moving aggressively to realign our business, both to improve current results in face of rapidly changing conditions and to prepare for the longer-term opportunities.' The measures were principally in response to the growing importance of the 'managed' (bulk discount) care sector in the US, Mr Lyons said. MMD is a leader in managed care, from which it generates about 40 per cent of its US sales. The rationalisation is also a response to a series of blows in recent months. Sales of Nicoderm, the best-selling smoking patch in the US, collapsed this year as the smoking cessation market, worth Dollars 800m in 1992, fell to Dollars 350m. MMD has also been affected by the expiry last November of the US patents of its best-selling product, the heart drug Cardizem, which had sales last year of more than Dollars 1bn. Sales of Seldane, its anti-histamine, have been undermined by safety concerns. Business in Europe has also been affected by healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy. The company plans to cut as many as 1,300 jobs from its workforce of 9,800. Most of the reduction will be in the US. The figure includes cutting 275 full-time US sales representatives and 200 part-time sales positions. MMD saw first-quarter turnover fall 21 per cent to Dollars 617m from Dollars 779m and pre-tax profits decline 56 per cent to Dollars 74m. It said it would focus its RD on specific projects, including a Seldane metabolite that would not have the side effects now associated with the product; Sabril, an anti-epileptic; and allergy products. Last year, MMD formed a joint venture with SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, to develop and market over-the-counter medicines in the US.

The proposed penalties include life imprisonment or a death  sentence for ""snake heads,"" as the mercenaries engaged in the  traffic have been dubbed.    The members of the standing committee of the Eighth National  People's Congress (NPC) were today deliberating a draft  supplementary decision on the punishment of organizers of  illegal emigration and border crossing.    The lawmakers said the draft decision is ready to be  promulgated in the current fifth session of the NPC Standing  Committee.    Such a decision is expected to help the country in combating  illegal emigration and border crossing, to maintain border order  and protect the legitimate rights of Overseas Chinese, according  to the lawmakers.    The draft said that snake-heads could face life imprisonment  or the death penalty if they committed other serious crimes  against emigrants they organized.    Lin Liyun, member of the NPC Standing Committee, said that  some snake-heads become involved in crimes of violence, murder,  drug trafficking and selling human beings.    ""Life of overseas Chinese are disturbed by the crimes and  their legitimate rights infringed upon because of the  influence,"" Lin said.    Member of the NPC Standing Committee Cai Cheng said the  decision was necessary to curb the illegal border crossing and  illegal emigration along China's vast border areas, and is  conducive to stability in border areas and the nation's security.

The latest round of suits was filed Thursday by the state Department of Food  and Agriculture, the result of a wide-ranging investigation during the 1988  grape harvest. Shortages of premium wine grapes drove prices up for some  varieties last year, but prices of non-premium grapes remained moderate.    In several of the suits, the growers or harvesters are accused of passing off  cheaper French colombard grapes as Chardonnays, which sell for more than eight  times as much. In others, inexpensive red grapes were allegedly sold as  zinfandels. Both Chardonnay and a blush wine made from zinfandels have become  highly popular moderately priced wines in recent years.    ""There have been suspicions for some time that there were irregularities (with  grapes) from some growers,"" said Frank Indelicato, co-owner of Delicato  Vineyards in Manteca. ""But it's gotten real bad in the last two years. Some  people are trying to take advantage of the high prices for grapes.""    The extent of the problem is not yet known, but both federal and state  authorities are continuing their investigations. It also is not entirely clear  why some wineries apparently failed to detect the switch, or how much  mislabeled wine -- if any -- made it to the marketplace. Industry sources say  wine made from the grapes under suspicion was not of the expensive type, but  rather fell among those that typically sell for $5 or less per bottle.    Winery officials are clearly embarrassed by the situation, and some express  concern about the effect the scandal could have on the industry's image.    ""There are 6,000 honest, hard-working grape growers in California and a couple  of cases like this make all of us look bad, and that is causing a lot of  bitterness in the grape-growing community,"" said Jim Ledbetter, owner of Vino  Farms and president of the Sonoma County Grape Growers Assn.    Six civil cases have been filed so far by state agriculture officials, all in  the San Joaquin Valley where virtually all of the state's cheaper wine grapes  are grown. However, some of the allegedly inferior grapes or wine are believed  to have wound up at wineries in Napa and Sonoma counties -- the state's most  prestigious wine-producing areas, and federal investigators are known to be  looking into some suspicious cases at a number of premium wineries.      Wineries Victimized    The wineries themselves so far are not under investigation for switching  grapes, and are considered to have been the victims. However, sources said the  federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a division of the Treasury  Department that regulates the wine industry, is checking to see whether some  wineries have mislabeled wine made from the suspect grapes.    It was also learned that federal regulators have demanded that a number of  California wineries show exactly what they did with any suspected misidentified  grapes or the juice produced from them. Winery officials said they are  cooperating.    Authorities want to determine whether wineries that bought misidentified grapes  or wine violated the federal ""minimum varietal content"" regulation. Federal  rules require that wine bottled with a varietal designation (Chardonnay, for  example, or white zinfandel) be made from at least 75% of that grape variety.    The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has the authority to suspend the  license of any winery that knowingly bottles wine with a varietal designation  made from less than 75% of the named variety.      Private Suits Filed    At least three private lawsuits also have been filed. In one, brewing giant  Anheuser-Busch recently won an out-of-court settlement in Northern California  after it claimed that an Escalon, Calif., grape harvester had sold it  lesser-quality grapes labeled as premium zinfandels. The defendant agreed to  pay nearly $1.1 million to settle the case after a government inspection  determined that less than 23% of the grapes delivered to Anheuser-Busch were  actually zinfandels.    Industry officials insist that the situation occurred in only a few instances  in the San Joaquin Valley and could not happen in the premium wine areas (Napa,  Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake counties, for example) where wineries and growers  are closely linked by long-term contracts. ""These are smaller communities where  the growers know the wineries, people know each other, they eat together,  they're friends,"" a spokesman for the Sonoma County Wineries Assn. said.    By contrast, the San Joaquin wineries are typically much larger and process  huge amounts of grapes from many different growers.    Ev Delfino, assistant director of inspection services for the state agriculture  department, said evidence accumulated so far indicates that the problem was  localized in the San Joaquin Valley. ""The great majority of growers, 99 and  nine-tenths of them, are clean. There is no large-scale misidentification of  wine grapes.""      Warning Issued    Since about 1987, when the state's supply of Chardonnay and zinfandel began to  dry up (in part because of a small harvest) and prices rose dramatically, the  state has suspected that some grape growers and brokers might take advantage by  selling cheaper grapes and passing them off as more costly varieties. In fact,  the state Department of Food and Agriculture issued a public warning to growers  and wineries early last year.    State Assistant Atty. Gen. Mark Urban, a prosecutor in the six cases filed so  far by the agriculture department, said the state is seeking a total of more  than $1.2 million in damages, including penalties.    Another six suspicious instances have been referred to the attorney general's  office for possible prosecution, according to sources familiar with the  investigation. (There is a one-year statute of limitations on grape-switching;  all the cases filed so far refer to actions that allegedly occurred last  summer.)    In four of the six cases already filed, Bavaro Brothers, an Escalon-based grape  harvester, and its owners, Nick J. Bavaro and Francisco Bavaro, among others,  were named as defendants. A secretary said that on the advice of its lawyers  the company would not comment on the cases.      Zinfandel Producer    Buyer of the grapes in three of the Bavaro cases was Delicato Vineyards,  believed to be the state's largest white zinfandel producer and purchaser of  80,000 tons of California wine grapes last year. Delicato sells much of its  production -- 4.2 million gallons last year -- in bulk to other wineries,  including Sutter Home, the state's largest marketer of white zinfandel under  its own label.    In one case, the Bavaro firm is alleged to have sold French colombard grapes,  which sold at a statewide average price of $138.79 per ton in 1988, as  Chardonnays, for which the statewide average was $1,122.36 per ton.    In other cases, the state alleges that lower-priced carignan, valdepenas and  grenache grapes were sold in different transactions and passed off as  zinfandels. There was a difference of about $600 per ton in the price paid for  those types of grapes last year.    Winery owner Indelicato said vintners cannot always tell the type of grapes  they are receiving, and therefore must rely on the representations of their  suppliers.    ""Even when we have suspicions, and we call the county (agricultural)  commissioner over, some of the grapes are sent to (the viticulture laboratory  at UC) Davis, and sometimes even professionals can't tell for sure. Just  looking at the grapes, it's hard to tell. You have to analyze the seeds.""    Bob Steinhauer, viticulturist for Beringer Vineyards in the Napa Valley,  agreed. ""The three of us who buy grapes for Beringer inspect the vineyards to  make certain that it's what the grower says it is. And we have a map on file of  every vineyard we buy from, showing the varieties,"" Steinhauer said. ""When the  grapes are on the vine, it's fairly easy to tell what's zinfandel and what's  not. But it's harder to tell when the grapes are in the gondola.""    Sebastiani Vineyards in Sonoma and Charles Krug in the Napa Valley, both  premium wineries that bought grapes from the Bavaro firm, have filed lawsuits  against it claiming that the grapes were misrepresented; each suit seeks $1  million in damages. Both wineries said discussions are under way to settle  those cases.      'A Small Minority'    ""This does not represent the entire wine industry,"" said Robert Hartzell,  president of the California Assn. of Winegrape Growers. ""It's a small minority  of growers.    ""This is an extremely unusual situation. . . . In the 12 years I've been  president of (the grape growers), I've almost never seen the state need to step  in.""    Hartzell said some growers do not believe that the state is being tough enough  on the wrongdoers. ""They think the perpetrators' hands aren't being slapped  hard enough, that the penalties should be more severe. Both growers and  vintners are deeply concerned that a few greedy people have misrepresented the  varieties.""    The last time a scandal of this type hit the California wine industry was  nearly 20 years ago when Almaden Vineyards, then located in San Jose, allegedly  mislabeled wine that it sold to airlines. That case was settled out of court.    Some wineries are upset that the authorities were slow to warn them that a  significant amount of misidentification was occurring. In some cases, the  warnings came after the wine was already blended with other wine. That means  large quantities of wine could be suspect if it were labeled as varietal.    A spokesman for Lost Hills Winery in Acampo said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco  and Firearms was slow in telling wineries of its concerns, ""and we never knew  until we had blended our tanks. . . . They should have told us. We could have  held onto that wine until the percentages were certified. Now it's too late.""

Interim pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 266m to Pounds 266.5m on sales 2 per cent up at Pounds 1.2bn. Net investment income fell 35 per cent to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 33.1m). Earnings per share rose to 20.9p (20p) and the interim dividend is increased by 7 per cent to 4p (3.75p). Lord Swaythling, chairman, said that because so much of the group's profits were made abroad, it was almost paying out as much as it could in dividends without running into an ACT problem. At the operating level, Rothmans increased tobacco profits, from Pounds 180m to Pounds 192m, despite a lower volume of cigarette sales. Sales increased in eastern Europe, particularly to the Commonwealth of Independent States. In the UK sales of Royals King Size 25's were strong. These increases were offset by lower sales in Australia, because of what Lord Swaythling called swingeing tax increases and a price war. Sales also fell in Germany, because there were too many manufacturers, and in Indonesia and the Philippines, where Lord Swaythling said it was tough to achieve meaningful market share. The operating profit was after a Pounds 9.2m exceptional charge covering rationalisation of the Australian and Philippine operations and stock write-downs of Pounds 3.9m in the Philippines and Indonesia. Luxury products lifted their contribution at the operating level to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 20.5m). Translation of overseas company profits hit the pre-tax result to the tune of Pounds 5m.

As a result it expected Souza Cruz, its Brazilian subsidiary, to raise its 1992 tobacco and cigarette exports by more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m). Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT, said he decided to step up investment from Dollars 30m to Dollars 110m because he had been encouraged by 'the government's resoluteness in dealing with inflation and more market-oriented policies'. The money would be used to modernise the company's plants and increase tobacco purchases, giving work to 16,000 extra farmers. Sir Patrick, who is currently visiting Brazil, expected the investment to produce a Dollars 70m increase in leaf exports on last year's Dollars 270m and for cigarette exports to reach Dollars 50m from Dollars 10m just five years ago. The company recently started exporting cigarettes to eastern Europe and was currently negotiating with Russia. It had stepped up exports to other Latin American countries and hoped to benefit from the creation of Mercosul, the tariff-free common market between Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Brazil has been starved of direct investment in recent years and BAT's decision will be seen as a welcome vote of confidence, coming shortly after a Dollars 2.1bn loan secured from the IMF last month. Cigarettes are one of the few items in Brazil which still have their prices set by the government and although Souza Cruz has a 90 per cent share of the Brazilian market, its cigarettes division was losing money until mid-1991 because of the low prices. Sir Patrick said he was confident that these controls would be dropped. He added: 'In the last six months the government has adopted a much more liberal pricing policy'.

Mr Carl Hahn, chairman, said 1.8m vehicles were sold in the six months, a rise of 5.4 per cent, based on preliminary figures. Turnover was estimated at DM44bn. Addressing the annual meeting for the last time before handing over at the end of this year to Mr Ferdinand Piech, Mr Hahn said VW was on course to sell 3.5m vehicles worldwide this year compared with 3.1m last year. This was all the more noteworthy as sales in Germany had fallen by 1.3 per cent in the first half because of weaker demand in the east. Mr Hahn contrasted VW's results with those of most US and Japanese carmakers, calculating that group earnings last year, adjusted for special depreciation, were 3.7 per cent before taxes which were matched by few others. Sales this year will be boosted by the inclusion for the first time of Skoda, in which VW has a majority stake. Sales of the Czechoslovak car were expected to rise to 190,000 units from a low point of 110,000 last year. Skoda was hit by plummeting domestic demand and a collapse of its east European market but has since found new markets in the west with VW's help. A Volkswagen spokesman said that with the help of the impending North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), VW aimed to boost sales of its cars in the US by an additional 100,000 cars in coming years. This was the rationale behind a planned doubling of the capacity of its Mexican operation to 400,000 units.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

0,FT941-14516 ,"FT941-14516 _AN-EATCKACCFT 940120   FT  20 JAN 94 / Tobacco boost for PSBR      By PHILIP COGGAN   The public sector borrowing requirement in December was Pounds 2.1bn, a much lower figure than the Pounds 5bn that analysts expected. One-off factors seem to have accounted for much of the discrepancy, however, and the Treasury has not reduced its Pounds 49.8bn deficit forecast for the 1993-94 financial year. Excise receipts from tobacco sales were Pounds 1.3bn higher than in December 1992 as wholesalers stocked up on cigarettes before the November 30 Budget, which increased tobacco duties. While the sales were recorded in November, the revenue only flowed through to the government in December. This surge translates into 900m packets of 20 cigarettes, or about 16 packets for every adult and child in the country. The central government deficit was Pounds 3bn in December, up from Pounds 2.6bn in December 1992, but was offset by debt repayments by local authorities and public corporations. Local authorities repaid Pounds 500m of debt, the first time they had made a December debt repayment since 1982. The Treasury and Central Statistical Office indicated the repayment may be related to the temporary change in the rules for capital receipts made by the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, in his 1992 autumn statement. The temporary rules allow local authorities to spend the 1993 receipts from the proceeds of the sale of council houses and other items. It appears that many authorities have had higher 1993 receipts as a result of the policy. The local authorities do not have to spend the money immediately, however.

0,FT943-16647 ,"FT943-16647 _AN-EGDDRAARFT 940704   FT  04 JUL 94 / European drug sales stagnate: German pharmaceuticals beat trend as market recovers      By PAUL ABRAHAMS   The German pharmaceuticals market, Europe's largest, has rebounded during the first four months this year following a steep decline in 1993 in the wake of healthcare reforms. However, falls in French and Italian sales meant the overall European market continued to stagnate, according to IMS International, the specialist market research company. In dollar terms, the seven largest European markets fell from Dollars 15.4bn (Pounds 10bn) to Dollars 14.4bn in the four months to April. The seven countries represent 85 per cent of the west European market. In the US, the world's largest single national market for prescription drugs, sales continued to expand, up 6 per cent from Dollars 14.9bn to Dollars 15.9bn. The Japanese market, the world's second largest, dropped 3 per cent in local currency, although it rose in dollar terms from Dollars 6.07bn to Dollars 6.59bn. The effect of an average 6.6 per cent cut in drugs prices introduced in April aggravated an already weak market. Sales in Germany increased 5 per cent in D-Marks, up from Dollars 4.17bn to Dollars 4.144bn. Among the most important therapeutic categories, only respiratory drugs registered a fall, down 6 per cent to Dollars 438m. However, German sales remain significantly down on the same period during 1992 when they reached Dollars 4.67bn. The French market fell 3 per cent in local currency terms, down from Dollars 4.2bn to Dollars 3.875bn. The anti-infective market, which includes antibiotics and anti-virals, dropped 14 per cent, while sales of respiratory and musculo-skeletal treatments fell 7 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Sales in Italian pharmacies fell 9 per cent from Dollars 2.87bn to Dollars 2.44bn, following continued healthcare reform. Sales of central nervous system drugs fell 14 per cent, while those of respiratory, musculo-skeletal treatments and blood agents dropped 20 per cent, 14 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. The UK was the fastest-growing of Europe's biggest drugs markets, up 7 per cent in sterling, an increase from Dollars 1.6bn to Dollars 1.7bn. That compares with 11 per cent growth for the first four months last year. Sales in Spain were up 2 per cent in local currency, although it dollar terms they fell from Dollars 1.47bn to Dollars 1.25bn. In the Netherlands, sales rose 3 per cent but declined in dollar terms from Dollars 527m to Dollars 516m. Belgian sales increased only 1 per cent, and dropped in dollar terms from Dollars 527m to Dollars 506m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     World pharmacy drug purchases January-April 1994 in US dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       N.

""I have had children tell me that they smoked Winstons so that they could be  just like me,"" David Goerlitz told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.  ""For that I shall always feel guilty.""    Goerlitz described himself as a 25-year, three-pack-a-day smoker who kicked the  habit in November. He has worked for private groups that fight smoking-related  illnesses and his testimony was intended to bolster legislation sponsored by  Rep. Thomas A. Luken (D-Ohio).      Ad Ban Sought    Luken, on a self-described crusade ""to reduce cigarette smoking to zero,"" wants  to ban all tobacco ads that might be seen by youths.

0,FT934-678 ,"FT934-678 _AN-DLWCTADKFT 931223   FT  23 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Awash with cash   Worries about weak institutional cash flow this year look, in retrospect, to have been thoroughly misplaced. Overseas investors have proved enthusiastic buyers of UK bonds and equities, while domestic institutions have been surprisingly flush with cash. Yesterday's figures show cash flowing into institutional coffers at a rate of Pounds 14bn a quarter. The total net inflow for the year looks likely to exceed Pounds 50bn, against consensus forecasts of around Pounds 30bn. The difference is accounted for by stronger than expected sales of single-premium savings products by life insurance companies and a stampede into unit trusts. Savers escaping the dwindling returns on cash are the cause. If interest rates fall again in 1994, sales of equity savings products might gather further momentum at the expense of bank and building society deposits. With pension funds also enjoying stronger inflows, as company contribution holidays come to an end, institutional liquidity could be on an upward trend. Third quarter figures suggest institutions themselves may have been taken aback by the appetite of retail investors. Around Pounds 4bn short-term assets were accumulated over the summer, around half of that amount by life insurance companies, while purchases of gilts and equities actually declined. Some institutions may have been deliberately building cash reserves to move into property. The more likely explanation is that strong inflows and rising markets caught them flat-footed. The build-up of cash in the summer may then have fuelled the bull market of the fourth quarter.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-17133 ,"FT942-17133 _AN-EDFDMAFPFT 940406   FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tender trap planned for cattle ticks      By ALISON MAITLAND   Interrupting the sex life of a humble African cattle tick could help save millions of pounds lost each year through cattle disease and constant applications of insecticide, according to scientists at Britain's Keele University. The brown ear tick, which is about the size of a small grape, attacks cattle by drinking their blood, damaging their hide and milk output and spreading deadly East Coast fever. The fever is prevalent in southern and east Africa, killing about 500,000 cattle each year in the latter region alone. Ticks world-wide are believed to cause about Dollars 7bn worth of damage annually in animal deaths and disease, lost production and veterinary costs. Keele is embarking on a Pounds 60,000 one-year project to find ways of tricking male brown ear ticks into thinking they have found a mate. Research on other ticks in the US has already developed decoys - beads that secrete the female pheromone, the chemical that attracts males. Dr Gordon Hamilton of Keele says the UK research, funded by the Overseas Development Administration, will examine the possibility of adding pheromones to insecticides poured or sprayed onto cattle. 'We hope the pheromones will remain active longer than the pesticide and disrupt mating,' he explains. 'Their presence on the host animal would make the male tick feel the whole animal was a female tick.' The aim is to cut the number of ticks, not to eradicate them, as this would reduce cattle resistance to the disease.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In Washington yesterday, Mr Trevor Manuel, South African trade and industry minister, said that the US and South African governments are working on various bilateral initiatives, including an investment pact, a double taxation treaty, and a conference in Atlanta to start tomorrow. South Africa plans to hold its largest trade exposition ever, on September 20-23 in New York City's convention centre. This will feature 150 South African businesses from a broad range of industries, including clothing, textile, furniture, domestic appliances, base materials, agricultural and industrial equipment, banking and financial services. Mr Manuel said the new government expects companies doing business in South Africa to adhere voluntarily to affirmative action plans for women and black people. The US commerce department, believing South Africa to be the key to trade in all of southern Africa, has marked the country for special attention by putting it on its list of 10 Emerging Markets, where it expects exports to grow the most. Also, the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation is increasing its investment insurance in South Africa to Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m). The US Export-Import Bank last year lifted conditions imposed because of apartheid. US exports to South Africa stand at Dollars 2.2bn, with South African exports to the US at nearly Dollars 2bn.

0," FR941004-2-00013   FR941004-2-00006        We calculated Interfit's PP sales based on packed, c.i.f., duty paid, landed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions to the U.S. price, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage, marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. brokerage, U.S. duties, and rebates.    No commissions were paid to unrelated distributors in the United States or home market, and we do not have an appropriate benchmark against which to test whether the commission arrangements between Interfit and its related party are at arm's length. Therefore, we did not make an adjustment for commissions claimed by Interfit that were paid to its U.S. subsidiary for various charges incurred in selling the subject merchandise. (    See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Coated Groundwood Paper from Belgium, Finland, France, Germany and the United Kingdom,     56 FR 56359, November 4, 1992.)        Foreign Market Value        In order to determine whether Interfit had a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. On this basis, we determined that the home market was viable. For purposes of calculating FMV, we used reported CV for products sold by Interfit in the United States during the POI.        Cost of Production        Interfit provided incomplete and inappropriate cost data for home market sales. Specifically, Interfit did not provide COP information for all comparison models sold in France during the POI. Furthermore, Interfit provided transfer prices for the main input into its pipe fittings. As this input was purchased from related parties, it is the Department's practice to use the cost of producing the input, rather than the transfer price. See     Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Venezuela     (58 FR 27522; 1993). Finally, the costs reported by Interfit did not reflect the specific time period requested by the Department.    Accordingly, we do not have the information necessary to make a determination whether Interfit's home market sales are being sold below the COP. In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act as best information available (``BIA'') we have determined that all sales in the home market were made at less than the COP and, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we have based foreign market value on CV.        Constructed Value          We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act, we (1) included the greater of Interfit's reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM, as appropriate, and (2) used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses for profit.    For comparisons to CV, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for differences in credit expenses between the two markets, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the rate respondent reported at which it could borrow in U.S. dollars during the POI. (For further discussions regarding the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation, please see September 26, 1994, Memorandum to Susan G. Esserman from Barbara R. Stafford on file in Room B099 of the Department of Commerce.) We have not made a deduction for the direct selling expenses reported by respondent. We have determined that these expenses (product liability premiums and inventory carrying costs) are, in fact, indirect selling expenses.    Because of the deficiencies in the cost data described above, we are requesting further information from Interfit. We also intend to verify that the prices paid by Interfit to its related suppliers are, in fact, at arms-length.    The CV data originally provided by Interfit did not cover all of the models sold by the company in the United States during the POI. On September 23, 1994, Interfit supplied the CV data for the remaining models. Because this information was not received in time to be used in this preliminary determination, we have used BIA for sales involving these models. As BIA, we have imputed the highest non-aberrational margin calculated from the CV information that Interfit submitted on September 6, 1994. (    See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products and Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Netherlands    , 58 FR 37199; July 9, 1993). In our final determination, we intend to use all the CV data submitted by Interfit so long as it can be verified.        Currency Conversion        We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.        Critical Circumstances        Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from France. Section 733(e)(1) of the Act provides that the Department will determine that critical circumstances exist if:             "," FR941004-2-00013   FR941004-2-00006        We calculated Interfit's PP sales based on packed, c.i.f., duty paid, landed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions to the U.S. price, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage, marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. brokerage, U.S. duties, and rebates.    No commissions were paid to unrelated distributors in the United States or home market, and we do not have an appropriate benchmark against which to test whether the commission arrangements between Interfit and its related party are at arm's length. Therefore, we did not make an adjustment for commissions claimed by Interfit that were paid to its U.S. subsidiary for various charges incurred in selling the subject merchandise. (    See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Coated Groundwood Paper from Belgium, Finland, France, Germany and the United Kingdom,     56 FR 56359, November 4, 1992.)        Foreign Market Value        In order to determine whether Interfit had a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. On this basis, we determined that the home market was viable. For purposes of calculating FMV, we used reported CV for products sold by Interfit in the United States during the POI.        Cost of Production        Interfit provided incomplete and inappropriate cost data for home market sales. Specifically, Interfit did not provide COP information for all comparison models sold in France during the POI. Furthermore, Interfit provided transfer prices for the main input into its pipe fittings. As this input was purchased from related parties, it is the Department's practice to use the cost of producing the input, rather than the transfer price. See     Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Venezuela     (58 FR 27522; 1993). Finally, the costs reported by Interfit did not reflect the specific time period requested by the Department.    Accordingly, we do not have the information necessary to make a determination whether Interfit's home market sales are being sold below the COP. In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act as best information available (``BIA'') we have determined that all sales in the home market were made at less than the COP and, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we have based foreign market value on CV.        Constructed Value          We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act, we (1) included the greater of Interfit's reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM, as appropriate, and (2) used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses for profit.    For comparisons to CV, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for differences in credit expenses between the two markets, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the rate respondent reported at which it could borrow in U.S. dollars during the POI. (For further discussions regarding the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation, please see September 26, 1994, Memorandum to Susan G. Esserman from Barbara R. Stafford on file in Room B099 of the Department of Commerce.) We have not made a deduction for the direct selling expenses reported by respondent. We have determined that these expenses (product liability premiums and inventory carrying costs) are, in fact, indirect selling expenses.    Because of the deficiencies in the cost data described above, we are requesting further information from Interfit. We also intend to verify that the prices paid by Interfit to its related suppliers are, in fact, at arms-length.    The CV data originally provided by Interfit did not cover all of the models sold by the company in the United States during the POI. On September 23, 1994, Interfit supplied the CV data for the remaining models. Because this information was not received in time to be used in this preliminary determination, we have used BIA for sales involving these models. As BIA, we have imputed the highest non-aberrational margin calculated from the CV information that Interfit submitted on September 6, 1994. (    See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products and Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Netherlands    , 58 FR 37199; July 9, 1993). In our final determination, we intend to use all the CV data submitted by Interfit so long as it can be verified.        Currency Conversion        We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.        Critical Circumstances        Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from France.

At the end of last year individuals owned 21.3 per cent of the share capital in UK companies, up from 20.6 per cent in 1989. Pension funds held the biggest stake in public companies registered on the London Stock Exchange, accounting for 34.7 per cent of total share capital valued at Pounds 620.6bn. In 1989 the stake held by pension funds was slightly lower at 30.5 per cent. According to an article in the latest edition of Economic Trends, published by the Central Statistical Office, the shareholding owned by insurance companies has decreased over the same period to 16.5 per cent from 18.5 per cent. Almost two thirds of the value of shares held by individuals at the end of December were in blocks of less than Pounds 100,000, and more than one quarter in holdings of less than Pounds 5,000. Individuals owned 24.5 per cent of shares in privatised companies, a higher figure than the proportion for the market as a whole. Overseas residents owned 12.1 per cent of total shares, worth about Pounds 75bn at the end of last year. People and organisations in the United States accounted for just under 50 per cent of overseas investment, while other European Community nations accounted for 17.5 per cent.

Merck reported a 6 per cent rise in sales in the final quarter, to Dollars 2.7bn, before the effects of the takeover of the Medco drug distribution business in November and the sale of the group's Calgon division. Sales for the year, up 6 per cent at Dollars 10.2bn excluding Medco, were held back by 'government cost control actions, primarily in Germany, strong competition in the US and the slowing growth in the cholesterol-lowering market, particularly in the US'. For the quarter, net income rose to Dollars 674m, or 56 cents a share, from Dollars 609m, or 53 cents, a year earlier. Without the earnings dilution due to the Medco acquisition, earnings per share in the latest quarter would have been 62 cents. Post-tax profits for the full year, before accounting changes, were Dollars 2.2bn, or Dollars 1.87, down 11 per cent from the year, although before restructuring charges and the effects of Medco they were 11 per cent ahead, at Dollars 2.7bn. Warner-Lambert saw a 7 per cent fall in pharmaceutical sales last year, to Dollars 2.1bn, 3 per cent of which was accounted for by the strong dollar. The results were also hit by a US regulators' ruling that forced the company to close temporarily its Puerto Rico manufacturing operations. Sales in Warner-Lambert's consumer products group, on the other hand, rose 11 per cent during the year. Warner-Lambert reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of Dollars 197m, or Dollars 1.46, after a previously announced Dollars 315m after-tax restructuring charge, compared with a profit Dollars 138m profit, or Dollars 1.02, the year before. For the year as a whole, net income before accounting changes was Dollars 285m, or Dollars 2.45, after total one-off charges for the year of Dollars 360m, against Dollars 644m, or Dollars 4.78, in 1992.

Currently, it is 96  million pounds (about 15 billion yen). It has acquired orders  for aluminum radiators for next-model compact cars such as VW  and Audi of Germany and Renault of France, as well as for the  locally produced cars of affiliates Nissan Motor and Honda Motor  and will gradually expand production beginning this fall.    Calsonic has received an order for the next model of the  compact car ""Concerto"" from Honda of UK Manufacturing (HUM), the  British production subsidiary of Honda Motor. HUM plans to  produce 50,000 units annually beginning in the latter half of  1994 in order to build an annual production system of 100,000  cars, and Suranesurii received the order for the whole quantity.    They will supply 130,000 units annually beginning this fall  for the next model of the ""Audi 80"" for Volkswagen-Audi of  Germany.    They also have received an order for radiators for  ""Netherlands Car"" (abbreviated Nedocar), the joint-venture  company between the Dutch Government-Volvo-Mitsubishi Motors,  and will supply 180,000 units annually. Production is scheduled  to begin in the middle of 1995. Since full production of the  Nedocar will be 200,000 units annually, the order is for almost  the whole quantity.    The next car type from Renault is the compact car ""Clio."" It  is scheduled to begin production in 1997, and they will supply  100,000 units annually. Since previously Valeo, a major parts  manufacturer of Europe, had the monopoly on Renault cars, they  have destroyed a corner of that by this order.    Since they are bolstering a substantial development and  production system in Europe, Calsonic is building a new research  and development center at Calsonic International Europe (CIE)  which is its general controlling company in Europe. The total  amount of the investment is about 2.2 million pounds. The  development system also will be increased from the current 70  people to 90 people.    Llanelli was purchased from Rover of Great Britain in 1989,  and is supplying the whole quantity of a little less than  200,000 units annually of the aluminum radiators for Nissan  Motor United Kingdom (NMUK). Llanelli still has a cumulative  deficit of close to 10 billion yen, but as the result of broad  sales expansion activities, the outlook is for it to be able to  liquidate it by 2000.     "

Sir Martin, former chairman of Barclays de Zoete Webb, said at the launch of the council's annual report that the government's efforts to reduce public expenditure plans threatened the grants made by the Foreign Office each year to support the efforts of the council, the main agency for promoting British culture and the English language overseas. He also warned that it might have to withdraw from some countries altogether if it lost the contracts for work on behalf of the Overseas Development Administration. The report showed the first real decline in turnover since the early 1980s. Income from the council's commercial network of language-teaching centres rose 17 per cent to Pounds 38m while income from agency work on behalf of other bodies fell 8 per cent. As a result, it withdrew from the Cote d'Ivoire and scaled down activities in the Nordic countries. It managed to harness funding from different sources, including increasing private-sector sponsorship from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 5.5m. Annual Report.

0,FT944-18195 ,"FT944-18195 _AN-EJED5AA3FT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / Industrial robots 'set to soar by one third': Potential for expansion enormous, says report      By FRANCES WILLIAMS      GENEVA   The world's industrial robot population is forecast to soar by more than a third over the four years to 1997, according to a report published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and the International Federation of Robotics yesterday.* The report, the first in an annual series, says sagging growth in robot investment bottomed out in 1993 and numbers are set to jump from 610,000 at the end of last year to more than 830,000 by the end of 1997. Annual sales are predicted to rise from about 54,000 units in 1993 to more than 103,000 units in 1997. Japan accounts for more than half the world's robot stock, equivalent to 325 robots for every 10,000 manufacturing workers. It is followed by Singapore (109), Sweden (73), Italy (70) and Germany (62). Use of robots is most widespread in the motor vehicle industry, which accounts for between a third and more than one-half of robots in use in countries such as France, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and Britain. Though Japan now has the highest number of robots in the electrical and electronic industry, it remains the world leader by far in the use of robots for vehicle manufacture. In the transport equipment sector, which includes motor vehicles, Japan has 1,000 robots for every 10,000 workers, compared with 167 in Sweden, 110 in France and 63 in Britain. In most countries, especially those with big motor vehicle industries, robots are used most frequently for welding. But in some countries machining is the most common application. In Japan 40 per cent of the robot stock is used for assembly, reflecting the large-scale use of robots in the electronic sector. The potential for expansion of robotics is enormous. Numbers would explode if other industrialised countries were to reach Japan's robot densities and if industry in general were to reach only half the robot density of the motor vehicle sector. If all industries in France and Britain had half as many robots as the motor industry in these countries, the robot stock would more than double. If it reached half the density of the Japanese motor vehicle industry, it would increase more than 20-fold. *World Industrial Robots 1994: Statistics 1983-93 and forecasts to 1997. Sales No. GV.

The results confirm Valeo as one of France's more successful companies. In the first six months of this year it was able to outperform the rest of the French car components sector by growing faster in the rest of the world. Turnover advanced 7 per cent in Europe, roughly in line with the general increase in car sales, but by 10 per cent in South America, 24 per cent in North America and 30 per cent in Asia. As a result, Valeo made 59.1 per cent of its sales outside France in the first half of this year, compared with 56.5 per cent in the same period of 1993. The company said it had increased gross margins, operating income and net profit, in spite of a rise in its tax rate, increased spending on RD and capital equipment, and unchanged restructuring charges. It also increased its foreign investments by nearly 10 times, to FFr330m in the first half by acquiring Borg Instruments in Germany and taking majority stakes in new subsidiaries and joint ventures in Argentina and China. With stronger cash flow and a capital increase, Valeo's debt to equity ratio stood at 5 per cent by the end of June, compared with 14 per cent last December and 23 per cent a year earlier.

Of the 1,159 cases, 211 are foreigners and Overseas Chinese  and 948 are Chinese. China has found 19 aids victims, 14 of  whom have died.    Most of the HIV/AIDS carriers in China are drug abusers or  returnees from abroad, said the official.    On the eve of ``World AIDS Day'', a national association of  sexually transmitted disease (STD) and AIDS control and  prevention was set up here.    Addressing the inaugural meeting of the association, Chen  Minzhang, minister of public health, said that the association  will help the government organize figures from various circles  to take part in STD and AIDS prevention activities. Meanwhile,  it will focus on health education, information exchange and  international cooperation on STD and AIDS control.    According to Chen, the Chinese Government has always  attached  importance to preventing and controlling the spread of STD and  AIDS. It has passed laws and regulations on prevention of AIDS  and STD, which have promoted the management, research,  surveillance and treatment of such diseases.    However, STD and AIDS epidemic areas are still expanding in  China. ``We lack publication and comprehensive management  measures on STD and AIDS prevention,'' said Chen.    He urged government departments at all levels and  communities  all over the country to undertake commitments in STD and AIDS  prevention and control. Meanwhile, he called for more  cooperation on AIDS control among different departments in the  country.     "

0,FT931-12256 ,"FT931-12256 _AN-DA3AKAEFFT 930129   FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Steel groups hit by fall in demand      By ARIANE GENILLARD and WILLIAM DAWKINS      MULHEIM, PARIS   TWO big European steel groups - Thyssen and Usinor Sacilor - made results announcements yesterday which underlined the weakness of demand within the industry. Thyssen, a German industrial and trading group as well as a significant steel producer, reported a 14 per cent fall in sales for the first quarter of this year, as it steel divisions suffered dramatic losses caused by falling demand and low prices. Incoming orders for the first quarter fell by 12 per cent to DM8.2bn (Dollars 5.4bn). Mr Heinz Kriwet, president, blamed the setback on the continued decline in the steel side which reported a 16 per cent fall in turnover for the quarter. Mr Ekkehard Schulz, president of Thyssen Stahl, said he did not expect results in the steel divisions to improve significantly in the second quarter of the year. Thyssen Stahl recently lost a contract with Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, for 30,000 tonnes of steel products to a consortium of steel producers including Klockner, the west German producer, Ecostahl of east Germany, Arbet of Luxembourg and Cockerill of Belgium. For the year ended September 1992, net profits for the Thyssen group tumbled to DM350m from DM520m a year earlier. Sales for the period were 2 per cent lower at DM35.7bn. The steel divisions lost money last year, but the group's other two main business showed improvements. Sales for Thyssen Industrie, Budd, the US subsidiary, and Wulfrather Gruppe climbed by 6 per cent to DM12bn for the year. Losses at Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steelmaker, last year fell to FFr2.4bn (Dollars 452m) from FFr3bn in 1991, the group estimated yesterday. The loss, which came on a 10.8 per cent decline in sales to FFr86.7bn reflects a continuing decline in steel demand and prices, said Mr Francis Mer, the chairman. Usinor Sacilor had trimmed output to adjust the fall in demand, but did not expect its result to improve in the first half of this year. However, it did expect to feel the benefits of price rises for flat steel products from the second quarter of 1993, said Mr Mer. The group reduced its workforce by just over 7,000 last year to 90,800. Of this, 4,400 were job losses in France, among the biggest workforce reductions in the French public sector and a serious worry to the government.   Companies:-  Usinor Sacilor.

In sterling terms, the rise was greater at 21 per cent. The comparative figures have been adjusted to remove the distorting effects of last year's non-recurring SFr48.6m reconstruction costs, following the group's its creation from the luxury businesses of Richemont, Rothmans and Dunhill. Turnover climbed 8 per cent to SFr1.25bn (SFr1.16bn). Operating profits were SFr203.3m (SFr181.4m). Sales in the Far East rose the sharpest - at 13 per cent to SFr469.1m (SFr416.7m), though Europe remains Vendome's main market. Here sales grew 8 per cent to SFr524.6m (SFr484.6m). Behind the Far Eastern performance lay stronger growth than previously from Japan - a result of a rise in tourism and a strong yen. Mr Joseph Kanoui, chairman, said: 'I'm proud Europe is our main market, but I would be as proud in five years to say the Far East had overtaken it.' The group is making inroads into China, where it already has four Dunhill stores and three Cartier. Lord Douro, deputy chairman, said there were more to come. Sales in the Americas slipped almost 2 per cent to SFr230.2m, though they rose by 5 per cent in dollar terms. The greatest fall was from the rest of the world, which includes the Middle East. Here sales declined 16 per cent to SFr28.5m. He was unworried by downturns in certain markets, however, saying the group's geographical spread was its protection. Mr Kanoui said the group continued to suffer counterfeiting at the hands of organised crime and imitation from other companies, though he was reluctant to give figures. He hoped the situation would improve with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which requires signatories to help protect intellectual property. Leather goods showed the strongest growth with sales up 22 per cent to SFR138.1m, while perfumes was the only sector down - by 13 per cent to SFr45.4m. Earnings rose 12 per cent to SFr0.248 and the maiden interim dividend is a gross SFr0.075, which shareholders can receive as a net UK pay-out of 2.9p, excluding any associated tax credit.

Rodriguez opens the debate by stating that measures  increasing prices and deregulating sales of cigarettes and rum  have significantly influenced the market and buyers.    Concepcion states that consumers and speculators have not  hoarded these products since they went on deregulated sale. He  adds that many people feared the cigarettes were stale but this  is not the case. The warehouses had stockpiled cigarettes to  ensure that supply would meet demand. Concepcion adds that  speculators are holding back, given that the media has reported  the factories have the conditions to continue producing 50  million cigarettes a day.    Rodriguez states the fight has been won as long as the  cigarette industry is able to maintain the flow of production.  Concepcion states that he believes that after years of  gratuities, the first big lesson the people have learned is to  be aware of home and personal finances. He adds that the basic  quota of four boxes has gone from costing 20 cents each to  costing 2 pesos each, and the two additional boxes were 1.6  pesos each and now cost six pesos each. Concepcion adds that rum  has gone from 7.2 pesos to 13.75 pesos, and that next September  the cost of electricity will increase and transportation and  water services have already been increased in order to mend the  national finances. He adds: ""We have to say it clearly. This  affects the people's pocket. The Cuban people will learn to  live on a budget, which is something we never thought about  because the state took care of us.""    Concepcion goes on to say that the current tobacco harvest  has been outstanding, adding: ""This year's tobacco crop is a  slap in the face to those who think that socialism is incapable  of organizing efficient agriculture.""    Rodriguez states that the measures have benefited smokers  because the black market can no longer charge 30 pesos for a box  because consumers can now buy three boxes for 30 pesos. He adds  that undoubtedly the people will have to learn to live on a  budget and that near the cigarette factory in Ranchuelo, people  are illegally selling cigarettes stolen from that factory in the  streets and that the factory's workers, management, party cell,  and union representatives have to solve that problem.    Rodriguez closes by stating that stealing from the cigarette  factories is widespread, adding: ""As long as this lack of  control prevails, we will not be able to sustain a stable  production.""

Sales, excluding the recently-acquired Rover group, rose 8.5 per cent to DM23.8bn (Dollars 15.9bn) at nine months, BMW said. This was 1.5 per cent higher than in the comparable part of 1992, when the full year's sales hit DM31.2bn, it added. The company, which last year saw net earnings tumble to DM516m from DM726m in 1992, reported a 14 per cent recovery to DM290m on a sales increase of 7.4 per cent in the first half of the current year. The group's share price jumped DM18 in early Frankfurt trading yesterday and closed DM12, or 1.6 per cent, higher on the day. The company's statement suggested production bottlenecks experienced in the spring had been cleared, and forecast demand would be further increased by new variants on the successful 3-Series, due shortly. While car production rose 5 per cent in the nine months to the end of September, deliveries to customers increased 7 per cent overall to 434,000, with a 13 per cent surge in the last month of the reporting period. Analysts at the Bayerische Vereinsbank calculated that production in the third quarter was more than 8 per cent up on the year-earlier period, while deliveries had risen 10 per cent. According to earlier data, world sales of BMW marque models were up only 5 per cent in the first seven months of the year. Deliveries in Germany, up only 2 per cent in the period to the end of July, were up 4 per cent after nine months, according to yesterday's statement. Sales elsewhere in Europe were in line with the overall market growth of 5 per cent so far. However, while deliveries in the UK rose 24 per cent to 39,000, those in the important Italian and French markets were unchanged at 24,200 and 18,700 respectively. US sales, up 13 per cent after six months, were still 10 per cent ahead at the end of the latest reporting period. At 63,500 vehicles, the nine-month total was only marginally short of BMW's US sales in the whole of 1993. Sales in Japan rose 8 per cent to 20,600, while 41 per cent growth in other south-east Asian markets took deliveries there to 17,400.   Companies:-  Bayerische Motoren Werke.

0,FT924-5710 ,"FT924-5710 _AN-CKYCPAEOFT 921125   FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Continental expecting healthy profit      By DAVID WALLER      FRANKFURT   CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, yesterday predicted that it would make a 'significant profit' for the 1992 year. Continental also said that profits for the first nine months of this year were considerably ahead of the same period last year, despite a noticeable slowdown in the third quarter. But the company released no actual profit figures. In the first nine months of the year, group sales climbed by 3.9 per cent to DM7.2bn (Dollars 4.5bn), the company said yesterday. Sales were on course to reach DM9.7bn for the 12 months, against DM9.38bn last year. Growth in turnover would have been higher but for currency movements and the deterioration in the world economy, the Hanover-based company said. The group had been expecting to achieve turnover of DM10bn this year. Last year, the group made net losses of DM128.2m, which was turned round to a profit of DM118m in the first six months of the current year. Yesterday's letter to shareholders from the company's management board said that third-quarter results were not up to the level achieved in the first half because of the economic downturn in Germany and abroad. Despite the slowdown, Continental said it foresaw no serious business difficulties in the rest of the year, although the business environment would become steadily more difficult in 1993. This would slow down the group's efforts to increase profitability. It said that General Tire, its loss-making subsidiary in the US, had managed to halve its losses during the first nine months, as planned. Sales had held up at the level of the previous year, at Dollars 1bn in local currency terms, although this represented a fall of 8 per cent to DM1.58bn in D-Mark terms. General Tire was likely to benefit from the anticipated revival of the US economy and was on course to make a profit next year, Continental said. The group said it would use every opportunity to compensate for an anticipated downturn in sales to domestic vehicle manufacturers by stepping up its export business and sales of replacement tyres.

0,FT942-1460 ,"FT942-1460 _AN-EFXC1ABIFT 940624   FT  24 JUN 94 / Reno to investigate US tobacco allegations      By JEREMY KAHN      WASHINGTON   The US Justice Department said yesterday it was examining allegations of criminal misconduct by the tobacco industry as a company executive hit back at charges that his company manipulates the level of nicotine in its cigarettes. Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, said her department's criminal, civil and anti-trust divisions were looking at 'all the allegations. . . to determine what would be the appropriate response'. The investigation follows charges by members of Congress that tobacco company executives lied under oath when they testified in April that they did not manipulate the nicotine level in their cigarettes, and that they did not know nicotine to be addictive. Mr Thomas Sandefur, chairman of Brown  Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of the UK's BAT Industries, denied that his company deliberately manipulated nicotine levels and misled the public. Mr Sandefur appeared before the congressional sub-committee which on Tuesday heard Mr David Kessler, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, allege that BW had secretly developed and commercialised a tobacco leaf with twice the nicotine of normal tobacco plants. Mr Kessler also accused the company of misleading FDA investigators who were looking into the high-nicotine leaf used by BW known as Y-1. Congress is attempting to determine whether cigarettes should be subject to FDA regulation on the grounds that nicotine is an addictive drug. Mr Sandefur and others in the tobacco industry claim that stringent FDA regulation will put 'the industry out of business.' Mr Sandefur accused Mr Kessler of leading 'a dangerous crusade' to advance his 'personal and political agenda' of banning tobacco products. He repeated his claim that nicotine is not addictive but struggled to convince sub-committee members, many of whom stated in their opening remarks that nicotine is a drug that should be subject to further government regulation. Mr Sandefur said BW did not instruct contract researchers working on Y-1 to mislead Mr Kessler's investigators about its existence and commercialisation. He said research was encouraged by the US Department of Agriculture in the 1970s.   Companies:-  Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT923-9277 ,"FT923-9277 _AN-CHJB0ACIFT 920806   FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nippondenso in 25% fall as car demand weakens      By GORDON CRAMB and REUTER      TOKYO   NIPPONDENSO, Japan's largest maker of electronic and electrical car parts which is affiliated to Toyota Motor, incurred a 25 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits to Y30.42bn (Dollars 239m) for the first half to June, showing the effects of declining domestic car demand. Sales rose 4.3 per cent to Y681.9bn, but the company blamed the fall in earnings partly on an increase in labour costs and research and development spending. It said profits would have been more than halved were it not for rationalisation moves and efficiency improvements already in place. Apart from Toyota - its main customer and 23 per cent controlling shareholder - Nippondenso supplies all Japan's other carmakers except Nissan. The industry is likely to have been seeking to squeeze supplier margins to help shield the car manufacturers from the downturn. For the full year, Nippondenso is projecting flat sales of Y1,350bn and taxable profits of Y65bn, down 21.7 per cent from the Y83bn achieved last year. Previously the company had expected to maintain or slightly improve on the 1991 level. Nippondenso said equipment investment would be cut to Y100bn from Y120bn last year and an originally budgeted Y126bn this time. A breakdown of its interim revenues showed the greatest gains in sales of electrical parts and electronic control products, its second largest segment. These showed a 7.2 per cent rise - Japanese makers have been packing their vehicles with technology as one effort to stimulate customer demand. Sales of car heaters and air conditioners, its mainstay representing more than one-third of business, were a bare 0.2 per cent higher. Daihatsu Motor, the Japanese compact car and minivan manufacturer, and Tianjin Automobile Industrial, the mainland Chinese carmaker, are considering setting up a joint venture, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Daihatsu, 14.7 per cent owned by Toyota Motor, already supplies technology and parts to Tianjin, while the Chinese company produces Daihatsu's Charade cars and Hijet commercial vehicles for the local market. It produced about 20,000 Charades and about 14,000 Hijets in 1991.  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

First, I would  appreciate it if you would briefly tell me about the your  personal history.    [Rong] I graduated from St. Johns University in Shanghai in  1937. Immediately after graduation, I got a job at a factory my  father operated. My father and my grandfather had been engaged  in business since 1901. They operated factories. They mainly  ran a flour mill and a spinning mill, which were regarded as  important national industries in China.    If we briefly follow China's modern history, we realize that  China has experienced the history of imperialism, feudalism, and  bureaucratic capitalism. I was born in 1916, and, since my  childhood, I have witnessed the confused days under the northern  warlords and the Kuomintang [KMT]. Particularly when the KMT  was in power, I witnessed how miserable and how confused the  Chinese people were.    Honestly speaking, for some time before the birth of New  China, I used to have strong expectations for the KMT  government. However, immediately before the birth of New China,  my expectations turned to disappointment. Also, as my parents  inspired me with the patriotic spirit, and as my father had  remained in China at that time, I was also determined to stay.  After China's liberation, my contact with the Communist Party  increased gradually and, by and by, I came to be very impressed  and attracted by the pragmatic attitude of the Communist Party's  leaders and the staff members in dealing with the problems and  in carrying out their duties. While observing their way of  doing things, which was totally different from the KMT's, my  opinion about the Communist Party changed gradually. Thus, I  have come to realize that socialism is the very structure that  can save New China.    Of course, I had to come through very hard experiences  during  the process. In China, we experienced the unique incident  called the Cultural Revolution -- I am sure you are very  familiar with its history. Yet, I have never lost my confidence  in the Communist Party because I firmly believe that the  Communist Party has been working for the people and for the  public. Such a belief has been supporting me when I was  personally in hardship. In 1978, after the Cultural Revolution,  the CPC held the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee and announced that it would change its policy and  emphasize construction of the economy. The Chinese people were  very glad to accept the proposal that all people should exert  themselves in carrying out economic construction. I was very  glad to hear the resolution as I had been interested in industry  and business since my younger days. I felt it was my duty to  contribute to the benefit of the people.    [Takano] It was your sense of duty that made you establish  CITIC [China International Trust and Investment Corporation],  was it not?    [Rong] In April 1979, Mr. Deng Xiaoping, who was vice  premier at that time, called me and several other All-China  Federation of Industry and Commerce [FIC] members and, on the  premise that China was going to carry out a policy of opening up  aimed at economic construction, we were asked to discuss the  meaning of the opening up policy, that is, to discuss how  important it was for China to carry out such a policy. At that  time, Mr. Deng Xiaoping requested that since we were well-known  members of the FIC, we should make the most of our experience  and cooperate with China in carrying out its opening up policy.  Particularly, he asked me to exert myself in introducing  foreign investment into China in the future.    Coming back from the meeting, I considered the theme over  and  over again, and my conclusion was that there might be two ways  we could take for the purpose of introducing foreign investment.  One was to establish an organization similar to the existing  governmental organization through which foreign investment was  to be introduced. The other was to establish an enterprise -- a  public corporation in Chinese words -- and to introduce foreign  investment in the form of issuing bonds in the enterprise's  name. I thought that, by all means, the better way was to  establish a company which will be able to procure funds through  broad contact with foreign enterprises, and I proposed my idea.  I organized CITIC upon obtaining the consent of Mr. Deng  Xiaoping and the State Council, who agreed that my idea was in  line with their's.    [Takano] Please let me ask a question or two. While it  seems to me that the friendly relations between Mr. Deng  Xiaoping and you was an important factor making it possible to  establishing CITIC, I am interested to know who was the first  leading member of the Communist Party with whom you became  intimate after liberation. In the first place, was it Mr. Deng  Xiaoping or Mr. Zhou Enlai with whom you first became very  intimate after liberation, or whose personality made you feel  that the Communist Party is rather acceptable?    [Rong] While I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Deng  Xiaoping from time to time at central government meetings, I  should say Marshal Chen Yi was the first Communist Party leader  I met. Then, of course, I had the opportunity of meeting with a  number of leaders such as Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou  Enlai, President Liu Shaoqi, and even Marshal Zhu De. In many  cases, I was urgently summoned to discuss China's government  policies. Thus, I have been associating with Communist Party  leaders for several scores of years.    I Do Not Agree With the ""Great China Economic Sphere""    [Takano] Though this is my assumption, your relatives are  scattered throughout the world creating a network. Has such a  network proved effective for development of CITIC?    [Rong] Though I suppose the network played its role to a  certain extent, I understand that the China Government's opening  up policy was the main cause for the development.    At first, to explain the idea of organizing CITIC, I  immediately visited, upon obtaining State Council approval,  Germany -- it was West Germany at that time -- France,  Switzerland, Japan, the United States, and Australia. To my  explanation that China was going to open up its door to foreign  countries, the foreign people accepted my explanation as very  fresh news, and told me it was an excellent determination for  China. I understand that the Chinese Government's opening up  policy is a very proper way for China's economic development,  making it possible to introduce and absorb foreign enterprises.    As you know, I was CITIC chairman before I became PRC vice  president, and I feel that the PRC Government's opening up  policy was one of the motive powers which helped CITIC develop  to its present level. Another motive power was the effort  exerted by all CITIC staff members. The third motive power was  the fact that foreign enterprises had become fully confident  that the PRC's opening up policy would never be changed in the  future.    [Takano] My next question refers to the comment you just  made. Particularly since 1991 and 1992, large business groups  consisting of so called ""huaqiao"" [Overseas Chinese] and  ""huaren"" [people of Chinese descent] have been actively  expanding their investments in China. A world conference of  Chinese businessmen will be held in Hong Kong at the end of  November 1993. What do you think is the role to be played by  the Overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent living abroad  in achieving China's economic development, and in promoting  CITIC's business activities?    [Rong] Generally speaking, the Overseas Chinese problem is  very complicated. We use the expression ""huaren"" for those  Overseas Chinese who have obtained the citizenship of the  countries where they live, and we hope they engage in their  business abiding by the laws of the countries where they live.  They are of course welcome if they want to contribute to their  motherland through their business activities and investments.    We use the expression ""huaqiao"" for those Chinese living in  foreign countries who have not obtained the citizenship of the  host country. We also want them to carry out their business  firmly abiding by the laws of the respective countries. Of  course, they are welcome to exert themselves for the benefit of  their motherland.    As to the world conference of Chinese businessmen to be held  in Hong Kong you referred to earlier, I understand it is the  second conference. The first was held in Singapore. We did not  originally propose the conference.    [Takano] Recently, Japanese newspapers and magazines have  frequently been using the expression, ""great China economic  sphere."" It is a very common recognition in Japan that  something like an invisible economic sphere is being formed by  the network of Overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent  taking part in the Chinese economy's development, which is  considered a very important factor in supporting the future  development of China's economy. Because of your position, I feel  that you are using a discreet expression, being afraid that it  might be taken as a Chinese threat if the Chinese merchants'  power became too strong throughout the world. Yet, what is your  opinion about the potential of an ""invisible economic network""?    [Rong] Let me explain my opinion from two points.    First, I want to take the example of Taiwan. Taiwan is part  of China. Hong Kong is to be returned to China in 1997. Macao  is also to be returned to China in 1999. To me, it seems very  natural that these three areas keep very close economic  relations with China. From such a standpoint, we are hoping to  maintain cooperative relations with the respective areas, and to  exchange opinions as to how to attain mutual development.    Second, as I just referred to the problem of Overseas  Chinese  and people of Chinese descent, we do not want to use the  expression ""great China economic sphere,"" and we do not agree  with such an idea.    Macrocontrol Should Be Strengthened    [Takano] By the way, it seems that the Chinese economy has  developed too rapidly, creating an overheated situation, or  creating a bubble economy-like condition in the real estate  field. What is your opinion about the present situation and the  problem points of the Chinese economy?    [Rong] The shift from the planned economy to a market  economy is a very serious conversion creating various problems  during the process. Yet, it is considered natural and  inevitable that such problems are taking place. Since China is  totally unfamiliar with a socialist market economy, having  absolutely no experience in history, and as there is no such  example in foreign countries from which we can learn lessons,  the PRC Government is groping, or trying to find a way, as  development is taking place. Problems always occur in the  process, and it may be inevitable for us to keep moving while  repeating this problem-solving process.    In the process of development, every district throughout the  country became more enthusiastic, making active investment and  exerting themselves for the betterment of enterprises. Although  such enthusiasm is understandable, the only problem is that the  people tend to be hasty and to expect a quick return, thus  creating an overheated condition or, in certain fields, making  excessive investments. China being, originally, a developing  country, its economic structure is not so well-balanced.  Therefore, if an excessive investment takes place at a  particular field, it will create a further imbalance in the  economic structure which was originally out of balance.  Particularly, there has been an active request for investment  in various fields, creating a further shortage of funds. On the  other hand, however, we even experienced confusion in the  monetary order because the Chinese legal system is imperfect.    Also, it is my opinion that the real estate sector, which  you  referred to before as being overheated, is a sector in China  which should be further developed. However, as there is no  established commercial practice [concerning real estate  transactions] in China, the real estate market has been left  uncontrolled, bringing about the rise of real estate prices with  only a few people monopolizing the business. Therefore, the  Chinese Government has decided to employ a macropolicy to  strengthen macrocontrol. I think the situation has been  improved to some extent.    [Takano] I suppose that the introduction of foreign  investment will play a more important role for China's future  development. Though investment from all over the world will  naturally be welcome to China, which countries do you think most  preferable to make investment in China?    [Rong] As we are taking an omnidirection policy in opening  up our door to foreign countries, any country is welcome as long  as it is willing to cooperate with China for mutual development.  Since China is a developing country, we want to promote, based  on our open policy, economic exchanges with foreign countries;  and we think it will be wonderful if, for instance, we can  improve our managerial skills through introduction of advanced  scientific technologies.    We would like to cooperate with Japan, the United States,  and  Europe. However, in view of the geological location and the  cultural history, it is considered easier and more convenient  for China to establish a cooperative relation with Japan. Yet,  as far as we see the present amount of investment by country,  the United States ranks at the top, exceeding Japan. I  earnestly hope that the Japanese investors will invest more in  China.    The People Enjoy the Benefits of the Opening Up Policy    [Takano] I understand that the Chinese Government is  exerting efforts in various ways to solve the problem of  economic differentials between the coastal and inland areas,  which have recently tended to expand. Are you also trying to  ensure, domestically, a well-balanced distribution of funds  invested by foreign countries?    [Rong] It is true that China's opening up policy is being  applied to the coastal areas first, and is to be gradually  spread to the inner areas. Particularly, it is necessary to  develop the social infrastructure in the inner areas. However,  it requires a vast amount of investment, also necessitating a  very long period for redemption. We intend to gradually improve  the investment environment, keeping pace with the promotion of  the opening up policy.    [Takano] In Japan, we use the expression ""post-Deng  Xiaoping."" Some people are afraid that political and economic  confusion might take place in China with the end of the Deng  Xiaoping era. May I frankly ask you about your opinion on this  point?    [Rong] China has attained its development centering around  economic construction, and the people's standard of living has  been further improved during the process. Around 1978, ""the  Three Sacred Treasures"" of the Chinese people were a bicycle, a  radio, and a sewing machine. Recently, they are a television, a  refrigerator, and a washing machine. Presently, the standard of  living has been further elevated with an air-conditioner, a  piano, and a camera becoming necessities of life for all the  people.    Since the fruits of China's opening up policy are being most  enjoyed by the people, it is certain that the people will oppose  Chinese Government leaders unless they continue to promote  economic construction. Of course, there may be a variety of  opinions among individual people, which should be considered  natural.    [Takano] Thank you very much.     "

0,FT944-821 ,"FT944-821 _AN-ELWCWADRFT 941223   FT  23 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Tequila sunset   Emerging markets enthusiasts have been faced with the prospect of a nightmare before Christmas. The Mexican devaluation set off a whiff of panic that spread from central America all the way to Argentina. With hindsight, the Mexican devaluation seems inevitable. The country funded its huge current account deficit through capital from abroad, especially the US. Foreign investors were content to provide funds as long as they ran no currency risk - the peso was pegged to the US dollar - and Mexican interest rates were double those in the US. But a combination of higher US rates and Mexican political crises reversed the flow of funds. With the government's limited foreign currency reserves quickly running out, the logical response was a devaluation capable of correcting the deficit by cutting imports and boosting exports. The theory of devaluation was economically justified, but poorly executed. The subsequent debacle threatens to scatter six years of stability to the winds. Overseas investors have taken a bath. While the equity market may have weathered yesterday better than expected, the peso's fall knocked another 10 per cent off the value of foreign investors' portfolios. Future prospects are not rosy. Corporate earnings in the final quarter will suffer from increased financial charges on their dollar debt, while economic growth could slow because of increased interest rates. Bargain hunters may return once the currency has stabilised, but bruised investors may well conclude Latin America remains as unreliable as ever.   Countries:-  MXZ  Mexico.

The explanation comes in two words - part time. While it is true that the UK has the second highest rate of female participation in the labour force, this is because we have so many part-timers. In all EC countries, married women are more likely to work part-time than non-married women. But in the UK, 53 per cent of married female employees worked part-time in 1988 (last year for which figures available) compared with an EC average of 37 per cent. A significant proportion of part-time working women would prefer to work full time, but are prevented from doing so by the lack of affordable quality childcare. The UK is also different from its EC neighbours in that 34 per cent of fathers of children under 10 worked more than 50 hours a week, the highest total in the EC. Women in Britain work out of necessity. But the lack of affordable childcare means that for most women a life of low-paid, part-time work is substituted for the prospect of a long and successful career.

But the company said it was continuing discussions with Paramount and with other US media groups with a view to smaller acquisitions in individual divisions. The privately-owned German group had been rumoured as a potential buyer for Paramount because of its healthy financial position and its desire to expand in the electronic media field. The group has repaid all its debt and has accumulated liquid funds totalling DM425m. Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive of the board, said Paramount was 'too expensive' and that such a 'grandiose investment was beyond imagination'. He stressed that it would be incompatible with Bertelsmann's conservative investment approach. 'We will stick by our policy of a step-by-step approach, of controlled growth, which has ensured our prosperity,' he said. Meanwhile, operating profits for the year to June 30 grew by 20 per cent to DM1.43bn, with worldwide sales rising 6.5 per cent to DM17bn. Net income rose 16 per cent to DM660m. Bertelsmann achieved its highest growth in its music division which includes the Arista Records company of the US. Sales for the division, which accounts for a third of total, turnover rose 13 per cent to DM4.42bn. Gruner + Jahr, the second-largest division which comprises newspapers and magazines, recorded a 4 per cent rise in sales to DM3.75bn. Book clubs, with 23m subscribers worldwide, continued to show good results. Sales of the printing and manufacturing division were down 3 per cent to DM2.99bn, mainly due to a fall in the price of paper. In electronic media, gratifying results came from RTL, the largest private channel in Germany. But Vox, the private television venture featuring a mix of news and general programmes and launched at the beginning of the year was disappointing. Premiere, the only pay-TV channel in Germany, was due to break even this autumn, the company said. Bertelsmann stressed it had achieved particularly good results in the US with Bantam Doubleday Dell, the publishing group reporting profits for the year. The company is 68.8 per cent owned by the Bertelsmann Foundation, with the remaining equity mostly in the hands of the founding family. Mr Wossner said the current business year would be more difficult because of the general recession, but results similar to those recorded in 1992-93 could be expected.   Companies:-  Bertelsmann.

The company said Finland's prolonged economic recession and weak markets in other countries were to blame. In particular, it highlighted continuing pressure on its fertiliser business, which has been hit by low domestic demand and lower prices in Europe due to cheap east European imports. It is likely to close two operations in Finland with the loss of 340 jobs. The company says it is encouraged by increased demand for titanium dioxide and a better performance from its chemicals unit. It expects results in the final four months, helped by a pick-up in Finnish fertiliser sales and a lower relative depreciation charge, to be better than last year. The group still says its full-year result will be 'clearly negative' and may equal last year's FM522m loss. Sales for the whole year are estimated at FM11bn. NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, suffered a loss of FM914m (Dollars 196m) for the first eight months, its first deficit since 1986. The result compares with a FM388m profit in the same period in 1991. Sales rose marginally to FM36.4bn from FM36.1bn. The group said the downturn in the world economy had an impact on its main oil refining, petrochemicals and plastics activities. Neste Oil, the group's largest business area, boosted sales to FM29.7m from FM29.5m, but profits were hit by lower international refining margins and inventory losses. The group's figures were also affected by lower petrochemical and plastics prices and by the impact of weaker freight rates on its shipping division. Neste said its operating result was likely to hold steady over the last four months of the year.  The Financial Times   London Page 31  "
0,FT931-10624 ,"FT931-10624 _AN-DBIBDAA1FT 930208   FT  08 FEB 93 / The Week Ahead   RESULTS DUE THE RESULTS season springs to life on Thursday with a handful of the UK's largest companies reporting. British Petroleum's figures should show it has begun to recover from its recent nadir. Having halved the 4.2p quarterly dividend at the half-way stage, a further 2.1p is expected for the final quarter, making 10.5p (16.8p) for the year. With historical cost profits of Pounds 100m forecast for the final quarter, losses for the year are expected to be Pounds 487m (profits Pounds 1.2bn). Last year, BP heavily restructured management and operations while chemical markets remained poor, refining was mediocore and upstream operations went well thanks to the dollar and increased output. After several quarters of negative cashflow, it is expected to have been cash neutral in the final quarter. Lloyds Bank, which has been most profitable of the clearing banks in recent years, announces its full-year results for 1992 on Friday. It is the first big clearing bank to report after bringing forward its announcement by two weeks. Analysts anticipate pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 650m after last year's Pounds 645m, but one estimate is of Pounds 745m. Provisions for possible bad and doubtful debts are estimated at between Pounds 650m and Pounds 870m, against Pounds 918m in 1991. Reuters, the international news and information group, is expected tomorrow to reveal an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 340m to Pounds 380m for the year to December. Given that Reuters is sitting on a cash pile of Pounds 700m, there has been some speculation that there will be a substantial hike in the dividend - or even a special payment. However, most interest will centre on the group's view of the trading outlook: a cautious statement at the interim stage gave the highly-rated shares a knock. BT unveils its third quarter results on Thursday against intense speculation that it intends to advance its ambitions in global communications services by spending up to Dollars 5bn for a stake in Electronic Data Systems, the computing services arm of General Motors. Excitement over rumours of the deal, on which neither company will comment, is likely to overshadow the trading figures which are expected to indicate BT's resilience in tough trading conditions. Pre-tax profits are expected to be Pounds 720m-Pounds 750m (Pounds 759m a year earlier). Analysts will be watching call volume closely as an indicator of the way the economy is moving.

0,FT933-15516 ,"FT933-15516 _AN-DGHCRAE0FT 930708   FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Bespak to Pounds 11.5m and shares jump 56p      By CATHERINE MILTON   SHARES IN Bespak jumped 56p to 518p as the medical valve and component maker reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.92m to Pounds 11.5m in the year to end-April. The outcome reflected a first full-year contribution from US-based Tenax Corporation, which moulds plastic medical components and was bought from private owners for Pounds 33.1m in March 1992. The US company contributed about Pounds 4.8m to operating profits of Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 6.79m). Group turnover, including the acquisition, improved to Pounds 61.8m (Pounds 38.8m) and operating margins from 17.5 to 18.3 per cent. Mr Bob King, chairman and chief executive, said sales of pharmaceutical valves were slow in the first six months due to significant customer de-stocking, but overall sales of pharmaceutical products had risen 16 per cent during the year. Sales of devices for laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) improved on the previous year, but increased competition and de-stocking caused a fall in business towards the end of the year. He said sales from Tenax and Bespak's rest-of-world operations grew at more than 10 per cent: 'Despite recent concerns about the healthcare market, there is a growing need in all developed healthcare markets for medical devices and systems that will safely dispense powerful drugs.' Interest receivable rose to Pounds 199,000 (Pounds 134,000). A proposed final dividend of 6p makes a 10p (9p) total. Earnings per share rose to 31.9p (24.8p). COMMENT Bespak is good at safely delivering drugs to patients. Now it is working on delivering profits to shareholders after analysts downgraded forecasts in April and the shares fell sharply. Yesterday's share price jump signalled returning confidence in the company's fundamental strengths. Its products have secure market niches and it has taken steps to broaden its once narrow customer base. Sales to Glaxo are now under 25 per cent of total turnover compared with more than 70 per cent a few years back. However, demand is changing as patents expire on the drugs its devices deliver and generic suppliers invade the market. Even so, Bespak products might be used by the new drug suppliers. Meanwhile, continued demand for its main products - drug valves for asthmatics and components for laparoscopy - is virtually assured. On a prospective p/e of 13.8 the shares look cheap compared to previous highs of 15 or 16 which the market expects to see again.   Companies:-  Bespak.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-1627 ,"FT941-1627 _AN-ECXDCAE5FT 940324   FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: UK retailing operation proves to be an uphill struggle for Kingfisher      By PEGGY HOLLINGER   The high street proved to be an uphill struggle for Kingfisher last year, as it revealed lower than expected profits from most of its UK retail divisions in its results yesterday. The most severe difficulties were encountered at Woolworths, which recently saw the departure of its managing director. 'The simple fact is that after a very good first half in toys, Woolworths overbought,' said Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman. The division was forced to cut prices substantially to get rid of stock. Woolworths was further hit by an unexpected collapse in the video consoles and games market, which forced a profits warning from both Kingfisher and its rival, Dixons, earlier this year. Although he would not quantify the extent of the damage inflicted by these events, Sir Geoffrey said it was substantially greater than the Pounds 3.3m decline in profits to Pounds 74.5m. Sales were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 1.3bn. Sir Geoffrey stressed that other lines that Woolworths offered were up to expectations. 'Excluding toys and games, gross profit rose by 10 per cent in the second half,' he said. Superdrug also had a difficult year, with operating profit falling by 9.5 per cent to Pounds 31.5m. However, sales were 5 per cent up at Pounds 617m, with a 2.5 per cent increase in comparable turnover. Sir Geoffrey attributed the profits decline to disruption caused by a shift in focus. In future the division would concentrate on personal care products, moving away from household and grocery ranges. BQ, the Do-It-Yourself retailer, did better, with profits rising from Pounds 81.1m to Pounds 82m, on sales 10 per cent higher at Pounds 1.15bn. Like-for-like sales were 4 per cent ahead. Sir Geoffrey said the improvement at BQ proved Kingfisher's strategy of every day low prices was working. Darty, the French electricals retailer acquired last year for Pounds 1bn, had proved resilient in a difficult market, Sir Geoffrey said. Sales for the relevant eight months were down by 2.7 per cent to Pounds 694m, and operating profits 6 per cent lower at Pounds 79.2m. However, the sales performance compared well with the overall decline of 4.3 per cent in the French electricals market, Sir Geoffrey said. Comet's profits fell by 7 per cent to Pounds 16.4m on sales 6 per cent higher at Pounds 526m. A sharp fall in sales in the second half held back the like-for-like advance to 0.7 per cent.

The British Tourist Authority's annual survey of foreign visitors found that French and Italian visitors were more dissatisfied than tourists of other nationalities with Britons' inability to speak foreign languages. The survey found that 55 per cent of visitors last year thought London public transport provided good value, compared with 50 per cent in 1992. Prices in shops won the approval of 47 per cent, compared with 35 per cent in 1992. Meals were regarded as good value by 42 per cent, compared with only 28 per cent in 1992. Hotel accommodation outside London won the approval of only 21 per cent, however, up from 19 per cent in 1992. London hotels were regarded as good value by 17 per cent, compared with 12 per cent in 1992. Western European visitors who did not speak English expressed high levels of dissatisfaction with the foreign language abilities of officials and staff in the facilities they visited. Non-English-speaking visitors from other countries, on the other hand, were generally happy with the foreign language abilities of staff and officials. The BTA said: 'Increasing European integration is probably making west European visitors less tolerant of the British lack of linguistic ability than before.' Overseas Visitor Survey 1993.

0,FT942-15472 ,"FT942-15472 _AN-EDOC4AA0FT 940415   FT  15 APR 94 / US tobacco companies go on defensive      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   US tobacco companies yesterday denied that cigarettes were addictive or that they manipulated the nicotine levels in their products, as they tried to defend themselves against a ferocious assault by members of Congress. 'Cigarette smoking is not addictive,' said Mr William Campbell, president of Philip Morris USA, one of the leading tobacco industry executives who appeared before a House of Representatives health committee. The industry faces a three-pronged assault with potentially devastating consequences for its future. The US Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to regulate nicotine as an addictive drug - a move that could lead to a ban on cigarettes containing nicotine - and the Labour Department has proposed a ban on smoking in all US workplaces, including restaurants and bars, because of the deaths caused by second-hand smoke. Also, the tax on cigarettes is likely to leap from 24 to 99 cents (16p to 67p) a pack, to help pay for the reform of the US healthcare system. The committee chairman, Congressman Henry Waxman, opened the ill-tempered and confrontational hearing yesterday by requiring the tobacco executives to testify under oath. 'This hearing marks the beginning of a new relationship between Congress and the tobacco companies,' Mr Waxman said, before beginning a hostile cross-examination of the industry representatives. The executives denied manipulating the level of nicotine to keep smokers hooked even when they switch to lower-tar cigarettes. Under close questioning from Mr Waxman, all panies admitted they could adjust the concentration of nicotine in their cigarettes through blending different tobaccos. All, however, said that they did not aim for any particular nicotine level through the blending. 'We do not design our cigarettes with any specification for nicotine. We design them for tar levels,' said Mr James Johnston, chief executive of R J Reynolds. But Mr Waxman said a study by Mr Alexander Spears, now vice-chairman of Lorillard, another cigarette company, showed in 1981 that the tobacco industry had deliberately aimed to raise nicotine levels in low-tar cigarettes. Mr Spears yesterday told Mr Waxman that he had totally misunderstood the evidence. RJR share move, Second Section   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The group also announced it would increase its steel prices by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on April 1, depending on the products, and by an additional 5 per cent on July 1. The increases would return prices to their July 1992 levels, Mr Wolfgang Kohler, a member of the board, said. Low steel prices have been blamed for helping to push European steel groups into recession. Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman of the board, welcomed British Steel's recent decision to increase prices, calling it 'a step in the right direction'. Thyssen Stahl Group was formed last October following the merger of Thyssen Stahl and Thyssen Edelstahl, the special steel division, in an attempt to cut costs and restructure production. Mr Schulz said that the merger could save at least DM200m. Pre-tax profits at Thyssen Stahl dropped for the fiscal year ending September 30 1992 to DM158m from DM651m in the previous 12 months. All of the group's divisions were in the red, except for those producing stainless steel and rails, Mr Schulz said. Thyssen Edelstahl recorded a DM313m loss against a DM63m deficit in the previous year. Sales dropped by 8 per cent to DM3.1bn. Sales of long products dropped by 6 per cent in the first quarter of the fiscal year to September 30 1993. Mr Karl-Heinz Rosener, director of Thyssen Edelstahl's board, said this was due to over-capacity in Europe, which had led to a 'ruinous price war.' Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, which manufacture long steel products, were accused by the German company of 'dumping' products in the European Community. Further job cuts are expected as part of the new group's restructuring efforts. Nearly 4,000 workers will be laid off over the current fiscal year. Group redundancies are expected to reach 8,000 by September 30, 1994. The group already has nearly 12,000 employees on part-time work. The consolidated group's total labour force is 57,500. Mr Schulz also called on the EC to devise pan-European measures to reduce capacity and to reduce subsidies enjoyed by some European steel producers. He added that the recent prognosis by the German Steel Association, which predicted that crude steel production in western Germany would drop by 5 per cent in 1993 to 35m tonnes, was 'too optmistic'.

0,FT943-12830 ,"FT943-12830 _AN-EGVDMAEUFT 940722   FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Car safety fears behind First Technology advance      By ANDREW BOLGER   Mounting concern over vehicle safety helped First Technology, which supplies sensors and crash dummies to the car industry, sharply increase profitability. Pre-tax profits jumped by 76 per cent to Pounds 4.1m in the year to April 30. Sales were 31 per cent higher at Pounds 34m, with overseas sales accounting for 89 per cent of the total. The shares rose 14p to 319p. The automotive electronics division, which accounts for 75 per cent of profits and turnover, benefited from strong car sales in America and the rapid growth of new business in Europe. Sales were up 43 per cent. The group said its fuel cut-off sensors were being fitted by Fiat, Peugeot/Citroen and one other unnamed manufacturer, which together could eventually add up to a total of 5m vehicles a year. The safety and crash division, which supplies dummies to manufacturers, increased profits on only marginally-increased sales. The group said the current year had started well. New product launches included child dummies and a pregnant woman. First Technology said that in North America and certain parts of Europe, including the UK, key economic indicators looked good for the medium term. In most markets, the economic position was finely poised between recession and the first signs of recovery. Mr Fred Westlake, chairman, said: 'Overall, we believe the outlook is more encouraging than it has been for a considerable period of time.' He said the group was interested in developing its sensor business in Japan  -probably through a joint venture or licensing arrangement with a local manufacturer. Earnings per share increased by 61 per cent to 17.33p (10.75p). A final dividend of 2.5p makes a total for the year of 3.5p (1p). COMMENT Car safety trends seem to be going First Technology's way, and an increasing number of European manufacturers are joining the US leaders in fitting the group's fuel cut-off sensor to their vehicles. The fall in gearing from 52 per cent to 19 per cent means the group can even consider making acquisitions again, although only closely related business would be considered. A more immediate prospect is expansion through a joint venture in Japan, where the group currently has no exposure. Forecast profits of Pounds 4.7m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 16 - in line with the sector. Given the orders outlook, they look good value - and the group's niche market position could also make it an attractive acquisition target.   Companies:-  First Technology.

0,FT941-3220 ,"FT941-3220 _AN-ECQDGAB1FT 940317   FT  17 MAR 94 / Sales fall as shoppers wait for tax rises      By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff   An abrupt fall in shop sales last month appeared to confirm that consumers are holding back spending ahead of higher taxes in April. But a significant upwards revision of January's figure means that the overall message from yesterday's official retail sales figures is ambiguous. The Central Statistical Office said that in February, sales volumes fell by 0.5 per cent on the month, to stand 2.5 per cent up on a year ago. This was the slowest year-on-year growth rate since May last year and compared with a rate of 3.7 per cent in the year to January. However, January's provisional increase in sales of 0.6 per cent was revised upwards to 0.9 per cent, one of the strongest monthly rises in the last 12 months. Earlier this week, the CBI's distributive trades survey showed two consecutive months of slowing retail sales growth. That, together with yesterday's official February figure may add to government concerns that tax increases next month will take the wind out of the recovery. On the other hand, the trends in the latest three months indicate that there is enough momentum in consumer demand to weather the effects of fiscal tightening. In the three months to February the volume of sales was 0.6 per cent higher than in the previous three months, and 3.4 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. The only sector that saw a rise in sales in February was food retailing, up 0.7 per cent after a flat January. The 'other non-food' category - which covers the more discretionary side of spending - suffered the biggest drop in sales. It fell 1.2 per cent on the month, and within this category, household goods - big ticket items - dropped 1.6 per cent, after a 3.5 per cent rise in January. Mixed retail sales volumes fell 1 per cent. Sales by clothing and footwear retailers fell 0.4 per cent in February, reversing January's 0.3 per cent rise. Yesterday's figures received mixed interpretations from analysts. Economists at James Capel said the figures show that spending was being increasingly concentrated in months such as January, when discounts are available, at the expense of February. Since the CSO's seasonal adjustment was unlikely to pick this trend up, the official data probably overstated the true level of sales in January and understated them in February. The British Chambers of Commerce said the figures show that the economy was performing better now than a year ago.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

This is thought to be one of the first attempts by a US cigarette manufacturer to litigate against 'anti-smoking' laws outside the US, and comes as the industry faces increasing pressure from regulators at home and in the international market. The company said it filed a statement of claim because the restrictions imposed by the 1992 Commonwealth Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act were 'so wide-ranging that they deny it the right to take part in debate on political, public and social issues and deny it the normal commercial freedom of speech. 'Important issues of freedom of speech are at stake because the restrictions deny us the right to communicate on political, public and commercial issues,' said Mr David Davies, vice-president at Philip Morris. The 1992 Act made tobacco advertising illegal in Australia from the middle of last year. It will also phase out cigarette sponsorship of sporting events by the mid-1990s unless exemptions are obtained. Existing sponsorship contracts were allowed to run their course. When the legislation was introduced, federal health officials claimed that about 18,000 Australians died each year from tobacco-related diseases and the drain on health services amounted to about ADollars 6.8bn (Pounds 3.3bn) a year. Some 28 per cent of Australians are estimated to be smokers. Philip Morris claimed yesterday its decision to proceed with a lawsuit came last month, after it tried to recall some promotional cigarette lighters, which were thought to be faulty. It said some Australian media groups claimed initially that they could not publish the recall advertisement for fear of breaching the federal law. After a brief delay, modi-fied advertisements were accepted. Philip Morris, which is under assault from the anti-smoking lobby in the US, employs about 4,000 people in Australia and says it pays more than ADollars 1bn in taxes and licence fees to state and federal governments.

0,FT942-17135 ,"FT942-17135 _AN-EDFDMAFNFT 940406   FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tobacco growers abandon their pipe dreams - Caution is the watchword for this year's Zimbabwe auctions      By TONY HAWKINS   Zimbabwe's flue-cured tobacco auction auction season open today at a time when, in the words of one marketing expert: 'There's a lot of pessimism around'. Growers and buyers alike predict a cautious, soft start to the sales after last year's shocks, when growers could hardly believe how little was paid for good quality tobacco. In the first four weeks of the 1993 sales, flue-cured tobacco prices averaged 97 US cents a kilogram, little more than half the 189 cents of a year earlier. Even after the mid-season recovery, the record 218.5m kg crop averaged only 123 cents a kilogram, 62 per cent below the record level of 1991 and 25 per cent less than was paid for low-quality, drought-stressed leaf in 1992. Last year, growers misread the market badly, having convinced themselves that the low 1992 price was a reflection on the poor quality of the offerings rather than growing oversupply in the world market. Accordingly, many went for volume, only to find their margins cut to the bone as costs continued to mount while prices tumbled. They now accept that 1991 was a freak year and that market fundamentals are now far more negative than three years ago. Accordingly, output has been cut by more than 20 per cent to about 172m kg. Quality is harder to assess at this juncture. Although the season started well, tobacco growing areas received only about 80 per cent of normal rainfall, while just one region enjoyed above-average moisture. Climatic conditions were very variable, deteriorating in the last six to eight weeks of the growing season, when the rains cut off early amid abnormally hot conditions. This was a godsend for some growers in the north who, up to then, had had too much rain; but it was a serious setback to the quality of leaf for many others. Both growers and buyers are predicting a soft start to the sales. Manufacturers, who are carrying substantial stocks, will be in no hurry to secure their supplies, says one leading tobacco merchant, pointing out that the nature of the Zimbabwe sales has changed with the advent of high domestic interest rates. The big players - the five multinationals that dominate the market - borrow offshore at low, hard-currency interest rates. The local merchants used to play a speculative role, buying up to a quarter of the crop in the early part of the season and selling it on to manufacturers at firmer prices later on in the year. But with high local interest rates - 30 per cent and more - and little likelihood of further significant depreciation of the Zimbabwe dollar following the 17 per cent January devaluation, there is little incentive to speculate, especially at a time when global oversupply is estimated at around 275m kg. Today there are two quite distinct markets for flue-cured leaf - a quality market dominated by the US, Brazil and Zimbabwe - and a much larger market for fillers and lower quality tobaccos, which is where the main oversupply has arisen. Like Zimbabwe, Brazil and the US have cut production, but new factors are depressing demand, including President Clinton's latest onslaught on the US industry, the price war in the US cigarette market - forcing manufacturers to seek low-priced supplies wherever possible - and Washington's new protectionism. Last year, the US Congress approved legislation limiting tobacco imports to 25 per cent of total usage by manufacturers, and, because tobacco is a politically incorrect commodity, this has drawn little criticism from the fair trade lobby. The US quota means that new markets will have to be found for most of the 36m kg that Zimbabwe exported to the US last year along with Brazil's 70m kg. Third world exporters hope, however, that US manufacturers will make their cigarettes offshore, as in the case of Phillip Morris in Turkey, using leaf from Brazil, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in preference to higher-priced US tobacco. Mr Chris Molam, Chief Executive of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association, which represents the country's 1,660 commercial growers, says: 'If we can get our tobacco into these offshore-manufactured blends, then we are on our way'. There are marketing problems at home too. With one buyer - the US-based Universal group - building up, partly by taking over smaller operators, a 45 per cent market share at the Harare sales, growers complain that the auctions have become less competitive than they were. This year, however, there will be new faces in the buying line with the admission of the domestically-owned Boka group of companies. Mr Boka, a black Zimbabwean political heavyweight, with little business muscle, hopes, with strong government support, to build market share at the auctions, and 'indigenise' what has always been a white-dominated activity. More competition in the buying line can only be good for the growers, but there are worries about the quality of that buying and the potential for price volatility. The consensus view - and last year the consensus was wildly optimistic - is that the price will harden modestly at the 1994 sales, averaging at least USDollars 1.35 a kilogram (up 10 per cent) and possibly as much as Dollars 1.45. As the country's top export, worth an estimated USDollars 325m last year, tobacco is crucial to the country's export drive under the structural adjustment programme. Exports have stagnated since independence 14 years ago, but must now take off if structural reform is to succeed. In 1991, the World Bank forecast that Zimbabwe's tobacco exports would double within five years; in fact they have fallen nearly 40 per cent since then. Leaf exports are likely to slip further this year, but 1994 could well be the trough of the cycle. 'The market is on the turn,' says one of the more optimistic merchants.  ------------------------------ ZIMBABWE TOBACCO  ------------------------------            Crop      Ave. Price          (m kg)   (US cents/kg)  ------------------------------ 1988        120             218 1989        130             203 1990        134             261 1991        170             325 1992        201             162 1993        219             123 1994*       172             135  ------------------------------ * forecasts  ------------------------------   Countries:-  ZWZ  Zimbabwe, Africa.

0," FR940819-2-00027   FR940819-2-00011            Department's Position:     We agree with the petitioners. Minasligas reported the replacement cost of monthly electricity for the month in which the bill was received. Each month's bill reflects the cost of electricity purchased in the prior month. Therefore, the reported replacement cost of electricity is understated since it lags the actual cost by one month. We have corrected for this understatement by matching each month's bill with the month that it covered.       Comment 19:     Petitioners contend that Minasligas's allocation of GA expenses is incorrect. (Minasligas allocated monthly GA expenses to individual products based upon the number of furnaces used in the production of each product.) Petitioners contend that the Department should allocate GA expenses to total COGS as was done in the preliminary results.   Minasligas contends that a larger portion of its operation is devoted to ferrosilicon than to silicon metal. Minasligas contends that allocating GA expenses to total COGS overstates the amount of GA expenses relating to silicon metal.       Department's Position:     We agree with petitioners. GA expenses are period expenses which relate to the operation of the company as a whole and are not customarily associated with a particular product or process. Therefore, we recalculated GA expenses on a company-wide annual historical basis and, in order to avoid overstating GA expenses and to neutralize hyperinflationary effects, we applied the GA ratio to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis.       Comment 20:     Petitioners contend that the Department should calculate Minasligas's interest expense as the consolidated expenses of Minasligas and Delp Engenharia S.A. (Delp). Petitioners note that Delp controls over 93 percent of Minasligas's common stock and thus has a controlling interest in Minasligas. Petitioners suggest that the Department use Delp's 1991 and 1992 financial statements to perform this calculation.   Minasligas contends that Delp and Minasligas are separate entities, maintain separate financial statements, and have their own interest expense and income. Therefore, Minasligas asserts that it would be improper to calculate interest expense on a consolidated basis.       Department's Position:     We agree with petitioners that Minasligas should report interest expense on a consolidated basis. See our response to comment 2.   In the case of Minasligas, Delp does not consolidate its accounts with Minasligas. In addition, because there are no significant intercompany transactions between the two companies, we combined the financial expenses of the two companies and calculated an interest expense as a ratio to cost of sales, effectively creating consolidated accounts. The Department only allows income generated from investments of working capital, which the company documents as short-term in nature, to offset interest expense (see,     e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Cellular Mobile Telephones from Japan,     54 FR 45447, 45455 (October 31, 1985), and     Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan,     55 FR 335, 342 (January 4, 1990)). Minasligas was able to substantiate only a portion of the investments to be short-term; consequently, we have allowed only the documented portion of interest income as an offset. We did not allow an offset to Minasligas's parent, Delp, for interest expense because the information required to substantiate such an adjustment is not contained in the record of this review.   In order to avoid overstating financing charges, we applied the interest expense ratio (    i.e.,     the ratio of net interest expense to cost of goods sold) to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis rather than to amounts computed under the replacement cost basis. This is consistent with the methodology used in the remand determination in the underlying investigation.       Comment 21:     Petitioners contend that Minasligas did not submit information regarding short-term interest income at the consolidated, parent company level. Accordingly, the petitioners contend that it is not feasible to ``compute interest expense using the sum of Minasligas's and Delp's financial expenses adjusted for intercompany interest transactions'', as suggested by the Department's cost verification report. Finally, petitioners assert that the Department should apply this allocation to COM to properly account for Brazilian hyperinflation.       Department's Position:     We agree with petitioners that the record does not contain information regarding short-term interest income at Minasligas's parent company, Delp. Accordingly, we have not allowed any such offset for Delp's interest income in our calculation of combined interest expense. Consistent with our practice in the     Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Fair Value; Ferrosilicon from Brazil,     59 FR 732, 736737, January 6, 1994, we have applied the calculated interest expense ratio to the monthly COMs calculated on a historical basis rather than amounts computed under the replacement cost basis.       Comment 22:     Petitioners contend that Minasligas's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses is flawed because Minasligas failed to properly ``layer'' inventory according to the month that the merchandise was placed in inventory. Petitioners contend that Minasligas's calculation reflects one level of inventory even though Minasligas held merchandise in inventory for at least two preceding months. Petitioners contend that this flaw makes Minasligas's calculation unusable. Accordingly, petitioners contend that the Department should disregard Minasligas's calculation, and make no adjustment for inventory holding gain or loss in the final COP calculations.       Department's Position:     We agree with petitioners. Minasligas's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses did not account for merchandise that spent multiple months in inventory. Accordingly, we have rejected Minasligas's claimed inventory holding gain.     "," FR940819-2-00027   FR940819-2-00011            Department's Position:     We agree with the petitioners.

Petitioners contend that these expenses are taxes, not duties. Petitioners also note that these two taxes were not listed in the duty drawback regulations provided by Minasligas.         Department's Position:     We disagree with petitioners. Article 314 of the Brazilian Customs Regulations provides for the ``suspension of payments of     tributes     due when importing merchandise to be exported ***.'' (Emphasis added.) The suspension is not limited to customs duties. It includes all ``tributes'' paid upon importation of the merchandise. IPI and ICMS taxes incurred on imported electrodes are two such tributes which are suspended upon exportation of the merchandise. Thus, Minasligas correctly included these expenses in its claimed adjustment for duty drawback.         Comment 24:     Petitioners contend that the Department should use adverse, noncooperative BIA for RIMA. Petitioners make reference to the Department's December 22, 1993 verification report regarding RIMA's COP/CV response. That report indicated that RIMA: (1) Was unwilling to supply the Department with necessary worksheets, schedules, or source documents, (2) that the aspect of RIMA's COP/CV response pertaining to related party transactions, GA expenses, finance costs, and profit were not verified, (3) that RIMA's calculation of charcoal and quartz costs were not reflective of monthly replacement costs, and (4) that RIMA did not adjust the value of its electrode purchases to account for inflation.     Petitioners assert that the verification report indicates that RIMA based its cost response on a managerial cost accounting system that was not used for purposes of valuing inventory in the financial statements. As such, petitioners contend that RIMA's submitted cost information could not be reconciled with RIMA's financial statements. According to petitioners, the verification report also indicates that RIMA based its calculation of labor hours on theoretical times and that actual labor hours exceeded these theoretical hours by a significant amount. Finally, petitioners find that the Department determined that RIMA's COP response did not account for costs associated with write-downs or obsolescence.     Petitioners contend that RIMA's refusal to provide requested information significantly impeded the completion of this review. In accordance with the Department's practice, petitioners argue that the Department should assign as BIA the higher of the highest prior margin established for any company or the highest margin determined in this administrative review.         Department's Position:     At verification we encountered serious and pervasive problems in our efforts to verify the information submitted by RIMA. We found that these problems were so extensive that we could not test major areas of the response. For those areas we tested, we found significant discrepancies in the amounts reported, in addition to a lack of sufficient data to corroborate the response. We outlined the major deficiencies that we found during verification in the public version of the cost verification report (December 22, 1993) and the RIMA calculation memorandum, both of which are on file in the Central Records Unit.     Under these circumstances, the Department cannot properly base its determination on the information submitted by RIMA. The Department cannot be placed in the position of having to identify and perform numerous and substantial revisions to develop accurate cost data, if indeed such revisions were even possible in this case. As stated in     Photo Albums and Filler Pages From Korea; Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value,     50 FR 43754, 4375543756 (October 29, 1985):           It is the obligation of respondents to provide an accurate and complete response prior to verification so that the Department may have the opportunity to analyze fully the information and other parties are able to review and comment on it. Verification is intended to establish the accuracy and completeness of a response rather than to supplement and reconstruct the information to fit the requirements of the Department.           Therefore, for the reasons stated above, we have determined that rejection of the cost response submitted by RIMA is appropriate for these final results and is consistent with past practice (see,     e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Antifriction Bearings (Other Than tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, et al..,     54 FR 18992 (May 3, 1989), 3170431709, and     Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber From Taiwan,     55 FR 34586 (August 23, 1990, 3458634587)).     In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we use BIA in cases where a party refuses or is unable to produce information in a timely manner and in the form required. The Department generally uses a two-tiered approach in its choice of BIA. For uncooperative respondents, the Department uses the higher of: (1) The highest rate for any company from the original investigation or a prior administrative review, or (2) the highest rate found in the current review for any company. For respondents that attempt to cooperate, the Department uses the higher of: (1) The highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the subject merchandise, or (2) the highest calculated rate in the current review for any firm (see     Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from France, et al., Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,     58 FR 39729, 39739, July 26, 1993).

We outlined the major deficiencies that we found during verification in the public version of the cost verification report (December 22, 1993) and the RIMA calculation memorandum, both of which are on file in the Central Records Unit.     Under these circumstances, the Department cannot properly base its determination on the information submitted by RIMA. The Department cannot be placed in the position of having to identify and perform numerous and substantial revisions to develop accurate cost data, if indeed such revisions were even possible in this case. As stated in     Photo Albums and Filler Pages From Korea; Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value,     50 FR 43754, 4375543756 (October 29, 1985):           It is the obligation of respondents to provide an accurate and complete response prior to verification so that the Department may have the opportunity to analyze fully the information and other parties are able to review and comment on it. Verification is intended to establish the accuracy and completeness of a response rather than to supplement and reconstruct the information to fit the requirements of the Department.           Therefore, for the reasons stated above, we have determined that rejection of the cost response submitted by RIMA is appropriate for these final results and is consistent with past practice (see,     e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Antifriction Bearings (Other Than tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, et al..,     54 FR 18992 (May 3, 1989), 3170431709, and     Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber From Taiwan,     55 FR 34586 (August 23, 1990, 3458634587)).     In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we use BIA in cases where a party refuses or is unable to produce information in a timely manner and in the form required. The Department generally uses a two-tiered approach in its choice of BIA. For uncooperative respondents, the Department uses the higher of: (1) The highest rate for any company from the original investigation or a prior administrative review, or (2) the highest rate found in the current review for any company. For respondents that attempt to cooperate, the Department uses the higher of: (1) The highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the subject merchandise, or (2) the highest calculated rate in the current review for any firm (see     Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from France, et al., Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,     58 FR 39729, 39739, July 26, 1993).

Del Valle said that Guatemala's intention is for the maximum  institution on world trade to voice its opinion on the legality  or illegality of the U.S. ruling with regard to the import of  this product. The agriculture minister indicated that the United  States has forced the large cigarette companies to purchase 75  percent of their tobacco needs from U.S. producers, thus  violating a GATT regulation. That measure, he noted, implies  that the nation's import of tobacco would be limited to 25  percent of consumption. This is the reason it was decided to  file the suit before the GATT so it may in turn issue its  opinion as to whether this measure is in keeping with its  mechanisms or not.    Gonzalez said that nations in Latin American, including  Brazil, that have been adversely affected by the U.S. measures  also joined in the suit. The foreign trade minister said that  Guatemala maintains close contact with these nations to set up a  structure similar to the one organized for the banana case, that  is, to unite Latin American positions in this regard.    In another turn of events, the foreign trade minister said  that the meeting slated for 7-8 February between Mexico and the  Central American Northern Triangle [El Salvador, Guatemala,  Honduras] has been postponed until a latter date that could be  21 February. Gonzalez indicated that the reason for suspension  of the meeting was that the Group of Three (Mexico, Colombia,  and Venezuela) did not reach an agreement. This situation  forced the Mexicans to request the meeting to be delayed to  analyze its current position.    To conclude, Gonzalez said that Guatemala's position is to  gain better access for our products in the Mexican market, as a  series of difficulties have been registered with merchandise  such as carton boxes, lamina [not further specified], and sugar.

The huge north American market grew by 7 per cent to Dollars 29.9bn in prescription drug sales compared with the first seven months of 1993. This compares with average growth of 5 per cent for the whole of last year, suggesting that efforts by insurers and employers to cut their healthcare bills were having little effect on the drugs side. The second biggest market is Japan, which imposed widespread price cuts in April this year. Sales to July grew just 1 per cent to Dollars 12.2bn in constant currency terms, compared with an average 6 per cent growth during 1993. In the UK, one of the smaller markets, sales grew 8 per cent to Dollars 3.1bn, a small fall from 1993's average of 11 per cent, possibly as a result of price cuts imposed by the government at the end of last year. France, which has for many years had low drug prices but high per capita consumption, saw an above-average rise in sales in July. Sales for the first seven months grew 1 per cent to Dollars 6bn, compared with zero growth in the six months to June. This was nevertheless a sharp fall on 1993's average of 6 per cent growth, reflecting France's determination to maintain low prices in the face of its high consumption rates. Italy, which reformed its health policies at the start of the year, is now the only country in the top eight not to show at some growth, the IMS report said. Italy's drugs bill fell 2 per cent in 1993 and 7 per cent in the seven months to July. The increased decline was the result of government reforms in January this year which cut subsidies on many drugs. Germany's drugs budget reforms were enacted in 1993, leading to a fall of 9 per cent in spending in that year. The first seven months of 1994 showed a 6 per cent rise, perhaps because doctors and patients were learning to exploit the loophole that hospital drugs were exempt from last year's controls. By therapeutic area, central nervous system drugs, including anti-depressants, extended their lead as the most popular category in the US. This may be because of continuing publicity surrounding Eli Lilly's best-selling drug, the anti-depressant Prozac, which has been more popular than expected this year.

Anhui has employed more than 420 foreign experts whose  assistance has generated 120 million yuan in extra economic  returns over the past eight years.    The grain-basket province has also imported advanced  cultivation technology, quality breeding stocks and other  applied farming technologies to promote high-yielding  agriculture with quality produce.    Last year Anhui spread the use of a rice cultivation and  growing technique from Japan to one third of the province,  achieving a ten percent output increase per mu (one mu is 0.1647  ha [hectare]).    The Fuyang region benefited from the skills of a Japanese  expert in growing apples. More than 700 kg of apples are now  harvested per mu, a one-third increase. The region has devoted  40,000 mu to growing the fruit.    Emphasis has meanwhile been placed on updating and retooling  major state-owned enterprises.    A leather factory in Anqing employed 15 foreign experts to  improve its technology and management skills, enabling its  products to enter the world market and increase its annual  output value by one million yuan.    ""The key to success is using the talents of foreign experts  to develop the local economy,"" said Zhang Mingxiang, deputy  director of the province's Foreign Experts Office.    To date, Anhui has fostered close co-operative ties with  countries like Japan, Germany, France, the United States and  Canada.    Zhang said his office is planning to recruit more experts,  including overseas Chinese, from more countries and regions to  help modernize Anhui's major enterprises and agriculture.     "

Lawyers at Philip Morris, the cigarette and food manufacturer, revealed yesterday that Mr Marc Edell, lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in the suit brought by long-time smoker Rose Cipollone and her family, had voluntarily withdrawn from the case. The request to end the nine-year-old litigation was made yesterday morning and an order was signed by the presiding judge. Philip Morris was one of three cigarette manufacturers sued by Rose Cipollone and then her family after she developed and subsequently died of lung cancer. Philip Morris declined to speculate on the reasons for the dismissal. Mr Edell was not at his New Jersey office yesterday morning, and was unavailable for comment. In 1988, four years after Mrs Cipollone died, a Newark-based jury awarded her husband Dollars 400,000 (Pounds 258,000) on the grounds that the Liggett tobacco company, another defendant in the lawsuit, had misrepresented the risks of smoking. This was the first and only verdict requiring a tobacco company to compensate the family of a smoker who had died of cancer. Two years later, however, it was overturned by a federal appeals court. The case then progressed to the US Supreme Court, which earlier this year deliberated over whether federally-mandated health warnings on cigarette packets protected tobacco manufacturers from being sued under state liability laws. In a complex and splintered decision, released in June, the Supreme Court ruled that some suits could be brought, where, for example, plaintiffs alleged that cigarette manufacturers hid or distorted the health dangers of tobacco. A new trial of the Cipollone v Liggett et al case was ordered. Yesterday, Philip Morris shares rose strongly on the news, gaining Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 78 5/8 . Loews Corporation, which owns Lorillard, another manufacturer involved in the Cipollone case, gained Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 115 1/2.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

The company recorded underlying fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 102.8m, or Dollars 1.43 a share, excluding extraordinary items and accounting changes. This compares with Dollars 99.3m, or Dollars 1.55, a year earlier, when the company had fewer shares outstanding. Including one-time items, Goodyear's net income stood at Dollars 87.5m, or Dollars 1.22, in the fourth quarter against Dollars 105.1m, or Dollars 1.65, last year. Sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 2.93bn from Dollars 2.78bn. The results were in line with Goodyear's earlier fourth-quarter predictions and its shares eased Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 70 3/8 at close of trading in New York. The proposed stock split and dividend increase will be put to a shareholder vote at Goodyear's annual meeting on April 5. During 1992, Goodyear took a one-time net charge of Dollars 1.01bn on the adoption of two non-cash accounting changes. As a result, Goodyear posted a net loss of Dollars 658.6m, or Dollars 9.22 a share, in 1992, compared with net income of Dollars 96.6m, or Dollars 1.61. Stripping out the charges and other one-time items, Goodyear earned Dollars 367.3m, or Dollars 5.14, in the year compared with Dollars 74.5m, or Dollars 1.24, in 1991. Sales advanced 8 per cent to Dollars 11.78bn from Dollars 10.91bn. During the fourth quarter, Goodyear had gains of Dollars 75.9m from the sale of its polyester resin assets which was partly offset by charges of Dollars 39.6m for workforce restructuring and charges of Dollars 15.8m for the planned sale of its roofing busi ness and other items. Goodyear's debt stood at Dollars 1.9bn at the end of 1992, compared with Dollars 2.6bn at the end of 1991 and Dollars 3.7bn in mid-1991. As a result, the company's interest expense fell to Dollars 232.9m at the end of the year from Dollars 217.8m a year earlier. Selling, administrative and general expenses rose to Dollars 8.97bn at the year end from Dollars 8.41bn a year earlier, reflecting higher advertising spending. Goodyear's tyre sales rose 6 per cent in the fourth quarter to Dollars 2.4bn, but operating income dropped 39 per cent to Dollars 125.9m. The oil transportation segment had operating income of Dollars 347,000 in the fourth quarter compared with a loss of Dollars 5.4m a year earlier.   Companies:-  Goodyear Tire and Rubber.

0,FT934-4567 ,"FT934-4567 _AN-DLCDFABSFT 931203   FT  03 DEC 93 / Tighter curbs on tobacco ads expected      By KEVIN BROWN and DIANE SUMMERS   The government is expected to announce tighter voluntary controls on tobacco advertising soon to head off a private member's bill which would impose an advertising ban. The bill, to be tabled by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, would ban all cigarette, cigar and pipe tobacco advertising except at the point of sale. The Department of Health confirmed yesterday that tighter voluntary controls being considered for tobacco advertising include: A ban on poster advertising. An end to tobacco advertising in women's magazines. Removal of tobacconists' shop front advertising. Larger health warnings on cigarette packs. The Advertising Association, the umbrella group for advertisers as well as practitioners, accused the government of over-reacting. Ms Fionnuala Tennyson, associate director, said said it was 'totally inappropriate to go any further without any real evidence' that advertising had an effect on tobacco consumption. The Tobacco Advisory Council, the trade body for UK tobacco manufacturers, said advertising stimulated competition between brands, rather than encouraging anyone to smoke. The total tobacco retail market is worth about Pounds 10bn a year and about Pounds 60m is spent by the industry on advertising. Mr Barron, who won third place in a backbench Commons ballot for the right to introduce legislation, yesterday claimed the support of more than 200 MPs of all parties. The government, however, is firmly opposed to legislative controls on tobacco advertising, which ministers believe are less effective than voluntary curbs. This approach was confirmed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in his Budget speech on Tuesday. Government MPs are not normally given voting instructions on private members' legislation but the government would have little difficulty in finding procedural ways of killing the bill if it wished. Ash, the anti-smoking lobby group, said yesterday it was concerned that the government would not be able to get the industry to agree to tighter curbs, particularly now that it had, in effect, taken away the threat of legislation. Britain has blocked an attempt by the European Commission to ban advertising by directive, and ministers rejected similar proposals by the Commons health committee earlier this year.

Helmut Werner, the new Mercedes-Benz chief  executive officer [CEO], appointed in May 1993, has great  ambitions. His company, a subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group,  will gain market shares in the future. Sales--down to 508,000  vehicles in 1993 compared with 522,000 the year before--are  expected to reach 570,000 vehicles in 1994, and between 850,000  and 900,000 in 1998, at the end of the five-year plan started  this year. Last year was difficult. The company lost money on  cars and trucks (trucks were already losing money in 1992).  Sales declined by three percent, to 64.6 million German marks  [DM] (about 219 billion francs [Fr]). They should rise by five  percent this year, reaching DM68 billion.    Cultural Revolution    In support of this prospect, Mr. Werner indicated that sales  during the second half of 1993 achieved an annualized rate of  300,000, thanks to the Class-C compact car introduced last  summer. Apart from that, Mercedes plans to expand its line with  a van called Viano, a small convertible, an all-terrain vehicle  to be manufactured in Alabama, and a Class-A ""mini"" to be  introduced in 1997. Innovation in the product line is the first  direction of Mr. Werner's strategy.    The second one is structural reform. Mercedes eliminated  11,000 jobs in 1993 and will eliminate another 8,000 this year.  But this policy, in addition to ""adding to the recession  spiral,"" is wearing out. Mr. Werner explained that, from now on,  they must take into account the productivity of capital, not  just that of labor. In other words, machines must be made to  work more efficiently. Mercedes will use three methods to  achieve this end: relocation--one Mercedes vehicle out of 10  will have to be manufactured outside of Germany ""in the  intermediate term,"" compared with one in 50 at present;  increased subcontracting (60 percent of components in 1998  compared with 55 percent now); and, finally, cooperation with  other manufacturers. Mercedes is currently negotiating setting  up plants in Korea and in India, in cooperation with the local  group Tata.    This policy implies cost savings, which amounts to a  cultural  revolution at Mercedes where engineers used to rule the roost.  The five-year plan was reduced by DM3.3 billion, down to DM 18.7  billion for investments and DM16 billion for research and  development. Mr. Werner said he was confident as to the  capacities of the German industry which, for the new age,  ""possesses greater potential"" than its U.S. and Japanese  competitors.     "

He warned that underlying results might be affected in the long term by political change, and in particular world-wide pressure on prices. The pricing situation was not getting any easier, he said. In Japan and parts of Europe it was draconian and he expected further price changes in European markets. In the US, Mr Robb said he had no doubt that pricing pressure would become more difficult, no matter which party won the coming presidential elections. Payments to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health care scheme for poor families, were Pounds 8m in the year to August 29 1992 and would rise to Pounds 40m this financial year. Wellcome's future depended upon its ability to generate volume growth, said Mr Robb. The main driving force last year was Zovirax, Wellcome's herpes, chicken pox and shingles drug. Sales increased 24 per cent to Pounds 586m, twice the figure achieved three years ago and nearly a third of overall sales. Mr Robb said Zovirax's potential was by no means exhausted. The group had gained approval to sell the drug over the counter without a prescription in New Zealand and Germany, where its patents expire next year. Meanwhile, Wellcome is in a race with SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group, to develop a second generation anti-herpes compound. Wellcome has two molecules, called 256U and 882C, nearing the completion of their development. These are due for launch in 1995 and 1996, while SmithKline Beecham expects to bring Famciclovir, its new treatment, to market in 1995. Sales of Retrovir, the HIV-treatment also known as AZT, increased 22 per cent to Pounds 213m, following a disappointing previous year, said Mr Robb. He warned, however, that Retrovir was now in a competitive environment, battling against DDI from Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US, and DDC which is marketed by Switzerland's Hoffman-La Roche. Mr Robb said sales would continue to grow as Retrovir was used increasingly in combination with such drugs. Sales of newer drugs, such as Tracrium, Wellbutrin, Wellferon, Exosurf and Lamictil, generated Pounds 200m. Further growth is expected to come from Wellcome's over the counter operations (OTC), which increased 17 per cent to Pounds 237m. Mr Robb said Wellcome was seeking ways to expand its OTC business. The company wanted to gain critical mass in the US and the Continent, but he did not want to make an acquisition that would dilute earnings, even in the first year. Mr Robb said the UK business had been hit by poor penetration of Zovirax and a high incidence of parallel imports. The organisation had been shaken up, he said. US sales rose 16 per cent to Pounds 737m, thanks to a strong performance from the anti-viral and OTC businesses. European sales increased 20 per cent to Pounds 590m. Japanese revenues were up 18 per cent to Pounds 128m, following the introduction of Zovirax as a treatment for shingles. Other international sales increased 17 per cent to Pounds 188m.

Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 19.1p (15.3p) out of which a 4.8p dividend is proposed. The core electrical cable accessories and identification products business increased sales 26 per cent to Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 13.8m) and operating profit 14.5 per cent to Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 2.22m). New products, particularly HSI, the computerised wire marking system which is now Critchley's biggest seller, and sale of cable accessories manufactured in LFH (Limited Fire Hazard) plastic materials, made 'good contributions.' Main customers in the UK for these products include thepower generation, oil and gas, and rail industries. Direct exports from the UK rose 21 per cent mainly reflecting strong demand for specialist products. Mr Chris Humphrey, finance director, said margins were 'fractionally' higher. The group's two other companies, Critchley Wound Components and Critchley Enclosures, both serving the electronics industry, also improved their performance. In April the group acquired the BT Label Centre for Pounds 1.5m cash. The business, subsequently renamed Critchley Label Centre, produces printed plastic identification labels for BT and a growing number of industrial users.   Companies:-  Critchley Group.

Henderson is the latest in a growing list of property companies which are capitalising on low interest rates and renewed global interest in Hong Kong shares, by issuing convertible preference shares or bonds. The bonds have a three-year life and pay a coupon of 4 per cent. They can be redeemed at par, or converted into shares in Henderson China upon its initial public offering. There is no guarantee that the company will be successfully listed. The share price of Henderson Land climbed 19 per cent yesterday with the issue apparently implying substantial value to the group's China assets. An independent audit has given an estimated net tangible assets per share for Henderson Land of HKDollars 42.69, against yesterday's closing price of HKDollars 28.70. Mr Lee Shau-kee, chairman of Henderson, said the move 'provides funds for our China property business and creates an opportunity for investors specifically interested in China'. Hong Kong investors have tended to shun companies with Chinese property interests, due to concerns over the impact of the austerity programme in China. Overseas institutions have been less concerned. New World Development, a Hong Kong property developer with substantial Chinese exposure, reacted to local fears recently, by launching a USDollars 200m Dublin-listed China investment fund. The fund has acquired a number of the group's China infrastructure and property projects and is only 50 per cent owned by the company, reducing the parent company's exposure and raising funds for China investment.

Mr Michael Beloff QC was launching 28 test case actions relating to a total of 227 claims. He said the group action, potentially worth more than Pounds 20m, could not go ahead without legal aid because the alleged victims - mostly from Liverpool but also from London and the south-east - lacked funds to fight a legal battle for compensation. Gallaher, Rothmans, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco are accused of negligence in failing to take steps to minimise the dangers of smoking, carrying out or publicising research into the risks, or giving adequate warnings of those risks. Mr Beloff said 110,000 people in the UK died prematurely each year as a result of smoking and hundreds of thousands more were damaged. Leading lawyers had estimated individual potential claims ranged between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 250,000. Many of his clients were seriously ill and three had died since the first application for legal aid had been made. The Northern Area Legal Aid Committee had 'killed' claimants' hopes of obtaining redress. It decided last year that the tobacco companies were prima facie in breach of the duty to take reasonable steps to minimise the risk of harm and give reasonable warnings. But committee members were not persuaded that any single individual in the group action, who suffer from a range of smoking-related diseases, could establish that he or she fell ill as a result of that breach of duty. The committee also decided that the cost of taking on the tobacco companies 'was not worth the candle'. Mr Beloff described both decisions as 'curious and unreasonable' and asked Mr Justice Popplewell to quash them and to order a fresh hearing before a different committee. The hearing continues today.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9211 Courts.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "

New commercial vehicle registrations rose to 31,704 from 28,946 in the same month a year ago, according to figures from the Society of Motor and Manufacturers and Traders. This was the second monthly year-on-year increase in the last three months. The tentative sign of recovery from a very low level follows a period in which demand weakened for 32 consecutive months up to the end of May. Higher sales than a year ago were achieved in all the main sectors of the industry last month for the first time since the steep decline started in the last quarter of 1989. New truck registrations (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) rose 7.3 per cent in August to 4,097. Sales of medium vans, such as the Ford Transit and the Volkswagen Transporter, rose 22 per cent year-on-year to 15,156. Sales of small vans, such as the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra car-derived vans, showed a 1.2 per cent rise, while registrations of buses and coaches rose 12.9 per cent to 184. Truck sales were higher than a year ago for the second successive month, following a year-on-year increase of 6.7 per cent in July. The truck sector has been hardest hit during the recession with sales at the lowest level since 1954. Commercial vehicle sales of 142,098 in the first eight months of the year were still 6 per cent below the very depressed level of a year ago. Registrations have fallen 46.5 per cent in the last three years. Truck sales of 20,633 in the first eight months were also 6 per cent below the level of a year ago, although sales of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes) at 10,588 have fallen only 0.7 per cent from the very low level of last year. The main demand in the heavy truck sector is still coming from private hauliers for heavy tractor units for articulated trucks. Demand for rigid trucks, most importantly from the construction industry, remains very depressed. The Iveco group, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy which includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson, has narrowly regained the lead in the UK truck market in its see-saw struggle with Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of DAF of the Netherlands. In the first eight months Iveco has captured a share of 24.7 per cent of UK new truck sales, just ahead of the 24.3 per cent held by Leyland DAF. In the heavy truck sector the strongest performances have been achieved by Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and ERF, which have benefited from the higher demand for heavy articulated truck units. Mercedes-Benz heavy truck sales in the first eight months of the year were 12 per cent higher than a year ago, while ERF has boosted its UK sales in this segment by 9.9 per cent and Volvo by 8.5 per cent.

Ford and Vauxhall, the UK new-car market leaders, announced price cuts of up to Pounds 1,150 on some models to clear old stocks, in response to disappointing sales in August. Jaguar, the luxury car maker which suffered a Pounds 226m loss last year, is cutting a further 700 jobs in the face of declining sales in many overseas markets, while Iveco Ford, the truck maker, is reducing its workforce by 8 per cent with the loss of another 100 jobs. The prolonged recession and the absence of any recovery in demand in August, the most important sales month of the year, has forced both Ford and Vauxhall to lower their forecasts for new car sales in 1992 to only 1.55m, a further 2.5 per cent fall from last year. Sales of new cars in the first seven months of the year were 36 per cent lower than in the peak year of 1989. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, warned that he did not foresee 'any increase in the market in the first six months next year, unless there is a change of tack by the government'. The latest job cuts by Jaguar will reduce its workforce to fewer than 7,300. The company warned that some compulsory redundancies appeared inevitable. The workforce has been cut by 40 per cent since the end of 1990. Jaguar is to cut its planned production for this year to 23,000 - unchanged from last year - compared with the 27,000 forecast earlier. Sales in the first seven months of the year at 13,237 were 10.7 per cent lower than a year ago. While sales in the US rose 1.8 per cent, sales in Japan fell 38.2 per cent to 914. Demand also fell sharply in the UK. Iveco Ford, which lost Pounds 38.6m last year, is cutting 100 hourly paid jobs from its truck assembly plant at Langley, west London. Since the beginning of the recession it has cut its workforce by 34 per cent from 1,796 at the end of 1990 to 1,183. Truck output at Langley is expected to total 8,000 this year compared with 5,750 last year, when the company was forced to cut 90 production days. The UK truck industry has suffered the steepest decline in the post-war period. New truck registrations last year were at the lowest level since 1954. Sales in the first seven months of 1992 fell 8.8 per cent. In the last three years they have fallen 59.5 per cent. Ford said yesterday it was cutting the prices of most of its remaining 1992 models by up to Pounds 1,000 in addition to any discount or trade-in value agreed by a dealer. Vauxhall said it was cutting the prices of its non-catalytic converter-equipped Nova and Cavalier models by up to Pounds 1,150.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Profits before tax for the year to December 31 increased to Pounds 117.2m. The Pounds 67.3m for 1992 has been restated in accordance with FRS 3 to take into account exceptional costs of Pounds 29.7m for the group's withdrawal from the food hall business - which was taken over by Iceland - and from its retail finance businesses. There were net exceptional costs of Pounds 3.4m for 1993, with Pounds 10.9m rationalisation costs offset by a Pounds 7.5m profit on the sale of Littlewoods' Christmas hampers business. Excluding exceptionals, underlying profits grew by 24 per cent from Pounds 97m to Pounds 120.6m. The death of Sir John Moores, the group's founder, last September had led to speculation that the group might be floated, with rumours that some of the 32 shareholder members of the Moores family were keen to sell their stakes. However, Mr Leonard van Geest, chairman, insisted there were no plans for flotation. 'We have no need to go public,' he said. 'The family members are all very committed to the business, and maintain a strong interest in it.' He added that not having access to equity finance was not a problem as the group was able to borrow at good rates. Littlewoods moved from net borrowings of Pounds 6.1m at the beginning of 1993 to net cash of Pounds 58.9m at the year-end. Sales increased by 2.5 per cent from Pounds 2.71bn to Pounds 2.78bn, of which the retail businesses contributed Pounds 1.96bn (Pounds 1.9bn). Sales in Littlewoods chain stores declined from Pounds 696m to Pounds 666m, mainly as a result of disruption during the conversion of food halls to the Iceland format. Operating profits from the continuing business increased from Pounds 33.2m to Pounds 37.8m. In the home shopping division, sales rose from Pounds 978m to Pounds 1.04bn, and profits from Pounds 56.3m to Pounds 68.6m. The Index catalogue shops increased sales to Pounds 251m (Pounds 228m). Losses were reduced to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 9.1m). Profits from the group's football pools side grew to Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 21.6m). Mr Barry Dale, chief executive, said trading was buoyant over Christmas, but had slackened in recent weeks. Looming tax increases next month had damaged consumer confidence, he said.

Sales promotion continues to account for a fast-growing share of corporate marketing budgets: already, we are told, a higher proportion than expenditure on media. Heinz, which has run effective promotions offering a free car a day for 100 days, probably had good reasons for recently announcing a shift of spending from TV to targeted promotions. Yet Hoover's free flights offer which sounded too good to be true failed because of confusion over the small print and inept administration. So what type of promotions work and when? Where is the evidence that promotional activities targeted at consumers through the letterbox, at the point of sale, via packaging, over the phone, even by fax, are more or less effective than press, poster and TV advertising? Some of the author's case material and examination of recent promotions is certainly illuminating. The sales promotion industry has come a long way, but still hasn't shrugged off its traditional plastic daffodil image. Outside the more vibrant specialist agencies, the business tends to be seen as tactical, but also peripheral, even ephemeral. Understandably, advertising agencies have blinkered views, suspicious of any techniques other than pure, powerful media advertising to build brand awareness and value. A good example of the switch, which reflects the impact of change in markets and marketing is that advertising league tables are no longer headed by the big brands, but by the powerful retail chains. The combined effect of competition from retailers' brands, pressure on margins and contributions to store groups' own advertising is clearly forcing more brand manufacturers to cut back on advertising and look for leap-frogging promotional techniques with faster direct impact on sales. Surprisingly few 'insider' books have focused knowledgeably and objectively on sales promotion. Alan Toop and the late Christian Petersen both founded leading sales promotion consultancies, created some spectacular campaigns and wrote several of the more enlightening books on the practice. Their latest, Sales Promotion in Postmodern Marketing, examines the background, 'the golden age of marketing' - the 1950s to the 1970s - which saw the arrival of independent television, the assault of Madison Avenue commercials, the emergence of supermarkets followed by superstores, offering more and more shopping convenience, variety and choice. For example, the authors found more than 20 versions of Persil alone, 150 brands of cereal and more than 30 different toothpastes. Add typically huge selections of fruit and vegetables, bakery lines, meat and fish and drinks, plus, in more cases, in-store pharmacies, newsagents and dry cleaners, and it is clear that the concept of one-stop shopping has overtaken any earlier preference for small specialist shops. For brand manufacturers to elbow their way onto the crowded shelves, compete with own-labels and gain attention, the two overriding priorities became new product launches and line extensions for added shelf space, and sales promotions. One of the key differences between advertising and sales promotion, the authors explain, is that sales promotion invites participation or exhortation to act now. It encourages response whether the promotion takes the form of cash rebates, extra product free, coupons, contests or competitions, premiums, prizes or free samples. Even they find it surprising, however, that so little senior management time is paid to ensuring maximum impact for every penny spent in this area. The authors admit that sales promotion is still less well understood and less closely studied than advertising. It is one thing to claim expenditure on sales promotion and other below-the-line activities now exceeds spending on media advertising. Is it too much to offer evidence and analysis? The book offers a rich seam of distilled experience and fresh insights. What is still lacking is research and rationale.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The results were at the top end of Wall Street forecasts and cheered investors, who bid the group's stock up Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Later in the session, however, the share price slid back to Dollars 49 3/8 for a net loss of Dollars  1/2 on the day. Chrysler's strong second quarter took the group's first half profits to Dollars 1.89bn, up from Dollars 1.22bn a year ago. It said it earned Dollars 956m, or Dollars 2.61 a share, in the second quarter, up from Dollars 685m, or Dollars 1.55 a share, a year ago. The results beat the previous record of Dollars 938m, or Dollars 2.55 a share, achieved in the first three months of this year. Sales and revenues jumped 19 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 26.3bn, due primarily to strong US demand. Sales between April and June totalled 709,158, up from 625,295 in the previous three months. Chrysler is the first of Detroit's 'Big Three' automobile manufacturers to report its second-quarter results. Industry analysts expect Ford and General Motors to post similarly strong earnings. They point to rising sales in the healthy North American market and the recovery in Europe. Carmakers are also benefiting from cost-cutting measures. The impact of Chrysler's cost-reduction efforts is evident in the improvement over the past year in the group's measure of profit-per-vehicle, which jumped from Dollars 810 in the second three months of 1993 to Dollars 1,300 in the latest quarter. The domestic market has been so strong that Chrysler has struggled to meet demand for its most popular vehicles. Ford and GM have also struggled to supply dealers. Mr Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman, said yesterday the group was 'carefully adding increased capacity' over the next three years. The group's share of the North American car and truck market was 15.4 per cent, unchanged from a year ago. Chrysler Financial, the group's financial services arm, reported second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 44m, unchanged from a year ago. The group also announced yesterday it had contributed another Dollars 600m to its pension fund, and was on target to wipe out its unfunded pension liability - for long a restraint on its stock and credit rating - by the end of this year.

0,FT942-3109 ,"FT942-3109 _AN-EFPDDAC5FT 940616   FT  16 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Roots versus lifestyle in a changing country - A look at the nature and direction of advertising in the new South Africa      By JOEL KIBAZO   'Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty we are free at last,' thundered a recent commercial on South African Television. It showed the flags and dates when various African countries gained independence, before arriving at South Africa in 1994. It closed with a black man in the speaker's chair in parliament with a voice quoting Martin Luther King's now famous phrase, also used by president Nelson Mandela in his victory speech. The commercial was for Sales House, a clothes retail chain, and the campaign was by Ogilvy  Mather Rightford, the country's biggest agency. But far from being seen as a celebration of the new South Africa, the campaign was condemned by some leading figures in South Africa's advertising industry as a throwback to the days of apartheid. Made in the spirit of 'black consciousness' and 'black pride', the advertisement followed on from two others in the series, one with a strident black 'man of Africa' and another showing a confident and assertive 'woman of Africa'. 'Times may be changing but I regard these advertisements as white people pretending to understand the black African psyche,' says Peter Vundla, a former employee of OM and now managing director of Herdbuoys, South Africa's first black agency. 'It's a romantic view that does not speak to us. They may be aimed at black shoppers but frankly we see them as a joke.' Controversy over the Sales House campaign reflects a wider debate on the nature and direction of advertising in the new South Africa. For years, the country's agencies concentrated on communicating with the white community which makes up around 14 per cent of the population. Sophisticated campaigns for everything from cars to mass consumer products were mainly in English and Afrikaans. There was little to show a black population existed in the same country or indeed, that blacks were consumers. Those wishing to reach a cross section of the population generally ran separate campaigns: racial mixing in a commercial was rare. Change began in the late 1970s, with a growing awareness and recognition of the rising black urban population and its increasing consumption of products once seen as the preserve of whites. The process was helped by pioneering multi-racial advertisements from South African Breweries in the 1980s and gathered pace with the political changes of the 1990s. Today, there are those who argue that advertising, for so long dominated by one race, should move from being 'Euro-centric', that is, made by and from a white person's point of view to 'Afro-centric', taking on the values and perspective of the black South African. Nearly 60 per cent of Sales House customers are black and OM has been in charge of its campaigns since 1986. However, the more strident black pride campaign has only been running for three years. Robyn Putter, creative director of OM Rightford, has become identified with 'Afro-centric' advertising. He says: 'This is a campaign that people identify with. Black people do not need to apologise for who they are and we've tried to bring this out.' He points to requests to run the same advertisements in the US as proof of the success in reaching black people. But Reg Lascaris, managing director of Hunt Lascaris, which ran the successful ANC election campaign, counters: 'Black consumers don't want to be seen as 'man of Africa'.' He advocates the use of marketing bands, based on occupation and education. 'What matters is a person's level of sophistication. Whether they are black or white does not matter. It did in the past, but not now.' Vundla suggests that understanding black people is the single most important factor for any agency in South Africa. 'Nothing has changed. Most agencies here don't even have black people at senior level nor have people in them even ventured into a township. How can they claim they understand the black majority market and how to reach them?' he says. Explaining his departure from OM, he says: 'I think this is where agencies like ours can make a difference.

It is the first time RJR has made a profit after interest and tax since the massive Dollars 25bn takeover masterminded by Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the investment banking business. In the first quarter of 1990, RJR reported a net loss of Dollars 222m. News of the surplus seemed to surprise some Wall Street analysts, who greeted the figures warmly. 'It's positive - we were expecting a small loss,' commented one high-yield analyst at Salomon Brothers. On the stock market, RJR shares rose in morning trading in New York by 3/8 to Dollars 11 7/8 , while its junk bonds also advanced on the profit news. The company has just completed the latest in a series of refinancing exercises aimed at reducing the cost of its outstanding debt. The most recent restructuring involved the issue of 115m new shares, to raise Dollars 1.29bn, plus a Dollars 1.5bn tranche of new junk bonds. During the first quarter, RJR's operating profits rose to Dollars 647m, 7 per cent higher than the same period a year earlier, with 'cash earnings' - that is, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation - marginally improved at Dollars 940m against Dollars 923m. Sales overall were 8 per cent higher at Dollars 3.47bn. Of the two main business divisions, food showed the more marked advance. Sales rose from Dollars 1.34bn to Dollars 1.51bn, while operating profits (ahead of amortisation charges) were 21 per cent higher at Dollars 171m. On the tobacco side, sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 1.96bn, while profits edged 2 per cent higher at Dollars 648m. The company reported 'significant volume gains' overseas, but said its domestic volumes were still falling by more than the market generally - the latter figure standing at around 3 per cent a year. The flow of debt refinancings has helped to push down interest costs. In the first quarter, cash interest expense was Dollars 307m from Dollars 388m.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "

Analysts had predicted a 35 per cent growth in earnings for Astra, which was the best performer on the Stockholm bourse last year. The company, headed by Mr Hakan Mogren, had revised upward its forecast for the year, saying profits would climb by 30 per cent to SKr3.3bn. Its previous forecast had estimated growth at 25 per cent. Operating profits increased by 22 per cent to SKr598m. Improved net interest income from Astra's large cash reserves, which totalled SKr5bn at the end of March, and favourable exchange rates for income from its foreign subsidiaries contributed to the buoyant pre-tax earnings. Sales during the period increased by 27 per cent to SKr2.74bn, with turnover from Losec, Astra's largest-selling product, increasing to SKr577m from SKr284m a year ago. Marketing of Losec by licensees, primarily Merck in the US, raised the drug's total sales to SKr880m from SKr360m. Losec suffered a setback in the US in January when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to approve the drug for first-line treatment of all ulcers. Astra said yesterday that it is holding talks with the FDA on widening its approval of Losec usage and it predicted that the FDA will make a decision in the near future. Losec was also introduced last month in Japan, potentially the biggest national market for the drug after the US. Drugs for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, dominated by Losec, had total sales of SKr626m, a 88 per cent increase. Drugs for respiratory diseases, however, remain Astra's largest product group, with sales climbing to SKr643m, a 26 per cent rise. The Turbohaler, an inhaler which delivers medication for asthma patients, has boosted sales for two asthma drugs. Sales of the new asthma agent Pulmicort increased by 57 per cent to SKr264m, while sales for the older bronchial drug Bricanyl rose by 19 per cent to SKr182m.

Although Dow's operating earnings were 9 per cent up at Dollars 568m, the quarter's net profit was Dollars 186m, compared with Dollars 233m a year ago. Second-quarter sales were 1 per cent higher at Dollars 4.9bn. Earnings per share were 68 cents, down by 21 per cent from 86 cents in the second quarter of 1991. Dow noted that earnings per share were reduced by 5 cents because Dow Corning, in which it has a 50 per cent stake, took a Dollars 45m pre-tax second-quarter charge associated with the costs of its discontinued silicone gel breast implant products. Mr Enrique Falla, Dow's executive vice president, called the second-quarter results 'disappointing' and said Dow does not expect to exceed the performance level of 1991 until some time during the second half of this year. He noted that earning momentum in some of Dow's businesses normally lags the economic recovery. Mr Falla added that margins were also squeezed because of lower prices and the European slowdown. Sales for Dow Europe in the quarter were Dollars 1.4bn, down 4 per cent. Operating income from Europe slumped by 79 per cent to Dollars 30m and, excluding earnings from Dow Europe's consumer specialty products business, the area experienced 'an unprecedented loss for the quarter'. In addition, Dow suffered temporary closures of polyethylene plants in Canada and Spain and of a styrene facility in the Netherlands. Dow's chemical and performance products sale were unchanged at Dollars 1.1bn, while operating income recovered by 53 per cent to Dollars 92m. Sales for plastics were unchanged at Dollars 1.7bn while operating income declined by 18 per cent to Dollars 113m. The energy and hydrocarbons division suffered an operating loss of Dollars 47m on Dollars 382m of sales, a fall of 15 per cent year-on-year. Dow's consumer specialties division achieved 18 per cent higher operating income of Dollars 381m on 13 per cent improved sales of Dollars 1.7bn. Monsanto, the Missouri-based chemicals company, meanwhile achieved a Dollars 113m or 92 cents a share second-quarter net profit, compared with a net loss of Dollars 52m (42 cents) a year ago. Last year's earnings were affected by a Dollars 325m after-tax charge for a corporate restructuring programme. Sales in the quarter were Dollars 2.28bn, down from Dollars 2.47bn a year ago, although Monsanto said the 1992 quarter did not include some Dollars 111m of revenues from businesses involved in the restructuring. Operating income from the agricultural division was Dollars 147m, down sharply from Dollars 243m a year ago. The chemicals division managed a Dollars 64m operating profit, against a Dollars 370m loss a year ago. The NutraSweet artificial sugar business suffered a fall in operating earnings, from Dollars 57m to Dollars 49m. The Searle drug business lost Dollars 39m, compared with a Dollars 27m profit a year ago. On Wall Street, Dow's share price was marked  3/8 higher to Dollars 53 1/4 while Monsanto's price slumped by Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 .  The Financial Times   London Page 25  "

The decision, which is subject to appeal, confirms the right of employers to introduce smoking bans on their premises. Workplace smoking bans are increasingly popular with employers who are fearful of claims against them from workers seeking compensation for the effects of passive smoking. The tribunal decided Mrs May Dryden, 63, was not forced to leave her job at Glasgow's Western Infirmary after Greater Glasgow Health Board introduced a smoking ban. Mrs Dryden, who smokes 25 cigarettes a day, told the tribunal she could not go eight hours without a cigarette and therefore had to leave her job. She said the health board banned smoking on its premises last summer. It did not set aside rooms for smokers or allow them time to smoke outside. The tribunal's decision will affect hundreds of smokers who still work for the health board. Written reasons for the decision will be given later. The health board said it was pleased the tribunal had decided in its favour. It would wait for the written reasons before commenting further. Mrs Dryden said: 'I am disappointed for myself but I am more disappointed for my colleagues that evidently nothing is going to be done about this situation.' Up to one in five employers now operate anti-smoking policies. They include Midland Bank, IBM, Marks and Spencer and the Inland Revenue. Ms Alison Hillhouse, director of Ash, the anti-smoking group, said the ruling was encouraging. The Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco (Forest) said the ruling meant British workplaces were moving closer to those in the US, where 'employers are dictating what people do outside their working hours'.

'African economies have been typified by low skill levels, inferior infrastructure, wasteful public expenditure and ineffective institutions,' the report says. As a result, the ODA has moved the balance of British aid to Africa towards supporting economic reform programmes 'designed to improve the policy and institutional environment,' the report says. In an separate assessment of more than 200 completed projects from 1966 to 1989, the ODA also reveals that 45 per cent of the projects were either failures, or only partially successful. Evaluation reports 'highlighted the difficulty of succeeding at the project level if the policies of the developing country at sector and national level are unsatisfactory.' The ODA identifies a stark contrast with Asia, where significant problems are confronted in just 10 per cent of projects. When the value rather than the number of the problematical projects is measured, the problem is even worse. In Africa, which accounted for projects worth Pounds 324m assessed in 1989-90 and 1990-91, overruns and other 'major' problems affected projects worth about Pounds 140m - or about 42 per cent. In contrast, Asia attracted funding worth Pounds 100m, but ran into complications in just 10 per cent.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Mr Borlaug told a meeting at the Overseas Development Institute yesterday: 'Some people say that Africa's food problems can be solved without the application of chemical fertilisers. They're dreaming. It's not possible'. He said that the environmentalists advocating traditional farming methods failed to recognise the rapid growth in population expected in the continent. The population of sub-Saharan Africa was set to double in the next 22 years, he claimed, which would put a considerable strain on non-chemical farming. China had managed to transform its production of cereals in the five years between 1975 and 1980, increasing yields by a tonne a hectare by using chemical fertilisers, Mr Borlaug said. China's output of cereals had risen from 238m tonnes to 285m tonnes during that period even though farmers had already been using organic compost on the land. Today China produced the most cereals in the world with average yields of 4 tonnes per hectare, Mr Borlaug said. Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest use of fertiliser in the world and soil nutrients were so low that other efforts to raise crop productivity would not be successful until fertility was improved. Mr Borlaug said, however, that it was extremely expensive for African countries to import fertiliser, and he called on industrialised nations to provide the continent's farmers with access to adequate inputs.

With nearly 10 million yuan it has raised, the project has  set up schooling foundations in 21 counties and built 21 primary  and secondary schools, the officials said.    Poverty, plus the big flood in 1991, has led to the exodus  of  thousands of children in the province from their schools.    But the Hope Project, which is helping to reverse the trend,  has received wide support both from within and from outside the  province. Donors range from kindergarten children to professors  and government officials, as well as companies and other  institutions.    State Councilor Peng Penyun now personally underwrites one  child's schooling. Youths in Tianjin made donations to build  three schools. The China Pingan Insurance Company donated  500,000 yuan to help 1,000 children with their education. The  company also helped build a primary school at Liuan County.    Donators also included business people and artists from Hong  Kong and Taiwan.    Overseas institutions and individuals have also given a  helping hand. Chinese Americans in Los Angeles funded China's  first Hope Project school in Jinzhai County. A Hong Kong  entrepreneur donated 200,000 yuan. The United Nations  Children's Fund and a British organization for children have  also contributed to the cause.    In 1993, the province raised 11 million yuan through the  issue of a ""love heart"" lottery.    Zhang Zongyou, a sophomore at Fuyang Teacher's College, has  become China's first college student to reach campus through  Hope Project help.     "

The value of international construction orders won by British companies fell by 11 per cent compared with 1990 to Pounds 2.2bn last year. The biggest fall in orders was in North America where the value of contracts fell by more than 30 per cent from Pounds 1.14bn to Pounds 781m. The decline reflects the recession in US construction markets. Overseas contracts account for less than 10 per cent of total order books of British construction companies. However last year contractors made big gains in the Far East, the world's fastest-growing construction market. The value of Far Eastern contracts won by British companies jumped by almost two thirds from Pounds 353m to Pounds 575m, in spite of a fall of Pounds 75m in Hong Kong. Construction of Hong Kong's multi-billion pound Chek Lap Kok airport is expected to provide big opportunities for UK construction companies over the next few years. Costain, Trafalgar House and Amec have already won contracts for a project that rivals the Channel tunnel in size. British contractors also increased orders in the Middle East, once the world's biggest export construction market, now greatly reduced in size. The value of orders won by contractors rose to Pounds 245m last year from Pounds 200m in 1990.  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "

However, the pulp, newsprint and containerboard markets continued to be weak, said Mr Robert Findlay, president. MacMillan would cut costs further and concentrate on producing higher-margin products in the most economic locations, he said. Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 22.5m (USDollars 17.6m), or 19 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 7.1m, or 8 cents a share. Sales were CDollars 964m, up nearly 25 per cent. For the first six months of the year, profit was CDollars 68.8m, or 57 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 18.1m, or 20 cents a share last time. Half-year sales were CDollars 1.8bn, up 20 per cent. Mr Findlay said that in the current six months, North American timber prices should remain at current lower levels but export prices should average about first half-levels. Canadian Pacific Forest Products, one of North America's biggest newsprint producers, reduced its second-quarter operating loss to CDollars 11m from a CDollars 53m deficit a year earlier. Sales rose by 6 per cent to CDollars 490m. For the first six months of 1993, losses totalled CDollars 49m against CDollars 120m. Half-year sales were 5 per cent higher at CDollars 941m. Strong wood products markets were the main factor, but newsprint shipments and prices were higher. Production costs declined and a lower Canadian dollar helped. However, the pulp, paperboard and white paper markets were weak and two joint ventures reported higher losses. Interest expenses rose because of continuing heavy capital outlays financed through term debt. Offshore timber products markets were firm in the second quarter, despite a 40 per cent drop in North American prices, but the Japanese market is now being adversely affected by the recession. CPFP is raising CDollars 130m by spinning off its wood products business into a separate, publicly-held subsidiary. Better demand for fine papers and strong timber products markets helped Noranda Forest to report its first quarterly profit in three years for the three months ended June. Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 4m against a loss of CDollars 21m on sales of CDollars 374m against CDollars 367m. In February, Noranda sold 49 per cent of MacMillan Bloedel for CDollars 997m: this week it announced the disposal of 50 per cent of a western fine paper group for CDollars 82m. The first-half loss equalled 40 cents a share against 39 cents, on sales of CDollars 761m, adjusted for the MacMillan transaction. Primax, a western wood product company that sells mainly to Japan, doubled second-quarter earnings to CDollars 4.4m, or 51 cents a share. It warned that Japanese prices were declining.

0,FT923-12024 ,"FT923-12024 _AN-CGUANAFDFT 920721   FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Merck shows second-quarter growth      By ALAN FRIEDMAN and KAREN ZAGOR      NEW YORK   MERCK, the world's biggest drugs company, said sales growth from new products contributed to its 18 per cent increase in second-quarter net profits, to Dollars 653.4m. The results, a continuation of the US company's first-quarter performance, were struck on the back of a 12 per cent rise in sales for the second quarter, to Dollars 2.38bn. Merck's earnings per share were 57 cents, against 48 cents in the second quarter of last year. Although the Merck results represented a continuing improvement, Wall Street marked the company's share price Dollars  5/8 lower, to Dollars 49 3/8 . Second-quarter results from American Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals group, were also encouraging. Net earnings rose 11.9 per cent to Dollars 147.5m - on a per-share basis the improvement was 14.9 per cent, to Dollars 1.62. American Cyanamid's second-quarter sales were 4 per cent improved at Dollars 1.48bn. The company's share price was unchanged at Dollars 58 in late trading. Commenting on the Merck results, Dr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said both domestic and international operations reported solid unit volume gains. Sales outside the US accounted for 46 per cent of first-half 1992 total revenues of Dollars 4.6bn. Dr Vagelos said excluding foreign exchange adjustments, second-quarter sales were 11 per cent higher. Among the products helping to boost Merck's performance was the recently introduced Proscar drug, designed to treat prostate enlargement. Vasotec, which reduces high blood pressure and treats heart failure, also did well, as did Vaseretic and Prinivil, two other blood pressure drugs. The New Jersey-based American Cyanamid said increased crop protection chemicals sales helped its agricultural division earnings. Ethical drugs and medical devices led the improved performance in the group's medical division. But higher promotional costs associated with the introduction of the group's anti-smoking nicotine patch affected earnings. Chemical division sales and operating earnings were down in the second quarter because of lower military demand for chemical light products and higher manufacturing costs for that line. Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world's third biggest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday unveiled slightly lower second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 488m, against Dollars 489.5m a year ago, after taking a special charge to settle legal and federal regulatory actions. The company, which recorded five per cent higher second-quarter revenues of Dollars 2.88bn, took a Dollars 46m pre-tax charge as a result of its agreement to settle an anti-trust lawsuit involving claims that the company conspired to rig the prices of infant formula. Mead Johnson, the Bristol-Myers infant formula division, also recently agreed to a settlement of charges by the Federal Trade Commission that the company, together with two other infant formula makers - Abbott Laboratories and American Home Products - engaged in price rigging and other improper trading practices. Mr Richard Gelb, chairman of Bristol-Myers Squibb, said US sales were unchanged while international sales were 14 per cent higher in the quarter, with foreign exchange fluctuations helping sales by one per cent. Earnings per share were unchanged at 94 cents. On Wall Street, the company's share price was marked Dollars 1 higher to Dollars 66. Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday unveiled a 7 per cent increase in second-quarter net earnings to Dollars 338.2m, or Dollars 1.16, from Dollars 317.5m, or Dollars 1.08 a year earlier. Sales also rose 7 per cent, to Dollars 1.48bn from Dollars 1.38bn, writes Karen Zagor in New York. For the first six months of 1992, Lilly's net earnings advanced 11 per cent to Dollars 780.8m, or Dollars 2.67 from Dollars 706.1m, or Dollars 2.43 in the same period of last year. Sales were 8 per cent higher at Dollars 3.04bn from Dollars 2.81bn.  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, the   Secretary is authorized to establish a national reserve from the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent to not more than 1 percent of the national acreage allotment for the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments, adjusting for inequities, and for establishing allotments for new farms. The Secretary has determined that the national reserve, noted herein, for the 1994 crop of each of these kinds of tobacco is adequate for these purposes.     On December 21, 1993, a proposed rule was published   (58 FR 67376) in which interested persons were requested to comment with respect to these issues.         Discussion of Comments         Thirty-one written responses were received during the comment period which ended February 4, 1994. Some respondents discussed more than one kind of tobacco. A summary of these comments by kind of tobacco follows:     (1)     Fire-cured (type 21) tobacco.     Eight comments were received. Four comments recommended that quotas be increased by 5 percent. Two others recommended that the marketing quotas be increased by 10 percent from the 1993 MY while two more requested an unspecified increase.     (2)     Fire-cured (types 2223) tobacco.     Four comments were received, all recommending a five percent increase from the 1993 marketing quota.     (3)     Dark air-cured (types 3536) tobacco.     Five comments were received. Recommendations ranged from a 5-percent decrease to a 10-percent decrease in the quota.     (4)     Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco.     Eight comments were received. Recommendations ranged from a   5-percent to a 20-percent increase in quota.     (5)     Cigar-filler and binder (types 4244 and 5355) tobacco.     Six comments were received. These comments ranged from no change in quota to a 35-percent decrease in quota.     (6)     Cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco.     No comments were   received.     Based upon a review of these comments and the latest available statistics of the Federal Government, which appear to be the most reliable data available, the following determinations have been made.         (1) Fire-Cured (Type 21) Tobacco         The yearly average quantity of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco produced in the United States which is estimated to have been consumed in the United States during the 10 MYs preceding the 199394 MY is approximately 1.5 million pounds. The average annual quantity of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco produced in the United States and exported from the United States during the 10 MYs preceding the 199394 MY was 2.7 million pounds (farm sales weight basis). Both domestic use and exports have trended sharply downward. For that reason, a normal year's domestic consumption has been determined to be 0.5 million pounds and a normal year's exports have been determined to be 2.1 million pounds. Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 5.61 million pounds.     Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 4.4 million pounds. The 1993 fire-cured (type 21) tobacco crop is estimated to be 1.9 million pounds. Therefore, the total supply of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco for the 1993 MY is 6.3 million pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total approximately 2.5 million pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 3.8 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained.     The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 1.81 million pounds. This represents the quantity of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. Less than 85 percent of the announced national marketing quota is expected to be produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a national marketing quota of 2.15 million pounds is necessary to make available production of 1.81 million pounds. Accordingly, the national marketing quota for the 1994 MY is 2.15 million pounds. In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 2.15 million pounds by the 198993, 5-year national average yield of 1,388 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment of 1,548.99 acres.     Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, a national acreage factor of 1.05 is determined by dividing the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 5.0 acres, by the total of 1994 preliminary farm acreage allotments (previous year's allotments). The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g) of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms.         (2) Fire-Cured (Types 2223) Tobacco         The yearly average quantity of fire-cured (types 2223) tobacco produced in the United States which is estimated to have been consumed in the United States during the 10 years preceding the 1993 MY was approximately 17.8 million pounds. The average annual quantity of fire-cured (types 2223) tobacco produced in the United States and exported during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993 MY was 16.9 million pounds (farm sales weight basis). Both domestic use and exports have trended upward recently. A normal year's domestic consumption has for that reason been determined to be 21.8 million pounds and a normal year's exports have been determined to be 20.7 million pounds. Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 98.8 million pounds.     Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of fire-cured (types 2223) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 64.0 million pounds. The 1993 fire-cured (types 2223) crop is estimated to be 36.8 million pounds. Therefore, the total supply of fire-cured (types 2223) tobacco for the MY beginning October 1, 1993, is 100.8 million pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total approximately 34.0 million pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 66.8 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained.     The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 32.0 million pounds. This represents the quantity of fire-cured (types 2223) tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during the 1994 MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. About 95 percent of the announced national marketing quota is expected to be produced.

0,FT932-116 ,"FT932-116 _AN-DGABBAECFT 930630   FT  30 JUN 93 / BAT swaps tobacco brands with rival      By PHILIP RAWSTORNE   BAT Industries and American Brands, the rival tobacco groups, are to swap some cigarette brands as part of a drive towards pan-European marketing. The move, a rare example of consumer companies swapping brands to simplify their ownership, was announced yesterday as BAT revealed that the cigarette price war in the US would reduce first-half trading profits at its Brown  Williamson subsidiary by Dollars 75m (Pounds 50m). The problem lay in excessive stocks of its full-price US brands, notably Kool. BAT will acquire from American Brands the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall cigarette businesses in France. In exchange, American Brands will get BAT's Benson  Hedges operations in the duty-paid markets of the European Community and European Free Trade Area. As part of the deal, prompted by the creation of the European single market, American Brands will pay BAT about Pounds 135m - Pounds 70m in cash with the balance paid over 10 years according to BH sales. The Pounds 135m will be included as a pre-tax profit in BAT's accounts for 1993. The net trading profit foregone is estimated at about Pounds 8m a year. The arrangements have been approved by the EC Commission. Mr Ulrich Herter, managing director of BAT's tobacco business, said: 'This is a key development which will enable the group to build on the continuing success of Lucky Strike in Europe by focusing on the brand and unifying its marketing.' BAT, which owns the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall trademarks in the rest of Europe, will continue to license the brands in France to Seita, the state-owned tobacco company. Sales of Lucky Strike in France have increased by 27 per cent a year since 1989 to 1.2bn cigarettes and BAT believes it offers scope for development across Europe. BAT's worldwide Lucky Strike volume, which has grown by 18 per cent a year to 17.1bn since 1989, will also benefit from the deal which extends its rights to the brand into the US duty-free trade and a number of other markets, including the Philippines, Algeria and Cuba. American Brands will retain control of the US domestic market where the brand's sales volume amounted to 1.7bn last year. Gallaher, the British subsidiary of the US group, which owns the Benson  Hedges brand in the UK and Ireland, will now manufacture and market the brand throughout the rest of western Europe. However, BAT - which owns the biggest UK export brand, State Express 555 - will retain control of the BH brand in European duty-free and other international markets. Sales of BH in Europe last year accounted for 3bn of total worldwide volume of 17bn. Lex, Page 24   Companies:-  BAT Industries.     American Brands Inc.

0,FT941-8706 ,"FT941-8706 _AN-EBRCXADCFT 940218   FT  18 FEB 94 / Technology: China exports Torch      By PETER WISE   Since China launched its Torch Programme in 1988, the cream of the country's 8m scientists and technicians has been mobilised in a big effort to exploit high technology. So far, the 100,000 specialists chosen by the State Science and Technology Commission have developed more than 1,500 industrial applications in new materials, biotechnology, electronics, information technology, energy saving and environmental protection. China is eager to reap more benefits from this effort by exporting new technology and finding foreign partners. Beijing is also keen to incorporate applications researched abroad into its own programme. Thus China recently established a joint venture (to be known as Torch Overseas or Torch Worldwide) with Micro Electronics International Europa, a supplier of Chinese-made telecommunications equipment based in Portugal. The new company will explore the market for Chinese technology, introduce advanced technology into China, supply equipment for high-tech production in China, foster joint ventures and promote foreign investment in Chinese projects. 'The Torch Programme is designed to take Chinese industry out of the 19th century into the 21st,' says Roman von Rupp, the Lisbon-based president of MEI Europa. 'The opportunities the programme offers to foreign companies are vast but most of the international business community has not yet become aware of it.' MEI manufactures telecommunications and other equipment in China, sometimes using Japanese technology. It has offices in Japan where it researches electronics projects. A Torch delegation visited universities and research centres in Lisbon last November. Chinese authorities are examining the market potential of two applications developed in Portugal - one uses halogen lamps to grow low-cost thin ribbons of crystalline silicon, the other is a computer program for public transport planning.

Considering that hiring of university graduates in the spring of  1995 and 1996 will in principle be zero, it will accelerate  personnel reductions and condense fixed costs. Along with making  a 30-percent reduction by gradually reorganizing existing  vehicle classes with full model changes implemented in the  future, Mazda will increase the ratio of shared parts with old  models to over 50 percent, and proceed with large-scale cost  reductions. Making these take root, it will turn to an ordinary  surplus in fiscal 1995, and thereafter, it is prepared to aim at  ""a management constitution capable of paying dividends even with  a 70-percent operation"" (Vice President Makoto Miyaji).    For the new-graduate hiring program, it had worked out zero  university graduate hiring in the spring of 1995, but the policy  is to continue this in the spring of 1996 also. In the plan to  reduce employees from 30,000 to 27,000 in the three-year period  from 1993 to 1995, no more than a total of 60 university  graduate BA's and BS's were hired this spring. Zero hiring for  two consecutive years is unusual, even in the auto industry.    To decrease the cost of vehicles, it is promoting in the  mid-  to long-term 1) a 30-percent reorganization of existing car  classes (26 classes), 2) 30-percent reduction in platforms (17  types) which are the basic frame of the vehicle, and 3) making  the parts diversion from old models to new models over 50  percent. In particular, it will review existing methods from the  vehicle planning stage and have drastic cost goals, with the  idea to ""aim at a profit improvement of 10 percent more than for  existing cars.""    Regarding reorganization of sales channels, which has become  an urgent task, it will maintain the present five-channel  system, but improve earnings by reorganization of stores in  important sales regions and expanding the ""combined sales  system"" of selling the same car classes in several channels.    Regarding their relationship with Ford Motor of the United  States, it considers it ""an important key supporting business in  the mid- to long-term"" and is studying joint development,  reciprocal adaptability of parts, and joint enterprises overseas.    Furthermore, in the short term, at the same time as  proceeding with a move up in cost decreases such as VA (value  analysis) and VE (value engineering) activities, it will hold  the amount of facilities investment for the time being to under  50 billion yen a year. The policy also is to expand the  reduction scale for the personnel reduction of 3,000 people in  the plan by rationalization of plants.    The goal is to have a constitution which can pay dividends  even with 70-percent operation (production capability of 1.1  million cars per year) in the next three to four years.     "
0,FT911-106 ,"FT911-106 _AN-BENBQADTFT 910514   FT  14 MAY 91 / Charity counts blessings amid aid fatigue / A look at Christian Aid as it launches its 35th annual appeal for funds      By NEIL BUCKLEY   TO THE many crises that have hit the developing world this year, a new one has recently been added: aid fatigue. Christian Aid, however, which yesterday launched the 35th Christian Aid week, claims so far to be immune. Although the Charities Aid Foundation has estimated that average household donations in Britain dropped by a third in recent years, Christian Aid's income in the last financial year held up well. 'We don't seem to have been affected by aid fatigue. Our support seems to have been maintained, even during the last three months,' says Mr Paul Tyler, head of finance at Christian Aid. This may be because of Christian Aid's link with the churches. It is sponsored by 41 churches and benefits from church fund raising. Christian Aid week is Britain's biggest regular fund-raising event - and the longest-running. Last year it raised Pounds 6.7m and this year hopes for at least Pounds 8m, with 400,000 volunteers delivering 16m collecting envelopes throughout Britain. The charity has come a long way from its roots as Christian Reconstruction in Europe, when it was set up in 1944 to help rebuild church and family life across the war-torn continent. One grant from its first Pounds 1m - raised through Victory in Europe collections and church grants - went towards buying hundreds of bicycles to enable clergy on the continent to get around their ruined parishes. Another funded a caravan stocked by Sainsburys on the Austro-Hungarian border to feed Hungarian refugees. In later decades the charity, renamed Christian Aid, built on its experience of refugee relief and resettlement in Europe and now works in more than 70 countries. It differs from all the overseas aid agencies except Cafod, the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development, in that it does not have its own staff based overseas, but works through indigenous church and other organisations. It aims to be an 'enabler', providing the funds and the means for local people to carry out aid and development work. 'Setting up an expatriate operation abroad is very time-consuming and costly, and it's very difficult to shift from that to something sustainable,' says Mr Paul Spray, head of aid. 'If you start with an organisation that is already there and set up, the chances of sustaining it are much greater.' Although the charity received about a third of its Pounds 33m income last year from government sources, most of it from the Overseas Development Agency for disaster relief, most of the rest was spent not on disaster relief but on long-term development programmes such as providing medical assistance in India, installing solar-powered water pumps in Somalia, and leadership training and advising farmers in Chile. Christian Aid shares its funds almost equally among churches, other Christian organisations, and secular groups. Education and campaigning inevitably plays an important part in Christian Aid's work, accounting for up to 10 per cent of expenditure - and can be a source of criticism, although the charity has so far avoided any clashes with the Charity Commission, the British charities watchdog. The commission last week published a report instructing Oxfam, Britain's biggest overseas aid charity, to stop mixing politics with charitable work, which could have important implications for other organisations such as Christian Aid. 'There is an area of unclarity about what charities can do,' says Michael Taylor, Christian Aid's director. 'But you can't have charity without politics. If a charity has a real concern for the good of the poor, it must be prepared to encourage governments to adopt policies that help the situation and don't make it worse.'

EFFECTIVE DATE:     January 27, 1994.              FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     David J. Goldberger or Michelle Frederick, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC, 20230; telephone (202) 4824136 or 4820186, respectively.         INITIATION OF INVESTIGATION:     The Petition         On December 30, 1993, we received a petition filed in proper form by Rhone-Poulenc Specialty Chemicals Co. (petitioner). Petitioner submitted amendments to the petition on January 13 and 14, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioner alleges that imports of coumarin from the People's Republic of China (PRC) are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that such imports are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, a U.S. industry.     Petitioner stated that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and the petition is filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.         Scope of Investigation         The product covered by this investigation is coumarin. Coumarin is an aroma chemical with the chemical formula C    9    H    6    O    2     that is also known by other names, including 2H-1-benzopyran-2-one, 1,2-benzopyrone, cis-o-coumaric acid lactone, coumarinic anhydride, 2Oxo-1,2-benzopyran, 5,6-benzo-alpha-pyrone, ortho-hydroxyc innamic acid lactone, cis-ortho-coumaric acid anhydride, and tonka bean camphor.     All forms and variations of coumarin are included within the scope of the petition, such as coumarin in crystal, flake, or powder form, and ``crude'' or unrefined coumarin (i.e. prior to purification or crystallization). Excluded from the scope are ethylcoumarins (C    11    H    10    O    2    ) and methylcoumarins (C    10    H    8    O    2    ). Coumarin is classifiable under subheading 2932.21.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.         United States Price and Foreign Market Value         Petitioner based United States price (USP) on average unit prices derived from U.S. Census import statistics, and on price lists from U.S. importers of coumarin.     Petitioner contends that the foreign market value (FMV) of PRC-produced imports subject to this investigation must be determined in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, which concerns non-market economy (NME) countries. The PRC is presumed to be an NME within the meaning of section 771(18)(C) of the Act, and the Department has treated it as such in previous investigations (see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Compact Ductile Iron Waterworks Fittings and Accessories Thereof from the PRC, 58 FR 37908 (July 14, 1993)). In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to address this NME presumption and provide relevant information and argument on this issue. In addition, parties will have the opportunity in this investigation to submit comments on whether FMV should be based on prices or costs in the NME (see Amendment to Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Amendment to Antidumping Duty Order: Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts from the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 15052 (April 24, 1992)).     Because of the extent of central control in an NME, the Department further considers that a single antidumping margin, should there be one, is appropriate for all exporters from the NME. Only if individual NME exporters are free of central government ownership and can demonstrate an absence of central governmental control with respect to the pricing of exports, both in law and in fact, will they be considered eligible for separate, owner-specific deposit rates. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's Republic of China, September 20, 1993, (58 FR 48833) for a discussion of the information the Department considers appropriate to warrant calculation of separate rates.)     In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, FMV in NME cases is based on NME producers' factors of production (valued in a market economy country). Absent evidence that the PRC government determines which factories shall produce for export to the United States, we intend, for purposes of this investigation, to base FMV only on those factories in the PRC which are known to produce coumarin for export to the United States.     Petitioner calculated FMV on the basis of the valuation of the factors of production. The factors of production used by petitioner were based on petitioner's experience at its manufacturing facility, which it states is comparable to the PRC production process.     In valuing the factors of production, petitioner used India as the surrogate country. For purposes of this initiation, we have, pursuant to section 773(c)(4) of the Act, accepted India as an appropriate surrogate country because its economy is comparable to the PRC's.

This is the first of a series of business-related initiatives for Earth Week. The guarantees will be issued by the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation for medium-term notes to be placed by J P Morgan, the investment bank. The fund will be managed by Global Environmental Emerging Markets Fund, a limited partnership, which has raised Dollars 20m more. Mrs Ruth Harkin, Opic president, said the fund could eventually make loans totalling some Dollars 500m-Dollars 700m. It is a prime example of the kind of 'public-private' initiatives the administration will support to develop new technologies and boost exports. It requires private sector companies also to put their own money at risk. The environmental fund is the fifth private equity fund Opic has supported. Two more region-specific funds are to be announced and more are in the pipeline. Mr H Jeffrey Leonard, president of Global Environment Management Corporation, said the growth areas for trade in environmental technology were clean water and clean energy. 'Rapidly industrialising countries in Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe need to increase dramatically the production of electricity to maintain economic growth.' The US Commerce Department is for the first time taking a big role in Earth Week activities, which are taking place globally this week and are aimed at focusing attention on environmental issues. It yesterday briefed journalists on its work to develop a 'green GDP', a statistical analysis of the environment as it relates to the economy.

In an unusual public criticism of the bank's management, the Overseas Development Administration said normal processes for monitoring implementation of projects had failed. It hoped it would not be necessary again to commission an independent review of a bank-funded project. Following a report by Mr Bradford Morse, a former administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, and Mr Thomas Berger, a former Canadian Supreme Court judge, the World Bank's executive board decided on Friday to continue funding the project, subject to a rigorous performance review next April. The board had considered whether to halt financing. However, Mr David Peretz, UK executive director of the bank, said that since India intended to proceed with or without support, continued Bank involvement offered the best hope for rescuing the project. Mr Peretz said the Morse report was a serious indictment of the Indian authorities and the Bank's management. The Bank's own guidelines on resettlement were repeatedly ignored; timetables for environmental impact assessments had not been met; compliance with legal covenants was lax; there was no effective consultation with those affected. Mr Peretz told the board: 'The pattern of inadequate supervision and enforcement fits in with concerns we have expressed for some time about the Bank's capacity to monitor large or complex projects.'

Volume fell to an estimated 192m shares from the 492.94m traded on Friday. The benchmark 225 average crept down 3.20 points to finish at 18,975.10. It remained in a narrow range all day, moving between a high of 19,071.61 and a low of 18,959.09. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 2.30 to 1,503.78, while the capital-weighted Nikkei 300 ticked down 0.32 to 277.29. Declining stocks outpaced gainers by 569 to 366 with 235 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.56 to close at 1247.69. Following its 201.74 drop on Friday the market made strong early gains, largely on bargain hunting and fund manager buying for corporate employee stock ownership plans. In the first 15 minutes of trading, the Nikkei took more than 60 points of Friday's losses, but the absence of market moving news undercut the rally and stocks quickly retreated from their early highs. Some brokers felt that recent losses in Hong Kong and the collapse of Orange County due to speculation in derivatives continued to weigh heavily on the market. Large capital stocks, including Japan Tobacco and some steelmakers, fell on selling by foreign brokerage houses. Japan Tobacco made a new low since privatisation of Y920,000, down Y20,000. East Japan Railway, which had just suffered a crippling electrical failure which stranded thousands of weekend passengers, finished unchanged at Y469,000. Nippon Steel shed Y9 to Y349.

KUALA LUMPUR encountered further redemption-linked liquidation by foreign institutions which, together with forced selling by clients unable to meet margin calls, sent the the composite index down another 15.49 or 1.7 per cent to a new closing low for the year of 895.77. Tenaga Nasional's attempt at recovery was short-lived with the issue ending down 10 cents at MDollars 9.55 after hitting an early high of MDollars 9.80. Telekom Malaysia fared slightly better, closing up 10 cents at MDollars 16 after reaching a high of MDollars 16.30.

The BSE-30 share index, which opened 1.2 per cent lower, lost 83.39 to 3,884.48 with several foreign mutual funds said to be booking profits. TAIPEI was mixed as positive corporate fundamentals were offset by investor nervousness over sales by funds to meet year-end redemptions and dividends.

C. Tsai]    [Text] Johannesburg, March 22 (CNA) -- South African  police on Tuesday [22 March] rapped Britain's Environmental  Investigation Agency (EIA) for falsely accusing a Taiwan  diplomat of involvement in rhino horn trade.    Pieter Lategan, chief of the Endangered Species Protection  Unit (ESPU) under the South African Police Administration, said  the Republic of China [ROC] Embassy and the Republic of China's  National Police Administration have worked closely with the ESPU  on wildlife protection.    None of the embassy officials or vehicles were ever involved  in rhino horn smuggling, Lategan said.    Moreover, he noted, no one from the ESPU has ever been  interviewed by the EIA.    The South African official said he has phoned the EIA to  express his strong dissatisfaction at the accusations. In  addition, he has sent a letter to the London-based conservation  group requesting a detailed explanation of the accusations.    During a meeting of non-government organizations (NGO)  following the Standing Committee meeting of the Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Geneva  Monday, the EIA aired a 20-minute videotape, in which a South  African policeman charged Taiwan envoys with smuggling rhino  horns.    A statement issued by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Tuesday said the man accused of rhino horn smuggling was not a  diplomat but an Overseas Chinese who once worked as a member of  the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest watchdog body.    The man, Yen Nuo, was [word indistinct] in South Africa in  February 1986 for illegally trading in rhino horns, but was  found not guilty as Yen had a license to sell rhino horns issued  by the South African Government.    Meanwhile, a report from Geneva said the CITES Standing  Committee has decided to ignore the EIA's accusations.     "

0,FT931-6041 ,"FT931-6041 _AN-DCCCKAEOFT 930303   FT  03 MAR 93 / RJR creates 'smoke-free' stock      By NIKKI TAIT      NEW YORK   RJR NABISCO, the US group which was subject to a record Dollars 25bn (Pounds 17.6bn) leveraged buy-out in 1989, is to create a separate class of shares tied directly to the fortunes of its worldwide food operations, technically making them a 'smoke-free' zone. The move will allow investors to hold shares unconnected with RJR's tobacco interests. Tobacco shares have been hurt by discount brands and fears that the US will impose higher taxes and tougher rules on smoking at work. Some institutions are barred from holding them by 'ethical considerations'. RJR's aim is to raise about Dollars 1.5bn, helping to pay off group debt which financial restructurings have already cut from Dollars 30bn at the time of the buy-out to about Dollars 14bn. The shares, to be called RN-Nabisco Group stock, will initially be sold to new investors. The company plans an offering of 93m Nabisco shares, representing 25 per cent of the food group's equity, at a price of Dollars 17-Dollars 19 a share. About six months later, the company will issue further Nabisco shares, representing a 47 per cent equity interest in the food group, to existing RJR Nabisco shareholders. Existing RJR Nabisco ordinary shares will be redesignated as RN-Reynolds stock, and will represent a 100 per cent interest in the tobacco operations and a 28 per cent interest in the food business. RJR will also start paying dividends, on both classes of stock. Someone owning 100 RJR Nabisco shares today would ultimately end up with 12.5 RN-Nabisco shares and 33.3 RN-Reynolds shares. The annual dividend on each RN-Nabisco share would be 52 cents; on each RN-Reynolds share, it would be Dollars 1 in respect of the tobacco interests plus a further 'pass-through' dividend to reflect the retained 28 per cent interest in the food business's equity. This is not a full demerger of the food operations, which had sales of Dollars 6.7bn last year and operating profits of Dollars 947m, and RJR Nabisco stressed there would be no transfer of legal title to assets. Mr Lou Gerstner, RJR's chairman, said the move was designed to 'enhance the value of the company for shareholders and attract new shareholders by underscoring the distinct growth characteristics of the food industry and cashflow characteristics'.

These industry member requirements are covered whether the agreement or other arrangement originates with the industry member or the third party. For example, a supplier enters into a contractual agreement or other arrangement with a third party. This agreement or arrangement contains an industry member requirement as described above. The third party, a ballclub, or municipal or private corporation, not acting as a retailer, leases the concession rights and is able to control the purchasing decisions of the retailer. The third party, as a result of the requirement, by agreement or otherwise, with the industry member, requires the retailer to purchase the industry member's products to the exclusion, in whole or in part, of products sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce.

The practices specified in this section are deemed not to result in exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act:    (a) A supply contract for one year or less between the industry member and retailer under which the industry member agrees to sell distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages to the retailer on an ``as needed'' basis provided that the retailer is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of such product.

(b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.    (c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product.    (d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry member's products.

That's stirring new interest in the market on the part of U.S.  investors, who are remembering all those post-Berlin Wall stories about the  united Germany's dynamic future as the economic leader of the ""new Europe.""    Should you have money invested in German stocks? Yes, most global market  strategists will tell you. Will you have to wait awhile for your payoff? Most  likely, yes. But to try and time the turn of events in Germany would probably  be futile. When that market moves, it moves very quickly.    In the first quarter of this year, the West German market was the world's  hottest. From January 1 to April 2, the Frankfurt exchange's 30-share DAX index  rose 10%, to 1,976.43. In the same period, the U.S. market fell 3.4% and  Japan's plunged 26%.    But just as the U.S. and Japanese markets rebounded in the spring, Germany's  stagnated. Steve Keddell, who handles big U.S. investors' trades of German  stocks for Deutsche Bank in New York, notes that the German market was hit by a  number of problems at once: concerns about the cost of unification; rising  interest rates; a strong Deutschemark, which hurt export profits, and turmoil  in Brazil, a big market for German firms.    Those problems sent the DAX down to 1,787.39 by June 13. Then, last week,  buyers returned, boosting the DAX 80.66 points for the week to 1,872.92 on  Friday.    Is this the start of a new surge? That's probably up to American and Japanese  investors. Because the German stock market is relatively small, ""in the short  term, what drives German stocks is the action of outsiders"" who suddenly throw  large sums at the stocks, says George Murnaghan. He runs two international  stock mutual funds for T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.    Some American investors believe that relief over the economic cementing of East  Germany with the West on July 2 -- via East Germany's conversion to West  Germany's currency -- could precipitate a flood of money into German stocks.  ""The market could rebound violently,"" says Frank Jennings, who runs American  International Group's $500-million international investment portfolio.    On the surface, German stocks don't appear overpriced. Keddell says the average  stock on the Frankfurt exchange sells for 14 times estimated 1990 earnings per  share, about on par with U.S. stocks and well below Japan's still-lofty  price/earnings ratios.    The big question now is whether West German companies will be able to show  decent profit growth this year and next. Keddell admits that his expectations  are coming down. ""We originally expected 12% (average) earnings growth this  year, but we now see 9%,"" he says. And for 1991, he sees just 7%.    The problem is that no one knows what West German companies will have to invest  to revitalize their East German counterparts, as unification proceeds. There is  a growing realization, however, that ""these companies will have to spend a lot  of money before they can earn anything,"" Keddell says.    George Noble, one of Fidelity Group's key international stock managers, toured  the two Germanys earlier this month. He returned to the United States sobered  about chances of a fast payoff from unification. In fact, Noble cut back a bit  on his Overseas Fund's position in German stocks.    The East German economy is a shambles, he says. Its plants are grossly  inefficient. Officials at a West German auto parts plant told Noble about an  Eastern counterpart that employs 800 people. The Western plant produces as much  with 150.    Everyone knows there's a huge bill that the West Germans will have to pay to  rebuild the East. The German stock market may even be prepared for little or no  earnings growth by German firms this year and next, as capital spending soars.  The big unknown, says Noble, is whether social upheaval in the East will lead  to rioting. That could panic foreign investors.    ""I think you're going to see unemployment be a real problem,"" he says. Add the  potential for interest rates to remain high -- as the two Germanys borrow  massively to fund unification -- and Noble believes German stocks could slide  further this year.    But beyond the short-term gloom, he says he is convinced that the German market  could one day be the world's best -- because German economic power is certain  to be pre-eminent in Europe. If you think you can time the market, good luck.  The smartest investors will probably put money into German stocks this year,  and vow not to touch them for three years minimum.

However, Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said the government did not plan additional measures to stimulate the economy with the risk of rekindling inflation.

The figures indicated no dramatic effect  on sales because of rising gasoline prices spurred by tension in the Mideast.    It was the first full vehicle sales period since Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait  on Aug. 2. The Big Three auto makers -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- said their  cars and trucks sold at an average daily rate of 32,674 units during the Aug.  11-20 period, compared to a daily rate of 34,290 in the period last year. Car  sales fell 10%; truck sales rose 5.1% based on strong sales of GM and Ford  vehicles.

0,FT943-5684 ,"FT943-5684 _AN-EICAFAEHFT 940902   FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Vickers ahead but shares fall on recovery warning      By ANDREW BOLGER   Shares in Vickers fell 7p to 188p yesterday after the engineering group, which makes tanks and Rolls-Royce cars, said it was seeing only a patchy recovery. Pre-tax profits nearly doubled, from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 15.9m, but were still slightly below market expectations. Sales were flat at Pounds 330m (Pounds 331m). Sir Richard Lloyd, chairman, said the recovery in results which started last year had continued, but this was more to do with plant rationalisation and efficiency measures than improvements in markets. Sales of Rolls-Royce cars rose slightly, from 683 to to 701, and higher sales in the UK and east Asia (excluding Japan) offset poor sales in North America. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said he hoped by the end of the year to reveal the outcome of talks the group has been having with other manufacturers over collaboration on new model programmes. Vickers will not say who it has been talking to, but is known to have been discussing the purchase of V12 engines and other components from Mercedes-Benz of Germany. Cosworth, the high-performance engine subsidiary, is still suffering from declining demand for special Ford Escorts and Scorpios, but is investing in a new factory for its castings business and an emission centre. The group's defence systems business now has a total order book of Pounds 1.5bn, following the government's recent confirmation of the follow-on order for 259 Challenger 2 tanks, in addition to the 127 tanks ordered in 1991. Sir Colin said the strength of this order book made the defence business a much stronger and more attractive partner when considering collaborative projects. The medical division's contribution fell, partly because of continued uncertainty over the proposed Clinton healthcare reforms and tough trading conditions for distributors in continental Europe. The propulsion technology division continued to suffer from the depressed state of the aerospace business, but on the marine side the Swedish-based KaMeWa company had an 'outstanding' six months. Earnings per share improved to 3.6p (1.9p). The interim dividend rose to 1.75p (1.25p). COMMENT The trading statement was deliberately downbeat, to lower expectations about the speed of likely recovery. But Vickers still looks in a strong position, following last year's Pounds 60m rights issue and the recent award of the crucial Challenger order. Capital investment is being increased - particularly at Cosworth - and there is some scope for margin improvement at the tank factories. On a prospective multiple of 19, the shares cannot be called cheap, but a modest upturn in demand for cars will sharply improve the bottom line. The shares are unlikely to move decisively until the group reveals its decision over collaboration on the next generation of luxury cars.   Companies:-  Vickers.

RJR hopes that, with its 70 per cent interest in the Lviv tobacco factory in western Ukraine and in the Kremenchuh tobacco factory in the south-central area of the country, it will be able to supply more than one-quarter of the 80bn cigarettes Ukraine's 52m people smoke annually. The deal will make RJR, which already produces cigarettes in St Petersburg, the largest producer in the Commonwealth of Independent States and represents a wider attempt by the company to expand into east Europe and the former Soviet Union, where smoking is still fashionable. 'It should be recognised that in eastern Europe and the CIS, total cigarette consumption is about 700bn units and represents a major potential market,' said Mr Thomas Marsh, RJR's regional president. 'I can assure you that RJR is not the only company which has recognised this.' These are tough times for tobacco companies in North America and western Europe, and RJR, which produces two of the 10 best-selling cigarette brands, has been under attack from the non-smoking lobby. By contrast, RJR executives have received a warm reception from Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president. 'Most people smoke and get great pleasure from smoking,' he said. Mr Kravchuk apologetically conceded that he was a non-smoker but hastened to add: 'My son is an enthusiastic smoker.' In turn, Mr Marsh praised Mr Kravchuk's commitment to 'very rapid movement to a free market' and said that the speed with which the Ukrainian government negotiated the joint venture has encouraged RJR Tobacco's parent company, RJR Nabisco, to invest in food processing in Ukraine. Mr Serhi Boriak, a part-time economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, who was hired as a consultant by RJR for the deal, said RJR was able to negotiate the agreement so swiftly by avoiding ministerial structures and working directly through the president. A Ukrainian official said RJR acquired its stakes in exchange for a Dollars 4m investment in new equipment in each factory.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT942-14789 ,"FT942-14789 _AN-EDSDVACSFT 940419   FT  19 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Help when you're all at sea - Exporting / Ian Hamilton Fazey offers a run-down of places offering advice to traders      By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY   British government help for UK exporters used to come from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, scattered through embassies around the world, along with the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK. But for the last two years government initiatives have been run by a joint directorate known as Overseas Trade Services. Industrial leaders, senior civil servants and export lobbyists say services are improving; nevertheless, where to go for advice has always been a problem for small businesses. The latest attempt to solve it, a planned nationwide network of 200 one-stop shops called Business Links, is supposed to end the confusion presented by an array of enterprise agencies, chambers of commerce, training and enterprise councils and other initiatives. However, there are only a handful of experimental ones at present - and probably only about 60 or 70 will play a 'hub' role. For the moment, one way of tapping into overseas trade services is to telephone the nearest regional DTI office, or the Welsh Office, Scottish Office or Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board. Information is the prime tool available, much of it generated by the government at taxpayers' expense. Indeed, the Treasury is making the DTI justify the Pounds 173m annual cost. This annoys the CBI and people like Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export, who say the UK's foreign competitors do similar things and the UK cannot afford not to. A quarter of the staff of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are in commercial posts. There are 203 sections around the world, of which 12 are in the US, seven in Germany and five in France. British staff in each section do a four-year tour of duty, supported by local staff. About 6,000 market information reports are produced each year, so the information base is vast and should be helpful, if only as a starting point. It can be supplemented by other services. The Export Market Information Centre in London (071 215 5444/5445) allows you to do your own desk research from government databases, published directories, trade statistics and market reports. There is an automated service matching companies to new export intelligence received daily by DTI. This is available through Prelink (081 900 1313). The government offers online access from your office computer to all its export intelligence through FT Profile (0932 76144), the electronic database owned by the Financial Times. Market Information Enquiries will assemble a tailor-made package of information on export opportunities for products, processes or services. It charges Pounds 35 for basic information and then in four-hour units for more complicated inquiries ranging from an initial Pounds 70 up to Pounds 355 for between 16 and 24 hours' work. The Export Marketing Research Scheme is more specific and detailed, providing professional advice and financial support, whether the work is done in-house or by a professional consultant. The Export Representative Service will help find a representative overseas through the government's own experts in the market concerned. The charge is Pounds 355 for up to 24 hours' work, Pounds 710 for up to 48 hours and Pounds 1,065 for longer. Overseas Status Reports provide assessments of the suitability of potential representatives or companies you want to do business with, but not creditworthiness. Charges are similar to those for Market Information Enquiries. Trade Fair Support pays for half the space and gives a fixed construction grant for up to three exhibitions in each market, but up to five in Japan and some parts of Germany and the US. New Products from Britain is a media relations service; Pounds 60 buys a professionally written news story aimed at securing editorial coverage in appropriate media in target markets. Trade Missions, organised by chambers of commerce or trade associations, are subsidised. Many companies find them a cheap way of sampling a market at first hand and for making contacts for subsequent visits. Reciprocal social obligations will usually involve attending a couple of receptions. The Programme Arranging Service usually builds on market information obtained through Market Information Enquiries, the Export Marketing Research Scheme or the Export Representative Service. It helps arrange appointments and gives advice on local business and culture in your target market. In-Market Help goes one step further, offering accompanied visits by local commercial experts and a de-briefing afterwards to help you consider your next steps. This concludes the series.

The number of UK residents travelling overseas in the three months to February was 9.6m, an increase of 6 per cent over the previous three months. Their spending rose 2 per cent to Pounds 3.28bn. In the 12 months to February, trips abroad by UK residents rose 7 per cent, and their spending rose 13 per cent. Overseas visitors to the UK rose 5 per cent to 5m in the three months to February compared with the previous three months - but their spending was broadly unchanged at Pounds 2.32bn. That meant a deficit of Pounds 960m compared with a deficit of Pounds 890m in the three months to November. In the year to February, the number of overseas visitors increased 3 per cent and their spending rose 14 per cent. The most popular destinations for UK travellers were western Europe, where the number of visits increased by 12 per cent. Visits to north America fell 7 per cent but trips to the rest of the world increased 7 per cent. The number of visitors from north America to the UK also fell 1 per cent while visitors from western Europe increased 4 per cent. There was a 3 per cent rise in those from the rest of the world. The Association of British Travel Agents said many UK residents sacrificed winter holidays abroad in the recession in the early 1990s. It added: 'But now they have taken one as they feel more confident the recession is over.

The reported award of the multi-million-pound contract to an  international group of arms manufacturers was called into  question by Mr Tom Clarke, Labour's Overseas Development  spokesman, yesterday.    The British Mines Advisory Group has expressed alarm at the  prospect that money earmarked by the UN for humanitarian  purposes could be given to munitions factories who profit twice  -- from the production and then the clearance of landmines.    The concern follows reports that Royal Ordnance successfully  headed a consortium, including Lonrho and Mechem of South  Africa, that won a 3.3 million pounds UN aid contract to clear  landmines from 1,200 miles of road in Mozambique.    Royal Ordnance now run privately by British Aerospace, has  not produced landmines for a decade, but was recently involved  in a Ministry of Defence programme to develop a new generation  of anti-tank mines which was cancelled due to defence cuts.    Mr Clarke said he had written to Mr Major demanding to know  whether the Royal Ordnance factory planned to manufacture  landmines.    He said: ""Parliament should take the issue of landmines more  seriously. They are a huge problem in the Third World.""    More than 100 million mines are estimated to be scattered  around 62 countries.    A Foreign Office spokesman said that while Britain supported  a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines which  endangered civilians, it did not approve a blanket ban on their  production.    Royal Ordnance was unavailable to comment on the contract  last night.     "

SHUIT, Times Staff Writer      SACRAMENTO      Ten months after passage of Proposition 99, the anti-smoking tobacco tax  initiative, the Senate and Assembly Thursday sent Gov. George Deukmejian a  $1.5-billion bill implementing the measure on back-to-back lopsided votes.    Lobbyists and officials from counties, medical organizations and other health  groups that backed Proposition 99 whooped and cheered in the hall outside the  Assembly chamber moments after the measure won final legislative approval on a  68-2 vote. Earlier, the Senate had approved the Proposition 99 implementation  bill by a 38-0 vote.    Deukmejian is expected to sign the bill.    The impromptu celebration by health advocates allowed a release of tension that  had built up during weeks of intense bargaining by lawmakers and a threat to  the bill posed by a last-minute lobbying effort by the tobacco industry. The  lobbying effort keyed on a provision of the bill that directs $28.6 million  over two years into an anti-smoking television and print advertising campaign  aimed at California's youth.    Tobacco companies, said to be fearful that a television ad campaign would  persuade more Californians to give up smoking, hoped to delete the provision  from the bill. They won some allies in the Legislature, including Senate  Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who said he opposed using any of the  advertising money for television ads because he did not think mass advertising  was the best way to reach smokers.    Maddy, who had dropped his objections Wednesday, carried the bill on the Senate  floor. He said numerous compromises were made by lawmakers. But he said the  overall benefits of the bill overrode objections to individual parts. ""When you  have $1.5 billion to give away you usually can find room for accommodations,""  he said.    The $1.5 billion contained in the bill represents 2 1/2 years worth of money  raised by the tobacco tax increases mandated by Proposition 99. The measure  caused cigarette taxes to go up 25 cents a pack and resulted in comparable  increases to other tobacco products, like cigars. The initiative directed that  most of the money be used to finance health programs for the poor.    County hospitals, emergency centers and health programs for the indigent will  get the lion's share of the money. Los Angeles County government's share of the  pie will amount to about $350 million over the 2 1/2-year life of the bill.

The collision left one person dead, 29 missing and a huge oil slick in one of the world's busiest shipping channels. An Indonesian team yesterday boarded the Nagasaki Spirit, a 96,000 tonne Liberian-registered tanker, and the Ocean Blessing, a Panamanian-registered container ship. Concern over the involvement of pirates followed the release by Orient Overseas Container Line, the Hong Kong operators of the container, of their captain's last radio message: 'We're being fired upon and have a fire on board in several of the tanks. We're abandoning ship. No more time for messages'. Rear Admiral Yusuf Effendi, the Indonesian naval commander co-ordinating rescue operations, has dismissed a link with piracy. He said the collision occurred at the widest point of the strait where ships cruise at normal speed, making it difficult for pirates to board. The channel, however, is notorious for piracy, with more than 100 incidents in the first half of the year. Indonesia will refuse passage to a proposed shipment of about a tonne of radioactive plutonium from France to Japan. Details of the shipment's timing and route on board a Japanese vessel have not been released. 'We have clarification from the Japanese government that security steps would be taken (to protect the shipment). . . but an accident may happen at any time,' a foreign ministry spokesman said. However, the quickest route for the shipment would be through the Strait of Malacca, to which Indonesia cannot legally deny access.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

C. Tsai]    [Text] Johannesburg, March 22 (CNA) -- South African  police on Tuesday [22 March] rapped Britain's Environmental  Investigation Agency (EIA) for falsely accusing a Taiwan  diplomat of involvement in rhino horn trade.    Pieter Lategan, chief of the Endangered Species Protection  Unit (ESPU) under the South African Police Administration, said  the Republic of China [ROC] Embassy and the Republic of China's  National Police Administration have worked closely with the ESPU  on wildlife protection.    None of the embassy officials or vehicles were ever involved  in rhino horn smuggling, Lategan said.    Moreover, he noted, no one from the ESPU has ever been  interviewed by the EIA.    The South African official said he has phoned the EIA to  express his strong dissatisfaction at the accusations. In  addition, he has sent a letter to the London-based conservation  group requesting a detailed explanation of the accusations.    During a meeting of nongovernment organizations (NGO)  following the Standing Committee meeting of the Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Geneva  Monday, the EIA aired a 20-minute videotape, in which a South  African policeman charged Taiwan envoys with smuggling rhino  horns.    A statement issued by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Tuesday said the man accused of rhino horn smuggling was not a  diplomat but an Overseas Chinese who once worked as a member of  the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest watchdog body.    The man, Yen Nuo, was [word indistinct] in South Africa in  February 1986 for illegally trading in rhino horns, but was  found not guilty as Yen had a license to sell rhino horns issued  by the South African Government.    Meanwhile, a report from Geneva said the CITES Standing  Committee has decided to ignore the EIA's accusations.     "

0,FT934-17043 ,"FT934-17043 _AN-DJCANAEWFT 931002   FT  02 OCT 93 / How to Spend It: Big spenders are hitting the factory floor  -Lucia van der Post reports on the latest shopping fad - one-stop retail 'happenings' that sell top brands at low prices      By LUCIA VAN DER POST   IT IS fashionable to think that most of the ills the Western world has been suffering in recent years are due to a familiar cyclical event known as a recession. Some of us - what you might call the deeper thinkers - have other views. We perceive more profound shifts in the psyche than are accounted for by mere economic downturns. Attitudes to life, to the things that really matter as well as to more mundane, considerations such as expenditure: all have changed so much that the entrepreneurs who make it successfully to the year 2000 will have to be a fleet-footed mix of economist, accountant, trader, sociologist and clairvoyant. Retailers, in particular, are going to have to be exceptionally nifty. Anybody who nurtures an old-fashioned nostalgia for the days when shopping meant a cosy chat at the corner shop and a dear little man in a striped overall trimming your Sunday joint had better fasten their seat-belts and prepare for a bumpy ride. In the pipeline is a whole range of different retailing experiments to cater for new-age shoppers. Yesterday, for instance, television shopping in the shape of QVC (Quality Value Convenience) Channel started on BSKyB and though nobody can be sure that we in the UK will embrace it as enthusiastically as our transatlantic cousins it clearly marks a new era. Factory outlets are another of the coming things. In America they are the fastest growing sector in the highly competitive retail world. They are what students of the genre call 'Destination Shopping Centres'. Chuck Bloom, perhaps the daddy of the whole outlet business and the man behind the hugely-successful Woodbury Common and Liberty Village in New York state, has defined the ideal of outlet shopping: 'It should never sell stuff that nobody wants. It is over-runs or samples of mostly current ranges that bring in the customers. There should be a good mix of designer labels as well as dresses and shoes and things for the kids. Then you need to be a 'happening' as well, somewhere worth visiting for a fun day out.' Outlets are not round the corner from anybody. Nobody goes there once a week. What Mr and Mrs Middle America (or a whole gaggle of Mrs and Miss Middle Americas) seem to do is to plan a visit as they might a jaunt. They make a day of it, buying junior's new trainers and anorak at the same time as they pick up a new designer frock, a few presents, Dad's socks, having a jolly good lunch and coming home all the cheerier for a good day out. 'The mall,' say some observers of the American scene, 'is the latterday village green,' and nowhere more so than the outlet mall. Whether the concept will work as well in Britain remains to be seen . . . In Hornsea, East Yorkshire, the Hornsea Freeport Shopping Village has been operating successfully for three years, selling a range of reduced price clothing and china from 17 different tenants. However, few in the more densely populated south east and Midlands seem to know about it. At Street in Somerset, Clarks Village, modelled carefully on the American genre, is up and running. A themed village with plenty of parking, nicely arranged shops, good restaurants and children's play areas, it sells a raft of merchandise from 22 well-known names (Laura Ashley, Benetton, Aquascutum, Dartington Crystal, Royal Worcester) all at prices discounted by up to 60 per cent. More factory outlet malls are in the pipeline. Gerald Ratner, the former jewellery shop magnate, is advising the consortium that bought Tobacco Dock in London from the receiver when it went bust. 'I first decided outlet shopping was the coming thing,' he says, 'when I found that the Calvin Klein boxer shorts I paid Dollars 8 for in New York and Pounds 8 in London's Harvey Nichols, were on sale at Dollars 1.75 at Bells in Orlando. 'What I want for Tobacco Dock is to get bargains in big designer names like that - that is what gives the mall its glamour in America.' Still angling for top-quality tenants, too, is Value Retail, a consortium which opens a 105,000 sq ft purpose-built outlet village outside Bicester, Oxfordshire, next autumn. Modelled on the Woodbury Common and Liberty Village outlet centres it plans to make sure that the mix of shops is right and that the merchandise is irresistible. For the consumer perhaps the biggest disappointment initially is the prices  -they are good but not as low as one expects. I arrived at Woodbury Common and Liberty Village expecting the kind of free-for-all and mouthwatering prices that I had found when bargain-hunting on the Lower East Side of New York. I found nothing of the sort. Here were smart shops, each clearly labelled - Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Cole-Haan, Stileman - selling current merchandise at prices that were reasonable, but far from dead cheap. On average prices seem to be 30 per cent lower than full retail on things such as china, glass, luggage and shoes and about 50 per cent on the highly fashionable items. But - acid test  -I (and my companions) all bought something. Chuck Bloom himself admits: 'They're not giving the merchandise away. Nobody is selling rubbish. The customer these days is sophisticated. He or she knows the labels so although Dollars 600 may still be a lot to pay, it is less than the Dollars 900 they know it will be selling for in Manhattan.' If Value Retail can get those sorts of names at those sorts of prices, the purveyors of the coach trips swanning through Oxford and Stratford-on-Avon may soon find another destination even more popular with their punters. We shall have to wait until next autumn to see but in the meantime watch this space - factory outlets are on their way.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The results of epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that exposure to ETS is causally associated with cancer of the lung in chronically-exposed nonsmokers. A discussion of this evidence follows.       (a) Evidence of Association._    The results of epidemiological studies taken in the aggregate suggest that nonsmoker exposure to ETS is causally-related to the development of lung cancer.   Evidence of specificity of effect is provided by active smoking studies that report a causal association with lung cancer [Ex. 4311]. It was therefore logical to examine nonsmokers with passive exposure to tobacco smoke, since the chemicals found in passive smoke are qualitatively similar to those in mainstream smoke. Active smoking induces all four major histological types of human lung cancer_squamous-cell carcinomas, small-cell carcinomas, large-cell carcinomas, and adenocarcinomas [Ex. 4311]. The results of lung cancer studies that examined the variation in tumor cell type induced by ETS exposure indicate that mostly adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are produced by ETS exposure. Some studies have reported an excess of adenocarcinomas, while others have reported excesses in squamous cell and small-cell carcinomas. From this information, it is apparent that similar tumor cell types are induced by ETS exposure as are induced by active smoking.   The unequivocal causal association between active tobacco smoking and lung cancer in humans, as well as the corroborative evidence of the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke provided by animal bioassays and     in vitro     studies and the chemical similarity between mainstream smoke and ETS, clearly establish the plausibility that ETS is also a human lung carcinogen (Table II2). In addition, biomarker studies verify that ETS exposure results in detectable uptake of tobacco constituents by nonsmokers [Exs. 450, 4311].

The Japanese Automobile Dealers Association said yesterday that 466,252 vehicles were registered in September. The only rise in sales recorded was for small trucks. A 11.2 per cent drop in sales of cars of more than 2 litres reflected the impact of the recession on spending on luxury items.

Excluding property, which had a bad year, the funds returned 18.8 per cent. All the other main categories of investments, UK equities, overseas equities, UK bonds and overseas bonds, returned between 18 per cent and 21 per cent. The average return achieved by fund managers in UK equities was 20.0 per cent, compared with the 20.7 per cent theoretically obtainable on the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index. Overseas equity portfolios returned 20.9 per cent compared with 23.7 per cent on the FT-Actuaries World ex UK Index. The figures reflect more than 2,000 funds worth Pounds 240bn in aggregate. WM reports that, as in 1990, companies last year took more out of their pension funds than was received through investment income and employees' contributions. This reflects the continued prevalence of fund surpluses and employers' contribution holidays. Total holdings of equities - UK and overseas - reached an all-time high of 77 per cent last year, and was even higher for smaller funds. Cash holdings fell sharply. Exposure to UK bonds and property also fell. In the past five years, in spite of the stock market crash of 1987 and a negative-return year in 1990, pension funds have returned 9.9 per cent a year on average, comfortably ahead of inflation of 6.4 per cent and slightly ahead of average earnings growth of 8.8 per cent.

According to the latest Ifo economic climate test, the prospects  for the next six months are better than they have been in a long  time. The situation in the east is different; industry there  considers the situation and prospects to be much worse.    The only point on which companies in both parts of Germany  agree is that they see increasing hopes of higher exports.    Industry in Western Germany    On the basis of the reports for its monthly test, the  Munich-based Ifo Economic Research Institute has concluded that  in the old laender, more orders were received than a month ago.  While output remained the same, it was possible to somewhat  reduce stocks. Hardly any companies are considering cutting back  on production. Prices remained stable.    The situation regarding producer goods worsened again, but  the outlook for the future of exports improved. In engineering  above all, production plans indicate that the recession is  subsiding. The signs are that there will also be an improvement  in the precision mechanics and optical instruments sectors.  Manufacturers of producer goods in the electrical engineering  sector remained skeptical, and manufacturers of delivery  vehicles and trucks complained about declining demand.    The situation is not quite as bad as it was for  manufacturers  of preproducts, and prospects were better for the chemical  industry above all. In the case of hard goods, business remains  bad, although there is more confidence about the future.  Manufacturers of hard goods state that the current trend is a  downward one.    Industry in Eastern Germany    Orders for manufacturing industry in the new laender just  reached last month's level and no more. Companies continue to  complain about poor sales, difficulties with finance, and poor  technical equipment.    In the case of producer goods, the situation has grown worse  and expectations are more pessimistic. Only the shipbuilding  industry is satisfied. The food, drinks, and tobacco industries  are still experiencing a recession, and for the first time since  1993, those who take a negative view are in the majority.    In the primary commodities and capital goods sectors, every  fifth plant reports good prospects, but states that the overall  situation is as bad as the end of the year. The consumer good  sector described the situation as ""almost satisfactory.""  Confidence regarding the future has somewhat declined.    The Construction Industry    There is confidence in the construction industry in both the  old and the new laender. In the west, orders have somewhat  increased compared to the previous year, from 2.9 months to 3.1  months. The upward trend primarily stems from surface  engineering, from housing construction to be more precise.  Nothing has changed in the construction of industrial  facilities, and the state is placing fewer orders.    In eastern Germany, the construction situation has worsened  because of seasonal factors. Nevertheless, almost two-thirds of  respondents were satisfied. The next six months appear to be  more positive, and 20 percent are counting on good business.  Capacity utilization stands at 67 percent, which is once again  above the previous year's level. Companies in the surface  construction field are pleased and optimism is spreading. In  the civil engineering sector, negative views prevailed once  again. In the prefabricated construction sector, the situation  has become much worse once again, although a much more positive  view is being taken of the future.    The Wholesale Trade    The situation is once again bad for wholesalers in the west,  in January, just as in December, they failed to obtain the same  level of sales as a year ago. The sector also expects demand to  decline over the next six months. Only sales of hard goods were  described as less disheartening, with only 20 percent of  companies registering fewer sales than a year ago, compared to  40 percent in December.    The business climate for the wholesale trade in the east  grew much worse. Almost one-fifth of companies still want to  reduce personnel over the next few months. However, there is a  noticeable increase in confidence regarding future expectations,  and the optimism is primarily based on the prospects for sales  of raw materials, semi, capital goods, and food, drink and  tobacco products. In the case of wholesalers of consumer goods,  those that have been the worst affected are in clothing and  footwear: 70 percent recorded lower sales than a year ago.    The Retail Trade    Consumer sales were bad throughout Germany in January. In  the west, they were still somewhat more negative than in  December and were ""poor once again"" in eastern Germany. Sales  were markedly below the previous year's levels. To keep the  decline in perspective, it should be borne in mind that this  year many end of season sales will not take place until February.    In the west, retail sales of consumer goods were somewhat  less worse than a month ago and sales were not quite so far  below the levels of a year ago. Sales were disappointing for  hardware, glass, porcelain, ceramics, lighting, electrical  goods, including audiovisual equipment. Sales were also  unsatisfactory for watches, jewelry, and office equipment,  although in the case of the latter, there are signs of an  improvement. In addition to the furniture trade, the automobile  sector also reported an improvement, although negative views  were still in the majority. Following a drop in demand in  January, retail traders in the food, drinks, and tobacco sectors  now expect demand to pick up.    In the east German retail trade sector, the situation for  employees will continue to worsen: As in the previous month,  one-third of companies want to reduce staffing levels.     "

Waxman and his allies maintained that limitations should be imposed on the  industry's $3-billion annual advertising effort, particularly ads that portray  smoking as sexy, sophisticated and linked to success.

The Ohio-based company had warned it would post a first-quarter loss, and shares in the company added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 21 3/8 by the close on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which has cut jobs, restructured and slashed its dividend in a bid to return to profitability, expects to be back in the black in the second quarter if the economy in North America improves. But Goodyear's problems run deeper than the recession and decline in vehicle production. The company is struggling under the burden of its disastrous Dollars 1.6bn investment in the All American Pipeline, an oil pipeline from California to Texas that is operating at only a fraction of capacity and has had to be written down. Goodyear expects these operations to eat into earnings for at least two years. Stripping out extraordinary items, Goodyear suffered a loss of Dollars 30.4, or 52 cents a share, in the first three months of 1991, against profits of Dollars 16.5m, or 29 cents, a year earlier. In the 1991 quarter, Goodyear took a one-off, after-tax charge of Dollars 59.7m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, related to job cuts and the discontinuation of its efforts to establish a tyre factory in South Korea. In the 1990 quarter, the company had extraordinary gains of Dollars 4.4m, or 7 cents a share. Including the one-time items, Goodyear's net loss for the 1991 quarter was Dollars 90.1m, or Dollars 1.54, against net income of Dollars 20.9m, or 36 cents a share. The company said the downturn in the tyre and rubber industry reduced first-quarter worldwide sales by 7.2 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn. In the US, operating income dropped to Dollars 30.1m from Dollars 82.8m a year ago, partly reflecting unusual charges of Dollars 34m in the 1991 quarter. Sales fell 9.5 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn. Weak demand reduced Goodyear's tyre sales by 7.5 per cent. Operating income fell to Dollars 62.8m, including one-time charges of Dollars 46.9m, from Dollars 129.9m. The company's oil transportation business extended its operating loss to Dollars 25.1m from Dollars 14.6m, reflecting losses on oil sales in spite of reduced operating expenses.

In the 1980's, prunes were not a popular fruit and most members of the public had little knowledge of their nutritional value, specifically, their high fiber content. In 1987, the prune Board began a campaign to highlight the link between consumption of high fiber foods (such as prunes, which were marketed as a good tasting, high fiber fruit) and cancer prevention. The program included direct mailings of product samples to physicians, publicity and media appearances by experts about the health benefits of prunes, and sampling programs in shopping malls and on domestic airline flights. Combined with generic advertising and promotion, the program resulted in a 12% increase in prune sales in 1987 alone. To date, the sales of California prunes continue to rise.     The success of certain commodity programs has also been measured through technical economic studies on the effects of generic advertising on industry sales. The results are impressive.     For instance, in a recent study of the Washington apple industry (Olan D. Forker and Ronald W. Ward, 1991) it was estimated that between 1988 and 1991, the industry received a rate of return of $6.63 for every dollar of assessments spent on the promotion of apples. In all, this represented a $133.76 million dollar return on a $17.5 million investment and the market price which Washington apple growers received for their apples between 1988 and 1991 was estimated to be 12.9% higher than it would have been without generic advertising.     Similarly, a recent study sponsored by the Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research Board (Ronald W. Ward, 1993) examined the effects of generic advertising on the beef industry. Based on extensive economic analysis, it was estimated that between 1987 and 1992, the beef industry realized an average return rate of $5.80 for every dollar spent on promotional activities. By February 1992, the total economic return to the industry was estimated at $2.99 billion.     A study by Ronald Ward and Bruce Dixon in 1989 provides an economic analysis of the effects of generic advertising on fluid milk consumption.

0,FT934-13923 ,"FT934-13923 _AN-DJSC5AG6FT 931019   FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (7): Business goes beyond mutual funds - Investment management      By PATRICK HARVERSON   ALTHOUGH more than 300 mutual funds are domiciled in Bermuda, there is more to the island's investment management business than just mutual funds. A small but growing number of specialised financial firms are running investment portfolios from Bermuda, not only for individual and institutional clients, but also for themselves. A wide range of firms on the island now offer investment management services to a wide range of clients. Prominent local companies such as Lines Overseas Management and PRP Performa Limited manage money for the island's insurance community and First Bermuda Securities, Bermuda Asset Management and Kast Investment Management, offer investment management services to local as well as international customers. Then there are the bigger names with operations in Bermuda. These include Fidelity, the US fund company, Kidder Peabody, the US securities firm, Monroe Trout, the Chicago-based commodities trading house and Schroders, the UK trust group. Finally, a host of individual investment specialists and one-man firms also manage portfolios from the island. Although no one has yet tried to calculate the size of this burgeoning industry, the evidence suggests that it is expanding fast. Investment managers are coming to Bermuda for several reasons, including the island's accommodating regulatory environment, its first class telecommunications links and its convenient geographical location. More important, they are taking advantage of a trend that is noticeable in other financial centres - the movement of investment management business and expertise away from the traditional locations, as computer and communications technology allows specialists actively to manage portfolios from almost anywhere in the world where there is an electric wall socket and a telephone plug. Although the focus of most investment management on Bermuda is directed overseas to the prosperous business of running offshore portfolios for international clients, some firms are aggressively pursuing business right on their own doorstep, namely the island's fast-expanding insurance industry, with its Dollars 52bn worth of assets. Until recently, Bermuda firms have not been seeking business from the insurers, primarily because they assumed that the big international insurance companies preferred to have their portfolios run from centres such as New York and London, either by their own managers or by huge securities firms. Although this assumption still holds in general, a few local firms are beginning to win business from the insurers. They include Lines Overseas Management (which hopes to have Dollars 120m under its control, some of it from small island-based insurers, by the end of the year), and PRP Performa, whose head, Hugh Barit, has been managing money for captive insurance companies for more than a decade. Another firm hoping to catch the insurers' attention is Orbis, a former Hong Kong money manager which now commands Dollars 490m in three Bermuda-based equity funds. Alan Gilbertson, a director of the firm, says: 'A lot of the insurance companies here are very young, and are building up to a point where they can become more adventurous with their investments. Some of them are beginning to dip their toes into the water of equity investment.' Orbis runs three of the many mutual funds registered in Bermuda. Growth in these funds - the bulk of them sold to international trusts, or high-net worth offshore investors in Europe and the East Asia - has been impressive. Two years ago there were 200 funds domiciled on the island. Today there are more than 300. The growth of Bermuda's mutual fund business, however, continues to be hampered by its virtual exclusion from the huge US market, because of regulatory restrictions. Ken Morgan of the Bank of Butterfield says the banks and other fund managers are unlikely to pursue opportunities in the United States until the authorities there loosen the regulations. 'At some point we might look at it, if we are able to find a way through the regulatory system up there. If there was a straightforward and simple way we'd do it,' Mr Morgan says. As for the UK market - a seemingly natural target for Bermuda fund managers  -only a few local firms have obtained the recognition from UK regulators as a special 'designated territory' that is required to market their funds in the UK. Malcolm Williams, general manager of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, says he is surprised that no more than a handful of Bermuda firms have sought UK-designated status. And he is not sure why so little interest has been shown so far. 'I suspect it's because most of our collective investment schemes are closed-ended, and in the UK they're open-ended and aimed at the UK public,' he says. The biggest presence in the island's mutual fund business remains Fidelity International, whose president (and Bermuda finance minister) David Saul describes as a 'cousin company' to the huge US fund group. Fidelity International now manages Dollars 10bn, but none of the management is done on Bermuda, where the 32 staff act purely as an administrative team for the company's many non-US operations.

Its results for the quarter to June 30, dropped 1 per cent from Pounds 294m to Pounds 291m. The fall was partly because last year's figures were helped by a Pounds 37m exceptional profit on the sale of the personal care business. Also responsible were increased expenses, up from Pounds 584m to Pounds 593m, as the company pushed new products to compensate for the US patent expiry on Tagamet, its former top-selling product. Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive, said: 'I think these are pretty good results given the difficult environment.' Earnings growth would remain in the high single digit area for the rest of the year. Operating profits from continuing operations were up 21 per cent at Pounds 296m on sales up 8 per cent to Pounds 1.57bn. The results benefited from currency movements. At comparable rates, sales rose 6 per cent and trading profits 8 per cent. Mr Leschly said the company had gained from hedging, but this would gradually unwind during the rest of the year. The pharmaceuticals division's trading profits increased 8 per cent to Pounds 219m at comparable exchange rates, while sales rose 9 per cent to Pounds 909m. Diversified, the newly acquired US pharmaceuticals benefit management group, accounted for 2 percentage points of growth. SB's two top drugs posted declines. Sales of Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug, fell 8 per cent to Pounds 165m, while Augmentin, the antibiotic, fell 1 per cent to Pounds 166m. Mr Leschly said: 'We are not depressed by Tagamet which has lost more than 50 per cent of the new prescriptions since the patent expiry. We've planned for this. Augmentin was hit by the chaos in Italy and a poor European 'flu season. It would be unfair to say Augmentin has peaked.' Growth had been driven by new products. Seroxat, an anti-depressant known as Paxil in the US, more than doubled its sales to Pounds 70m while Kytril, an anti-nausea drug, posted sales up 31 per cent at Pounds 24m. Relafen, an arthritis medicine, rose 52 per cent to Pounds 60m, and sales of Havrix, a hepatitis A vaccine, rose 84 per cent to Pounds 17m. Sales of these drugs would reach Pounds 700m during the full year. Consumer healthcare increased trading profits 6 per cent to Pounds 42m, while clinical laboratories fell 6 per cent to Pounds 23m and the animal sales side slipped to Pounds 12m. Earnings per share rose 7 per cent from 14.7p to 15.8p while earnings per equity unit increased 7 per cent from 73.5p to 79p. The company declared a second quarter dividend of 3p per share, 5.854 cents per equity unit and 29.27 cents per equity unit. Lex, Page 22   Companies:-  SmithKline Beecham.

However, the increase in earnings per share of 61 per cent was heavily affected by special factors. The adoption of the new FRS 3 accounting standard depressed the previous year's profits by Pounds 47.7m, made up of losses previously counted as extraordinary. In addition, the comparison was heavily affected by last year's devaluation of sterling. In underlying terms, Wellcome said, earnings per share were up only 9 per cent on sales up 7 per cent. Reported pre-tax profits for the year were Pounds 667m, up 46 per cent, on sales of Pounds 2.04bn. In real terms, the pre-tax increase was 9 per cent. The full year dividend was raised by 33 per cent, while Wellcome's cash mountain rose 38 per cent to Pounds 567m. Underlying growth in Wellcome's two most profitable drugs, the herpes treatment Zovirax and the controversial Aids drug Retrovir, slowed sharply. Sales of Zovirax, at Pounds 760m, were up 11 per cent in real terms compared to 24 per cent the year before. Sales of Retrovir, at Pounds 248m, were up only 3 per cent in underlying terms, compared to a rise of 22 per cent in the previous year. In several markets, sales were held back by government efforts to control healthcare costs. In the US, underlying sales growth was 4 per cent, while there was a real contraction of 4 per cent in Germany. However, real sales were up 16 per cent in both France and Italy, and by 11 per cent in Japan. Group investment in RD increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 326m. Some 41 per cent of the total RD spend was on research into antivirals and other anti-infectives. Clinical studies on two novel anti-herpes compounds, Valtrex and Zonavir, continued. Wellcome said the results to date continue to support its belief that both compounds may offer clinical advantages over Zovirax.

The profits figure, which was struck after a Dollars 101m pre-tax charge for the restructuring of its car rental operations, compared with a loss of Dollars 82m in the same period of last year. Sales and revenues were up 22 per cent at Dollars 9.2bn, and earnings per share worked through at 62 cents, compared with a loss of 36 cents a year ago. Chrysler has been benefiting from a Dollars 3bn programme imposed at the start of the US recession to slash its manufacturing costs and from good demand for its trucks and mini-vans. Mr Lee Iacocca, who is retiring at the end of this year as chairman, said other factors contributing to the results were lower discounts and a reduction in less profitable sales to fleet buyers The company is in the middle of launching a new range of medium-sized cars - the Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision and Chrysler Concorde - which are crucial to the revitalisation of its tired car range and have won enthusiastic reviews from the motoring press. Mr Iacocca said orders for these vehicles were very strong. Chrysler's combined US and Canadian car and truck market share for the quarter was 12.5 per cent, compared with 11.3 per cent in the same period of last year. For the nine months it totalled 13 per cent, up from 12.2 per cent. Earnings for the nine months totalled Dollars 367m, or Dollars 1.08 a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 892m, or Dollars 3.94 a share, in the same period of 1991. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 26.7bn, up from Dollars 21.2bn. Chrysler's financial services unit contributed third-quarter earnings of Dollars 45m, down from Dollars 81m in the same period of last year, due to lower levels of earning assets and the increased cost of a debt agreement the company recently struck with its bank lenders. Mr Iacocca, reporting his last quarterly earnings statement as chairman, said the July to September results, coming on top of a profitable second quarter, were particularly satisfying in the middle of the slowest US economic recovery in decades. He said it demonstrated the company's achievement in controlling costs, improving margins and lowering break-even points.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "

The announcement followed a dramatic recovery of popularity by the ruling Labor government, which leads the conservatives by about 12 points in the polls, compared to a deficit of 12 points in October. Mr John Hewson, the conservative leader, acknowledged that he had been unable to win widespread public support for the opposition's Fightback manifesto, launched in November last year. The revised version retains original proposals for a goods and services tax (GST), tariff cuts, labour market deregulation and cuts in public spending to balance the budget. However, the opposition has responded to criticism by church and social welfare groups by exempting basic foodstuffs and child-care from the GST, dropping plans to cut unemployment benefits, raising family allowances, and deferring cuts to job creation programmes. The revised package also includes cuts in personal income taxes, ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.3bn) for public spending on infrastructure projects, and a streamlined depreciation regime - swiftly welcomed by business organisations. The increased spending would be financed by bringing forward the proposed privatisation of Australia and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, the government-owned carrier, which analysts say could raise ADollars 20bn. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, dismissed the revisions as a desperate gamble. He said the spending and revenue estimates did not add up, and claimed the Australian capital markets would be unable to digest the proposed privatisation programme. Mr Keating is believed to be working on an economic statement to be delivered early next year, possibly as a curtain-raiser to an election in February or March. He said he would not try to match the tax cuts offered by the conservatives.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Rather, it appears to us that Lafarge could not sell the flux to the home market customers without incurring these special bagging costs. While we agree with petitioner that Pads from Italy is applicable here (in that difmer adjustments are based on the variable cost of manufacture only), petitioner's reliance on Phosphoric Acid from Israel is misplaced, because the bagging for flux is clearly distinguishable from the drums used for packing (and accounted for in packing costs) in Phosphoric Acid from Israel. Therefore, we do not consider bagging in this case to be a pre-shipment expense, but rather a condition of sale. For these reasons, we have treated these bagging costs as direct selling expenses, rather than as part of variable COM or packing for purposes of the final determination. (See March 9, 1994, Memorandum from V. Irene Darzenta to Richard W. Moreland Re. Treatment of Bagging Costs Associated with Home Market Sales of Flux.) Because the difmer that resulted from exclusion of these costs from variable COM was less than 20 percent, we used the reported, verified home market flux sales as the basis for FMV and deducted bagging costs as direct selling expenses from FMV accordingly.         Comment 12         Petitioner states that the difmer adjustment is also incorrect because respondent included fixed costs (i.e., GA) and profit in its calculation. Petitioner asserts that if the Department includes bagging in the difmer adjustment, it should recalculate the amount of the difmer to include only variable costs. Finally, petitioner maintains that the reported packing expenses, inclusive of bagging costs, should be adjusted to avoid double- counting GA expenses.         DOC Position         For the reasons stated in the DOC Position to Comment 11 above and in accordance with the Department's normal methodology, we have recalculated the difmer adjustment to exclude bagging costs and include only variable COM. However, upon further review of the documentation examined at verification, we note that the GA expenses included in the reported packing expenses were not double-counted. Notwithstanding this fact, we have also excluded from the packing adjustment the reported GA expenses.         Comment 13         Petitioner believes that the claimed adjustment for home market technical service expenses should be denied or reduced. Petitioner maintains that the Department should deny the claimed direct adjustment for home market technical service expenses, because these expenses cannot be directly tied to specific sales made during the POI. According to petitioner, services such as those provided by respondent for purposes of determining new uses for a product in future production aimed at increasing future sales levels constitute goodwill or sales promotion, and as such are not directly related to the sales under consideration. Petitioner also argues that technical service expenses attributable to test sales made during 1992 that are considered to be outside of the ordinary course of trade should be excluded from the adjustment; however, because the Department did not verify data that would permit their exclusion, the Department should deny the adjustment in toto. Nonetheless, if the Department determines that an adjustment is warranted, petitioner urges that it should only deduct the reported travel expenses and not the reported salary expenses comprising respondent's technical service expense calculation because salaries are considered fixed costs which are incurred whether or not the services are provided.     Respondent contends that technical service expenses should be treated as direct selling expenses in accordance with past Department and court decisions. Respondent notes that the technical services performed by LFI in France consist of visits to customers to review and help analyze the customers' test data and to work with the customer to make more efficient use of flux in its steel operations. Lafarge emphasizes that the customer needs to know from the time he makes his purchase that LFI's technical staff will be available to provide this analysis for him on an on-going basis. According to respondent, these types of services are not provided by LCA in the United States because LCA's U.S. flux customers perform this technical service using their own personnel. Respondent argues further that an adjustment for technical service salaries is appropriate where the technical service personnel provide functions that the customer would otherwise have to perform himself.         DOC Position         We agree with respondent in part. Lafarge provides the technical support to its home market customers because they have not yet developed the systems required to perform these services themselves. Without Lafarge's technical support, the customers cannot analyze and make appropriate adjustments in their steel production processes to optimize performance of CA flux in their operations. Given the nature of the steelmaking industry, it is reasonable to believe that, while these technical service expenses could not be directly tied to specific sales of flux, they would not otherwise have been incurred but for the sale of flux.     It is the Department's practice to allow, as a direct selling expense, claims for services rendered in assisting the customer in solving problems with products purchased during the POI to the extent that the variable costs can be segregated from the fixed costs. In general, variable technical service costs include travel expense, while fixed technical service costs include salaries. (See e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Brass Sheet and Strip from Italy, 52 FR 816, January 9, 1987; and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, 54 FR 18992, May 3, 1989.) Therefore, in accordance with our practice, we have treated travel expenses associated with technical services as direct selling expenses, and we have treated salary expenses as indirect selling expenses and deducted them from FMV accordingly. We made no adjustment to these amounts for expenses related to test sales that may have been made in 1992, because we did not have sufficient information on the record to allow us to do so accurately.

The resulting financial pressures which the continued fall in sales is exerting on Japanese car manufacturers will be reflected in their deteriorating financial results, which are due to be announced within the next three weeks. Nissan Motor announced yesterday that in the six months to September it had made its first pre-tax loss since the second world war. Large luxury cars were particularly hard hit, with a 21.9 per cent fall to 47,573 units compared with October 1991. Sales of smaller cars fell by 15.6 per cent to 233,292 units. The smallest decline was in sales of small trucks, which fell by 5 per cent to 128,960 units, while large truck sales fell by about 20 per cent to 10,618 vehicles. The growth of new car sales reached a peak of 30 per cent a year in October 1989. Over the next year the growth of new car sales fell to zero and since then have been contracting. However, the decline in sales has not affected car manufacturers equally. Honda, Toyota and Mitsubishi all managed to contain the damage, while Nissan and Mazda each suffered falls of more than 20 per cent. Toyota's sales fell to 183,296 in October, down 9.6 per cent from the year before. Honda sales fell by 9.8 per cent to 35,003, while Mitsubishi's sales were 3.3 per cent lower at 36,241. In contrast Nissan's sales fell by 23 per cent to 84,618 and Mazda's sales were 22 per cent down at 34,380. Sales of imported cars also declined 3.4 per cent to a total of 14,509 vehicles. Japan's small businesses are being badly hit by the economic downturn, with profitability at a 17-year low, according to a survey published yesterday by the Japan Finance Corporation, a government agency which provides small companies with low-interest loans, writes Charles Leadbeater. The survey suggests that small businesses, which are the bedrock of employment in Japan despite the power of its large manufacturing groups, may be suffering the first signs of the kind of squeeze which has hit small US businesses over the past few years. Japanese small companies, which are heavily dependent on bank lending for their finance, may be particularly hit by a more cautious approach to lending by the banks as they attempt to deal with their mounting bad loans.

Life expectancy for men jumped from 68.6 years in 1970 to 72.8 in 1990, and life expectancy for women from 74.9 to 78.2. In 1970 only 4.7 per cent of the population was aged over 75, but this had risen to 6.9 per cent 20 years later. Women still outnumbered men by 1.4m in 1990, although this was down from the 1.6m 20 years before. Average earnings rose more than tenfold, from Pounds 26 a week to Pounds 263  -but what a pound would have bought in 1970 would have cost Pounds 6.80 in 1990. The period also saw a growing taste for travel, both at home and abroad. Air travel showed the biggest increase - up from 2bn passenger kilometres in 1970 to 5.1bn in 1990. Overseas travel became more popular in spite of the fact that Britain showed signs of getting warmer. At home the average daytime temperature in England and Wales rose from 10.10C in 1970 to 11.10C in 1990. In Scotland temperatures rose from 8.30C to 9.30C. and in Ulster from 9.10C to 9.80C. Rainfall declined in England and Wales over the period, although the pattern was not consistent. There was 910mm of rainfall in 1970, rising to 979mm in 1980 before dropping to 814mm in 1989 and 838mm in 1990. Government Statistics 1992. United Kingdom in Figures.

In the Reality of Aid report earlier this year, NGOs working with the world's poorest communities noted the World Bank estimate that 40 per cent of world aid was diverted from poverty reduction to middle and high-income countries 'largely for political purposes'. The Overseas Development Administration has recently taken a number of important steps to increase its focus on poverty. The forthcoming European Community council of development ministers will consider a proposal to increase the poverty focus of EC aid, initiated during the British presidency. The record shows that, when the ODA is able to make poverty the priority, British aid can be very effective in areas such as humanitarian relief. The strong and consistent support of the public for UK aid targeted on poverty reduction was echoed in a June 1983 Actionaid/Gallup Survey, which found 87 per cent of MPs wanted more attention to be given in this category of spending to aid for basic needs. The National Audit Office report shows that the diversion of British aid for foreign policy purposes serves neither the interests of the poorest nor the taxpayer, nor indeed Britain's long-term commercial and political security. The government should end competition between the developmental, political and commercial interests in aid by stating explicitly (in line with the World Bank) that sustainable poverty reduction must be the primary determinant of British aid spending and the benchmark against which its success is evaluated.

0,FT944-13140 ,"FT944-13140 _AN-EJ1D8AFXFT 941028   FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Shares in Japan Tobacco slump on first day's trade      By EMIKO TERAZONO      TOKYO   Japan's ministry of finance, which has met strong criticism over the unpopular partial privatisation of Japan Tobacco, ran into further embarrassment yesterday as the stock fell sharply on its first day of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Shares in Japan Tobacco, the cigarette manufacturing monopoly, closed at Y1.1m, down 23.5 per cent from its publicly offered price of Y1.438m and wiping Y133bn (Dollars 1.4bn) off shareholders' investments. After failing to trade during the first few hours due to the lack of buyers, the stock finally changed hands at Y1.19m. Matsushita Electric Works, a subsidiary of the consumer electronics group, which bought 1,720 shares through the pre-offer auction at about Y1.35m per share, said it would maintain its holdings for now. Other corporate holders include Yasuda Fire  Marine Insurance, which bought 1,120 shares through the pre-offer auction. Brokers fear the sharp fall in the stock price will further hit sluggish retail investor confidence. Over 60 per cent of the small investors who were allotted the right to buy shares in the public offering forfeited their allocations due to concerns of the weak Tokyo stock market and the expensive offering price. The privatisation flop casts a shadow over future government flotations. 'People will not trust the government in future privatisations,' said one Japanese broker. However, amid the criticism the ministry of finance put on a brave face, and said it intended to go ahead with the sales of the partially privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shares during the current year to March, since it was included in this year's budget. The transport ministry has taken a more cautious approach, and this week said it would review plans to list in February West Japan Railway, one of the six rail companies created by the 1987 break-up of Japanese National Railways. Meanwhile, the finance ministry has started to review its pricing method of shares in companies to be privatised. Rather than choosing a mid-price achieved in a pre-offer auction, Japanese and foreign brokers are calling for the adoption of the book-building system used in the US and Europe, where an offering price is chosen after financial advisers sound out the leading potential investors. The Tokyo stock market shrugged off Japan Tobacco's woes, and the Nikkei 225 index closed marginally higher gaining 50.01 to 19,796.36. See World Stock Markets   Companies:-  Japan Tobacco.

Columbian is taking a 60 per cent stake in Columbian Tiszai Carbon, the new entity, in partnership with Tiszai Vegyi Kombinat (TVK), Hungary's largest chemicals company, which will hold the remaining 40 per cent. The Dollars 55m planned investment will be part-financed with a Dollars 33.5m loan package involving Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US government investment promotion corporation, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the London-based multilateral institution aiding eastern Europe. The joint venture partners said that the new carbon black factory on TVK's Tiszaujvaros site in eastern Hungary would use by-products from existing refining facilities at the same location and so enjoy substantial savings on transport costs. Excess gas from the plant would in turn generate steam for TVK's other operations. Columbian, the world's second-largest carbon black producer, said that half of the planned 50,000 tonne annual production would go for export to help meet west European demand. The company added that it expected to benefit in the longer-term from the influx of car companies into Hungary, which executives expected would be followed by an investment by a leading international tyre manufacturer. Columbian investigated existing carbon black plants in eastern Europe but decided to avoid involvement because of the cost of bringing the old facilities, which have a terrible reputation for pollution, up to acceptable environmental standards. Cabot of the US, the world's largest producer of carbon black, took a different route in forming a joint venture earlier this year with Deza, an established producer of the material in the Czech republic.

In a vigorous defence of a government decision to provide Pounds 234m in aid funding for a hydro-power project on the Pergau river in Malaysia, the foreign secretary admitted he had overridden advice from civil servants that the project would be 'a very bad buy' and a burden on Malaysian consumers. He said in an interview with the BBC World Service during the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Cyprus that he had disagreed with advice from the Overseas Development Administration, which manages Britain's aid budget. 'I had to take account of something they did not have to take account of,' he said. 'An undertaking had been given at the highest level that we would proceed with this project. The damage of backtracking on that understanding reached at the highest level would have been very great.' He was referring to a high-profile visit to Malaysia in 1988 by Lady Thatcher which brought to an end a decade-long 'Buy British Last' policy in Malaysia. A Pounds 1bn defence supply agreement was negotiated personally by Lady Thatcher with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. Malaysia's defence shopping list at the time amounted to Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn), an official involved in the negotiations said yesterday. Controversy over the contract erupted on Thursday when a National Audit Office report strongly criticised the government's support of the project, saying it 'would result in Malaysian consumers paying over Pounds 100m more for electricity over its 35-year life than if the money were invested in an alternative'.

0,FT944-9072 ,"FT944-9072 _AN-EKQEIACBFT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / Hurd to review overseas aid plans      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has ordered a review of Britain's overseas aid programme in the light of the High Court ruling that he acted unlawfully in earmarking Pounds 234m for Malaysia's Pergau Dam project. He has told officials at the Overseas Development Administration to check whether any of the dozens of projects in other countries financed by the Pounds 100m a year provided under the government's Aid and Trade Provision scheme might also be deemed illegal. Last week the High Court said that the aid grant to the Pergau dam was unlawful because it was 'economically unsound'. Mr Hurd has rejected the basis of that argument as illogical because projects requiring aid necessarily cannot be judged on the same basis as those for which market finance would be readily available. A final decision on whether to take the issue to the Court of Appeal will depend on the outcome of Mr Hurd's review of other aid projects which might be caught by the judgment. However the foreign secretary, who is still awaiting the detailed written judgment from the court, has told colleagues that his instincts are against appealing against the ruling. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has made clear that he will fight a separate court defeat for the government last week over compensation for victims of crime. But Mr Hurd believes that high-profile battles with the courts risk prolonging the political damage inflicted on the government. Mr Hurd, who will face Labour fire over the affair during today's Commons debate on foreign affairs, plans to assure MPs that during his five-year tenure at the Foreign Office, no aid decisions have been linked to sales of military equipment. He will reject charges that substantial aid projects in Indonesia have been linked to large exports of military equipment.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-1181 ,"FT942-1181 _AN-EFZARABVFT 940625   FT  25 JUN 94 / Hunt for a smoking gun: The political battle against US tobacco groups      By GEORGE GRAHAM   Mr Thomas Sandefur, chairman of cigarette manufacturer Brown and Williamson, was the very picture of the tobacco executive at bay this week. Several times his lawyer advised him not to answer as he defended his company before a hostile congressional committee against charges that it manipulated the levels of nicotine in its cigarettes to keep smokers addicted. Repeatedly in recent weeks the chairman and chief executives of leading US cigarette manufacturers have been hauled before a panel of disbelieving members of congress, chaired by Congressman Henry Waxman, to repeat that they do not believe nicotine to be addictive, and do not believe their cigarettes cause lung cancer. The congressional hounds drew closer to their quarry this week when Dr David Kessler, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, an agency of the health department, denounced Brown and Williamson for developing a strain of tobacco plant with twice the normal levels of nicotine. 'These findings lay to rest any notion that there is no manipulation and control of nicotine (in the manufacture of cigarettes)', Dr Kessler said. Mr Sandefur was the immediate target in a quest - he calls it a 'crusade' - by the FDA for evidence that might justify it defining nicotine as a drug, allowing it to assert its regulatory authority. Brown and Williamson, owned by the UK conglomerate BAT industries, has faced particularly close scrutiny because a cache of internal documents about its research and marketing operations, which the company alleges were stolen by a disgruntled employee, has made its way into the hands of Mr Waxman. But research papers and internal memoranda from other companies are also turning up which have added piece by piece to the picture of an industry that has not just ignored, but actually concealed, the evidence about the addictive and carcinogenic properties of its products. Amid all these disclosures, Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, this week announced that the justice department was examining an array of allegations against the tobacco industry that could lead to criminal, civil and antitrust investigations. Dr Kessler's strategy for taking on the tobacco industry is unclear. The bearded and bespectacled paediatrician came late to the anti-smoking crusade, which he declined to pursue during his first two years as commissioner. In the past, the FDA limited itself to regulating nicotine in chewing gum or patches to help people stop smoking, and to preventing cigarette makers advertising their products' benefits, such as weight loss. Dr Kessler now speaks with all the fervour of the convert. The logic of his quest, if he finds more compelling evidence than the FDA yet possesses that nicotine is addictive, would lead him to a complete ban on nicotine-bearing cigarettes, or at least to strict limits on nicotine content. But Dr Kessler has warned of the dangers of prohibition. 'One must consider the possible effects of the loss of this source of nicotine on the health of some people who are addicted. It is also important to consider the potential for a black market in nicotine-containing cigarettes,' he told Mr Waxman's committee. Congressional opponents of smoking also shy away from talk of prohibition. Legislation being considered in Congress to give the FDA explicit power to regulate tobacco (currently defined as neither a food or a drug), sponsored by Congressmen Richard Durbin of Illinois and Mike Synar of Oklahoma, would specifically bar the agency from banning cigarettes. Mr Synar acknowledges that his bill would not pass if it included the threat of prohibition. But the tactics he has adopted highlights how hard it will be to win approval for even the less draconian proposals he is making: he has tried to attach the measure to the agriculture spending bill, which many legislators from tobacco growing states will in the end feel compelled to vote for, rather than presenting it on its own. 'If the bill could stand on its own they wouldn't resort to this backdoor tactic,' said Mr Tom Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, the industry lobbying group. Mr Lauria's confidence reflects the realities of congressional politics: despite the bashing the tobacco industry has received over the past year, its political muscle is still considerable. Political action committees run by the Tobacco Institute and individual manufacturers gave more than Dollars 1m to federal candidates last year. In addition, the industry is developing a grassroots lobbying strength. The National Smokers Alliance, run by Burson Marsteller, a public relations firm with close ties to cigarette manufacturers, now boasts hundreds of thousands of members and was active, along with cigarette maker Philip Morris, in collecting signatures to place a pro-smoking measure on the November ballot in California. If approved, the measure would overturn hundreds of local anti-smoking ordinances and replace them with a less stringent state law. Congress, however, may turn out to be something of a sideshow in a much broader onslaught on the tobacco industry. Anti-smoking campaigners are pressing the attack with new vigour on two other fronts. First, they are calling for more companies and employers to ban smoking in public places. A 1993 study by the Environmental Protection Agency classifying secondhand smoke as carcinogenic has led to companies such as McDonalds and employers such as the Pentagon to ban smoking on their premises. Second, legal action is being taken to force the tobacco industry to pay for the health costs of its products. Instead of lawsuits brought by individual smokers or their bereaved relatives against the company to whose products they attribute their lung cancer - a type of case the cigarette makers have almost always won - a new wave of claims is being filed by state governments against the tobacco industry in general. For tobacco executives such as Mr Sandefur, however, the immediate problem is the prospect of FDA regulation of nicotine. Congressman Ron Wyden of Oregon, another foe of smokers, urged Mr Sandefur to work with Congress to develop regulations his industry could accept, or risk becoming an 'outcast' in the debate over smoking policy. 'Congressman, it's hard for me to envision becoming more of an outcast than I am,' Mr Sandefur replied.   Companies:-  Brown and Williamson Tobacco.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The half-life of cotinine in nonsmokers is of the order of a day, making it a good indicator of integrated ETS exposure over the previous day or two [Ex. 4311]. Although intersubject variability exists for both nicotine absorption and cotinine metabolism [Exs. 4156, 4162], cotinine is a good indicator that ETS exposure has taken place [Ex. 4311]. Further, studies show that cotinine levels correlate with levels of recent ETS exposure [Ex. 4311].   In summary, nonsmokers' exposure to ETS has been characterized by a database of widely used atmospheric and biological markers which have been measured in a number of workplaces, such as offices, restaurants, commercial buildings, and on trains and in planes. OSHA believes that this database is sufficient to support the risk assessment which follows. ETS-nicotine exposures of the average worker appear to be of the order of 5 to 10 micrograms per cubic meter (g/m3), and for the most-exposed workers, 50 to 100 g/m3). For ETS-RSP, exposures are about tenfold that of the nicotine levels. The concentrations of various ETS atmospheric markers to which nonsmokers are exposed in the workplace, such as nicotine, respirable suspended particulate matter (RSP) and carbon monoxide, are linearly correlated with the amount of tobacco burned. Studies of human activity patterns show that the workplace is the largest single contributor to ETS exposure. Air exchange rates in nonindustrial workplaces are not designed to control the risks of ETS exposure.       (f) Inadequacy of General Dilution Ventilation to Address Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure Control.     A primary function of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is to circulate air throughout a building to achieve thermal and sensory comfort for the building occupants. The general ventilation function of the HVAC system is to dilute and remove occupant generated bioeffluents and other contaminants from the space. However, from the industrial hygiene perspective, general ventilation as delivered by a HVAC system, is not an acceptable engineering control measure for controlling occupational exposures to ETS.

Officials admitted that reforms had been 'bogged down in detail', and restructuring would allow civil servants to discover more of what was happening 'at the ground level and in the regions'. The changes, which follow a review by the consultants Coopers  Lybrand, will be backed up by replacement of the department's two most senior personnel to allow more direct ministerial control. From the end of next month the department will have both a new permanent secretary - after the departure of Sir Geoffrey Holland to the University of Exeter - and a new deputy secretary in charge of the sensitive issues of the national curriculum, teacher-training, and teachers' pay. Both appointments will be filled from outside the department, with Mr Peter Owen moving from the Cabinet Office to take up the post as deputy secretary, and Mr Tim Lankester moving from the Overseas Development Administration to become permanent secretary. Task forces will be created to tackle key issues, while officials will have individual responsibilities for different regions. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said: 'The changes in the education world mean that the department itself needs to be even more flexible and responsive.' Quangos have been created to cover grant-maintained schools, the curriculum, further and higher education, student loans and teacher-training. The Department for Education is also for the first time creating an international relations branch. This will deal with the European Union, which has an increasingly important role in education, and promote educational exports on the international market. Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, said that the UK was attempting to boost exports by attracting foreign students and exporting educational materials such as books and software.

The Treasury select committee said imports of alcohol and tobacco were 'not seriously undermining receipts of excise duty'. But it cautioned Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, against widening the differential between UK and Continental duties. The MPs' report on cross-Channel shopping expressed doubt about the brewers' case. They had argued that the loss of UK beer sales was damaging pubs and off-licences. A cut in duty would revive sales, they argued. Cross-border shopping is 'clearly having a serious impact on the activities of legitimate traders,' the MPs said. But 'changing consumption patterns, however, make it exceedingly difficult to isolate the loss of sales directly attributable to cross-border shopping'. Claims that there is a link 'have to be treated with considerable caution'. Moreover, brewers' costs and margins have driven up the price of beer, the MPs said. 'Until it addresses these issues, the industry cannot expect the taxpayer to subsidise its operations by reducing excise duties.' On health grounds, a government could never consider a large cut in duties if they led to increased consumption of alcohol and tobacco, the MPs said. They recommended, instead, that the government seek to persuade Continental governments to raise their taxes to make cross-border shopping less attractive. The report drew an angry response from Whitbread, one of the brewers which has been leading the campaign. Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive, said: 'They're a set of wishy-washy recommendations from a rushed inquiry which failed to get the facts.' The government has already said it is unwilling to cut excise duties. The chancellor indicated in last year's Budgets that alcohol duties were unlikely to rise faster than inflation. The MPs found a closer link between tobacco imports and damage to the domestic industry, most particularly in tobacco for hand-rolled cigarettes. Tobacco accounted for the 'vast bulk of smuggled goods' and the high profits had attracted 'serious criminals'. The MPs recommended that the Customs service deploy 'substantially increased' staff to try to stem the illegal import of alcohol and tobacco. The National Union of Civil and Public Servants warned yesterday, however, that the Budget on Tuesday would include proposals to cut 4,000 jobs out of Customs service's 25,000.

It has completed a report on British aid policy following a critical review from Finnish and Belgium examiners appointed by its development assistance committee. A final report will be published next month after a draft copy of the review was circulated to members for comments. The OECD has been reluctant to fuel the trade row between the UK and Malaysia by being drawn publicly into the Pergau controversy but domestic criticism of British aid policy towards Malaysia in recent weeks has been sympathetically viewed by OECD aid specialists. The OECD examiners have identified Pergau as a project that does not readily meet essential criteria for the granting of aid. A committee meeting last month, called to consider the British aid programme, discussed the Pergau controversy and reaffirmed that aid should be subjected to the full standards of normal assessment and procedures, and that aid quality should predominate in government decisions. Considerable credence is given in the OECD to last October's critical report of the Pergau project by Britain's National Aid Office. OECD examiners have taken evidence from British officials at the Overseas Development Administration, which is supposed to manage the UK aid programme. ODA civil servants objected to the Pergau project but were overruled by ministers. The OECD is expected to welcome the government's decision last year to change its aid and trade rules, so that a country as prosperous as Malaysia could no longer qualify for assistance. A recent memorandum submitted to the OECD by UK officials defines the aim of UK aid policy as promotion of sustainable economic development in order to 'improve the quality of life and reduce poverty, suffering, and deprivation'. The Pergau project predates this decision.   Countries:-  QMZ  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

The stronger than forecast result pushed profits for the nine months ended September to Pounds 1.5bn, up 10 per cent from a year earlier. 'There should be a worthwhile increase in our pre-tax profits for the year, enabling us to maintain our progressive dividend policy,' Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said. BAT remained hopeful that a New York court would overturn attempts by the Federal Trade Commission to block its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover of American Tobacco. The FTC will argue in the case, beginning in New York on December 5, that the deal would reduce competition. Tobacco trading profits for the nine months rose 13 per cent to Pounds 920m, excluding a Pounds 135m extraordinary gain a year earlier. Cigarette volumes rose by 5 per cent. In the US, third-quarter profits at its Brown  Williamson subsidiary nearly trebled to Pounds 111m and doubled in the nine months to Pounds 328m. US profits were depressed last year by Philip Morris' savage price cutting on 'Marlboro Friday'. Since then the market has stabilised with Kool and GPC Approved, BAT's leading brands, improving their market shares. Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, said the jump in US profits reflected special factors but there was good underlying growth. Financial services contributed Pounds 674m to group trading profits, up 3 per cent from a year earlier. Eagle Star's profits fell Pounds 13m to Pounds 104m because of a sharp drop in investment returns to Pounds 99m. Its underwriting loss fell to Pounds 28m from Pounds 99m. Allied Dunbar, BAT's UK financial services business, raised its trading profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 124m on premium income up 10 per cent at Pounds 1.32bn. Farmers, BAT's US insurer, showed a marginal increase in profits to Pounds 391m with its life business improving in the quarter. BAT said Farmers' claims from last year's San Francisco earthquake were expected to exceed earlier estimates of Dollars 1.35bn. A 16 per cent increase in nine-months tax to Pounds 466m and an increase in minority interests to Pounds 83m from Pounds 71m left earnings per share ahead 6 per cent at 30.8p.

While he did not rule out an increase in tax from 24 cents a packet to 50 cents or even higher, Sir Patrick said he thought rumours of a levy of Dollars 2 per packet being spread by anti-smoking campaigners were 'totally unrealistic'. He said: 'People can just roll their own, and America is a tobacco-growing country. There is also a huge land border - Canada has seen a big increase in smuggling since prices were increased there.' Sir Patrick gave three reasons for confidence, even if US taxes were increased - BAT's high level of cigarette exports from the US, the continuing growth in world demand for tobacco, and the group's expectations that its financial services businesses would show further growth and recovery. BAT said that it was particularly encouraging that cigarette exports, especially from the UK, US, Germany and Brazil, had grown by a further 23 per cent. Exports now accounted for almost a quarter of group sales. Export volumes from the UK had increased substantially, mainly to the Far East. With export growth set to expand further, a Pounds 175m development programme was well under way at BAT's Southampton factory, which exports all its output. The group's annual production capacity in the UK will eventually rise to 55bn cigarettes. BAT has also authorised a large investment programme at its plant at Macon in the US, which will increase its annual capacity by 50 per cent, to 150bn cigarettes. Sir Patrick said: 'This export success is all the more important in the light of the extremely competitive pressures which were affecting margins in the US domestic market. However, we are improving market share there, particularly in the rapidly growing value-for-money segment.' Domestic market share also grew in Germany and Australia, where there had been a good recovery. The group's market share had remained stable in Brazil, at 83 per cent, even though the overall market volume increased in the face of difficult market conditions. However, it said that more realistic pricing had led to a notable increase in trading profit. In Asia, BAT Hong Kong's domestic volumes and market shares were down, while profits were lower due to excise increases and higher costs. Elsewhere, volumes and profits were higher overall.

The result was scored on a 4.7 per cent rise in operating revenues, at Dollars 59.1bn. In the fourth quarter alone, Philip Morris posted after-tax earnings of Dollars 1.2bn. This compared with Dollars 767m last time, but the previous year's figure was depressed by a Dollars 455m charge to cover restructuring in the food division. Operating revenue in the final quarter rose from Dollars 13.7bn in 1991 to Dollars 14.9bn last year - an 8.9 per cent improvement. Philip Morris's earnings per share last year stood at Dollars 5.45, up by 20 per cent over the 1991 (again, before accounting-related charges). The company had already signalled that it expected a rise of one-fifth in earnings per share, and the shares edged ahead only Dollars  1/8 on the news to Dollars 73 5/8 before the close. Mr Michael Miles, Philip Morris's chairman, said the group was 'optimistic' about prospects for 1993. He based this view on 'our growth and productivity initiatives, increasing volume momentum, and a narrowing of price gaps in a number of our key categories'. Philip Morris surprised the stock market at the time of its third-quarter results when it revealed that cigarette shipments, in volume terms, had fallen slightly, and were expected to dip further in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, it said that cigarette volume for the full-year was down by 0.5 per cent, mainly due the previously-announced stock adjustments in domestic shipments and lower level of Russian exports. Within this aggregate figure, domestic shipments fell 2.9 per cent, and Philip Morris's US market share declined by 1.1 percentage points, to 42.3 per cent. However, operating profit for the domestic tobacco business was up by 8.6 per cent at Dollars 5.2bn, on a 3.6 per cent increase in revenues, at Dollars 12bn. Operating profit from the international tobacco business also advanced strongly, by 19.1 per cent to Dollars 2bn, on revenues up by 11.6 per cent at Dollars 13.7bn. Operating profits from the food businesses overall showed a 10.6 per cent advance at Dollars 3.3bn, with sales improving by a more modest 3.1 per cent, at Dollars 29bn. The Miller Brewing Company, however, turned in a 13.6 per cent decline in operating profit, at Dollars 260m, on sales 2 per cent lower at Dollars 4bn.   Companies:-  Philip Morris.

0,FT922-882 ,"FT922-882 _AN-CFYA4AD7FT 920625   FT  25 JUN 92 / Tobacco ruling to allow some injury suits      By NIKKI TAIT and PHILIP RAWSTORNE      NEW YORK, LONDON   THE US Supreme Court yesterday ruled that suits can be brought against tobacco companies under individual states' product liability laws, giving the green light for some types of personal injury claim. Ambiguities in the judgment, however, allowed both the tobacco industry and the anti-smoking lobby to hail the court's 7-2 decision as a victory. The ruling overturns the industry's claim that such suits should be barred because federal law requires that cigarette packets carry health warnings on the risks of smoking. Congress passed cigarette labelling laws in 1965 and 1969. The decision comes in the context of a long-running case brought by Mrs Rose Cipollone against three tobacco companies, after she had a cancerous lung removed in 1983. The Supreme Court justices expressed a range of views over what type of claims could be brought under state liability laws. The majority concluded that some of the claims brought in the Cipollone case  -for example, that the defendants had failed to warn adequately about the health dangers of smoking and fraudulently misrepresented the risks - were precluded by the federal labelling law. However, they also said that claims brought on other grounds - such as intentional misrepresention by the tobacco companies - should be allowed to proceed. Standard  Poor's yesterday affirmed its debt ratings for US-based tobacco groups. 'Although the decision could result in a greater number of liability filings against cigarette manufacturers, and an increase in legal expenses, we believe it will take a considerable amount of time before the court decision would affect creditor protection, if at all,' said the large Wall Street rating agency. In London, shares in BAT Industries initially fell 38p, but rallied later to close 26p down on the day at 731p. Rothmans International was 19p lower at 1,091p. In New York, shares in RJR Nabisco fell to Dollars 8 3/8 at one stage, but recovered to close down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 9 3/8 . Philip Morris closed up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 73 3/4 . Philip Morris, whose brands include Marlboro, claimed that the decision was 'a significant victory'. It noted the court had held that smokers cannot sue on the grounds that they were not adequately warned of the risks of smoking once the 1969 legislation had been enacted.

0,FT933-12032 ,"FT933-12032 _AN-DG0CFABQFT 930727   FT  27 JUL 93 / Spy HQ's cost was hidden, say MPs      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   THE COMMONS foreign affairs committee yesterday rebuked the government for covering up the Pounds 86.7m cost of fitting out a new building for the Secret Intelligence Service. In a report on Foreign Office spending the all-party committee accused ministers of 'burying' the Pounds 45.5m being spent on the offices in the current financial year. It also notes that the total cost of internal equipment and furnishings for the office complex on the south bank of the Thames at Vauxhall Cross is expected to reach Pounds 86.7m. That compares with Pounds 66m spent by Mr Jacques Attali, the former head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Attali's expensive tastes proved his downfall and he resigned earlier this month. The overall cost, including the land, of the concrete and glass headquarters for Britain's spy service - more commonly referred to as MI6 - runs into several hundreds of millions pounds. Designed by Mr Terry Farrell, its construction - coinciding with the ending of the cold war - was vigorously opposed by the Treasury but was approved by Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister. The MPs do not disclose whether Britain's spy chiefs insisted, like Mr Attali, on importing the highest quality marble from Italy or the best interior designers from France. They concede that the government does have arrangements for such expenditure to be monitored by the National Audit Office. But they criticise the way that such substantial amounts of money - equal to the amount that the Overseas Development Agency spent in the same year on all its bilateral emergency and refugee aid - was buried in more general expenditure totals for the Foreign Office. More generally the committee suggests that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office should consider reducing the number of staff it has based in London in order to free additional personnel for overseas postings.

It expects initial sales to be small, but is anxious to establish a foothold in the region in the expectation of significant future growth. The company also indicated that it was wary of growing Japanese manufacturers' interest in the area. In twin moves announced yesterday, Jaguar has appointed a distributor in Poland and is setting up its first service dealership in east Germany. It is also assessing how best to establish a presence in two other key east European countries, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Jaguars are to be imported and sold in Poland by Jaguar Poland, a subsidiary set up by Overseas Marketing Corporation, a London-based independent Anglo-Polish trading company which already has extensive experience of automotive retailing in eastern Europe, including that of cars produced by Ford, Jaguar's parent. Initially, it is to have premises in Warsaw, which are expected to become operational within the next three months. First year sales are expected to be only 20 to 25 cars. However, 'it is important that we quickly establish a presence in these markets', Mr Roger Puttnam, sales and marketing director, said. 'They will undoubtedly grow in the future and as their economies expand so will the demand for luxury cars'. Jaguar's service dealership is located at Freital, near Dresden, and is the first of five sales and service outlets planned to be operational within the next 12 to 18 months. Unlike the Polish operation, they are to be set up and controlled by a wholly-owned Jaguar subsidiary, Jaguar Deutschland.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

0,FT924-2263 ,"FT924-2263 _AN-CLNB1ABSFT 921214   FT  14 DEC 92 / Anxiously awaiting a duty-free-for-all: Tobacco and alcohol retailers' fears about the single market      By PHILIP RAWSTORNE   BRITAIN's drink and tobacco retailers fear that the creation of the European single market next month will start a cross-Channel shopping boom that will wreak severe damage on their businesses. Although duty-free allowances will remain in force, limits on the amounts of beer, wine, spirits and cigarettes travellers can bring back from Continental hypermarkets for personal consumption will be abolished on January 1. Lower duties and taxes levied on the goods in France and other EC countries are expected to tempt growing numbers of UK shoppers across the Channel. Mr Peter Lewis, director of the Wines and Spirits Association, says: 'We are very apprehensive. Some small traders may be forced out of business before the government realises it is losing an unacceptable amount of revenue.' The threat of large-scale commercial smuggling as Customs formalities are withdrawn from Channel ports is particularly worrying to retailers in southern England. Even under the present restrictions on personal duty-paid imports - 1.5 litres of spirits, 50 litres of beer, and five litres of wine - it is estimated that liquor purchases abroad total Pounds 350m a year. That is equivalent to the annual drinks sales of Co-operative Retail Services. Beer brought into the country by returning holidaymakers already accounts for 5 per cent of the UK's take-home beer market. Next year, each adult will be allowed to bring in up to 10 litres of spirits, 90 litres of wine, 110 litres of beer, 200 cigars and 800 cigarettes for personal use. But these are merely 'indicative levels' to help Customs and Excise distinguish between genuinely private imports and commercial trade. The onus will be on anyone bringing above those amounts into the country to prove that they are for personal use - but a family wedding, say, would be an acceptable reason for exceeding the levels. The changes will offer cross-Channel shoppers some tempting bargains in spite of the recent sterling devaluation. A couple bringing back their full liquor allowance would save Pounds 350 in tax after paying for the ferry crossing and a good meal in Boulogne, according to the Brewers' Society. Some comparisons of retail prices suggest possibly much higher savings. A half litre of Stella Artois lager is 60p cheaper in France than in the UK and a bottle of Morgon Beaujolais is little more than half the UK price. A packet of 20 cigarettes costs Pounds 1 less. Nobody, of course, knows how British consumers will react to the opportunity. Customs officials, pointing out that a quarter of the 25m cross-Channel trippers a year return with less than their duty-free allowances, predict a brief initial rush of bargain hunters, then a return to more normal levels of traffic. Relatively few travellers, they believe, will have the money to buy in bulk or the space in their cars and caravans for more than a fraction of the allowance. PO Ferries, preoccupied with taking over Customs' task of policing duty-free purchases aboard its vessels next year, tends to agree. It does not expect its ferries to be swamped with shoppers. The Treasury, which last year collected more than Pounds 11bn in duty on liquor and tobacco, forecasts losses of about Pounds 250m in excise revenue from cross-Channel buying next year. The brewing and tobacco industries predict that the loss of revenue will be considerably higher. The Brewers' Society calculates that Pounds 100m will be lost on beer imports alone. The Tobacco Advisory Council says UK cigarette sales might fall by 6bn, resulting in a revenue loss of Pounds 400m. One Scottish bus company is said to be taking bookings for cross-Channel trips on which each coach will be accompanied by a lorry to carry the passengers' goods home. Nor do events on other borders between high-tax and low-tax countries lend support to a sanguine view of prospects. Denmark's consumers buy 13 per cent of their beer across the border in Germany. Canadian customers account for 25 per cent of the turnover of US drinks retailers along the border between those two countries. Mr Bill Simpson, of Whitbread's corporate planning staff, says: 'We are very concerned about the possible effect of extensive cross-Channel shopping. The beer allowance is roughly equal to the average annual consumption per head in the UK - and five times the average amount a consumer drinks at home.' Mr David Coxon, trading director of the retail chain Victoria Wine, says the increased allowances 'clearly represent another form of competition for beer, wine and spirits retailers'. Denmark had started to cut its taxes to narrow the differential with Germany, but the UK government had rejected calls to peg or cut duty.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

0,FT921-9736 ,"FT921-9736 _AN-CBKBQAACFT 920211   FT  11 FEB 92 / MEPs likely to back plan to ban tobacco advertising      By ANDREW HILL and PHILIP RAWSTORNE      BRUSSELS, LONDON   THE European Parliament is expected to back a European Commission plan to ban all tobacco advertising, except at the point of sale, when it votes on the draft directive in Strasbourg today. However, the measure is likely to encounter serious opposition at the next meeting of EC health ministers in May. Ministers from a blocking minority of member states, including the UK and Germany, have already voiced their objections to the directive. Parliament's vote on the issue was delayed for procedural reasons following a full debate in Strasbourg last month. Some MEPs argued successfully that the legal basis of the legislation should be re-examined. Parliament's legal affairs committee has since decided that Brussels was right to put forward the directive as a single market measure which only requires approval from a weighted majority of member states. Nearly 30 amendments have been tabled, including proposals to change the legal basis of the directive and to overturn the legislation altogether. There is still a possibility that that the directive might be talked off the parliamentary agenda. The Commission's plan seems sure of approval by MEPs in spite of heavy lobbying by tobacco companies. In the UK, the Tobacco Advisory Council at the weekend launched another national advertising campaign opposing the EC proposals. It said the campaign focuses on 'Brussels' intransigence' in pursuing the ban in spite of a lack of evidence to support claims that it would reduce smoking. Mr Christopher Bullock, the TAC's director of public affairs, said: Brussels has simply ignored the facts  .. preferring instead to listen to the special pleading of the anti-smoking lobby.' The European Commission is considering separate proposals for co-ordinating its legislation on advertising through a single department. Advertisers and agencies have objected that disparate measures - including those on tobacco and comparative advertising - have emerged recently from different parts of the Brussels bureaucracy, without consultation. Mr Martin Bangemann, internal market commissioner, said yesterday that he intended to produce a Commission paper on advertising and the single market which would try to resolve the problem. '(The current proposals on advertising) are too dotted about - they deal with single topics but aren't based on general considerations,' he said. 'That's why we must have real European legislation with a systematic structure.'  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "
0,FT933-3995 ,"FT933-3995 _AN-DIJB0AFLFT 930910   FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bird fight puts heat on Booker - Slight decrease to Pounds 30m and cautious note sounded on second half      By ANDREW BOLGER   BOOKER, the food distribution and agribusiness group, yesterday reported a slight decrease in interim profits and sounded a downbeat note about the outlook for the second half. Mr Jonathan Taylor, chairman, said: 'Overall, current trading is satisfactory but . . . we remain cautious for the year as a whole.' Mr Taylor said he was concerned about the group's Arbor Acres chickens farms in the US, which were facing increasing competition, and the possible adverse impact on consumer confidence in the UK of November's budget. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 36.8m to Pounds 29.9m in the six months to June 12, although the previous period was flattered by a Pounds 5.3m gain on disposals. Sales rose from Pounds 1.47bn to Pounds 1.5bn and operating profits from continuing operations rose from Pounds 37.4m to Pounds 38.9m. In spite of sluggish trading conditions, Booker said effective action had been taken to increase operating efficiencies and reduce costs, so margins had improved slightly. Food distribution profits recovered strongly from Pounds 16.2m to Pounds 19.2m. Sales in cash and carry started to improve during the second quarter and this trend was improving. More important were the cost savings resulting from the extension of information technology throughout the depot system. The total group workforce fell by 1,340 to 21,000, with most of the job losses occuring in cash and carry. Booker Fitch Food services improved profits as a result of tighter operation control. Its biggest fast-food contracts had been concentrated into two dedicated depots, reducing costs. However, the catering market remained dull. Within food distribution, current trading was improving, but the group said it was not possible to predict the impact of the next budget, which would come before the peak Christmas period. Profits from fish and prepared foods were static at Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 9.8m). The group said it was difficult to secure price increases from supermarkets to compensate for higher costs. Agribusiness profits fell to Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 10.1m). In the UK, McConnell Salmon had returned to profit and other businesses were benefiting from sterling's devaluation. Earnings fell to 10.5p (12.2p), although excluding exceptionals they rose from 10.42p to 10.51p. The interim dividend was held at 7.5p. COMMENT The preference of US consumers for chickens with lots of white meat is hurting Booker, which breeds birds with more dark meat than the competition. It will be 1995 before a suitable female bird is ready, so the pain could continue for some time. Meanwhile, the success of rationalising food distribution shows that Mr Charles Bowen, the recently appointed chief executive, has plenty of scope for improving controls further. The shares are on a prospective multiple of 13, a 15 per cent discount to the market and just below the food sector's rating. A maintained dividend looks assured. The shares, down 9p to 432p, are underpinned by a prospective premium yield of more than 6 per cent, but are unlikely to advance until the new man shows his hand.   Companies:-  Booker.

0,FT923-4471 ,"FT923-4471 _AN-CIGBWABEFT 920907   FT  07 SEP 92 / Move to boost women's pay urged      By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff   THE GAP between the earnings of men and women is set to increase unless the government forces employers to upgrade women's pay, according to an Equal Opportunities Commission report published today. The decline of centralised collective bargaining in many sectors, the casualisation of the labour market and the introduction of performance pay in recent years are all working against the closing of the pay gap, the organisation says. The absence of a statutory minimum wage also continues to disadvantage women, it adds. The commission wants to see the existing, highly complex equal-pay legislation replaced by more simple and more effective laws to require employers to demonstrate they are not discriminating against women. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, who also has cabinet responsibility for women's issues, is more sympathetic to the idea of legislative reform than her recent predecessors. Women in full-time work earn about 77 per cent of the full-time average hourly pay of men. The commission argues that an increase of 10 per cent in women's hourly earnings would result in an increase in the UK's total wage bill of only 3.1 per cent. This is because women work shorter hours and receive lower basic pay. Mrs June Bridgeman, deputy chair of the organisation, said the study showed it would be good value for money to correct the harmful bias in the way women's work is valued. The report concludes that progress in closing the pay gap is unlikely to come as a result of existing legislation on equal pay and the pursuit of individual equal-value cases.

I. Background       BPA is a self-financing power marketing agency with the United States Department of Energy. BPA was established by the Bonneville Project Act of 1937, 16 U.S.C. 832     et seq    ., to market wholesale power from Bonneville Dam and to construct power lines for the transmission of this power to load centers in the Northwest. BPA sells wholesale electric power and energy to 126 utilities, 13 direct service industrial customers and several government agencies.   The Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act) directs BPA to serve the net power requirements of any electric utility requesting service, and to serve existing DSIs in the Pacific Northwest. 16 U.S.C. 839c(b)(1) and (d). Although BPA cannot own or construct electric generating facilities, the Northwest Power Act directs BPA to acquire rights to the output or capability of electric power resources to serve increased customer requirements. See 16 U.S.C. 839d(h). Billing Credits may be adjustments to customers' power bills or equivalent cash payments. Resources eligible for Billing Credits include conservation and generation.   Specific requirements for resources and the amount BPA can pay for these resources are outlined in the Northwest Power Act and BPA's Billing Credits Policy.   BPA's Billing Credits Policy interprets the Billing Credits provisions in the Northwest Power Act, prescribes criteria for customer and resource eligibility, and establishes procedures for granting Billing Credits.       II. Description of the Generation Proposal       BPA proposes to issue the Billing Credits as a method to facilitate Project construction pending the issuance of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service under section 9(f) of the Northwest Power Act relating to the portion of the Project's output that will be furnished to nongovernmental persons and the extent to which the private business use test of section 141(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, will be met. Upon issuance of a ruling favorable to EWEB, the Billing Credits will terminate in favor of a negotiated Power Purchase Agreement with similar terms and conditions for all parties.   This project meets the qualifications for Billing Credits, and BPA has completed its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act. EWEB will comply with all applicable environmental requirements in the construction of the project and during the operation phase.       III. Methodology for Determining Generation Billing Credits       The payment for Billing Credits for EWEB will be calculated and paid monthly as follows:   EWEB is a Computed Requirements Customer under its Power Sales Contract with BPA, the monthly Billing Credits will be the lesser of the Adjusted Alternative Cost or Net Cost multiplied by the monthly amounts of Assured Energy Capability of the Billing Credits Resource, less the amount of Priority Firm Rate dollars EWEB avoids paying as a result of the Billing Credits Resource. There is no annual true-up because EWEB is required to maintain the Assured Energy Capability for the Billing Credits Resource, as it must do for all its firm resources under the Power Sales Contract.

Description of the Generation Proposal       BPA proposes to issue the Billing Credits as a method to facilitate Project construction pending the issuance of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service under section 9(f) of the Northwest Power Act relating to the portion of the Project's output that will be furnished to nongovernmental persons and the extent to which the private business use test of section 141(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, will be met. Upon issuance of a ruling favorable to EWEB, the Billing Credits will terminate in favor of a negotiated Power Purchase Agreement with similar terms and conditions for all parties.   This project meets the qualifications for Billing Credits, and BPA has completed its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act. EWEB will comply with all applicable environmental requirements in the construction of the project and during the operation phase.       III. Methodology for Determining Generation Billing Credits       The payment for Billing Credits for EWEB will be calculated and paid monthly as follows:   EWEB is a Computed Requirements Customer under its Power Sales Contract with BPA, the monthly Billing Credits will be the lesser of the Adjusted Alternative Cost or Net Cost multiplied by the monthly amounts of Assured Energy Capability of the Billing Credits Resource, less the amount of Priority Firm Rate dollars EWEB avoids paying as a result of the Billing Credits Resource. There is no annual true-up because EWEB is required to maintain the Assured Energy Capability for the Billing Credits Resource, as it must do for all its firm resources under the Power Sales Contract.       IV. Materials Available       Copies of the Billing Credits Policy and the Administrative Record are available from BPA's Public Involvement Office.

This is because  the MOF has judged that since it plans to abolish additional tax  on automobile acquisitions and to remove a special tax on  business corporations as part of the pump-priming measures, it  needs to cover the expected shortfall in tax revenue -- which is  expected to be nearly 400 billion yen -- that will occur  following implementation of the plan. A probable plan is to  raise cigarette taxes by 1 yen per cigarette. However, the  situation concerning economic pump-priming measures is a fluid  one due to the difficulties in coordination on the cost of the  income tax cuts. Moreover, industrial circles and consumers are  expected to oppose the MOF plan. For this reason, the MOF  intends to coordinate with the ruling coalition and other  parties while watching the situation concerning the shortfall in  estimated tax revenue.    At a request by the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry, the MOF intends to include the plan to lower the  consumption tax on motor vehicles from the current 4.5 percent  (which is the standard consumption tax of 3 percent plus an  additional tax of 1.5 percent) to 3 percent, and to remove the  (current 2.5 percent) special tax on business corporations in an  economic pump-priming package which it will compile within this  month. The MOF plans to raise the consumption tax to 7 percent  in April 1995. It hopes that demand for automobiles and other  products will increase in response to the proposed income tax  cuts and change in tax rates, and this will help the economy  escape from the current recession.    It is expected the drop in consumption tax on automobiles  will push down the overall tax revenue by approximately 80  billion yen and the abolition of the special tax on business  corporations by 315 billion yen. Because an expected drop in  tax revenue is serious in view of the economic recession, the  MOF intends to make up for the fall by raising taxes on liquor  and cigarettes, which are not daily commodities and will have  little impact on the economy.    Since Japan Tobacco Inc. gave up its plan to list shares on  the Tokyo Stock Exchange by the end of the fiscal 1993, the  proposed hike in cigarette tax is not expected to affect its  business profits as well as the listing issue. If the MOF's  plan is implemented, this will be the first increase in  cigarette tax since fiscal 1986 and the first increase in liquor  tax since fiscal 1984.     "

This compares with a previous forecast of Y1bn pre-tax profits and would mean the third consecutive year of losses for the company. Fuji Heavy said the main reasons for its revised forecast were the continuing weakness of demand for automobiles, the yen's appreciation and Y1bn of stock appraisal losses. Sales for the year are expected to be Y870bn, instead of Y900bn, and after-tax losses Y8.5bn instead of Y1bn.

0,FT921-2762 ,"FT921-2762 _AN-CCRBLAB1FT 920318   FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Decline in property markets behind losses at Wimpey      By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent   THE DEEP recessions in UK and US property markets were the main reason for Wimpey's decline into the red last year. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said trading conditions in both countries were the worst in 'living memory.' Group operating profit, before exceptional write-downs of Pounds 46.4m mainly on US and UK housing land, tumbled from Pounds 97.6m to Pounds 59.4m. Interest charges, however, fell from Pounds 41.5m to Pounds 29.1m reflecting the group's efforts to reduce borrowings through disposals. A divisional breakdown of Wimpey's performance in 1991 showed: Contracting: This was the only division to record an improvement, with profits rising from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 11.2m. This was after a Pounds 12m provision to cover its share of potential losses on the Channel tunnel construction contract. Mr Dwyer said that he still expected to make a profit on the contract which would enable the provision to be clawed back. Contracting profits last year were helped by a strong performance by the offshore oil and gas fabrication businesses before they were sold to a subsidiary of Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction, mining and engineering group. At the end of last year the construction order book stood at Pounds 700m compared with Pounds 1.15bn at the end of 1990. Homes: Housebuilding, mostly in the UK and US, saw profits almost halve from Pounds 51.7m in 1990 to Pounds 26.2m last year. House sales in the UK rose from 6,263 to 6,380. Averfrom Pounds 67,200 to Pounds 65,500 as margins continued to be squeezed. Sales of homes, worldwide, fell from 8,747 to 8,061. However, Mr Dwyer said that housing markets in the UK and in northern California and Florida had recently shown signs of improving. The group, following recent land purchases, owned 14,720 plots with planning permission in the UK, equivalent to about 2 1/2 years' supply at current rates of production Minerals: Profits from minerals fell from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 17.4m. Aggregate sales in the UK held up well, although prices and margins had come under pressure. US operations had suffered from the general recession in construction and also from moratoria which had been placed on infrastructure spending in a number of states. Property: Sales of properties helped to generate profits of Pounds 4.5m compared with Pounds 18m. More important was the impact of sales on cashflow, which was Pounds 107m to the positive last year after disposals. This enabled the company to reduce net debt by Pounds 99m to Pounds 206.4m. Still to come this year is the cash from the sale for Pounds 110m of the 50 per cent stake of the Little Britain office development in central London and from the Pounds 45m sale of St Alphage House, also in central London. The group has written down the value of its investment properties by Pounds 28m. This has been more than offset by a revaluation surplus of Pounds 45m on operational properties occupied by the group.  ------------------------------------------------------ WIMPEY DIVISIONAL SALES AND TRADING PROFIT (POUNDS M)  ------------------------------------------------------                      Turnover       Trading profit                    1991    1990   1991         1990  ------------------------------------------------------ Homes             585.4   658.0   26.2         51.7 Contracting       777.2   917.0   11.2          3.2 Minerals          290.6   297.9   17.4         26.3 Property           40.4    54.0    4.5         18.0 Technology/other   59.6    50.1    0.1         -1.6 Total           1,753.2 1,977.0   59.4         97.6  ------------------------------------------------------ Source:Wimpey  ------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

0,FT922-11763 ,"FT922-11763 _AN-CDWA1AFMFT 920423   FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Sharp decline at Dow Chemical      By KAREN ZAGOR   DOW CHEMICAL, the US chemicals group, yesterday turned in a 32 per cent decline in first-quarter operating income to Dollars 531m, reflecting sharply lower prices in 1992. Dow's net income for the first three months of this year fell to Dollars 171m or 62 cents a share, from Dollars 578m or Dollars 2.13 the previous year. Last year's results include the benefits of a one-time gain from an initial public offering of stock in Destec Energy, and higher prices linked to the Gulf war. Sales in the latest quarter slid 6 per cent to Dollars 4.64bn from Dollars 4.95bn. The results continue to reflect the weak state of the US chemicals industry. Dow's earnings have fallen steadily since 1989 when it turned in record profits of Dollars 2.49bn or Dollars 9.20 a share. Mr Frank Popoff, president and chief executive, said comparisons with last year were very difficult 'because of the rapid escalation of prices during the Gulf war. 'The good news is that pricing has become relatively stable over the past six months, feedstock costs have declined and we have probably reached the bottom of the economic cycle in the US.' Dow's chemical and performance products division saw a 56 per cent drop in first-quarter operating income to Dollars 95m, although product sales fell only 9 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn. Dow said that the decline was led by chlorinated solvents and softer demand for caustic soda, although vinyl chloride showed signs of volume recovery. The group's plastic products division also suffered a 56 per cent decline in operating income to Dollars 95m on a 10 per cent fall in sales to Dollars 1.6bn. Dow's hydrocarbons and energy business posted an operating loss of Dollars 30m, compared with operating income of Dollars 24m, while sales fell 30 per cent to Dollars 385m. The company's consumer specialties division - which brought in more than half of Dow's total operating income of Dollars 1.7bn in 1991 - had first-quarter operating income of Dollars 342m, up 17 per cent from the previous year. Sales rose 9 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn. Mr Popoff said that the company remained optimistic it would have 'positive earnings momentum during the second half of 1992', although the chemical industry tends to lag any upward economic movement by as much as six months.

In  the Japan-U.S. economic consultations that broke down recently,  the U.S. Government strongly demanded setting targets to expand  imports of finished automobiles. The U.S. auto industry has  called on Japan to expand its sale of U.S.-made automobiles to  100,000 units over the next three years (19,000 units sold last  year).    Certainly, it is difficult not only for foreign companies  but  also for domestic companies to break into the Japanese market.  Commercial practices of a closed nature as well as excessive  government controls must be remedied. Still, however hard other  companies may try to pry open the markets of Japan through  government-to-government treaties, unless they can interest the  dealers, who sell the automobiles, and the consumers, who buy  them, business can never materialize.    Japanese dealers may be called keiretsu dealers, but they  are  different from the past, and they are not bound by contracts  with manufacturers as to which manufacturers' vehicles to sell.  Besides, lately, the business of selling domestic automobiles  is not going well. If the dealers confined themselves as  keiretsu dealers, their business would only suffer more.  Individual dealers now need to establish independence for  themselves, and to get rid of the old way of thinking which took  controls by keiretsu-connected manufacturers for granted.    On the other hand, U.S. manufacturers need to get more  serious in the efforts to break into the markets. Specifically,  they should put more efforts into selling to dealers directly.  Some of the Big Three auto makers are selling their products  through the sales outlets of Japanese auto manufacturers. This  means they do not want to develop their own sales outlets and  instead want to let their competitors sell their products. That  attitude is too easy-going.    Secondly, what needs to be done to get the dealers  interested, naturally, is to offer commodities which are  appropriate for, and can be sold in, the Japanese market, and  also to present attractive business terms. The manufacturers  need to offer right-hand drive automobiles, ensure high  performance and good quality products, not overprice the  products, and be able to provide good after-sales service.    Americans consider cars as something like shoes, while  Japanese value them as if they were part of their own houses.  The U.S. manufacturers should recognize this different cultural  view, and pursue efforts to develop markets with the  business-version perception of ""In Rome, do as the Romans do.""  Japanese consumers are prone to buy foreign-made products. The  Japanese market is worth U.S. manufacturers going after  seriously.    Recently, the results of a joint survey by Japanese and U.S.  consulting companies at the request of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry and the U.S. Department of  Commerce were released. The survey analyzed the Japanese market  with respect to dealer networks, distribution costs, prices of  cars, purchasing practices, permits, and customer satisfaction.    The survey presented an estimate that the U.S. Big Three's  annual sales in Japan will grow to 57,000 units if all existing  problems in Japan -- like closed keiretsu relations between  manufacturers and dealers, and the U.S. manufacturers'  inadequate efforts -- are resolved. Some of the premises for  the estimate are questionable, but the survey does show there is  plenty of room for both Japan and the United States,  particularly in the private sectors, to make efforts for  improvement.

This year, the British Overseas Development Program will  help  Hainan draw up a plan to protect the environment in Haikou, the  island's capital. It will also train personnel and provide  equipment for environmental protection.    A German-aided sewage-treatment plant in Haikou is expected  to go into construction next year.    Located in a tropical region, Hainan has a land area of  34,000 sq km, with forest coverage of 40 percent. It also  boasts a coastline more than 1,500 km long. No other area in  China matches Hainan in terms of the abundance of animal, plant  and marine resources.    No large-scale development was launched until five years  ago,  when Hainan Province was founded.    Since then, the island has been faced with environmental  pollution, a drastic shrinkage of its forests and the  deterioration of the coastal marine ecological system.    Whether Hainan can avoid economic growth at the expense of  the environment, which most developed nations have experienced,  has become a focus of concern.    Martin Lees, former assistant secretary general of the  United  Nations, has cautioned the Chinese Government of the problem of  economic development and environmental protection. He said  Hainan should set an example for the world by combining economic  development with minimal damage to the environment.    With the help of UN organizations and other overseas  foundations, Hainan has hosted seminars on the environment  problem. In September of 1990, eight Chinese and eight  international experts formed an international advisory council  on the economic development of Hainan in harmony with the  environment.    The Asian development bank allocated 600,000 U.S. dollars to  work out a comprehensive plan for the administration of Hainan's  environment and natural resources early this year. According to  the plan, sewage-treatment plants will be built for a sugar  plant and a rubber plant, in addition to a garbage disposal  plant. A province-wide environmental monitoring network will  also be set up.     "

It says the reduction could be achieved by introducing a practice known as substitution. Overseas customers would be given the option of taking an additional quantity of high-level waste resulting from the reprocessing of fuel in place of bulkier intermediate and low-level waste. Countries with Thorp contracts signed since 1976 are required to take back waste which results from reprocessing. BNFL has made its evidence available to the public following the publication earlier this month of the committee's study on substitution, which was ordered by ministers to help its review of nuclear waste management. The report supports BNFL's claim that the radiological impact on the environment of substitution would be neutral. It says, however, that if BNFL is to be given the option of offering substitution there is a case for a 'small additional quantum of vitrified (glass) waste to be returned over and above that calculated on radiological grounds alone'. BNFL said yesterday that it welcomed the committee's advice to the government and said it should be possible to implement substitution in a way that accommodated the committee's suggestions on additional waste being returned abroad. The government is likely to decide in the next few months, as part of its review of the nuclear industry, whether to allow substitution. It will face strong representations from environmental groups such as Greenpeace which oppose Thorp's operation and the transportation of nuclear waste materials. They will be concerned about the increase in transportation of high-level waste if substitution is implemented and will dispute claims of a neutral effect on the environment. BNFL started commissioning Thorp this year after a long legal battle. It plans to start returning waste to overseas customers around 1998.

0,FT933-15195 ,"FT933-15195 _AN-DGICIAGLFT 930709   FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guatemalan tobacco growers fear US import curb      By EDWARD ORLEBAR      GUATEMALA CITY   A BILL in the US congress that would restrict domestic cigarette manufacturers to using a maximum of 25 per cent of imported tobacco, is threatening to cripple Guatemala's tobacco industry, according to producers here. The bill, which is still in committee stage, is part of President Bill Clinton's Dollars 500bn deficit reduction package, and is expected to be voted on in the next few weeks. Guatemala's influential private sector umbrella group, Cacif, has written to the US congress complaining that the proposal would violate the Generalised Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and goes against the spirit of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a unilateral trade benefit granted by the US. The Central American republic exports mainly Burley tobacco, 70 per cent of which goes to the US without trade restrictions. Tobacco exports are expected to reach 15,200 tonnes this year, worth about Dollars 70m. This follows a sharp increase in planting over 1992, when the Bank of Guatemala recorded exports of Dollars 28.8m. For blending purposes US manufacturers require a 15 per cent mix of Turkish tobacco, which means countries that only produce Burley and Virginia tobacco will be forced to compete for the remaining 10 per cent of US manufacturing needs, say exporters here. The US currently imports more than 40 per cent of its tobacco requirements. In Guatemala tobacco supports 140,000 people, mostly on the hot, flat lands along the southern Pacific Coast, according to an industry official. 'If the bill goes through, it will put us out of business,' warned Mr Francis Carlow, manager of Tabacalera Nacional, a subsidiary of British American Tobacco, which has been operating in Guatemala since 1928. BAT is the Central American republic's largest tobacco exporter, accounting for 40 per cent of shipments to the US. Mr Carlow says that US manufacturers will probably turn to larger, cheaper, lower quality suppliers to rationalise reduced import requirements. The Guatemalan government has yet to respond officially to the proposed measure. But Mrs Irma Luz Toledo Penate, the acting economy minister, said Guatemala was working on a response together with Honduras, another Central American producer. She said the Guatemalan government would consider adopting retaliatory measures if a negotiated compromise were not found. Apples, chicken, and textiles have been mooted as possible areas were restrictions might be imposed. But a US embassy official in Guatemala City played down the significance of the Bill. He said the local industry was exaggerating its production figures and claimed tobacco exporters had told him six weeks ago that they were expecting a 25 per cent drop in exports during 1993.

0,FT921-7397 ,"FT921-7397 _AN-CBVAEACJFT 920222   FT  22 FEB 92 / Property: It's been worth the wait in NW8 - John Brennan looks closely at one of London's best residential areas      By JOHN BRENNAN   THE residential arc across the north and north-west of central London - from Highgate to Hampstead and down to St John's Wood, at the top end of Regent's Park - includes some of the most frequently-traded houses in the capital. The locals cannot sit still - and the area attracts more than its share of short-term owners from abroad. In the mid-1980s St John's Wood, in particular, was made nearly impassable because of builders' skips parked outside houses and flat blocks, filling up with previous owners' interior decorations. The turnover record probably is held by a family house in Little Venice, by the Regent's Canal; it had three new kitchens, to match its changing owners, in just four years. But in the deal-crazed pace of that period, even the decorators lost track of who was having what done There has been constant sales movement in this northern arc ever since, even though sales agencies in west-central London have been struggling to find signs of life in their market. Why the difference? Divorce always helps to make available a steady supply of houses and flats. The area has its full share of repossessions and cash-strapped sales, too. The fact that more owners live there year-round than in, say, Mayfair, Knightsbridge or Belgravia also goes some way to explain this greater activity. British buyers within this northern arc tend to have clear ideas about where they want to live. As a generality, Hampstead Garden Suburbanites may seek to trade up within their area but rarely beyond. Hampstead home-seekers often turn to the similar-sized and less expensive family homes on the Highgate side of the heath, while those who prefer St John's Wood are willing to set the probability of having to buy a leasehold against time-savings on travel into work. Overseas buyers, as Noel De Keyzer of Savills confirms, have a less-localised view of these markets. Often, they will start their search on the northern border of Regent's Park and end up two miles north in Hampstead or Highgate because they do not want to spend money on a leasehold. This applies particularly to Americans, who commonly start their search at the park's north-west corner because their ambassador's residence and the American school are there. But many end up buying freeholds to the north. The same thinking applied when the Sultan of Brunei's home-buyers were active in London a few years ago. They looked at the leaseholds, but then followed elements of the Saudi royal family north, buying several houses in Highgate. His last big purchase was a Pounds 5.6m mansion in The Bishop's Avenue, Highgate's 'millionaires' row.' But that was then. Sales agents now are attuned more acutely to the calls of Far Eastern cash. Their patience is beginning to be rewarded. 'Hong Kong buyers are active in the area now,' says De Keyzer. 'They are looking for properties that they can buy and rent out for three to four years. A lot of them are medical people who can practice over here after the hand-over to China in 1997 and, yes, they do have plenty of cash.' These buyers have been on the sidelines for the past few months, some viewing and others taking a long view on areas such as Docklands and acquiring bargain flats. But most have been dissuaded from action by the argument that London prices have further to fall. In London's northern housing arc, price cuts have been sharp enough to persuade even sceptical Hong Kong investors that they are seeing good value. These buyers are expecting, and getting, minimum returns on their investments of eight to 10 per cent from open market rents on the modern, two-bedroom flats or modernised freehold family houses that head most property shoppers' lists. They can achieve these returns (occasionally, substantially higher) at a time of stable rather than rising rents, and because of property price cuts of between a quarter to a third since 1988. The odd cautionary tale of a price collapse helps realism among vendors, and most sales agents' conversations are full of such disasters. Savills' records include one property on the Mortgage Corporation's books which sold in 1987-88 for Pounds 3.5m, and re-sold recently for Pounds 1.25m after repossession. At much the same time, Middleheath, one of the largest of the red-brick Victorian mansions built along West Heath Road to face Hampstead Heath, was on the market because of the BCCI bank crash. Promoted initially at an asking price of Pounds 3.5m, it has now been sold to Far Eastern buyers for nearer Pounds 2m. Andrew Wadsworth's is asking prices on some of his Dockland developments by Tower Bridge once overshadowed all comparable ones. Subsequent price-cutting on those schemes recognises the changed market  - as does the 'just under Pounds 2m' asking figure (actually Pounds 1.975m, via Savills in Hampstead.

This is a classic 1840s Italianate villa in an area that can claim to be London's first estate development with semi-detached and detached, rather than terraced, housing. Wadsworth has done an enormous amount of renovation tothis nine-bedroom property. The Grove and The Towers are at the geographical top and bottom of the northern arc - and the two most expensive homes on sale in London. The newly-built Towers in Highgate, with 31,000 square feet of residential space, has a Pounds 25m price tag that leans heavily on the hope that someone will wish to buy, and have finished to taste, one of the biggest houses in town. The Grove is on the extreme southern edge of the arc,on the bank of the Regent's Canal. Although Pounds 17.5m for a 96-year Crown lease does put it in the same super-cost range as the Dallas-style Towers, there the similarities end.

The report, published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, was based on 30 industrial sectors. It found that 'at the level of individual manufacturing industries, Germany does not so clearly dominate Britain, except in the period from 1973 to 1979. 'Almost half the industries showed a superior British productivity growth performance over the entire three decades to 1989,' it added. The report said that in 1989, 23 industries had higher productivity levels in Germany than in Britain, whereas in 1960 Germany had an advantage in only 17 industries. German manufacturing productivity peaked in superiority in 1979, when only three industries performed better in Britain - leather and footwear; drink and tobacco production. In 1960 labour productivity was only 4 percentage points higher in Germany than in Britain; by 1973 the gap had widened to 19.4 and six years later to 40 per cent. But by 1989 the difference had narrowed to 16.5 percentage points. The study calculates that aggregate labour productivity growth in Germany from 1960 to 1989 was 'a little less than half a percentage point higher per year than in Britain'. However, only six out of the 30 industries covered had a lower productivity performance in Germany than in Britain in 1989. These were mineral products; iron and steel; office machinery; electrical engineering; drink and tobacco production. In 1960, 13 out of the 30 industries had a better level of labour productivity in Britain. The largest productivity gap in 1989 was in the printing, publishing and paper industries where Germany was more than 50 per cent more productive. German dominance was also clear in ceramic goods manufacture; mechanical engineering; vehicle production and instrument engineering. The report attributes the better UK performance in the 1980s to the labour market freeing itself 'from the worst forms of restrictive practices'. The report adds that Britain still lags in the number of manufacturing workers with skills; in the volume of resources devoted to research and development; and in investment in new plant and machinery. The study found that in 1989 Germany had 30 per cent more physical capital per worker-hour in manufacturing than Britain. Changing Fortunes. NIESR No7. Pounds 11.50.

The commission reported that while 6 per cent of white women were unemployed, as many as 16 per cent of ethnic-minority women were unemployed and one-in-three Bangladeshi women was registered as jobless. Ms Francis, an associate director of a London public relations company and a member of several public bodies, including the Radio Authority, said: 'The report mirrors the working experience both of us and our mothers since their emigration to the UK.' Ms Francis, who founded a successful PR company in the 1980s, said: 'Part of my motivation in working for myself has been the desire for independence - and that includes not being vulnerable to problems (that) women, and particularly black women, face in the workplace.' She said that discriminatory attitudes were open, visible and deep-seated. 'For example, when I attend professional conferences the typical attitude of a white male is that I am a secretary or a tea lady.' The report, which drew on the last census, said that women from ethnic minorities faced discrimination because of their sex and their race. Consequently, ethnic minority women were more likely to work longer hours than white women and to work in lower-paid and lower-status jobs. The commission expressed concern about deteriorating job prospects in many occupations. One of the most startling findings was that this higher rate of unemployment existed in spite of the fact that ethnic-minority women were more likely to continue in higher education than their white counterparts. Highly qualified women from ethnic minorities were twice as likely to be unemployed as white women with equivalent qualifications. Black Women in the Labour Market.

0,FT943-14955 ,"FT943-14955 _AN-EGLEZAELFT 940712   FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: An efficacious formula - Daniel Green on Smith  Nephew's new found prominence      By DANIEL GREEN   There are few happy investors in the healthcare industries these days, but shareholders in Smith  Nephew might at least have a half-smile on their faces. SN's shares have outperformed the falling FT-SE 100 index and the pharmaceuticals sector by more than 10 per cent this year. The unhappy pharmaceuticals sector has been hurt by falling margins because those who pay for drugs - insurance companies in the US and governments elsewhere - are bearing down on healthcare costs. The profitability of the drugs industry, where operating margins of more than 30 per cent are typical, makes it an obvious target for efforts to cut prices. But SN seems to have been relatively unaffected. Annual sales in 1993 were Pounds 949m, up 11 per cent on 1992. Pre-tax profits before exceptional items were Pounds 163m, up 16 per cent. Perhaps most important, trading profit margins have risen from 16.5 per cent in 1992 to 17.1 per cent last year and 'are trending up again this year', says Mr John Robinson, chief executive. He says that they are likely to stay in the 17 to 18 per cent range. SN is happy with its new-found prominence. It has struggled for years to shrug off its image of a slow-moving pedlar of bandages and creams. Without medical magic bullets and blockbuster drug sales, the company's shares have been outpaced by the likes of Glaxo and Wellcome. The turnround this year is the result of the very dullness of SN's product range. Drug companies rely on a handful of big sellers for their success. Trouble with one can mean trouble for the whole company. SN has 2,000 brands and none is vital to the future of the company. In a time of declining growth in healthcare, that gives SN a rare defensive appeal. Almost two thirds of sales are in four sectors: Casting and support. These include joint bracing devices and modern versions of the plaster cast. SN says it is the world's biggest supplier, ahead of 3M and Johnson  Johnson of the US. Sales in 1993 were Pounds 162m, up from Pounds 121m a year earlier; Trauma and arthroscopy. These are fracture repair devices and keyhole surgery equipment. SN says it is second and first respectively in world sales competing against the likes of Stryker of the US and Zimmer, part of Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US drug company. Sales last year were Pounds 199m (Pounds 155m); Orthopaedic implants, mostly artificial knees and hips. This is a fragmented business led by Zimmer and Howmedica, part of Pfizer, the US drugs company. SN sales last year were Pounds 118m (Pounds 95m) and Mr Robinson acknowledges that the company is too weak, especially in hip implants. 'We are vulnerable there,' he says; Wound management, mostly specialist dressings for skin ulcers and pressure sores which often afflict the bedridden. Sales last year were Pounds 136m (Pounds 127m) and SN says it is in fifth place in world sales behind the likes of 3M and Johnson  Johnson. Other products include consumer goods such as Lil-lets tampons and Elastoplast plasters, eye and ear implants and surgical gloves. Some of these products have defensive characteristics in themselves. Nurses must be trained to use specialist dressings, so a hospital manager offered cheaper dressings would have to bear in mind the costs of retraining. Nevertheless, Mr Robinson concedes that there is price competition in some areas, especially in the US. He has tried to minimise the effect in three ways: by concentrating on high-margin, high-technology products in which SN is a world leader; by broadening the group's geographical base; and by increasing research and development efforts. So in 1992 SN sold the Nivea cosmetics brand to Beiersdorf of Germany. It is no longer in simple bandage cloths and gauze, which are produced in developing countries at low prices. It is trying to expand in Europe, especially Germany. Its European market share is low - almost half SN's sales are in North America and only one fifth in continental Europe. The region is also promising because cost controls have tended to focus on cutting drug bills rather than total hospital costs as in the US. And in May it set up a joint venture with Advanced Tissue Sciences, a Californian biotechnology company, to develop a means of growing living cartilage in the laboratory. A product, which would be surgically inserted into a patient's knee, is scheduled to be launched by the end of the decade and sales could reach Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year. Mr Robinson is convinced that this strategy will maintain the company's outperformance, but some analysts are not convinced. Mr Stuart Adkins at Lehman Brothers, the stockbroker, argues that the whole of the healthcare business is a buyers' market. 'There is price pressure yet to come for Smith  Nephew,' he says. Even relatively high-technology medical goods such as hip implants are subject to heavy competition and 'near commodity status'. Investing in biotechnology companies is necessary but not sufficient for success, he says. Mr James Culverwell at Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, is more optimistic, arguing that SN is more accustomed than drug companies to the tendering process increasingly used by cost-conscious healthcare buyers. Lower margins make it less of a target for bargain-hunting clients, and in any case the SN sales effort already includes cost benefit analyses, an area still new to most healthcare suppliers. Either way, it is clear that SN is in a race against time. It must sell more in Europe and harvest the fruits of new research before price pressures begin in earnest and spill out from the US into Europe.   Companies:-  Smith and Nephew.

The companies were aided by a very large contract in Singapore. Construction investment is rising sharply throughout Asia as countries take advantage of their growing economic strength to improve infrastructure particularly in transport and water. As a result the region is one of the fastest growing construction markets in the world. South Korean construction companies along with the Japanese provide some of the largest construction companies in Asia. Figures published yesterday by the Overseas Construction Association of Korea revealed that South Korean contractors won 16 major international contracts worth more than Dollars 870m (Pounds 500m) during the first three months of this year. The value of the work was more than double that won during the corresponding period last year. Almost 90 per cent of the work by value was won in Asia. The largest single contract worth Dollars 622m was for an urban development project in Singapore won by Hyundai and Ssangyong construction companies, said the association. Daelim Engineering also won a hydro electric project in Pakistan worth Dollars 98m. The association said that South Korean companies expected shortly to win other large overseas contracts in Asia. South Korean construction companies which have been strong international competitors, notably in the Middle East, have traditionally earned much of their sales overseas. More recently companies have been concentrating efforts on the domestic market where construction output, as in other Asian countries, has risen sharply in recent years. Cement sales, a good indicator of construction activity, rose by 20 per cent in South Korea last year to 44m tonnes, equivalent to 1.02m tonnes for each of the country's 43m population - the highest cement sales per capita in the world, according to the Korea Cement Industrial Association.

A report from the free-market Adam Smith Institute said present 'excessive' rates of taxation are costing the economy Pounds 20bn a year. 'If the chancellor wants to close his budget deficit he should be reducing taxes on alcohol and tobacco, not putting them up,' it said. At Westminster an all party group of MPs protested against 'unfair taxation' of Scotch whisky and other spirits, while the Brewers Society said beer sales fell last year to their lowest level since 1970. It called for a staged reduction in 'the unacceptable tax burden on the British beer drinker'. High taxes combined with the recession depressed beer production to 32.25m barrels, a decline of 3 per cent or 800,000 pints a day, the society said. 'The prospects for 1993 are far from good as the flood of duty-paid imports from France continues to undermine British pubs, off-licences and jobs,' the society added. Within two months of the start of the single market duty-paid imports were already equivalent to almost 10 per cent of beer drunk at home, the society said. The Adam Smith Institute report, by Mr Barry Bracewell-Milnes, a tax economist, suggested that the economic loss from alcohol taxation because of the distortion of competition amounted to Pounds 7.57bn a year. That was equivalent to a quarter of the gains expected from membership of the European single market. Because UK duties were so high - 13 times the amount of VAT on a bottle of spirits - consumers sought to avoid them by shopping abroad, Mr Bracewell-Milnes said. Retailers in south-east England were facing ruin and the chancellor's tax-base was shrinking as a result. He said that while the chancellor might still be better off by putting 1p on a pint of beer, he could raise an extra Pounds 1.22bn by slashing the tax on spirits by 60 per cent. He could also gain a little extra by reducing tax on wine. He added that the government should welcome any opportunity to move to a lower-duty regime. Alcohol and tobacco taxes hit poorer families harder than the well-off and were inefficient tools for attempting to improve public health - 'like trying to reduce road accidents by doubling the price of petrol'.

Some 27 diplomatic centres - including embassies, consulates-general and consulates, many of them in Africa and Latin America - may close as a result of the cuts. Between Pounds 13m and Pounds 14m could be saved in this way. The precise budget to be allocated to the diplomatic service and other Foreign Office departments and services, such as the British Council and the BBC's external broadcasting services, is still the subject of negotiations. However, according to some informed estimates, the cuts to be made in spending on the Foreign Office's services, except for the Overseas Development Administration, over the next three financial years could amount to nearly Pounds 100m. The bulk of the savings - an estimated Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m - would be achieved during the last year of the period, 1994-95. Among the services likely to be hit are embassies in the smaller countries of the Third World, consulates in western Europe and commercial services in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Foreign Office's budget amounts to only 0.5 per cent of total government expenditure, but officials argue that the UK's overseas representation has a symbolic value far outweighing the money spent on the diplomatic service. With German and French governments each deciding recently on an increase of 6 per cent in their spending on the diplomatic service, the Foreign Office is particularly worried about its capacity to promote UK interests abroad.

The rise was mostly due to improved turnover in New South Wales and Queensland.

Brazil and Malaysia began  to import Russian arms. Russia signed agreements with them in  early June. The Russian military-industrial complex is able to  restore its prestige of a reliable exporter of arms and military  equipment, ITAR-TASS was told in the main agency for  international cooperation of the Russian Defence Ministry.    In the 70's-80's, the USSR ranked first in the world for the  sale of conventional armaments. The peak of the Soviet export  of arms was reached in 1987 when armaments worth 22.6 billion  dollars were sold by the USSR. The USSR then accounted for 38  percent of world trade in arms.    According to foreign sources, Russia's share now amounts to  17 percent. From 1990 Russia reduced arms export to almost  one-fifth of the volume, yielding the lead to the United States  which now controls almost 60 percent of the world export of arms.    Russia's positions weakened in markets of Eastern Europe it  once dominated. East European countries now consider purchasing  NATO armaments. Russia's arms export to Nicaragua, Cuba, Laos  and Vietnam petered out. Joining United Nations sanction  banning arms sales to troubled areas, Russia discontinued the  export of arms to a dozen countries.    Russia now sells arms to some 50 countries. According to  military experts, the Russian military-industrial complex can  sell up to 30 billion dollars worth of arms a year, earning  10-12 billion dollars on new armaments.    Russia began to sell arms to Brazil from June 3. Under the  contract, Russia is to deliver to Brazil before the end of the  year a consignment of antiaircraft missile complexes ""Igla"" with  110 ground-to-air missiles. These missiles are regarded in  Brazil to be the cheapest missiles in the world market of arms.  They have proved their effectiveness.    The possibility of buying other military equipment from  Russia, including armoured carriers, is considered in Brazil.  The contract for Brazil's purchases of ""Igla"" complexes was  signed in the framework of the trade agreement between Russia  and Brazil concluded last year. The agreement will be effective  for four years. The total volume of deals for this period is  envisaged at two billion dollars. Under the agreement, Brazil  supplies to Russia coffee, sugar, soybeans in return for Russian  goods, including arms.    With the conclusion on June 7 of a contract to deliver 18  MiG-29 fighter planes Russia entered armaments market in  South-East Asia. MiG planes, for which there was a demand abroad  and Kalashnikov submachine guns accounted for 20 percent of the  Soviet export of arms. The deal with Malaysia is valued at  550.5 million dollars. The first plane of the batch will be  delivered next April. The other planes will be supplied within  eleven months. There are plans to perfect the plane.  Refuelling in mid-air will be made possible. The planes will be  armed with ""air-to-air"" missiles. The bombing load will be  increased from two to three tonnes. Russia will help Malaysia  train pilots. A centre for maintenance of MiG planes will be  set up. Russia will also help Malaysia develop the airospace,  defence and other industries. Under the contract, 25 percent of  the planes' cost will be repaid wilh palm oil products.    The Middle East market of arms remains the biggest market  for  Russian armaments. Saudi Arabia and the Arab Emirates are  interested in purchasing new kinds of arms from Russia. Russian  aircraft, tanks, antiaircraft and antitank complexes, personnel  carriers and naval ships sell well abroad.     "
0,FT923-12269 ,"FT923-12269 _AN-CGTAYACJFT 920720   FT  20 JUL 92 / New car sales in west Europe fall by 5.3%      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   NEW car sales in west Europe fell by 5.3 per cent in June to 1.13m from 1.19m a year ago, according to industry estimates. Demand weakened in Germany and in many of the small and medium-sized European markets. New car sales in June were lower than a year ago in 11 of 17 markets across west Europe. The decline in June accelerated the downward trend that began in March. Sales have been lower than a year ago in three of the last four months. New car sales in the first six months of the year fell by 1 per cent to 7.34m from 7.42m in the same period a year ago, according to industry estimates. Sales were lower than a year ago in 8 of 17 west European markets including Germany and the UK. The significant fall in sales in June was caused most importantly by an estimated 17.4 per cent drop in demand in Germany to 356,000. New car sales in Germany are retreating from the record levels achieved a year ago in the wake of unification. The sharp fall in sales in Germany, the biggest single European new car market, was exacerbated by the declining demand in most small and medium-sized European markets in June, led by a sharp 22.5 per cent drop in sales in Finland. These declines could not be compensated by the continuing strength of demand last month in Italy and Spain, where new car sales were 9.6 and 13.4 per cent higher respectively than a year ago, nor by a rebound in sales in France where new car registrations rose by 7.7 per cent year-on-year. The fragile recovery in new car demand in the UK continued last month with a rise of 4.4 per cent, but in the first six months sales were still 4.1 per cent lower than the very depressed level of a year ago. Japanese car sales in west Europe fell by 5.7 per cent in the first half of the year. Japanese car makers have been hit by the changing pattern of new car sales across Europe and the relatively higher decline in demand in the unprotected European markets where they have their main strength, most importantly in Germany. Demand has grown most strongly this year in the protected markets of Italy and Spain, where Japanese car makers have only a small share. The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, has established a record lead in the first six months. It boosted its share of west European new car sales to 17.7 per cent from 16.8 per cent a year ago, thanks most importantly to the success of its Audi and SEAT marques. Sales of its up-market Audi brand rose by an estimated 12.7 per cent in the first six months narrowly outselling both BMW and Mercedes-Benz, while sales by SEAT, the VW group's Spanish subsidiary, were 14.6 per cent higher than a year ago. Skoda, the Czechoslovak car maker where VW has management control, fared less favourably with sales in west Europe falling by 6.3 per cent. Sales of the VW brand rose by an estimated 1.9 per cent helped by growing output of the new generation VW Golf, Europe's best selling car. Among the big six volume car makers in Europe Fiat of Italy and Ford of the US have lost most ground with declines of 6.2 and 6.1 per cent respectively. BMW, the German executive and luxury car maker, has made some of the biggest gains. The company increased its sales by 13.3 per cent in the first six months and for the first time in its history has outsold Mercedes-Benz in west Europe in the first six months. The main loser among European car makers is Rover, the subsidiary of British Aerospace, whose sales in west Europe plunged by 16.4 per cent in the first half of the year to 156,000, depressing its market share to only 2.1 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                         January-June 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Volume   Volume    Share (%)   Share (%)                              (Units)  Change(%) Jan-Jun 92  Jan-Jun 91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET               7,345,000    -1.0       100.0      100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen* (incl.         1,301,000    +4.6        17.7       16.8 Audi, SEAT  Skoda) Fiat (incl.

0,FT933-642 ,"FT933-642 _AN-DI1CRAEIFT 930928   FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Strong business at convenience stores helps lift TS to Pounds 6.8m      By CATHERINE MILTON   TS STORES lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.54m to Pounds 6.79m in the six months to July 3, helped by the strength of its convenience stores business which offset falling margins at its core Supercigs discount newsagents. The shares fell from 166p to 160p as the company moved up to the standard rate of tax which reduced earnings to 7.06p (7.69p). The interim dividend goes up to 2.5p (2.4p). Total sales rose to Pounds 171.2m (Pounds 166.1m). TS said full year results depend on its Supercigs initiatives launched at the end of April. The company had cut the cover prices of 150 magazines by between 5p and 20p in 80 of its 210 (212) Supercigs stores and would extend the discounts to 100. This, and a flexible multi-purchase confectionery promotion had lifted transactions since the half year end. 'The number of transactions in Supercigs at the end of June was down 5 per cent compared with this time last year but has since climbed back up by 7.5 per cent,' said Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman. Operating profits at Supercigs fell to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 2.04m) as operating margins declined 10 per cent. Cigarettes, some 75 per cent of Supercigs' sales, felt manufacturers price increases and increased tax which pushed the price through the 'Pounds 2 barrier' in a market which shrank by 5 per cent over the period. The Dillons convenience stores, now 102 (87) outlets, contributed operating profits of Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 1.99m). The Dillons confectionery, tobacco and newsagents business contributed a static Pounds 2.55m. The pre-tax figure reflected interest charges of Pounds 259,000 (Pounds 288,000) on short-term borrowings. Profits on disposal dropped to Pounds 88,000 (Pounds 222,000). Mr Stephen Boddice and Mr James McCarthy have been appointed joint managing directors. COMMENT TS shares are held back by the group's dependence on the difficult UK tobacco market and fears of a rights issue for acquisitions. It has virtually ruled out the latter, and plans to reduce the proportion of cigarette sales from 59 per cent to 50 per cent through internally funded expansion of its convenience stores over the next four years. November's budget presents the threat of another tax-led squeeze on tobacco margins which would hold back Supercigs second half, notwithstanding its attempt to extend discounts to all its non-cigarette goods. Stripping disposal gains, pre-tax profits are forecast for Pounds 13.5m giving a multiple of 11 which looks somewhat undervalued given the good performance of convenience stores and management's ability to stimulate non-tobacco purchases in Supercigs.

It is the first time the government-funded authority, which opposes all tobacco promotion, has attacked the advertising of one brand. The move came as the government's chief medical officer, Dr Kenneth Calman, disclosed in his annual report yesterday that the number of teenage smokers has not fallen significantly in recent years. The HEA has written to the Advertising Standards Authority calling for the withdrawal of posters which feature a middle-aged, irreverent character called Reg and his views on life. The posters - which appear mainly in Scotland, Wales and northern England - have the ASA approval required by all cigarette advertisements under a voluntary industry agreement. The posters have also won two top advertising industry awards. The HEA said its research showed that 91 per cent of teenagers in northern England had seen the 'Reg' advertisements compared with 49 per cent of adults. More boys aged nine and 10 than adults liked the campaign, it said. According to the HEA's findings: 'Reg's irreverent view of authority appears to be just what children want to hear. His flippant attitude to life is extended to smoking, and it has become clear that children felt that Reg is giving them permission to smoke.' The HEA says the research demonstrates that the campaign contravenes ASA rules. Those state that cigarette advertisements 'should not be designed, written or published in such a way as to make it likely that they will appeal more to those under 18 than to the public at large'. Examples of the slogans are: Reg on party politics - 'If you drop ash on the carpet you won't get invited again'; Reg on the Exchange Rate Mechanism - 'Erm'. The HEA says Reg has become an 'icon' among children who see him on the way to school every day. Surveys showed that 'children in Manchester no longer called each other a Wally to denote stupidity, they called each other a Reg,' said the authority. The ASA said yesterday that it would study the findings. The advertising agency responsible for the campaign, Lowe Howard-Spink, denied that it had targeted children for the campaign. Imperial Tobacco, the Hanson subsidiary which owns the brand, said the intention had been to 'persuade smokers of other manufacturers' brands to switch to our own, not to persuade anyone to start smoking or to smoke more'. The advertising agency and Imperial Tobacco both said they had not yet examined the HEA's methodology.   Companies:-  Lowe Howard-Spink.     Imperial Tobacco.

0,FT941-9159 ,"FT941-9159 _AN-EBPC3ADQFT 940216   FT  16 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Doubtful benefits from tying UK overseas aid to exports      From MR MARTIN GRIFFITHS.   Sir, A K Goldsmith (Letters, February 14) defends the use of overseas aid to promote British exports. Three points needs to be made in the light of his assertions. First, the Overseas Development Administration stated in its 1993 review of British aid that 'the aid programme's greatest priority is reducing poverty'. When ODA minister Baroness Chalker outlined the seven goals of the aid programme last year, promoting exports was not one of them. Furthermore, only 10 per cent of MPs believe that promoting trade should be a main aim of overseas aid, an Actionaid/Gallup opinion poll showed last July. It is true that other governments tie their aid to the exports of their own goods. Yet Britain ties 70 per cent of its bilateral aid, a higher proportion than most donors. Second, recent research contradicts Mr Goldsmith's claim that the aid and trade provision (ATP) benefits the British economy. A 1992 study by experts at the University of Bath noted that, while the ATP has created some commercial benefits, 'this does not, however, imply that there has been a net economic gain to the UK'. Regarding tied aid generally, the study concluded that 'it is quite possible that the net economic effect on the UK has been negative, or at least quite negligible'. A 1991 OECD study concurred, noting that 'it is improbable that aid tying provides significant macro-economic benefits to any donor's domestic employment or balance of payments aggregates'. Third, what taxpayers want from overseas aid is that it helps to reduce poverty. An Actionaid/BMRB survey last July found that 73 per cent of the public believe the government should increase aid to tackle global environmental and development problems. We share Mr Goldsmith's willingness to participate in a public debate on these issues. But this should take account of the needs of the world's poor rather than those of big business.

The text of the new government regulation was promulgated on  February 1.    The new regulation is expected to curb ""early marriages and  births,"" and is conducive to the nation's goal of controlling  its already large population, said Yang Jianchang, spokesman for  the Ministry of Civil Affairs, at a press conference here today.    China's marriage law stipulates that men are not allowed to  marry until 22, and women until 20.    Every year there are two million illegal marriages out of a  total ten million marriages, the spokesman said. The illegal  ones include 1.6 million so-called ""early marriages.""    According to the new regulation, China is continuing to  combat arranged and mercenary marriages, marriages between close  relatives and bigamous marriages. All these are still  widespread in some parts of China.    The spokesman said that the new regulation will be ""a  forceful legal means"" for the civil affairs bodies to administer  the marriage registration process.    The new rules stated that legally marriageable couples who  simply do not go to the government marriage registration agency  will be criticised and have to register within a certain period  of time.    Marriages based on certificates obtained through fraud and  deception will be declared null and void, the certificates will  be withdrawn and the couples fined up to 200 yuan (about 23 U.S.  dollars), according to the text.    The regulation gives couples getting married the right to  bring charges against any officials or organisations trying to  impose illegal fees or engaged in other corruptive practices in  marriage registration.    The regulation also specifies the rights and duties of  people  wanting to divorce. The spokesman said that divorces have been  increasing annually. The latest statistics show that 310,000  couples divorced in 1992, compare with 190,000 couples in 1979.    Existing regulations for marriages of Chinese people to  foreigners, or to Overseas Chinese people, or to residents of  Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan, are not replaced by the new decree.     "

The company, which has lost more than FFr15bn over the past three years, said the improvement in results demonstrated strong progress in its recovery strategy. That strategy is based on three priorities; an increase in revenues, a drastic reduction in non-salary costs, and improved productivity. It has been put into effect by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman, who came to the group in October. Turnover grew by 20 per cent in the first three months, to FFr6.15bn. The improvement partly reflected a strong sales performance at Zenith Data Systems, the microcomputer division, which increased turnover by more than 70 per cent. Most of Bull's other operating divisions also saw sales increases. However, the principal reason for the decline in losses was the reduction in non-salary costs. Bull said these costs, which include buildings, supplies and financial charges, were reduced by FFr453m and represented 58 per cent of the fall in net losses. The group said cost-cutting measures were continuing. In April, many corporate activities were transferred from Tour Bull in the Defense business district of Paris to a cheaper site in the suburbs. The management teams of the Bull Europe and the Bull Overseas divisions will shortly be transferred to the cheaper site. Bull said orders rose sharply in the first three months. Hardware and software commissions grew by 27 per cent, while orders for systems integration contracts increased by 33 per cent. The company said the improved demand partly reflected the introduction of new products, such as the DPS 9000/800 business computer developed in co-operation with NEC of Japan. NEC, which holds a 4.43 per cent stake in Bull, may increase its investment as part of the French group's privatisation. Bull is holding negotiations with industry partners with the aim of reducing the government's holding to a minority by the end of the year.   Companies:-  Groupe Bull.

The company, the third largest tobacco company in the world, controls 83 per cent of Japan's Y3,000bn (Dollars 28.4bn) domestic tobacco market. JT been restructuring its business since 1985 - when the market was opened to foreign competition - reducing the number of distribution outlets by 36 per cent to 174 and the number of staff by 20 per cent to 24,000. Due partly to this rationalisation, its bank borrowings are low relative to other government-owned companies waiting to go public. Bank debt at JR East, the rail group about to be privatised, is more than 16 per cent of total assets: at JT the ratio is under 1 per cent. The company's operations and decisions on pricing are less regulated than at JR East and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the semi-state owned telecom company. Japan's cigarette market is very mature. Mr Shigeru Mizuno, JT president, says: 'In terms of volume, the industry is declining.' Industry sales for the 12 months ended March 1992 fell 0.5 per cent to 272.6bn cigarettes. JT also faces growing competition from foreign tobacco companies, notably Philip Morris of the US which now hold 17 per cent of the market. Analysts predict that foreign companies will hold over 20 per cent of the market within the next few years. The company's competitiveness is clearly hampered by regulations over the amount of home grown raw tobacco it has to buy in. In general, Japanese tobacco costs between and three times more than foreign grown tobacco. Japanese tobacco makes up around 50 per cent of JT's tobacco purchases. JT is now looking to diversify. Mr Mizuno envisages growth in new business sectors such as foods, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and cigarette exports. The company entered the non-alcoholic beverage and pharmaceuticals market in 1988, and started a hot-dog chain in 1989. Its lily bulb business and an electric power switch manufacturing operation are among its more recent ventures. Exports account for less than 1 per cent of JT's total sales. It is targeting Asian cigarette markets, which unlike western markets, are still growing. Some 60 per cent of JT's overseas sales are in Asia. Analysts feel that some of the new projects will be slow to contribute to JT's profits. Mr Eizo Uchikura, of Nomura Research Institute, says property could make a near term contribution but JT's drug operations are unlikely to make a return before the end of the decade.

Speaking at the organization's annual meeting, its president  He Luli said that during the past two years the association has  helped conduct economic and trade activities in various forms  and through different channels, thus greatly promoting economic  and trade co-operation between Beijing and the rest of the world.    The association, currently composed of 20 members of the  city's industrial, commercial, trade and service companies, aims  to tighten economic and trade connections between the members  and their overseas counterparts.    It also has 12 overseas advisers in Hong Kong, the United  States, Britain, Thailand, the Netherlands, and other countries  and regions.    During the past two years the association has received over  2,300 overseas economic, scientific, technical and financial  personnel as well as 26 economic and trade inspection teams.  The visits have helped conclude agreements on joint-venture  projects involving hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars, the  president said.    At a 1992 exchange fair sponsored by the association more  than 130 overseas Chinese entrepreneurs from 15 countries and  regions, including the U.S., Japan, Britain, Indonesia and Hong  Kong and Macao, signed more than 130 contracts, agreements and  letters of intent with Beijing's large and medium state-owned  enterprises, involving direct overseas investment of over 35  million U.S dollars.    The association, exploiting its vast network of connections  overseas, has so far helped more than 80 enterprises in the city  build up ties with their counterparts abroad.    It also invites overseas experts and scholars to chair  seminars and give lectures on quality management and commercial  law for the city's economic and trade professionals.    He Luli held that such exchanges have helped push Chinese  companies and products onto the world market and improved their  competitiveness.    The president said that this year the association is going  to  invite more overseas advisers and renowned personages to Beijing  for business exchanges and trade talks. Meanwhile, it will  designate team members to carry out business activities in  Europe, Southeast Asia and other parts of the world.     "

Pure Magnesium        The products covered by these investigations are imports of pure primary magnesium regardless of chemistry, form or size, unless expressly excluded from the scope of these investigations. Primary magnesium is a metal or alloy containing by weight primarily the element magnesium and produced by decomposing raw materials into magnesium metal.    Pure primary magnesium encompasses all products that contain at least 99.95% primary magnesium, by weight (generally referred to as ``ultra-pure'' magnesium), as well as products containing less than 99.95% but not less than 99.8% primary magnesium, by weight (generally referred to as ``pure'' magnesium). Products that have the aforementioned primary magnesium content, but that do not conform to ASTM Specifications or other industry or customer-specific specifications, are included in the scope of these investigations.    Pure primary magnesium is cast and sold in various physical forms and sizes, including ingots, slabs, rounds, billets and other shapes.    Excluded from the scope of these investigations are primary magnesium anodes, granular primary magnesium (including turnings and powder), and secondary magnesium.    Granular magnesium, turnings, and powder are classifiable under     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States     (HTSUS) subheading 8104.30.00. Magnesium granules and turnings (also referred to as chips) are produced by grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and thus have the same chemistry as primary magnesium. Although not susceptible to precise measurement because of their irregular shapes, turnings or chips are typically produced in course shapes and have maximum length of less than 1 inch. Although sometimes produced in larger sizes, granules are more regularly shaped than turnings or chips, and have a typical size of 2mm in diameter or smaller.    Powders are also produced from grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and have the same chemistry as primary magnesium, but are even smaller than granules or turnings. Powders are defined by the Section Notes to Section XV, the section of the HTSUS in which subheading 8104.30.00 appears, as products of which 90 percent or more by weight will pass through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1mm. (See HTSUS, Section XV, Base Metals and Articles of Base Metals, Note 6(b).) Accordingly, the exclusion of magnesium turnings, granules and powder from the scope include products having a maximum physical dimension (    i.e.    , length or diameter) of 1 inch or less.    The products subject to these investigations are classifiable under subheadings 8104.11.00 and 8104.20.00 of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope is dispositive.        B. Alloy Magnesium        The products covered by these investigations are imports of alloy primary magnesium regardless of chemistry, form or size, unless expressly excluded from the scope of these investigations. Primary magnesium is a metal or alloy containing by weight primarily the element magnesium and produced by decomposing raw materials into magnesium metal.    These investigations cover alloy primary magnesium products which contain 50% or greater, but less than 99.8%, primary magnesium, by weight. Products with the aforementioned primary magnesium content that do not conform to ASTM Specifications or other industry or customer-specific specifications are included in the scope of this investigation. In addition to primary magnesium, ``alloy'' magnesium generally contains one or more of the following items in amounts less than the primary magnesium itself: (1) Other elements deliberately added to the primary magnesium; (2) magnesium scrap or secondary magnesium; (3) oxidized magnesium; and (4) other elements present as impurities.

0,FT944-9681 ,"FT944-9681 _AN-EKOENAA6FT 941115   FT  15 NOV 94 / Brokers fight for private savings      By EMIKO TERAZONO      TOKYO   Branch managers at Nikko Securities, a leading Japanese broker, have been scrambling to gather their ideas together ahead of the stock market seminars for individual investors held today. Over the next few weeks, the brokers are expected to pursue a fierce media campaign against the commercial banks in bidding for the ordinary salaryman's seasonal bonus. But many officials of the broker's 126 retail branches are uncertain how much interest they can muster among their individual clients in time to get them to invest their winter bonus payments, to be distributed next month, in shares. With the Nikkei index down 3.6 per cent since the start of the month, and many traders nervous over the benchmark's possible fall below the 19,000 psychological support level, some Nikko managers do not expect high participation. What worries the officials, and the Tokyo financial community, is that while overseas, corporate and large institutional investors have been cautiously investing in the stock market over the past few years, retail investors, who have shunned shares since the market started its decline in 1990, have shown no signs of returning. Participation in daily stock market trading has declined steadily, with last month's activity by private individual investors totalling 14.4 per cent of total market turnover, a sharp fall from 43 per cent 10 years ago. Many retail investors are still licking their wounds from the post 'bubble' era plunge in share prices, with the bulk of them sitting on unrealised losses. The problem has been exacerbated by disastrous privatisations of state owned enterprises. The government and brokers had hoped that flotation of such companies as East Japan Railway, part of the former Japan National Railways, and Japan Tobacco, the tobacco and salt monopoly, would lure private investors back. Instead, the Nikkei plunged 20 per cent in a month subsequent to JR East's listing in October last year, while Japan Tobacco has fallen 33 per cent from its public offering price. Mr Jason James, strategist at brokers James Capel in Tokyo, says a gradual rise in interest rates has damaged the case for a boom in retail stock investment seen in the US and the UK over past few years. While low interest rates prompted US and UK retail investments into equities, in Japan, the rise in bank deposit rates has kept individual investors from the equity market. So how will the brokers try and entice retail clients to invest their hard earned cash? Many hope that by steering clear of the stocks, they can appeal to their clients. 'We're offering them deposit type investments,' says one Nikko branch manager. 'We have to convince people that we also offer safe and profitable products,' he says.

0,FT942-16802 ,"FT942-16802 _AN-EDHDEACAFT 940408   FT  08 APR 94 / Sales of AZT fail to meet great expectations      By DANIEL GREEN   Seven years ago AZT was launched into a world alarmed at the prospect of an Aids plague. Sales forecasts - not from Wellcome which developed the drug - ranged up to Dollars 2.5bn a year. But in the first six months of Wellcome's current financial year, AZT brought in just Pounds 110m. In the world league table of best-selling drugs, it is about 70th. The main cause of the drug's mediocre performance is that it is not prescribed to people infected with HIV who do not have Aids. Although figures are difficult to confirm, it is widely accepted that fewer than 10 per cent of people with HIV are suffering from the disease at any one time, though almost all will eventually contract it. Asymptomatics - patients without symptoms - are regarded as a more lucrative market for the simple, if unpalatable, reason that they live longer. The Concorde study published today confirms that such patients have little if anything to gain from taking AZT. It will not, therefore, be the 'blockbuster' Wellcome must have once hoped for. Although the preliminary report of the trials, published a year ago, were attacked by Wellcome, the company took a more emollient line yesterday. Mr Trevor Jones, director of research and development, argued that the final version of the report was essentially positive because it said there was some transient benefit for asymptomatics. This, he said, allowed the choice to use the drug to be made according to individual cases. Mr John Robb, chairman and chief executive, insisted that the fortunes of AZT were vital for the company. 'It is our second biggest-selling product and is very important for the company,' he said. He said the company's strategy would remain unchanged: to pursue combination therapy - the use of the drug in combination with others. The company has just signed a deal with Glaxo, the UK's biggest drugs company, that gives it the option to use an experimental drug called 3TC that seems to work well with AZT in laboratory tests. The trials results nevertheless come at an awkward time for the company. Last month its shares fell 8 per cent after it reported slower than expected first-half sales growth and revealed that it was dropping development of a new anti-herpes compound. The company also announced plans to cut its UK staff of 5,400 by about 350 during the next 12 months, with further cuts to come in the US. City analysts remain unconvinced both about the ultimate importance of the drug and its growth prospects. 'Sales of this drug have stopped growing because of Concorde,' said Mr Paul Krikler, analyst at securities house Goldman Sachs. They say AZT is significant to Wellcome but argue that it is not central to the company's fortunes. Another drug, the herpes treatment Zovirax, has first-half sales of sales of Pounds 418m, up from Pounds 369m a year earlier. Zovirax is in the world's top 20 drugs and has sales of more than Dollars 1bn a year. AZT, in contrast, has gone into a decline, said Mr Stewart Adkins of Lehman Brothers. He forecasts current-year sales of it to fall to Pounds 218m from last year's figure of Pounds 248m.   Companies:-  Wellcome.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Robert Clarke, chairman, said the results, were 'highly creditable' in difficult economic conditions. He forecast satisfactory profits and earnings this year although there was no sign of an upturn in the group's main markets. The results, above market expectations, compared with Pounds 195.1m last time. Sales advanced to Pounds 2.98bn against Pounds 2.72bn. The fastest growth was in the McVitie's division's continental operations, where acquisitions contributed to operating profit of Pounds 14.6m, up from Pounds 5.2m, on sales of Pounds 217.9m (Pounds 103.9m). KP Snacks' continental business also did well, increasing profit to Pounds 6.6m from Pounds 5.4m on sales of Pounds 140.4m (Pounds 99.1m). In the US, where product launches helped Keebler lift its market share, trading profit rose to Pounds 65.6m from Pounds 54.7m. Sales were Pounds 983m compared with Pounds 900.8m. A change in Keebler's accounting policy to reflect the cost of US post-retirement healthcare benefits reduced United Biscuit's pre-tax profits by Pounds 3.1m. The previous year's figures have been re-stated to reflect the change. In the UK, results were depressed by sluggish demand and trading down by consumers. McVitie's lost volume market share but increased profit to Pounds 92.1m against Pounds 85.6m on sales of Pounds 586m up from Pounds 548.6m, while KP's profit rose to Pounds 36.9m from Pounds 36.1m on sales of Pounds 363.9m (against Pounds 343.2m). Terry's was hit by a fall in demand for boxed chocolates, and profit edged up to Pounds 14.3m from Pounds 14m on sales of Pounds 143.4m against Pounds 138.9m. Profits of Ross Young's frozen foods operation fell to Pounds 27.5m (against Pounds 30.1m) on lower sales of Pounds 542.9m, down from Pounds 564.4m. United Biscuits said rationalisation had given Ross Young's a competitive cost base. Acquisitions overseas and the UK recession meant only 53 per cent of the group's sales and 64 per cent of profit were generated in Britain last year, the lowest in its history. Earnings rose 9 per cent to 29.5p per share on a fully diluted basis compared with 27.1p a year ago. Undiluted earnings were 30.8p (28.9p).

The report warned that a bigger diesel-car population could lead to a worsening of emissions of nitrogen oxides (Nox) and particles containing carcinogens - claims rejected by the industry. A similar report in Germany in the late 1980s brought diesel car growth to a halt, although it is now recovering. While the industry claims that it has no reason to favour either form of vehicle, it fears confusion among motorists about the merits or hazards of diesel cars may lead to deferred purchasing decisions, slowing the new-car market's recovery from recession. Diesels have been the single-biggest growth sector as motorists have been attracted by the 25 per cent to 30 per cent better fuel economy compared with petrol equivalents. This is particularly so now that purchase-price premiums demanded for diesels are reducing sharply. Growth has also been encouraged by a widespread view that diesels are more environmentally friendly than petrol engines, partly because they produce substantially less carbon dioxide than petrol cars, thus helping to combat global warming. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Retail Motor Industry Federation and leading component makers all argue that the report - which they complain was compiled without consulting industry sources - ignored several factors. These include developments in engine technology, specific advantages of diesel engines during short, urban journeys, and the greater consistency of diesel emissions over the life of a vehicle compared with the breakdown in efficiency of petrol engines. According to Mr John Mardell, chief engineer at Lucas Diesel Systems, although Nox emissions initially are higher than with a petrol car, the emissions even from a catalyst-equipped petrol car worsen steadily over the vehicle's life so that the total balances out. On short journeys, pollutant emissions from a petrol car can be 16 times higher than with a diesel, Mr Mardell says. Mr Ernie Thompson, SMMT chief executive, says that 85 per cent of vehicle pollution is attributable to elderly or poorly maintained vehicles. Diesel Vehicle Emissions and Urban Air Quality.

Runzheimer also included all applicable sales, property and excise taxes to items that were part of other living-cost components. For example, automobile purchase costs in Puerto Rico include an excise tax based upon vehicle type and dealer's acquisition cost. Runzheimer included this tax in computing the total purchase price of a vehicle in Puerto Rico. (See sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.7.)    Runzheimer gathered applicable information on taxes by contacting appropriate sources of information in the allowance areas, such as the Excise Tax Officer of the St. Thomas Bureau of Internal Revenue.

As it applies to Goods  Services, the approach involved comparing the average prices of marketbasket items in each allowance area with those in the Washington, D.C., area. The resulting price ratios were aggregated into subcategory and then category indexes using the expenditure weightings derived from the 1988 CES.    In the area of professional services (accounting and legal fees), Runzheimer and OPM noted the existence of a relatively few extreme values that were either exceptionally low or high cost. In situations such as this, statisticians frequently use the median or trim the data in some manner to enhance reliability. Consequently, Runzheimer recommended that the observations be ranked from low to high and that the top and bottom 20% of the observations be ``trimmed'' (i.e., eliminated) from the data before averages or trends were calculated.

The results were at the low end of expectations and the group's shares fell 7p to 746p. Sales increased 21 per cent from Pounds 3.39bn to Pounds 4.09bn, while trading profits increased 17 per cent from Pounds 1.104bn to Pounds 1.29bn. However, Mr Ernest Mario, deputy chairman, admitted both figures had benefited from currency changes. The US dollar had been Dollars 1.76 on average during 1992 compared with Dollars 1.86 in 1991. At constant exchange rates, the increases would have been 18 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. Volume growth, excluding price increases and exchange rates, grew 16 per cent. Sales in all four of Glaxo's established therapeutic areas - anti-ulcerants, respiratory, antibiotics and dermatological medicines - showed healthy increases, said Sir Paul Girolami, chairman. Margins fell from 32.4 per cent to 31.4 per cent as the company increased its investment programmes. Sir Paul said the company had invested Pounds 595m on operating expenses for research and development during the year. A further Pounds 300m had been spent on capital projects related to RD. The group has set up an RD centre in Japan. Sir Paul said such investment was the key to the future. During 1993, the group would spend Pounds 700m on capital investments, of which 35 per cent would be on RD projects and 45 per cent on manufacturing. Between 1993 and 1997, the group would spend about Pounds 2.5bn on capital projects. Additional marketing costs had also squeezed margins. The company has added 500 representatives to its US salesforce. Mr Stewart Adkins, pharmaceuticals analyst at Lehman Brothers, said higher than expected research and development and capital expenditure would reduce interest receivable in the future. In 1992 it fell 22 per cent from Pounds 179m to Pounds 140m. Mr Mario refused to be drawn on when Serevent, an asthma drug, and Imigran, a migraine treatment, would be licensed in the US, Japan and Germany, and on negotiations with the French on Imigran. Earnings per share rose 13 per cent from 30.4p to 34.3p. Earnings per ADR increased only 7 per cent from Dollars 1.13 to Dollars 1.21 because of currency changes. The board proposed a dividend of 17p for the year, an increase of 21 per cent. Lex, Page 18; Details, Page 21; Market report, Page 38  The Financial Times   London Page 19  "

Only hours after the incident, three journalists working for Italian state television were killed in fighting in the south-western Bosnian town of Mostar, which is under siege by Bosnian Croat irregular troops. The Italian Foreign Ministry said the three - a reporter, a cameraman and a sound technician for the state broadcasting organisation RAI - were killed during a mortar attack in the Moslem-held eastern part of the town. The British aid workers, employees of the Overseas Development Administration, were abducted in Moslem-controlled Zenica by a group of uniformed men with assault rifles, according to Ms Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 'The way it was described to us in the first report (by the two survivors) was that it was a gang, an armed gang,' she said. 'I don't think this is the policy of any government to do something like this.' After being seized in their Range Rover outside the European Union's relief warehouse in Zenica, the Britons were driven out of town and ordered out of their vehicle. The 'bandits' beat them and robbed them. One of the Britons, Mr Paul Goodall, was shot dead immediately while the other two ran away towards a river. Both of them were shot and wounded, but managed to escape. Mr Goodall was the 11th aid worker to be killed in the former Yugoslavia. The UNHCR is also considering whether to suspend its aid operations in the area, as it did for a month after an aid convoy driver was shot dead in October, according to the organisation's spokesman in Sarajevo, Mr Ron Redmond. 'What we have now is people attacking their own military as well as our own (UN) people. We're extremely concerned about that, and obviously if this kind of thing continues, we are not going to be able to operate,' Mr Redmond said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The chancellor and Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, had stressed the need for strict policies at a meeting with industrialists in Mr Kohl's office because they were important for the confidence of commercial and financial markets, a government spokesman said. Meanwhile, the DAX Frankfurt stock exchange index shed more than 2 per cent following a report of a sharp downturn in business expectations for the next six months. The Ifo economics institute in Munich said expectations across a wide range of companies taking part in its monthly survey had 'considerably worsened' following a marked fall in new orders last month. Many were planning to reduce production because cuts so far had failed to reduce inventories. The car industry is expected to be particularly hard hit. An industry trade group said orders this year would be a quarter to a third lower than 1991. Mr Achim Diekmann, director of the German Automobile Association, the industry's main trade group, said employment in the industry, including suppliers to the vehicle manufacturers, would fall by 100,000-200,000 from the total 1.7m employed in the sector. Mr Diekmann also said order backlogs for German car manufacturers to August this year had fallen 'by half' compared with the same period last year. Business conditions in the east have also deteriorated. Order intake among manufacturers fell 20 per cent in July, according to the economics ministry. Overseas demand fell by more than half. The collapse which followed a 20 per cent rise in June reflects highly volatile trends which have marked the progress of the east German economy since the virtual disappearance of buyers from former markets in the ex-Soviet Union and elsewhere in eastern Europe.

0,FT932-4493 ,"FT932-4493 _AN-DFICHACFFT 930609   FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Aid body set to lose funds      By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor   THE GOVERNMENT is to end its aid funding for the Commonwealth Development Corporation, Britain's main agency for channelling aid to the private sector in the developing world. In figures about to be released under the Foreign Office's cash plans for next year, the current CDC funding of Pounds 49m will disappear next year. In part compensation, the CDC will not pay interest on outstanding loans. The total Overseas Development Administration budget is set to rise by 4 per cent from Pounds 2.27bn to Pounds 2.31bn, with the only significant increases being rises from Pounds 202m to Pounds 272m in funding for the European Development Fund, and from Pounds 131m to Pounds 187m in EC funding for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The CDC is the main casualty of a 35 per cent increase in funding for European Community aid efforts - a shift that has occurred in spite of criticisms by ministers and members of parliament about inefficiencies in the way aid from the EDF is disbursed. That shift will raise the EC share of Britain's gross aid budget from less than 15 per cent this year to 20 per cent in 1994. The decision will cut the projects it supports from more than 300 last year, to about 200 in 1994, the CDC says. The cut comes in spite of a recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report, which commended the CDC as providing 'a highly effective form of aid' that 'fits well with the trend of international thinking on development assistance.' The decision will 'take the growth out of the CDC, and make us sweat a bit more', Mr John Eccles, CDC chief executive, said yesterday. He emphasised that net funding averaging Pounds 20m a year over the past five years had enabled the CDC to disburse more than Pounds 150m. He said that the shift towards aid funding from Brussels would force the CDC to look more in the future to the EC for support.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.
